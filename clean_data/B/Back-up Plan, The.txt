THE BACK-UP PLAN: Written by Kate Angelo
ZOE (V.O.): I can't believe I didn't get a pedicure for this. How embarrassing. Look at that...
ZOE (V.O.)(CONT'D): What's wrong with me? If I were with a real guy doing this, I would've gotten a pedicure. And a wax. I'm pathetic.
ZOE (V.O.) (CONT'D): Fuck, that one's even worse. And when did my toes get so fat? No wonder I'm alone. I'm a fat-toed animal.
ZOE (CONT'D): Sorry I didn't get a pedicure.
DR. HARRIS: What?
ZOE: My toes...sorry.
DR. HARRIS: I'm not looking at your toes.
ZOE: Right.   Duh.
DR. HARRIS: All done.
ZOE: That's it?
DR. HARRIS: I'll elevate your legs for ten minutes and then you're good to go.
ZOE: This is the first time I've heard that ticking clock sound and it doesn't freak me out.
DR. HARRIS: Good.   Just relax.
ZOE: I can't, I'm totally freaking out.
DR. HARRIS: Everything's going to be great. I have a feeling you and... (checks empty syringe) Number CRM-101404 are going to make beautiful babies together.
BOBBY (V.O.): Number CRM-101404? Are you high?
BOBBY: Says here he has red hair and freckles.
ZOE: And glasses, too.
BOBBY: And why are we picking him?
ZOE: Because he's honest.
BOBBY: He's ugly.
ZOE: You think they're all telling the truth? If they're so smart and good looking, why are they beating off into a cup?
BOBBY: Have you ever fucked a guy with red hair and freckles?
ZOE: No, and I won't have to.
BOBBY: But what about your kid? No one's going to want to fuck your kid. (beat) That came out wrong.
ZOE: Yeah...it's a good thing you're not going to be the father.
BOBBY: What?    I can't be the father!
ZOE: Come on, we don't have to have sex.
BOBBY: Oh, Jesus, I didn't even think about that. Rewind, rewind, rewind...
ZOE: You're one of my best friends. Don't you want to help me?
BOBBY: Yeah, but...that's too much. I'll walk your dog, tell you when you look fat, be honest about your eyebrows...
ZOE: Just a few sperm. Big deal. You waste billions of them every night.
BOBBY: You know I flee at the slightest chance of intimacy. Do you see these bags under my eyes? Ricardo slept over last night, and he wanted to hold me. I actually had to fake a seizure.
ZOE: Forget it.     Forget the whole thing.
MONA (V.O.): Forget the whole thing.    It's just a phase...
MONA: You don't want kids.    Trust me.
ZOE: Easy for you to say.    You have four.
MONA: Yeah, and it's awful.
MONA (CONT'D): They've ruined my life.
ZOE: Come on...
MONA: Have you seen my vagina?
MONA (CONT'D): Do you want to?
MONA (CONT'D): I would do that for you. To prove to you that you don't want to have kids, I will show you my vagina.
ZOE: I don't want to see your vagina.    I want a baby. My own baby.
MONA: Is it possible you're just a little lonely? You know, you haven't met the right guy and--
ZOE: It's not about a guy. I don't need a guy. I don't even think I want a guy at this point. I've dated a hundred guys in the last five years, and not one of them is even close to being the one. How long am I supposed to wait?
MONA: You never know. He could be right around the corner.
ZOE: Well, then he's late. And I hate people who are late. And what if he's not right around the corner? What if he's miles away?
ZOE (CONT'D): I want to have a baby. And time is running out. I hear a clock ticking every time I close my eyes. I need it to stop.
ZOE: Ding.
ZOE (CONT'D): How the fuck am I supposed to get down from here?
DR. HARRIS: You don't have to walk like that.
ZOE: Oh.   Okay.
ZOE (CONT'D): Should we hug? We might have just made a baby together.
ZOE: Hi.
PREGNANT WOMEN: Hi.
ZOE: Hi.
WOMAN: Hi.
WOMAN (CONT'D): You're starting to freak me out.
ZOE: Sorry.
WOMAN: Stop it.
ZOE: Hi!
ZOE (CONT'D): Taxi!
ZOE: Hallelujah!
ZOE (CONT'D): Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.
STAN: You own it?
ZOE: No, but I'm about to rent it.
STAN: Actually, if we're being technical, you kind of stole it.
ZOE: I don't think so.
STAN: If you see someone about to get in a cab, you can't just run in from the other side and say it's yours.
ZOE: I didn't see you.
STAN: I saw you see me.
ZOE: (to the cabbie) Sir, who saw you first?
STAN: Maybe you're not from around here, but there's a code. It's like war, even though it's brutal and bloody, there are still certain rules we--
ZOE: Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out.
ZOE (CONT'D): But not because you're right, but because I am in a terrific mood, and you are ruining it.
STAN: No.   I'll get out.
ZOE: Now what?
STAN: I don't know. You tell me.
ZOE: What? Where's he going?! (waving her hands, then) Come back!
ZOE (CONT'D): Well, that was stupid. Why'd you get out, you, stupid-head?
STAN: You said you were in a great mood and I was ruining it. I felt bad. (then) Did you just call me stupid-head?
ZOE: Oh, man...
STAN: How's your great mood now?
STAN: How `bout now?
ZOE: Please stop talking to me.
STAN: So, why are you in such a good mood anyway?
ZOE: Not that it's any of your business, but...good things are happening to me.
STAN: That's nice. I hope it continues.
ZOE: Thanks. Well, have a nice life. Try not to steal any more cabs.
STAN: You do the same.
ZOE: Hey, Nutsy. How's it going?
BOBBY: Oh, my God, you're glowing. (to Jalisa) She's glowing, right?
JALISA: Glowing.   Tell us everything.
BOBBY: Everything.
ZOE: There's not much to tell.
BOBBY: You just got shot up with a wad of red-headed-freckle sperm. There's something to tell.
JALISA: He had red hair and freckles?
BOBBY: I tried to talk her out of it.
JALISA: Why'd you do that, Mami?
BOBBY: (to Jalisa) I know, right?
JALISA: Red pubes.     Eek...
ZOE: I'm never going to see his pubes!
BOBBY: You'll see your kid's pubes.
ZOE: I doubt it.
BOBBY: But you'll know they're there.
ZOE: What is wrong with you?
JALISA: So, what happened?    Come on...
ZOE: I lay down, put my feet up, five minutes later it was over. I barely felt a thing.
BOBBY: Sounds like Ricardo.
JALISA: Tell me about it, Papi.
BOBBY: So...what happens now?
ZOE: Now, we wait.
BOBBY: That's no fun, I want to know if I'm going to be a fairy godmother.
ZOE: We'll just have to wait and see.
BOBBY: Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can have an O'Dhouls or something.
JALISA: We'll go to the piano bar and get Bobby to sing some Ace of Base.
BOBBY: Forget it, she's not coming. I can tell by the dull look on her face.
ZOE: Love you.
BOBBY/JALISA: I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign...
STAN: Hi.
ZOE: Aahhh!
ZOE (CONT'D): You scared the hell out of me!
STAN: Oh, wow.   Is he...okay?
ZOE: What are you doing here?
STAN: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Or hurt your dog. Don't worry, I'm not a stalker.
ZOE: How'd you know I worked here?
STAN: I followed you after the subway. (thinks, then) That sounds a little stalkery, huh?
ZOE: Yeah.
STAN: I just really wanted to see you again. Almost like I had to see you again. Can I walk you home? (then) Is it me or does everything I say make me sound more like a stalker?
STAN (CONT'D): Can I just give you my card? Here. Take my card. I'm not a freak. Really. I sell cheese.
ZOE: Cheese?
STAN: Yeah. My family has a goat farm. We make cheese. You like cheese?
ZOE: I guess. I've never really thought about it.
STAN: Little Goat. Maybe you've seen us at the Farmer's market? Come by sometime and you can taste my cheese. (then) Okay, I'm going to go. This has not gone as planned.
ZOE: Bye.
CAROL: Everyone, please say hello to Zoe.
EVERYONE: Hi, Zoe.
CAROL: Welcome to Single Mother's By Choice. As the name suggests, we are all single mothers by choice. Some of us have adopted, some conceived with a donor, every story is different, but with the same common denominator. We wanted to have a child, and we didn't need a partner to make it happen.
LORI: Are you a doer or a tryer?
ZOE: Excuse me?
LORI: Are you already a single mother or are you trying to become one?
ZOE: Oh, I guess I'm trying. I was just inseminated a few days ago. (then) Inseminated...makes me feel like a cow or something.
CAROL: Well, when we don't have partners with penises, we do what we've got to do, right? (then) So, tell us a little bit about yourself.
ZOE: Okay. Let's see...um, I own a pet store on Hudson Street. Dogs, cats, rabbits...no birds, they creep me out. Before that, I worked for Google, which I completely hated. One day, I decided life was too short, and, against my accountant's advice, I quit Google, cashed out and bought the pet store. Now I'm really happy on the work front, but I still haven't found, you know, the one.
CAROL: Ah, yes.   The elusive "one."
ZOE: I always imagined I'd be married with kids by now, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen that way. So, time for Plan B.
CAROL: Society tells us we're supposed to find that special person to make us happy and complete. But guess what...you have to create your own happiness. You don't need someone to complete you, some...man. You already are complete.
LORI: Amen, sister.
CAROL: If you want to have a baby, we here at Single Mothers By Choice can be your partners. We will be your emotional rocks.
CAROL (CONT'D): From inception to college graduation and everything in between. We're here for each other.
SARA: Dakota was actually born right here in this very room. Right where you're sitting, actually.
ZOE: (uncomfortable) Really? Right here?      Imagine that.
SARA: Best day of my life.
ZOE: And how old is she now?
DAKOTA: I'm three.
MONA: Why did you join a support group of unattractive, militant lesbians when you have me?
ZOE: Because you're really not that supportive.
MONA: Sure I am.
ZOE: You just told me that if I breast- feed "my girls" will end up looking like empty tube socks.
MONA: I'm just being honest. And don't even get me started on what childbirth does to your bladder.
ZOE: What does it do to your bladder?
MONA: I just peed a little bit.
ZOE: I don't think I'm pregnant. The doctor says it will probably take several tries. Something about frozen sperm being lazy.
MONA: Good.   Take your time.
ZOE: So, should I call this guy?   Do you think that would be weird?
MONA: Do I think it's weird that you're pursuing someone at the exact moment in time that you might be most unavailable? No. Because that's what you do. You sabotage.
ZOE: (ignoring her) He works at the Farmer's market. And it's right around the corner. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
MONA: I look fat and old?
ZOE: No.
MONA: Then, no.
ZOE: Let's go spy on him. Come on. It will be fun. Like high school.
MONA: I can't. (checks watch) This twenty minute breakfast concludes my "me" time for the week. More proof that you should not have kids.
ZOE: Oh, well.
OLIVIA: Can I help you?
ZOE: (distracted) No, I'm fine.
OLIVIA: Tasty, huh?
OLIVIA (CONT'D): All ripe and juicy. And firm, too. Bet you could just eat him up in one bite, right?
ZOE: What?
OLIVIA: And don't look now, but he's coming this way.
STAN: A-ha! I didn't scare you away after all.
ZOE: (trying to be casual) I was just in the neighborhood. I thought I'd come by and get some blueberries. I'm going to make a pie.
STAN: I love blueberry pie.
ZOE: I'm confused. I thought you made cheese or something.
STAN: What makes you think I don't?
ZOE: I don't know, you're over there playing the banjo.
STAN: Can't someone do both?
ZOE: Honestly, I didn't know anyone did either.
OLIVIA: Aren't you going to introduce me to your new friend?
STAN: Nope. (to Zoe) Come on. Let me show you around.
STAN: This is our basic chevre, probably our best seller. The cheese that started it all, as they say. Then over here we have our surface- ripened cheeses. These are the aged/raw milk cheeses. (realizing) This is really boring, huh?
ZOE: No, not at all.
STAN: It's like you're in a foreign country and the only thing to watch on tv is a documentary on cheese. You don't want to watch it, but somehow you can't stop...
ZOE: (laughing) I think it's interesting.    Really.
STAN: All right, you asked for it... (boring voice) The aged/raw milk cheeses are made from raw milk and then aged for four to six months. Sometimes more. Sometimes less. Usually more. Depends on the cheese.
FRED: Stop.   You're killing me.
STAN: Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred. (then) She's the one I followed from the subway the other day like a total psychopath.
FRED: Right...I heard about you.
ZOE: I don't know whether to be flattered or terrified.
FRED: Be afraid.
STAN: Don't scare her away.   I'm trying to redeem myself.
FRED: Then you should put down the banjo. You look like a doofus.
STAN: Doofus? (then, to Zoe) Do you think I look like a doofus?
ZOE: I don't really know what a doofus looks like.
STAN: Okay. If I put the banjo down, can I take you to lunch or something?
ZOE: I should really get back to work.
STAN: Come on, say the word and we can have a six-course tasting menu at Union Square Cafe. I know the chef.
ZOE: That sounds nice, but, I should probably go.
STAN: Well, can I call you?
BOBBY (CONT'D): He'll be there with bells on. (then) He didn't say the "bells on" part. I added that. Sounds a little too gay, though, so I take it back.
STAN: We could have gone anywhere.
ZOE: Just take a bite.   You'll see.
STAN: Per Se, Jean Georges, Nobu...
ZOE: Gray's Papaya.   Cheers.
ZOE (CONT'D): Good, right?
ZOE (CONT'D): You've lived here your whole life and never been to Gray's Papaya. What's wrong with you?
STAN: I actually haven't lived here my whole life. We moved out of the city when my parents bought the farm....not died, but actually bought a farm and moved upstate.
ZOE: That must have been a nice place to grow up. On a farm.
STAN: What about your family?
ZOE: It's just me and my grandmother. She lives in a retirement community in Queens. (an awkward beat) My parents died when I was young.
STAN: I'm so sorry.
STAN (CONT'D): I don't know what to say now.    I've made it all awkward and sad.
ZOE: It's okay. (then) My dad was kind of a bad guy, anyway.
STAN: Shit.   I'm so sorry, Zoe.
ZOE: No, come on, we'll get all this stuff out of the way so we never have to talk about it again. Let's ask all the awkward, get-to-know- you questions right now.
STAN: Okay.   Good idea.
ZOE: Let's see...are you religious?
STAN: Nope.   What about you?
ZOE: No.
STAN: Have you ever been married?
ZOE: No.
STAN: Aren't you sick of going to weddings?
ZOE: If I have to listen to one more couple write their own vows...
STAN: I hate when they write their own vows!
STAN (CONT'D): What about kids?
ZOE: What about them?
STAN: Well, do you want them?
ZOE: Yeah.   I want kids.
ZOE (CONT'D): Do you?
STAN: Yeah.   Absolutely.
ZOE: Okay, first kiss...
STAN: Jen Salzer. Seventh grade. She wore a head-gear. What about you?
ZOE: Summer camp. I think his name was--
ZOE (CONT'D): That was way better.
STAN: When can I see you again?
ZOE: What if I'm pregnant?
MONA: Then you'll get fat and hormonal and I'll say, "I told you so."
ZOE: But what if this could go somewhere with Stan? Like, really go somewhere.
MONA: Then it will work out perfectly.
ZOE: What do you mean?
MONA: Because just when you really like him, you'll break up because you're pregnant and then you never have to put yourself out there and possibly get hurt. That's your dream.
ZOE: (thinks, then) I'm not pregnant.
MONA: So, when are you seeing him again?
ZOE: Tonight.
MONA: Well, don't have sex with him. That's the last thing we need. You get knocked up and we'll have no idea who the father is.
MONA (CONT'D): And then we'll have to do a paternity test. Is it the cheese farmer or the red-pubed bandit?
ZOE: I'm not going to have sex with him tonight. It's too soon. (for the women's benefit) I'm not a slut.
MONA: Well, bring condoms, just in case. (thinks, then) And a pregnancy test.
ZOE: Very funny.
MONA: I'm not joking.
ZOE: I'm really not a slut.
ZOE: There's no way, right?
ZOE: Stop looking at me like that.   I'm not pregnant.
ZOE (CONT'D): Come on, come on, come on...
ZOE (CONT'D): Shit.
ZOE (CONT'D): Shit!
ZOE (CONT'D): Shitshitshitshit...
ZOE (CONT'D): No, shit.
ZOE (CONT'D): Holy fucking shit!
STAN: Are you feeling okay?
STAN (CONT'D): Good, because this should really be a culinary adventure. This is an underground restaurant that moves from apartment to apartment, depending on the chef.
STAN (CONT'D): And some of the guys from the band will be there. So, we might get a little jam going. Sounds fun, right? (then) Zoe?
STAN: And this looks like a mache salad with grapes and feta.
STAN (CONT'D): And this, oh this must be white beans and lamb's tongue. You've got to have some of this. Etienne is famous for his lamb's tongue.
OLIVIA: Hey, stranger.
STAN: Oh, hey, Olivia.   You remember Zoe.
OLIVIA: Right. How'd that blueberry pie turn out?
ZOE: What?
OLIVIA: You bought blueberries from me? Said you were going to make a pie?
ZOE: Um, can you excuse me for a second?
OLIVIA: No way she knows how to bake a pie.
ZOE: I'm pregnant.
BOBBY (O.S.): What?!   Where are you? I'm on my way.
ZOE: Brooklyn.
BOBBY (O.S.): Where's that?
MONA (O.S.): Don't panic. Could be a false positive. Take another test.
ZOE: I can't. I'm at some underground foodie party in Brooklyn. Where am I gonna--
BOBBY (O.S.): Okay, I'm looking at a subway map. Which way is Brooklyn?
STAN: Where have you been?
ZOE: Sorry.   You scared me.
STAN: Did you just go to the store?
ZOE: Yeah, I had a little emergency. I have a, a, um...corn, and I needed to get those little...corn pads.
STAN: Corn pads?
ZOE: I know, it's gross. Do you know where the bathroom is?
STAN: What's a corn pad?
ZOE: Corn pad?    What the hell is wrong with you?
ZOE (CONT'D): Corn pad.    Jesus Christ.
ZOE (CONT'D): Relax! I'll be out in... (checks box) Three to five minutes.
ZOE: Excuse me, are you allowed to drink when you're...
ZOE (CONT'D): You know...
PREGNANT WOMAN: Pregnant? (off Zoe's nod) My doctor says one glass is--
STAN: Who makes me forget all the other girls I met, sweet, little Miss Blue Eyes. Who's sweeter to me, than she really ought to be, sweet little Miss Blue Eyes.
STAN (CONT'D): Who's gonna start takin' care of my heart, she makes me realize. And it's lucky for me and I really want to be with... (winks at Zoe) sweet, little Miss--
STAN (CONT'D): Blue eyes?
ZOE: Ohhhhhhhh.
ZOE (CONT'D): Please, God...
ZOE (CONT'D): Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to...
ZOE (CONT'D): Fuck me.
STAN: My singing made you vomit.
ZOE: No.    It's not that.
STAN: Sure, we were a little out of tune, but...
ZOE: I really don't feel well.
STAN: Is it your corns?    Hurts to walk?
CAROL: Zoe?
ZOE: Wow.   Hi.    Hey, there...
CAROL: Where have you been?    You haven't been coming to any--
ZOE: (cutting her off) Right. I know. I've been so busy. Next one, I'm there. For sure. (then, awkward) This is my friend, Stan.
STAN: Hi.
CAROL: (eyeing Stan suspiciously) Hello. Are you two--
ZOE: Late. Yes. We are. We really are. (pushing Stan along) I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.
STAN: An old...boyfriend?
ZOE: Her name is Carol. We're on a...committee together.
ZOE (CONT'D): All right. I have to go to bed now. I'll call you, okay?
STAN: Okay. (then) Hey, I was thinking, if you don't have any plans this weekend, maybe you'd like to come up to the farm and get away for a few days.
ZOE: I'll call you tomorrow. Something's not agreeing with me.
STAN: Was it the lamb's tongue?
STAN (CONT'D): Okay, well...this weekend.   Think about it.
ZOE: What the hell have I done?
ANNIE: Hi, Zoe.   You look fantastic.
ZOE: I don't know how that's possible.
ANNIE: Something's different. Did you get highlights or a spray tan? Your face looks like it's...
ZOE: Please don't say glowing.
ANNIE: Yes!   Exactly!
ZOE: Morning, Arthur.
ARTHUR: Hello, my dear!
ZOE: No, no, no, don't get up.
ARTHUR: Good, because I can't get up. Came to see my lovely fiance? She's looking fine today, let me tell you. Fine.
ZOE: Hi, Nana.
NANA: One more mile to go. Do you have a minute? Talk to Arthur.
ARTHUR: That's what I'm talking about. Work it.
NANA: Do you want a nose guard?   I have an extra.
ZOE: No, I'm fine.
SHIRLEY: Are you sure? Ethel Silverbeck just had another carcinoma removed from her nose.
ZOE: (to Nana) I kind of need to talk to you. Alone.
NANA: Don't worry, they can't hear anything anyway.
ZOE: I'm pregnant.
NANA: (can't hear her) What?
ZOE: I'm pregnant.
NANA: What?
ZOE: I'm pregnant.
NANA: I can't hear you, darling.
SHIRLEY: Jesus, Judy, she's pregnant.   Turn your hearing aide up.
ZOE: What am I going to do?
NANA: I'm confused. Isn't this what you wanted? You bought sperm and were inseminated by your doctor. This isn't what we would call an accident.
ZOE: But now it's all happening so fast. Did I really think this through?
NANA: You might find out he's a total douchebag and then the whole thing is moot.
ZOE: Okay, so we'll just hope that he's a douchebag. Could happen, right?
ZOE (CONT'D): I'm sorry.     Am I keeping you up?
ZOE (CONT'D): My whole life is falling apart and you can't keep your bug-eyes open? (yawning) Thanks. Now I'm yawning. But why am I so tired? I slept nine hours. (thinks, then) And I'm starving, too. What the hell is going on?
ZOE: Am I even allowed to drink coffee?
ZOE (CONT'D): Do you know anything about being pregnant?
ZOE: Thanks a lot, decaf.
STAN (O.S.): Where are you?
ZOE: I have no idea.
ZOE: He's so not a douchebag.
ZOE: I can't believe you live here. This is ridiculous.
STAN: I just come on weekends. My parents really live here.
ZOE: Oh.   Where are they now?
STAN: In the kitchen.
ZOE: Wait, they're here? Now? Is this a "meet the parents" kind of thing? I wasn't prepared for this.
STAN: No. Not at all.    I mean, you'll meet them, but--
ZOE: When you said come up for the weekend, I assumed it was just us. (then) I think I need to lay down.
STAN: Are you hung-over or something?
ZOE: I'm just...not myself. Give me ten minutes. A ten-minute power nap and I'm good. I need to regroup.
STAN: Are you sure you're okay? (then) Zoe? Hello?
EDWARD: Oh.   It's just you.
STAN: She's taking a nap.
JOAN: A nap?   Now? She just got here.
STAN: Mom, I need you to not be judgemental, okay. I like this girl a lot.
JOAN: How can I be judgemental?    We haven't even met her yet.
JOAN (CONT'D): What the heck is that?
STAN: Oh.   This is Nuts.
JOAN: Who's judging?!
ZOE: What was that?
ZOE (CONT'D): Whoa.
ZOE: (whispering) Stan?
ZOE (CONT'D): Stan!
ZOE: Stan?    Hello?
ZOE (CONT'D): Oh, my God.
ZOE (CONT'D): (mouth full) Oh, my God.
ZOE (CONT'D): Oh, who am I kidding?
ZOE (CONT'D): Oh.   My.    God.
JOAN: Would you like a plate?
JOAN (CONT'D): A napkin?
JOAN (CONT'D): I'm Joan.
JOAN (CONT'D): And you must be Zoe.
EDWARD: The stew is delicious, honey.
STAN: Yeah, Mom, it's awesome.
EDWARD: (to Zoe) Have you ever in your life had stew like this? Come on, be honest.
ZOE: Uh...no.    Never.
JOAN: So are all the animals in your pet store...differently abled?
ZOE: Oh, you can say paralyzed. He doesn't mind. (then) No, our pets are all in great shape. Purebreads mostly, but not from puppy mills.
JOAN: Those puppy mills are terrible.    I read about them in the paper.
ZOE: Well, that's actually how I ended up with Nuts. I bought him from this pet store near my house. Six months later, I had thousands of dollars in vet bills and had to put him in a wheelchair.
EDWARD: You should have sued that place.
ZOE: I thought about it, but what was that really going to do? They were still going to sell inbred dogs. So...I took the money I made when I left Google and just bought the place figuring I would do better.
STAN: You worked for Google?
STAN (CONT'D): How could I not know that?
ZOE: You never asked.
STAN: And you made a lot of money and then bought a pet store?
STAN (CONT'D): I love that.
ZOE: It's been fun. Beats brand management, that's for sure.
JOAN: (to Edward) That sounds like us, honey.
EDWARD: It's true. (to Zoe) When we bought this farm we just wanted to make cheese because we couldn't find anything we liked in the stores. And now, twenty years later, here we are...
JOAN: Sometimes in life you just have to take matters into your own hands. Make things happen your own way, you know?
STAN: I can't believe that Nuts has an off-road wheelchair.
ZOE: He's got one for snow, too.      With little skis on the bottom.
ZOE (CONT'D): What?
STAN: You're really something.
ZOE: Are you making fun of me?   Do you think I spoil him?
STAN: No, I really think you're amazing. I mean, that story you told tonight. You just quit your whole professional life because of this little dog? Started your own business, just like that?
STAN (CONT'D): You're very...unique.
ZOE: Well, you're a dime a dozen. I can't tell you how many banjo playing, cheese makers I've been with.
STAN: I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like, how can you be so perfect? Why are you even still single? I can't believe no one's snatched you up by now.
ZOE: I drive them all away, I guess.
STAN: Yeah, right.
STAN (CONT'D): Look, I know this is all going fast...the time we're spending together, meeting my parents and everything...but, I'm okay with that. I want it to go fast.
ZOE: It is going fast.
STAN: But isn't that okay? Aren't we old enough to skip all the bullshit? What are we waiting for? I...want to be with you.
ZOE: Stan.
STAN: Come on. There's something I want to show you.
ZOE: What is it?
STAN: It's cheese.
ZOE: I can see that.
STAN: It's a new kind of goat's milk we're using. I've been developing the recipe, and now it needs to age. It'll be ready for market in several months. (then, excited) Want to know what it's called?
ZOE: Okay.
STAN: Zoe.
ZOE: You named a piece of cheese after me?
STAN: Not just one piece. The whole line. This will forever in history be known as the Zoe.
STAN (CONT'D): Unless, of course, it tastes like shit, and then we'll just scrap it. (with a wink) But that'll never happen.
ZOE: How do you know?
STAN: Because it's going to be fantastic. Sweet and sassy and very complex. Why do you think I'm calling it Zoe?
ZOE: No one's ever named a piece of cheese after me before.
STAN: You're kind of hard to read right now. You're either seriously flattered or totally repulsed.
STAN (CONT'D): What?
ZOE: I want to kiss you right now, but it really smells like cheese in here.
ZOE: (under her breath) You're such a douchebag.
STAN: What?
STAN: That was amazing. I mean, like, totally and exceptionally, over-the- top, amazing.
ZOE: Stan.
STAN: Yeah.
ZOE: There's something I really have to tell you.
STAN: There's something I have to tell you, too.
STAN (CONT'D): Can I go first? `Cause if we're going to say the same thing, I want to say it first.
ZOE: We're not going to say the same thing.
STAN: Well, let me go, because this is really embarrassing, and I just have to say it.
ZOE: Okay.
STAN: I've dated a lot of women. I mean, not tons, but a lot. And, the thing is, I've never...been in love before. I've never even told anyone I love them before. Because I just never felt it. But from the day we met, from the first time our backs accidentally touched in the subway, I feel this, this... (he shakes his head) Maybe this is too much to say right now, but...I love you, Zoe. I really do.
STAN (CONT'D): In my mind, you were supposed to say, I love you, too.
STAN: Zoe?
STAN (CONT'D): Why are you crying? Everything's perfect.
ZOE: It's not.
STAN: Sure it is.
STAN (CONT'D): What?
ZOE: I'm pregnant.
STAN: Uh, I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen that fast.
ZOE: I just found out.
STAN: Pregnant? As in you're going to have a baby?
STAN (CONT'D): I don't understand.
ZOE: I know.   It's hard to explain.
STAN: Well, who's it?
ZOE: I don't know.
STAN: What?
ZOE: I don't know who the father is. I kind of know him. I just don't know his name exactly. It was sort of anonymous.
STAN: Anonymous?
ZOE: He's a donor. From a sperm bank.
STAN: Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about? Sperm bank? What?
ZOE: I know, this is so fucked up.
STAN: When did all of this happen?
ZOE: The day we met. That same day. And I didn't tell you because I didn't think there was any way I could be pregnant.
STAN: But...why?
ZOE: Because supposedly with frozen sperm it takes a few tries and...
STAN: No, why would you do this?
ZOE: Because I wanted a baby. And I'm almost forty, and I never met the right guy. I was afraid if I waited any longer it would all pass me by, and I'd miss my chance.
ZOE (CONT'D): I didn't know you. I would have never done it if--
STAN: I just told you I loved you.
ZOE: Well....do you not now?
STAN: You're pregnant.
ZOE: Don't say it like that.
STAN: You're pregnant.
ZOE: Yes.   I'm pregnant.      I'm pregnant!
STAN: I tell you I'm in love with you and you tell me your pregnant with some stranger's child?
ZOE: Don't say it like that.     You make it sound dirty.
STAN: I'm sorry. I...I'm stunned. I don't know what to say. What the fuck am I supposed to say?! This is great fucking news? Congratulations?! Why did you wait so long to tell me?
ZOE: Because I'm freaking out, okay! I didn't know what to do. I made this big decision to do this and then I met you--
STAN: Well, what am I supposed to do now? This isn't how it was supposed to be. This isn't what--
ZOE: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Life isn't perfect. It's not all neat and tidy like your perfect family and your perfect farm and your bluegrass band. It's messy. It's fucked up. This is real life, okay? I'm sorry to break it to you.
ZOE (CONT'D): I'm sorry.
STAN: Sorry?   What's sorry going to do?
JOAN: Oh, I thought you were in your room. Sorry. (then) Everything okay?
JOAN (CONT'D): Well, she seems really terrific. Dad and I both think so. She's smart and poised and...
JOAN (CONT'D): And warm and gracious...
JOAN (CONT'D): And pretty and...
JOAN (CONT'D): What the hell's going on in there?
STAN: She's pregnant.
JOAN: Oh, dear God.
ZOE: I don't know what to say.
ZOE (CONT'D): I guess I'd given up on meeting someone like you, and I did what I thought was best.
ZOE (CONT'D): But, for what it's worth...I love you, too.
MONA: Come here.
DR. HARRIS: Congratulations! What luck to get pregnant on the first try, huh? And with frozen sperm, too. So, how are we feeling?
ZOE: (unconvincing) Okay.
DR. HARRIS: You sure about that?
ZOE: It's been hard. I don't know if I was really prepared for this.
DR. HARRIS: Well, your hormones aren't helping, and going through this without a partner must be difficult.
DR. HARRIS (CONT'D): Well, the good news is everything looks great. You are now eight weeks pregnant, which is an important milestone. With a little luck, we should be able to see a heartbeat today.
ZOE: That's it?     That's...my baby?
ZOE (CONT'D): Hi, Baby. (then) Is it okay? Is it healthy?
DR. HARRIS: Everything's just... (makes a face, then) Wait, a minute...
ZOE: What?   Wait a minute, what?
DR. HARRIS: Well...I see another heartbeat.
ZOE: (freaking out) It has two hearts?
DR. HARRIS: No...but you have two babies.
CAROL: Twins!   That's fantastic!
LORI: Why are you crying?   That's so lucky.
ZOE: Yup.   That's me.   Lucky, lucky, me.
CAROL: Are you okay? Is it a financial concern? There are many programs--
ZOE: No. I'm fairly loaded, actually. Used to work for Google. (blows nose) I'm sorry. This is hard for me. I don't know if I can talk about it yet.
CAROL: Take your time. When you feel like sharing, we're here for you. We're all sisters here. (then, to the group) Let's give Zoe some space. When she's ready to talk, we're ready to listen. Deep, cleansing breaths, Zoe.
CAROL (CONT'D): Now, in the meantime, does anyone else have anything they want to discuss? Problems? Concerns?
TABITHA: I'm having a hard time. Luca keeps asking why he doesn't have a daddy, and I just don't know what--
ZOE: (blurting out) There's this guy. His name is Stan. And he's fantastic.
CAROL: I knew it!
TABITHA: Uh...wasn't I just speaking?
CAROL: I knew you were with that guy!
SARA: What guy?
LORI: Zoe, this group is called Single Mother's By Choice.
ZOE: I know.   I'm sorry--
TABITHA: Um, excuse me. What about Luca? He's been really, really sad.
ZOE: (floodgates opening) Have you ever met a guy and you get butterflies and you think this is the kind of man who could take care of me forever? The kind of guy who makes you re-examine everything? Like, maybe I can be a stay-at-home mom and be barefoot and pregnant.
ZOE (CONT'D): He actually lives on a farm! Plays the banjo! Maybe I could learn to sew and take care of the animals. Like Laura Ingalls.
ZOE: Carol, thank you. This has been really helpful. Just getting it all out and being with other women who--
CAROL: I'm going to have to ask you not to come back.
ZOE: What?   Why?
CAROL: I don't think we can help you, and, quite frankly, you're against everything we stand for.
ZOE: But, I thought we were all sisters.
CAROL: No.  Not you. (then) Do you know how long it took me to conceive? Five years. I had three miscarriages and spent every last dime on in-vitro. And Dana? The woman with the short hair?
ZOE: Which one?
CAROL: The one with the really short hair?
ZOE: Yeah, that doesn't really narrow it down much.
CAROL: She   just flew to Memphis to watch her   baby being born. Seconds after the   birth, the birth mother changed her   mind and refused to give it up.
CAROL (CONT'D): So, as you can see, we are really dedicated and choosing to be single mothers, and you seem to be in a slightly different place. You're carrying two healthy babies, and you have no idea how lucky you are.
ZOE: (after a beat) You're right.
CAROL: I like you, Zoe. We all like you. But you kind of need to figure out where you are.
NANA: That man is obsessed with my ass.
ZOE: I know.   It's kind of upsetting.
NANA: He wants to take me on a cruise so that we can finally tie the knot. But, I don't know. What's the hurry?
ZOE: You've been engaged for nine years.
NANA: No reason to rush into anything.
NANA (CONT'D): You look terrible, dear.
ZOE: Thanks.
NANA: You must really love him, huh?
ZOE: I guess I do.
NANA: Honey, I'm sure he's wonderful, and I'm sure he loves you, too. But, you have put him in a really awkward position. Having a baby is a big adjustment for any couple. And you're not married. And he's not the father. And you've only been together a little while. And now you're having twins. And--
ZOE: Please stop.
NANA: I'm just saying, if he actually wanted to stay with you right now, he'd be the greatest man in the world, and, quite frankly, I don't think any man is that great.
NANA (CONT'D): Arthur's just about the best man I know, and look at him. He's a fucking idiot.
JOAN: You know, people thought we were crazy when we bought this farm.
JOAN (CONT'D): All of our friends in New York, they thought we'd lost our minds.
JOAN (CONT'D): I guess I'm saying that you may have envisioned your life going one way, but the reality is, it could go a totally different direction. You just have to be open to it.
STAN: Having a baby with someone I barely know, someone else's baby...it's just not how I pictured it.
JOAN: I used to work on Wall Street. Now I wear boots covered in goat shit. This isn't how I pictured it, either. But guess what...I'm happy.
LORI: Make sure you put your numbers down. I want to have everyone's number handy in case I go into labor early.
ZOE: Hi, guys.
CAROL: Hi, Zoe.
ZOE: I just wanted to apologize. I'm sorry I got into a relationship and wasn't honest with you guys, and I'm sorry I interrupted you, Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing better.
TABITHA: Thanks.
ZOE: (to Carol) And I've thought a lot about what you said, about how lucky I am. I got into this whole situation because I wanted to have a baby. And, somehow, I lost sight of that. (then) Anyway, I need partners in this, and I hope you'll take me back.
ZOE (CONT'D): What's this?
LORI: It's a phone tree. I'm due next month, but my midwife thinks I may go sooner. I want everyone to be there. Are you in?
ZOE: I'm in.
ZOE: Hi.
WOMAN: Hi.
TWIN TODDLERS: Hi./Hi.
STAN: Hi.
ZOE: Hi.
STAN: Hi.
ZOE: You said that already.
STAN: You...look great.
STAN (CONT'D): How are you feeling?
ZOE: Okay.
STAN: Good.
ZOE: You have a beard.
STAN: Yeah, it's awful isn't it.
ZOE: No.
STAN: Don't lie. (then) Did I tell you how pretty you look?
STAN (CONT'D): I miss you.
ZOE: I miss you, too.
STAN: This whole time we've been apart, I've been trying to figure out what it is about you that I love so much. And I think that it's that a lot of people talk about doing things, but you actually do them. You're really kind of daring. How you quit your job and took over a pet store all because some asshole sold you a lame dog. You came and found me at the Farmer's Market even though the night before I acted like a total stalker...
STAN (CONT'D): And now you're pregnant. Because you wanted to have a baby and didn't think you could wait any longer. Well, that's just the same kind of thing. It's...brave. And I can't love you for being that way but then walk away for the same reason.
STAN (CONT'D): I love you. I've been waiting my whole life for you. And I can't let one little baby get in the way of that. I just...can't.
ZOE: There's something I need to tell you.
STAN: Okay.
ZOE: It's big. And you're allowed to take all of this back when I tell you.
STAN: What.
ZOE: It's not just one baby....I'm having twins.
STAN: This is insane.
STAN: Do you feel any kicking?
ZOE: Sometimes.
STAN: What does it feel like?
ZOE: Like butterflies.
ZOE (CONT'D): Are you really sure you want to do this?
STAN: Yeah.     I'm really sure.
ZOE: Are you okay?
STAN: They're so...perfect.      They look like real babies.
DR. HARRIS: Would you like to know the sexes?
ZOE: Yes.     Tell us.
DR. HARRIS: You're having two healthy little girls.
STAN: Two girls?
ZOE: Two girls.
DR. HARRIS: Congratulations.
STAN: Two girls!
STAN (CONT'D): Hi.
WOMAN: Hi.
CHEF: Here we have a yellowtail sashimi with ponzu sauce and pea shoots. This is carpaccio with shaved white truffles. And, finally, an heirloom tomato salad with fresh Buratta flown in from Italy this morning.
STAN: Thanks, Sam. It looks incredible.
STAN (CONT'D): Aren't you hungry?
ZOE: I can't eat any of this.
STAN: Why not?
ZOE: (pointing to each dish) Raw. Raw. Unpasteurized. (re: champagne) Alcohol.
STAN: Let me get Sam back. He'll make you anything you want.
ZOE: I don't want to hurt his feelings. You go ahead. I'm fine.
STAN: Well, what are you going to eat?
CASHIER: Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with cheese, four large fries, and a six piece chicken McNuggets?
ZOE: Make that an eight, no, ten-piece McNuggets. (to Stan) You'll have some, right?
STAN: No.
ZOE: (back to the cashier) Ten-piece. Someone will eat them.
ZOE: (re: book) Have you gotten to page 79 yet?
STAN: No. I stopped reading when you ripped out one of my pages and used it as a napkin.
ZOE: Says here many women in the second trimester experience an increased sexual appetite.
STAN: Really?
STAN (CONT'D): Are you coming on to me? It's kind of hard to tell right now.
ZOE: Yeah.   I'm coming on to you.
ZOE (CONT'D): What?
STAN: You have chicken in your hair.
MONA: Why are you even working out? This is the one time in your life you're allowed to let it go.
ZOE: Because look at me. I just keep getting bigger and bigger.
MONA: Well, yeah. That's kind of how it goes.
ZOE: I'm afraid I'm going to scare him away. I'm like one of those giant bouncy castles. Soon I'm going to take over the whole back yard.
MONA: Come on.   He loves you for you.
ZOE: I'm just getting kind of freaked out by everything. He asked me to go to this wedding with him. What kind of first impression am I going to make on all of his friends?
MONA: Well, you're knocked up with some stranger's twins. So, already you're not exactly...
ZOE: Not helping.
MONA: Do you have anything to wear at least?
STAN: Everything okay in there?
STAN (CONT'D): Never mind.
ZOE (O.S.): This SUCKS!!!
STAN: Honey, whatever you wear is fine.
ZOE (O.S.): I don't have anything to wear! That's the problem.
ZOE (CONT'D): Fuuuuuuck!
STAN: You always look great. I've never seen you not look great.
STAN (CONT'D): That's perfect. You look hot.
ZOE: Really?    You think?
STAN: Do you have a shawl or something?
STAN: You look smokin'.
ZOE: Thanks, honey.
STAN: Let's go.     We're super late.
ZOE: Hmmmm...
STAN: Why don't you sort of go in...head first and then turn around.
ZOE: Shut up and push me.
STAN: Push you?
ZOE: Just do it.
ZOE: I hate everyone.
ZOE: Do you think he's telling everyone why I didn't go? I'm too much of a fat-ass walrus to go to the wedding?
BOBBY: You're not a fat ass walrus. You're pregnant.
BOBBY (CONT'D): Why are you crying? So what?   You missed a stupid wedding.
BOBBY (CONT'D): You got to have girls' night with me. This is way more fun.
ZOE: I don't know. I'm just so emotional lately. It's the hormones.
BOBBY: You can't help it. Being pregnant sucks. You're emotional, and irrational, and you get back fat.
ZOE: I have back fat?
BOBBY: No.  I'm just kidding. (then) Okay, yes. You have back fat.
ZOE: How's Stan going to stay with me through this? I'm disgusting.
BOBBY: We'll go shopping tomorrow. We'll get some hip maternity clothes... whatever that means.
ZOE: Look at me, Bobby.
BOBBY: What?
ZOE: (pinching back fat) Look at me. What do you see?
BOBBY: I see the most amazingly wonderful person I know.
BOBBY (CONT'D): With back fat.
OLIVIA: Why aren't you dancing?
STAN: I'm just about to go.    It's late.
OLIVIA: Come on, one dance.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): For old time's sake.
STAN: I have a girlfriend, Olivia.
OLIVIA: Never stopped you before.
STAN: It's serious this time.
ZOE: How was it?
STAN: Boring.
ZOE: Good.
ZOE: This is my old ass.
STAN: Why do you have a picture of your ass?
ZOE: My college boyfriend took it. So, I guess in fairness, my ass doesn't look exactly like this anymore, but it's pretty close. It's held up.
STAN: It's a nice ass.
ZOE: You said you don't know the real me, so I thought I'd show you.
ZOE (CONT'D): This is me in seventh grade.
STAN: Wow.
ZOE: I know.
STAN: You look like Anthony Michael Hall.
ZOE: This period, as horrible as it was, made me who I am. I think every person should go through a hideously ugly phase. It builds character. (then) It also taught me that I should never, under any circumstances, have short hair and a perm again.
ZOE (CONT'D): This   is one of my favorites because look   how happy I am. I don't even know   what place yellow is, but I'm sure   it's not good.
STAN: Fifth place.
ZOE: But I still look super happy, right? That's all because of Nana. Whatever I did, she thought it was the best.
ZOE (CONT'D): These are my best friends, Bobby and Mona. Mona and I met in high school and Bobby passed out on my couch in college and never left. You haven't met them yet because they might scare you away.
STAN: Why are you dressed like that?
ZOE: Halloween. We were supposed to be a traffic light but Mona bagged out at the last minute and so Bobby and I just look like idiots. That's typical Mona, by the way.
ZOE (CONT'D): This is my mom.
STAN: You look just like her.
ZOE: This is the last picture of her that I have. She lived for a few more years, but we never took any pictures because she didn't want us to remember her like that. I was eight when she died.
STAN: I...can't imagine.
ZOE: She had a great laugh. And really soft hands. She used to rub my back before I went to sleep.
STAN: Do you have any pictures of your dad?
STAN (CONT'D): I'm sorry. If you don't want to talk about it...
ZOE: My mother was in a coma for two years before the end. That's when my dad left her.
STAN: Oh.
ZOE: So...that's when he died.    To us, anyway.
STAN: God, Zoe.    I'm so sorry.
ZOE: (after a beat) It's okay. It was an important lesson. That's when I realized that nothing lasts forever.
ZOE (CONT'D): So, that's my story. That's the real me.
STAN: Things can last forever, you know.
ZOE: Not for me they can't.
ZOE (CONT'D): That's weird.
STAN: I'm confused. Why did you say you would come witness this birth in the first place?
ZOE: I don't know. Seemed like a good idea at the time. I was trying to get back in their good graces. Go home. I'll meet you there. I don't want them to see you anyway.
STAN: It's four in the morning. I'm not letting you walk home alone.
ZOE: Fine. I'll just pop in, show my face and leave. Ten minutes, tops.
CAROL: Zoe, it's so nice of you to come, especially at this crazy hour.
LORI: You're really one of us now.
ZOE: Are you sure you're in labor? You're so calm.
LORI: Oh, I'm sure.
ZOE: Well, I just wanted to come and say a quick hi and good luck.
LORI: You're not staying?
CAROL: You have to stay. Lori wants us all to be together for this.
ZOE: Well, I really want to be here but...um, the truth is...actually I've been wanting to tell you guys for a while but, the truth is...
CAROL: (whispering) She's having a contraction.
LORI: Okay.   What was it you were saying?
ZOE: I'm back with Stan.
LORI: Stan who?
CAROL: The farmer?
ZOE: Actually, he makes cheese. He named a cheese after me. Isn't that romantic? Sort of? (off their blank stares) Well, anyway, I'm not technically a single mother by choice anymore. So, if you want me to leave right now, I totally understand. I'll just walk out the door and--
LORI: No, I really want you to stay.
ZOE: (bummed) Oh.
CAROL: Listen, Zoe, if you're happy, we're happy. We'd love to meet him. Bring him to group any time.
ZOE: Well, actually, he's downstairs, so I should probably get back to--
LORI: Great.   Invite him up.
ZOE: Oh, no, no, no...
LORI: I'm not shy. I've been through this before. It's quite beautiful, really.
STAN: Excuse me?
ZOE: Just a few minutes.
STAN: I don't know, Zoe.
ZOE: You have to come up. They begged me. And truthfully, I'm kind of scared of them. Please?
STAN: This is weird.
ZOE: Good brownies, though. This one has peanut butter in it.
CAROL: Come on everybody, it's time. She's getting into the water.
STAN: The what?
CAROL: Oh, it's a water birth.   Didn't Zoe tell you?
STAN: What's a water birth?
ZOE: I don't know. But just so we're clear, this... (re. the whole scene) Is not the real me.
STAN: I'll wait here.
CAROL: Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.
ZOE: (eyes wide) Wow. Wow. Wow.
CAROL: I know. It's amazing how the body can open up like that.
ZOE: I'm just going to get some air. I'm feeling a little...
LORI: Don't move, Zoe, you're my focal point.
MIDWIFE: Push, Lori. Push.
CAROL: You can't leave.   You're her focal point.
ZOE: Can't she use someone else?
CAROL: She's in labor. You want to argue with her now?
CAROL: Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.
ZOE: Oh, Jesus. (then) What is...that?
CAROL: Sssshh. It's perfectly natural. Sometimes the bowels just let go. (then, back to chanting) Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.
LORI: (yelling) Don't move, Zoe, I need you! You're my focal point.
ZOE: What does that even mean?
LORI: I need to turn over.    Please!
JESSIE: Do it, Lori. We're here for you. We're all here for you.
CAROL: (excited) Here comes the head.
JESSIE: We can see the head, Lori.
CAROL: There's so much hair!
ZOE: (woozy, afraid) I don't think that's the baby's hair.
LORI: I want to see the head. Get me a mirror. It's in the bedroom.
ZOE: I'll get it.
CAROL (O.S.): Stan, get the mirror!
STAN: Excuse me.     Hello. I'm Stan. Excuse me.     Hi. I'm Stan.
LORI: Look at all that wet, curly hair.
STAN: (freaking out) Let's get the hell out of here.
ZOE: I can't.   I'm her focal point.
STAN: What does that mean?
ZOE: I don't know.
STAN: Are you okay?
ZOE: I don't know. Why am I wet?
ZOE (CONT'D): What is that?
STAN: (afraid) I think it's the placenta.
ZOE: Wow. We really shouldn't have seen that.
STAN: No.
ZOE: I did mention that I barely know those people, right?
STAN: Like forty times.
ZOE: I feel the need to say it again.
STAN: It won't be like that for us.
ZOE: How do you know?
STAN: Well, for starters, you wax.
OLIVIA: Oh, hi.
STAN: Hi. (awkward beat, then) You remember Zoe.
OLIVIA: Right, hi.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): Wow. (then, to Stan) Wow.
ZOE: What is that supposed to mean?
OLIVIA: It's nothing.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): (re. Zoe's pregnant belly) I had no idea it was that serious.
STAN: I told you it was serious.
ZOE: (interrupting) What the hell does, "sorry about last night" mean?
OLIVIA: It's stupid. I was drunk and...
STAN: It was nothing.
ZOE: What was nothing?
OLIVIA: You're having a baby? I didn't know you'd been together that long.
STAN: Well, they're not mine...but, yeah, we're having a baby. Two actually.
STAN: Nothing happened.
ZOE: Get away from me.
STAN: Nothing happened!
ZOE: You said, "they're not mine."
STAN: I didn't mean to say it.
ZOE: How could you say that?
STAN: I don't know. I was flustered.
ZOE: Flustered?
STAN: I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking straight. I've been up all night watching Orca give birth!
ZOE: (incredulous) "They're not mine?"
STAN: (at a loss ) Well, I mean...technically, they're not.
ZOE: You know, all this time you're trying to figure out who the real me is, but who the fuck are you?
STAN: Zoe.
MONA: Do you really think something happened with the berry girl?    They both said nothing happened.
ZOE: Well, are they going to come out and tell me? And that's not even the point. He said, the babies weren't his. And if he says that, he thinks that. And if he thinks that, he's not really committed.
MONA: So, now you run?
ZOE: Why should I stick around for the end of the story when I know what it's going to be?
ZOE (CONT'D): What? If you want to say something, say it.
MONA: Do you know the end of the story? Can't you just give him the benefit of the doubt? He seems like such a good guy.
ZOE: You haven't even met him.
MONA: Yeah, and don't think I don't know the reason for that. You were never going to see this through, Zoe. Never. It was doomed before it began. Just like all of your relationships. You get out before you get hurt.
ZOE: You don't think I'm hurt right now?
MONA: Every man is not your father. When are you going to realize that?
ZOE: You don't know what you're talking about.
MONA: I've known you for thirty years. I know you don't trust people. You and your grandmother, both. She's been engaged to Arthur for how long now?
ZOE: Leave Nana out of this.
MONA: She's never going to marry him. Just like you'd never marry Stan. No wonder you ended up with a sperm donor. He'll never let you down. It's your ideal boyfriend.
ZOE: I used a donor because I wanted a baby.
MONA: I'm sorry.     I went too far.
ZOE: Because I wanted to have a family. Because Nana is the only one I've got and she's eighty-four years old. And then it will just be me. So, yeah, you went a little too far.
ZOE: Guess it's just you and me again.
ZOE: What.
STAN: It's Thursday. We have a doctor's appointment.
ZOE: There is no "we", Stan.
STAN: Come on, I didn't mean to say it, and that's not how I feel.
ZOE: I made a mistake trusting you.
STAN: Don't say that.     That's not true.
ZOE: You're not good for me. You made me think I needed you, and I don't.
STAN: So that's it? Because of one stupid, asinine thing that I said, it's all over? This is how it ends?
ZOE: Yes.  This is how it ends. (then) I don't know why you're so surprised. I told you, nothing lasts forever.
DR. HARRIS: Things look great.
ZOE: Good.
DR. HARRIS: So, I'll see you back in two weeks, and we'll start checking to see if the babies are dropping.
ZOE: It's hard to believe we're in the home stretch.
DR. HARRIS: Now's the time I start discussing a birthing plan with my patients. Do you want me to wait until next time when Stan's here?
ZOE: Oh.    Uh, no. He won't be here.
DR. HARRIS: He's out of town or something?
ZOE: No.    He's just...out.
DR. HARRIS: Oh.   I'm sorry to hear that.
ZOE: It's back to just you and me now. We've come full circle.
DR. HARRIS: Well, don't you want anyone with you in the delivery room? You know, like a birthing partner?
NANA: Me?
ZOE: Yeah.   Is that okay?
NANA: Of course.
ZOE: Good.   `Cause you're all I've got.
NANA: What do I have to do?
ZOE: I don't know. It will be a c-section, so, basically, just stand there and try not to faint.
NANA: I can do that.
ZOE: Thanks, Nana. It means a lot to me that you'll be there.
NANA: Are you kidding me? I've been waiting my whole life for this.
ZOE: Holy shit, is he dead?
NANA: Sleeping.
ZOE: How can you tell?
NANA: He's been like that all morning.    I wore him out last night.
ZOE: Wow.   I did not need to know that.
NANA: We were celebrating. (with a smile) We finally set a date.
ZOE: Excuse me?
NANA: So, we'll put the band here and the dance floor right here.
ZOE: I can't believe you're getting married. What made you change your mind?
NANA: All of a sudden it just hit me, what am I waiting for? I love him. He loves me. What am I so afraid of?
ZOE: Wow.   This is...really big news.
NANA: You don't seem happy.
ZOE: No, I am. It's just...it just makes my situation seem all the more tragic. You're getting married and here I am...
NANA: Zoe.
ZOE: Don't worry. I'm fine.    I'm really happy for you.
NANA: I'm worried about you, honey.
ZOE: I'm fine.
NANA: I just don't want you to make the same mistakes I made. I've been alone for over thirty years now, and that's too long. Sometimes in life you have to forgive and move on.
ZOE: Are you talking about my father or Stan?
NANA: Both, baby.
NANA (V.O.): Because if you don't learn how to forgive, you will always be stuck in the past.
BOBBY: (singing) I see trees of green, red roses too. I see them bloom for me and you...
MONA: This song always makes me cry.
ZOE: Me, too.
MONA: Is it happy or sad? The words are happy but the song is so sad.
ZOE: I guess it's both.   Happy and sad.
BOBBY: (singing) I see skies of blue and clouds of white. The bright blessed day, the dark and sacred night...
MONA: I'm sorry about the things I said.
ZOE: I know.
MONA: It was really shitty of me.
ZOE: It was. Especially because you were right.
BOBBY: (singing) And I think to myself...what a wonderful world...
ZOE: I don't want to be alone forever, Mona.
MONA: Then don't be.
CUSTOMER: Is this new? The Zoe?
STAN: Yeah. This is the first week it's been out.
CUSTOMER: Can I have a sample?     What's it like?
STAN: It's...very stubborn, overly suspicious and distrustful of men.
CUSTOMER: Huh?
BOBBY: Come on, you old maid.
ZOE: No.
BOBBY: Dance with me. One dance.
ZOE: Forget it.
BOBBY: Fine. But it doesn't mean that I won't dance with you.
ZOE: What?
BOBBY: Haaaaaay.
ZOE: Go away, you freak.
BOBBY: Smack it, Bitch.
BOBBY (CONT'D): You know you love it. Uh-huh. That's right. Smack it.
BOBBY (CONT'D): What the hell?
OLD MAN: Damn it. Not again. (then, checks pants) Nope. Not me.
ZOE: I think my water just broke.
ZOE: I'll drive.
NANA: You're in labor.   You can't drive.
ARTHUR: I'll drive.
NANA: You don't have a car or a license. (then, to Bobby) You drive.
BOBBY: We're in Queens. I don't even know what side of the road they drive on here.
ZOE: Will someone please just drive me to the fucking hospital?
MONA: This was my surprise for after the wedding, but let's hit it.
BOBBY: This works.
NANA: Are you okay? Remember to breathe. Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in.
MONA: Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee.
NANA: (joining in) Hoo-hoo. Hee-hee...
MONA/NANA: Hoo-hoo.   Hee-hee...
ZOE: Please stop. It's getting really breathy in here. I'm fine.
BOBBY: What about me? I have amniotic fluid on my Gucci tux.
ARTHUR: Who needs a drink?
NANA: (whispering) Bobby...
BOBBY: What?
NANA: I don't know if I can do this.
BOBBY: What?!
NANA: I can't go in with her.
BOBBY: Well, I certainly can't do it.   I don't do vaginas.
ARTHUR: Don't look at me.
NANA: Help me, Bobby.
BOBBY: Nana, pull yourself together. This is the biggest moment of Zoe's life, and you can't let her down. I'd slap you right now, but I'm afraid your teeth would fly out.
ZOE: Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee, hoo-hee.
BOBBY: Hey, girl.     How ya doing?
ZOE: Okay.
BOBBY: Good. (smiles, then) So, I really don't want you to worry, but Nana just passed out at the nurse's station and is now down in the ER getting stitches.
ZOE: What???
BOBBY: Everything's under control. Good thing we're at the hospital, right?
ZOE: Where is she?
BOBBY: Get back in bed. All is well. Arthur's with her. Now, on to bigger and better...who do you want to be your birthing partner? Your choices are me or Mona.
BOBBY (CONT'D): I know. They're shitty choices. Do you want me to call your scary lesbian friends from your group?
ZOE: I don't know.
BOBBY: We're going to get through this, okay? You just have to really think about it. Who do you want with you in the delivery room?
BOBBY (CONT'D): Who is the one person you want by your side?
ZOE: Taxi!
CABBIE: You're not an escaped mental patient, are you?
ZOE: Kind of.
ZOE: Ow.   Son of a bitch, that hurts.
OLIVIA: Are you okay?
OLIVIA (CONT'D): Are you in labor?
ZOE: Fuck off.
ZOE: Stan!
FRED: Whoa. I've had nightmares that started like this.
ZOE: Stan!
STAN: Zoe?
ZOE: Stan!
STAN: Are you okay? Don't run!
ZOE: I can't help it!
STAN: Are you all right?
ZOE: (panting) Great. I'm great.
STAN: Why are you in a hospital gown?
ZOE: I'm in labor.
STAN: What?   What the hell are you doing here?
ZOE: It's you.
STAN: What?
ZOE: Nana's my birthing partner, but she passed out and needed stitches, and Bobby asked me who I most wanted with me, and...it's you. It's only you. (then) I don't want to be alone anymore. I love you. You don't know how much I love you.
ZOE (CONT'D): More than anything in the world, I love you.
STAN: I've been in love with you since the moment you stole my cab.
ZOE: Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab, hee-hee, hoo-hoo.
ZOE (CONT'D): Ow.   Ow.   Ow.
STAN: I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just love you. I love you so much. (then) Let's get the hell out of here.
ZOE: Yeah. I think I really need to go to the hospital now.
STAN: Let's go have our babies.
WOMAN: Hi.
ZOE: Hi.
STAN: Hi.
ZOE: Who knew you were such a romantic.
STAN: Well, it's the anniversary of our first date. Where else would I take you? (then) Cheers.
STAN (CONT'D): What a year, huh?
ZOE: Incredible. Wouldn't change a thing. Well, except for the part where you dumped me.
STAN: And the part where you dumped me. (to the babies) Girls...Mommy and Daddy were stupid.
ZOE: (baby-talk) Yes, we were. Yes, we were.
STAN: The first time we held hands was in here. It started out as a high- five, but then I strategically turned into a hand-hold.
ZOE: How do you remember that?
STAN: We both agreed that we were totally sick of weddings and hated when people wrote their own vows.
ZOE: That's right. I remember that.
STAN: So...I hope you won't hold it against me.
ZOE: What?
ZOE (CONT'D): What are you doing here?
ZOE (CONT'D): Bobby?
ZOE (CONT'D): What's happening?
STAN: I promise to love you even though you still eat chicken McNuggets in bed. I promise to name cheeses after all of our children no matter how embarrassed they are by it. I promise to always check out your ass when you walk away, and I promise to love you more tomorrow than I do today, which doesn't even seem impossible...
