HOWARD: How about it, Jeff?
JEFF: Done.
HOWARD (O.S.): Nice legs.
JEFF: (matter-of-fact) Sniper.
HOWARD: Where?
JEFF: High-rise. Top floor.        Window in the middle.
HOWARD: (looking through his binoculars) Stay on him. Stay on him.        Now go back to the woman. Now!
HOWARD (O.S.): Back to the sniper.
HOWARD: Stay tight on the sniper. Jesus -- look at him! He's about fourteen! Don't lose this!
JEFF: He sees her.
HOWARD: Stay on her. If she runs, widen and try to get her and sniper in the same frame.
JEFF: I said he sees her.
HOWARD: I heard you.    Stay on her.
JEFF: (under his breath) No... no...
JEFF: Sniper!   Sniper! Sni--
AMY: God, I missed you.
JEFF: Me too.
AMY: Let's get out of here. Where's your equipment? Don't tell me you checked it?
JEFF: (holds up his bag) This is it.
AMY: No camera?
AMY: No nothing?
AMY: Ah ha.
AMY: Jeff?
AMY: Can I come in?
JEFF (O.S.): Sure.
AMY: Couldn't sleep?
AMY: I remember when you took that. We had fun on that trip, didn't we?
AMY: You want to talk about it?
JEFF: There's nothing to talk about.
AMY: C'mon, Jeff.
JEFF: I told you. I quit.   Walked out. end of story.
AMY: That's   it?
AMY: Whatever happened back there wasn't your responsibility. You can't keep beating yourself up over it.
AMY: What do you think? You could have stopped that girl from getting killed?
JEFF: You don't understand...
JEFF: It was different this time.
JEFF: (a beat)
JEFF: Think of it. Low pressure, a steady paycheck. So I shoot city council meetings -- how bad could it be?
AMY: Is that what you really want -- or are you just running away?
AMY: You're supposed to let it happen. It's your job.
JEFF: No, Amy.   It's my excuse.
JEFF: That girl... it's like I was paralyzed. I wanted to do something, but I didn't. I just stood there and watched her get killed.
JEFF: Please, babe, I need this.     Say yes and we'll take as long    as you want -- drive cross-country    and make a vacation out of it.     What do you say?
AMY: Jesus, Jeff...
JEFF: Sorry.     I took my eyes off the road.
AMY: (seeing thermos on floor) Maybe it's time we took a break, you know?
JEFF: I'll pull over next chance we get. (a beat) Sorry...
TRUCKER: On vacation?
AMY: Sort of.    We're moving, actually.
TRUCKER: Whereabouts?
AMY: California. We thought we'd take the scenic route.
TRUCKER: Huh. In that case, you oughta try the Pass Road, 'bout thirty miles west. Real pretty, makes a loop through the hills, then hooks back up with the highway.
AMY: Thanks. I'll mention it to my husband.
TRUCKER: Okay, then. Good luck.   Enjoy the rest of your trip.
EARL: (flatly) Nice car.
JEFF: Thanks.
EARL: Air, C.D., leather -- I guess you sprung for the whole nine yards.
JEFF: I guess.
EARL: Then again, out here, what you really need's a C.B. radio.
JEFF: Is that right?
EARL: 'Course, if you use a C.B., you gotta have a handle.
EARL: How about Shit-for-Brains? (beat) You damn near killed us back there, boy.
EARL: (snorting)
EARL: Howdy, ma'am. Caught this fellow tryin' to steal your Cherokee.
AMY: What was that about?
JEFF: Nothing. Guy in the truck. Thinks I tried to hit him.
JEFF: C'mon, let's go.
AMY: You want me to drive?
JEFF: Later.   Just get in.
AMY: Is something wrong?
JEFF: No, let's just go.
AMY: This isn't the Grand Prix, you know.
AMY: What's bothering you?
JEFF: I told you. Nothing. (pause) The guy was an asshole.
JEFF: What'd you get?
AMY: Junk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo Hoo, Moon pies... can you believe they still make this stuff?
JEFF: You kidding. It's probably gourmet cuisine around here.
AMY: (trying to brighten the mood) This is crazy. Look at this. Says if you win this mail-in contest, you can choose either ninety thousand dollars or ninety thousand doughnuts.
AMY: What would you do with ninety thousand doughnuts?
JEFF: I dunno... Sell 'em for thirty cents each and pay off this car.
AMY: Very funny. (beat) Alright, what about ninety thousand dollars? What would you do with that?
JEFF: I don't know.    Look, Amy, I'm not --
JEFF: Sonofabitch!! My camera!        He stole my camera!
AMY: (startled) Who?
JEFF: The redneck at the gas station! He lifted it right under my nose! My brand new Nikon. (pounds wheel in frustration) Goddammit.
AMY: Should we go back?
JEFF: What's the use. He's probably halfway to Bumblefuck now, the bastard.
AMY: Look, maybe if we call the cops --
JEFF: What the hell?
AMY: What'd you do?
JEFF: Nothing.   I --
JEFF: Hang on -- I can't steer!
AMY: (deadpan) Found your camera.
JEFF: Ow!
AMY: Are you okay?
JEFF: I'm fine.
JEFF: (annoyed) I said I'm fine, okay?
AMY: Out of range?
AMY: What's going on, Jeff?
JEFF: What's it look like?      I'm trying to fix the car.
AMY: Not the car.
JEFF: What?
AMY: What's going on with you?
AMY: It's been a month since you got back. You can't keep shutting me out like this.
AMY: Jeff, I'm talking to you.
JEFF: (flaring) Look, I really don't want to go into this right now. I'm changing jobs, our finances are fucked, and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. So could we maybe just fix the --
JEFF: Christ, not these guys...
JEFF: Asshole...
AMY: (looking down the road) Jeff --
JEFF: What the hell?
AMY: What's he doing?
RED (TRUCKER): You folks all right?
JEFF: Yeah.   Our car broke down.
RED: (chuckling) I figured that much. You want a hand pushing it off the road?
JEFF: Thanks, I'd appreciate it.    Amy, you want to steer?
JEFF: Think you could radio a tow truck for us?
JEFF: How far is that?
RED: About 60 miles.
JEFF: (disappointed) Oh.
RED: I'd offer to take a look, but it's hard to say with these new engines. Used to be, you could give 'em a kick and a holler and they'd start right up. Now it's all computers and chips.
JEFF: It's a new car.
RED: That could be the problem. You been running it pretty fast?
RED: Tell you what. If you want a ride, there's a little diner up the road. Belle's. They got a pay phone. You could call a tow truck from there.
JEFF: Nice     of you to offer. But we've got a     lot of stuff in the car. I think     we're better off waiting for a cop     to come along.
RED: (casually) Suit    yourself. Not many cops on this    road, that's why the truckers use    it. Maybe you'll get lucky. (tipping his cap) Good    luck.
AMY: Are you nuts?
JEFF: We don't know this guy.
AMY: He's offering to help. It       could be hours before anyone else      comes along. It's 100 degrees.        You really want to be stuck out      here?
JEFF: Amy, I've got my equipment in the car. All our stuff. What if those guys come back and we're not here? (turns away, quietly to himself) Jesus... don't be stupid...
AMY: Stupid is sitting out here waiting for a cop when we already have a ride.
AMY: Stupid was letting you talk me into leaving Boston.
AMY: Excuse me? Do you think you could drop me at that diner?
RED: (surprised) Sure thing. How about you, mister? I could take you both just as easy.
AMY: That's okay. My husband wants to stay with the car. I'll just get my purse.
JEFF: What do you think you're doing?
AMY: I'm going to the diner. I'm going to call a tow truck. Then I'm going to order an iced tea and wait. Good-bye, Jeff.
JEFF: (firm) You're not riding with that guy. End of story.
AMY: You wanted to be alone. Well... you're alone. Why don't you take the time to get your head together?
RED: Watch your step, ma'am.
JEFF: Oh for Christ's sake...
JEFF: Excuse me.
JEFF: I was supposed to meet my wife here.
JEFF: Dark hair, slender, about five- five. Wearing a pale blue Benetton shirt.
BARTENDER: A pale blue what?
JEFF: Benetton shirt.
BARTENDER: Hank!  Your order's ready. (to Jeff) I been busy. They come and go.
JEFF: Guy with a baseball cap.   Driving an eighteen wheeler.
BARTENDER: Don't ring a bell.
JEFF: You sure?
BARTENDER: Hey! Man here's looking for his wife, dark hair, button-on shirt, travelin' with a guy in a baseball cap. Anybody see 'em?
FLO: Looks like she got away from ya, cowboy.
JEFF: Could she have left a message with another one of your employees?
BARTENDER: Don't see how. I'm the only one who works here.
JEFF: I don't understand. Is there another Belle's Diner?
BARTENDER: (chuckles) No siree. Definitely not.
JEFF: (under his breath) Shit.
JEFF: Excuse me, how far is the next town?
BARTENDER: About twenty miles.
JEFF: Look, if my wife comes in -- her name is Amy -- tell her I was here. Tell her to stay put till I get back, not to move. Would you do that, please?
BARTENDER: (shrugs, bored) Okay.
JEFF: C'mon, you fat-ass.    Pull over.
JEFF: Pull over!    Pull over!
RED: Jesus, pal, what the hell you doing?
JEFF: I was signaling you to stop. Didn't you see me?
RED: No.
JEFF: Where's my wife?
RED: Huh?
JEFF: My wife.     Where is she?
RED: How should I know where your wife is?
JEFF: I checked at the diner.      No one saw her there.
RED: Mister, I don't know what you're talking about.
JEFF: You gave her a ride. You were supposed to drop her at Belle's diner.
RED: Nope.   Sorry.
JEFF: How can you not remember? It was just half an hour ago, for chrissakes!
RED: Mister, I never seen you before in my life.
CB VOICE (V.O.): (filtered) Breaker, breaker -- Iron Man, you copy?
JEFF: (reacts) Your radio works -- (locks eyes with Red) What the hell are you doing -- ?
JEFF: Amy?    Amy?!   You in there?
RED: Look, mister, I don't know what you want, but --
JEFF: I want my fucking wife, is what I want! What have you done to her?!
JEFF: Officer, I need your help!
SHERIFF BOYD: What's your problem?
JEFF: I don't know, this guy has my wife!
SHERIFF BOYD: Calm down, sir. Tell me what's going on.
JEFF: I don't know what the hell's going on. Last time I saw her she was with this guy in his truck. Now he's saying he's never seen her!
RED: Officer, he's crazy -- I don't know what he's talking about.
JEFF: Don't lie, you son of a bitch!
SHERIFF BOYD: All right -- everybody just calm down. (to Jeff) Sir, you want to tell me what happened?
JEFF: Our car broke down. This guy stopped to help us, said he'd drive my wife to a pay phone.    But she never showed up.
SHERIFF BOYD: (turning to Red) Sir?
RED: I don't know, officer. I'm driving along, suddenly this fella runs me off the road and starts hollering about his wife. I swear, I never seen the guy before.
SHERIFF BOYD: And you didn't give his wife a ride?
RED: No, sir.
JEFF: He's lying!
SHERIFF BOYD: Sir, all right with you if I search your truck?
RED: Hell yes, officer. Go right ahead. Name's Red, by the way. Red Barr. (pulls out his wallet) My permits are all current. You can check 'em out.
SHERIFF BOYD: That won't be necessary yet. Just stand back behind the line. Both of you.
SHERIFF BOYD: (to both of them)
SHERIFF BOYD: (eyeing him)
JEFF: (to Sheriff, impatient)
SHERIFF BOYD: (to Red)
SHERIFF BOYD: (re: boxes) Those yours?
RED: Yeah. Personal stuff. Clothes and whatnot. You want to take a look?
SHERIFF BOYD: No. I think we're pretty much done here. You're free to go.
JEFF: (reacts) Whoa, whoa -- wait a sec. That's it? You're not going to question him anymore?
SHERIFF BOYD: Sir, I searched the truck. There's no evidence of suspicious activity, no sign of struggle.
RED: Look, I don't mean to butt in, but maybe you got my truck confused with someone else's.
JEFF: (lunges) Go to hell, you sonofabitch --
SHERIFF BOYD: Hey! Hey! You want to get arrested? Now the man has a point. This is a plain-looking, John Doe truck. Maybe you did get them mixed up.
SHERIFF BOYD: Hey!
SHERIFF BOYD: Mr. Taylor, either you come down from there or I'm going to have to arrest you.
JEFF: It was him.    It was this truck.
SHERIFF BOYD: Uh-huh, I can see that. Did you get a license plate?
JEFF: No.
SHERIFF BOYD: What about the information on the door panel. You recall any of that?
JEFF: I wasn't paying attention.
SHERIFF BOYD: Mr. Taylor, did you by any chance have a beef with your wife today?
JEFF: What does that have to do with anything?
SHERIFF BOYD: Well, for starters, maybe she left you.
JEFF: I don't believe this...
SHERIFF BOYD: I've seen it a hundred times. Lovers, married couples, gay guys. You put two people in a car long enough, they'll go at it. Hell, I've even seen men dump their women on the side of the road, and vice versa.
JEFF: My wife did not leave me.
RED: (cuts in)
RED: Much obliged. (to Jeff) Good luck findin' your wife, mister. No hard feelings.
SHERIFF BOYD: Sir, I believe you that your wife is missing. Maybe you got confused about what truck she got into, maybe you had a fight -- you don't have to tell me. The point is I'm trying to help.
SHERIFF BOYD: The town of Brackett's 31 miles that way. My deputy's name is Len Carver. He's a good man. He'll help you fill out the necessary forms if you want to report your wife missing.
SHERIFF BOYD: If you want my opinion, your wife is probably around here. Lost or plenty pissed off and giving you a scare. Either way, she'll turn up.
DISPATCHER (V.O.): (filtered) Sheriff, this is dispatch. Mrs. Gilbert's locked out of her trailer again. Can you respond?
SHERIFF BOYD: (into mike) 10-4, dispatch. Tell her I'm on my way.
JEFF: I want your name and badge number.
SHERIFF BOYD: Sheriff Arthur Boyd. 226-93. This really isn't necessary --
JEFF: Don't tell me what's necessary, goddamnit. I'm noting the exact time of this conversation. 10:52
SHERIFF BOYD: (exhaling) Suit yourself, Mr. Taylor.
DEPUTY CARVER: Is this a recent picture?
JEFF: Two months old.
DEPUTY CARVER: She still wear her hair like that?
JEFF: Yes.
DEPUTY CARVER: We'll certainly do our best, Mr. Taylor. There's over a hundred thousand people go missing in this country every year. Runaways, deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks hiding from the I.R.S. -- all vanishing without a trace.
DEPUTY CARVER: Now I'm not saying she's one of them. I sure hope not. But unless there's a ransom demand or evidence of forced abduction, believe me, the F.B.I. won't even look at your case till it's been 24 hours.
DEPUTY CARVER: Nevertheless, we'll sure keep our eyes peeled. How's that sound?
JEFF: Did she come in?
BARTENDER: (looks up, uninterested) Didn't see her.
JEFF: You didn't see her, or she didn't come in?
BARTENDER: Buddy, I told you the last time. I'm busy. Maybe she came in, maybe she didn't. All I know is, I didn't see her.
BARFLY: (confidentially) None of my business, mister. But if I was you I'd take a look in the ladies room.
JEFF: Amy?
FLO: Hey -- what the hell you doing?!
JEFF: I want to see your order slips.
BARTENDER: What?
JEFF: You write down the names.   I want to see them.
JEFF: If my wife came in here, then her name's in that pile.
BARTENDER: You calling me a liar?
BARTENDER: Mister, I've had just about enough of you.
JEFF: Let me see the fucking slips.
BARTENDER: Now, mister, you're going to have to leave.
JEFF: Please, I need the phone -- I have to call the police!
SLUGGISH MAN: (drawls) My name's Billy. You the feller lookin' for his wife?
JEFF: How'd you know? Did you see her?
JEFF: Please, if you know something, anything, tell me.
BILLY (SLUGGISH MAN): (a beat) I seen her... maybe.
JEFF: What?    When?
BILLY: Oh man. Never shoulda opened my damn mouth. Now I'm gonna git it.
JEFF: No one's going to hurt you, Billy. Just tell me what you saw.
BILLY: She came in on a truck.   A big white one.
JEFF: Yes...
BILLY: Then she... she got in another truck.
JEFF: Another truck? With who?
BILLY: Dunno. Some men. Bad men. They say I'm a dummy, but I ain't. I see things.
JEFF: Do you know where they went?
BILLY: Uh-huh.    Route seven.   Up by the river.
JEFF: Where by the river?
BILLY: Dunno. They don't tell me that kind of stuff.
JEFF: Who doesn't? The bartender?      The men in the truck?
BILLY: I ain't talking to you no more.
JEFF: Billy, I need you to come to the police. If you tell them what you saw, they'll be able to help me.
BILLY: Man, you're the dummy.
BILLY: Don't you git it? The police is the ones in on it!
JEFF: C'mon... work, goddammit...
JEFF: Fuck.
JEFF: (thank God) Yes.
JEFF: Hello, Steve? It's Jeff Taylor... Listen, I -- don't put me on hold! I need a favor... I've gotta talk to that friend of yours at the F.B.I... No, it's about Amy, she's missing --
JEFF: I said Amy's been --
JEFF: Fuck!
JEFF: Yes, I'm still here.       No -- don't call back -- Steve?!       Steve?!
JEFF: Goddammit!
JEFF: Shit!
EARL: (calling out) Out of the car! Put your hands where I can see 'em!
EARL: I said get out, dammit!   Now!
EARL: Sonofabitch...
EARL: Fuck!
EARL: Goddammit...
EARL: He's getting away!
DRIVER OF VAN (O.S.): Where is he?
EARL: He's in the water!   I just saw him!
AL: ... can't believe you let him get away...
EARL: You try chasing... through this shit...
AL: Fuck... this is what happens when you get one without the other...
EARL: He coming around?
BILLY: Should be... I clocked him pretty good...
BILLY: Rise and shine, dad.
BILLY: C'mon, shake a leg.
JEFF: (weak) Where is she?
BILLY: Give us some answers and you might find out. According to her, you've got a pretty good pile of ready cash sitting in the bank. Is that true?
JEFF: There's some... yeah...
BILLY: Uh-huh... well, 'some' doesn't cut it. Your wife gave us a dollar figure. I want the same exact from you.
JEFF: (coming around; stalling) I don't -- there's different accounts... the balance fluctuates...
BILLY: Fluctuates, my ass. If a hotshot like you ain't tracking his bottom line, it'd be the first time in history. (turning) What do you think, Earl?
EARL: We been fucked with, is what I think. Little slut lied to us. Put 'em on the spot, they'll say anything to stay alive.
BILLY: Yeah, I suppose. Too bad. (peers down at Jeff) Guess you're not the donut magnate after all. (to Earl) Waste of time. Plug him.
JEFF: (blurting out) Ninety thousand.
BILLY: Say again.
JEFF: (emphatic) Ninety thousand dollars.
EARL: Get out.   Don't try anything stupid.
RED: You're a tough man to get a hold of, Jeffrey.
JEFF: (barely able to control himself) What do you want?
RED: It's not me we're talking about. Question is what you want.
RED: Bring him up here.
RED: Welcome to Brackett, Jeff. If ever there was a two-bit shithole in the middle of nowhere, this is it. One gas station, a half-dozen stores and a V.F.W. hall. (pointing) See that building?
RED: That's the bank. Brackett Commerce Bank. You with me?
RED: Then here's the drill. You're gonna walk in there and tell the manager you want an express wire in the amount of $90,000 from your account in Boston. Got your wallet?
RED: You ask for the money in cash. Small bills.
RED (CONT'D): Today's payday at the copper mine, so don't take any horsecock about how they haven't got it. If the manager gives you a hard time, that's your problem. It's your wife who's counting on you.
JEFF: How do I know she's still alive?
BILLY: Shut up.
RED: She's tucked away someplace safe. You get her back as soon as we get the money. Simple as that.
RED: Now a smart guy like you, you're already thinking about calling the cops, right?
RED: (into mike) Iron Man to Blacktop, let's open the gate.
AL (V.O.): (filtered) Copy that, Iron Man.
RED: Like I said, Jeff, if you want to call the cops, there's nothing I can do. Hell, with the fire you've got in your eyes right now, I figure you're fixing on calling the F.B.I., C.I.A. -- even the 82nd Airborne.
RED: Problem is, you can see this town for miles around. So ask yourself: How's the law gonna get here? They gonna fly in? Drive in? Either way, we'll see 'em. So let me be very clear: if we see one unmarked car, one plane, one human being who even smells like a cop -- this deal is dead.
RED: Now take a look at the building with the flagpole.
RED (O.S.): There's exactly two cops in this town. One of them's inside pulling ass duty; the other's on patrol in the foothills. Now a minute ago one of my men called in a non-injury accident on the I-40 connector.
RED (O.S.): It'll take that good ol' boy 20 minutes to get to the connector, another 10 to see there's no accident, and another 20 or so to tool his way back. 50 minutes all in.
RED: That's your deadline. If for any reason one of those cops pulls into town before I'm looking at a bag of money, your wife is dead, you're shit out of luck and we're gone for good.
RED: See, that's why there's no risk to us in this thing. You do the legwork. We sit back, we watch, we listen to our scanners, we monitor you every step of the way. If at any moment we don't like something, we split. Period. (beat) Helluva lot safer than sticking up 7-11s, wouldn't you say?
RED: Put this on. You can't go into the bank like that.
RED: How about it, Jeff? Time to get the show on the road?
JEFF: I need to see the manager. I need a wire transfer from my bank in Boston.
CALHOUN: Yes... sir. I'm the manager. Would you like to have a seat?
CALHOUN: Sir?
JEFF: (turning; preoccupied) What?
CALHOUN: I said you can have a seat if you want.
JEFF: Right.
JEFF: Here's my driver's license, credit card if you need it, my account number in Boston... How long is this going to take?
CALHOUN: Are you all right?
JEFF: (quickly) Yes, I'm fine. Look, that account only has $5,000 in it. How much can you advance me on my credit card?
CALHOUN: Excuse me?
JEFF: (impatient) My credit card. I've got a $6,000 limit. Can you advance me the whole $6,000?
CALHOUN: No, I can't. For non-customers the limit is $500 a day. Sir, are you sure you're all right?
JEFF: Yes, I'm fine. Just... transfer the money, okay?
CALHOUN: (looking up; baffled)
COWBOY (O.S.): Excuse me, you the manager?
CALHOUN: Yes, I am.
COWBOY: Lady over there said to see you about a car loan.
CALHOUN: (indicating waiting area) Certainly, sir. Would you like to have a seat?
CALHOUN: (turning back to Jeff) You were saying, Mr. Taylor?
JEFF: Just... transfer the money.
JEFF: Would you tell the manager I want the money in these denominations?
RED (V.O.): (filtered)
JEFF: The whole thing. Ninety thousand.
RED (V.O.): (filtered) Good. Turn left and start walking toward the main road. Get in the first car that stops.
JEFF: When do I see my wife?
RED (V.O.): (filtered) When I say so. Now walk.
CALHOUN: Marie, this is Roger Calhoun down at the bank. Is the Sheriff there? (a beat) Well, maybe it's nothing, but you might tell him we just had a fellow in here acting kind of strange...
EARL: Toss the envelope on the seat.
JEFF: No.   First you tell me where she is.
EARL: Wrong, asshole. First you give me the money, then you find out. Unless you want me to shoot you dead right here on the highway.
EARL: Now lift your shirt and jacket and turn around.
EARL: Turn around, hands behind your back, and step toward the truck.
EARL: Now get up in the truck, knees on the floor. Do it now!
JEFF: I gave you the money.     Now let her go.
EARL: 'Let her go.'    Do I look like I have her?
JEFF: What the hell --
EARL: (on phone) It's done. I'm heading in. (a beat; listening) Gotcha.
EARL: You gotta be the dumbest motherfuck yet. You think we picked you out of the blue? New car, Massachusetts plates -- probably be days before anyone misses you. Hell, you shoulda got the bumper sticker that goes with it: 'Rich Assholes Looking for Trouble!'
EARL: I'd have loved to see the look on your face when that car seized up. (mimicking panicked driver) Help, help, I ain't got no power!
EARL: You know what I'm gonna do first with your money, boy? Well, do you?
EARL: (fluttering bills under his nose)
EARL: (erupting)
EARL: Aaagghh!
JEFF: Where is she, goddammit?   What'd you do with her?
TOW TRUCK DRIVER: Hey!   You there!
JEFF: Where is she?!
EARL: (barely able to breathe) Fuck you!
JEFF: You like that?     How about this?
JEFF: Four wheel anti-lock brakes, you sonofabitch! You want to try 'em again?
JEFF: How about an emergency stop? You want to try that, Earl? Where is she?
EARL: I don't know!
SHERIFF BOYD: What the hell?
JEFF: End of the line, Earl! How about it? You gonna tell me?
EARL: She's with Billy.
JEFF: Yeah?     Where's that?
EARL: I don't know!    Driving around!
SHERIFF BOYD: (on radio) Repeat, I am in pursuit of a Dodge Ram pickup. Request back-up, repeat, request back-up!
SHERIFF BOYD: Jesus Christ -- (on radio) Dispatch! Suspect identified as one Jeffrey Taylor, repeat, Jeffrey Taylor!
JEFF: Where were you taking the money?
EARL: (losing it) To the truck stop...
JEFF: Where?
EARL: Main highway... Texaco...
JEFF: I know where she is!   My wife!
SHERIFF BOYD: (ignoring him) Drop the gun!
JEFF: You don't understand!      She's been kidnapped!
SHERIFF BOYD: I understand plenty. Now get down on the ground or I'll shoot!
SHERIFF BOYD: You there -- in the pickup! You all right? Can you get out?
EARL: Yeah! Just don't shoot me, officer! He's crazy, I tell you!
SHERIFF BOYD: Well, get out dammit!
JEFF: Officer, please. You gotta listen to me --
SHERIFF BOYD: (glances down at Jeff) Shut up. (to Earl) C'mon out, sir. It's safe --
SHERIFF BOYD: (weak) Shots fired... Officer down... Suspect...
DISPATCHER (V.O.): Help is on the way, Sheriff. Just hang on. I have units and an ambulance en route.
TRUCKER (O.S.): (muffled) C'mon, baby, give it up!
RED: (on phone)
RED: Look, I'm getting out of here. Stay off the airwaves. Bring the girl and meet me at the barn... You got that?
JEFF: (on phone) Hello? Can you hear me? This is Jeff Taylor. I need to talk to the deputy.
JEFF: The name is Jeffrey Taylor. I just witnessed your sheriff being shot. Now put someone on, goddammit!
JEFF: Hello?
DEPUTY CARVER: It's no good. He's not talking. You better mobilize your boys.
DEKE: Daddy, you're home!
RED: Hey, Deke, you miss me?
ARLEEN: Deke, get back to bed! I said now! (to Red) Warren? I thought you were coming back next week.
ARLEEN: ... but it's four in the morning. Why can't Al and Billy come some other time?
RED: (reasoning) I told you, we've got some stuff to take care of. Won't be more than a couple of hours -- I promise.
RED: Say, Deke, how 'bout opening up the barn for your daddy?
RED: Deke, c'mon over here, I got something for you.
RED: Guess which hand.
DEKE: (pointing to right hand) This one.
RED: Nope.    Try again.
DEKE: (pointing to left) This hand.
RED: Nope.
DEKE: (he's been tricked) Dad...
RED: (laughing) Okay, okay, I'll give it to you.
DEKE: Cool!
RED: Deke?   Deke, you back there?
AL: Man, if I never see another couple from Massachusetts it'll be too soon.
RED: Tell me about it.   You get any word on Earl?
BILLY: (shakes head) There's reports of an accident up Five Mile, but that's about it.
BILLY: I told you we shoulda gotten rid of 'em like that couple up in Utah. Nice and clean.
RED: So it got a little fucked up -- so what? We stay out of the area for a while, things will cool off.
RED: Dammit, Al, what the hell you doing?
AL: Figured I'd get started on the jewelry.
RED: Fuck that, you can work on it later. Help us with the girl.
RED: I'll get some plastic. We'll bury her before it gets light out.
AL: (startled) Aagh!
AL: Goddamn.   Scared me half to death.
BILLY: (chuckles) Gotcha good, huh, Al? Oughta be more careful next time.
AL: Shut up. (glaring at Amy) Lemme do her, Red. I'll cut her head off right now.
ARLEEN (O.S.): (muffled) Warren? You in there?
RED: Shit, it's my wife. Help me get her in the freezer. (calling out) Just a second, Arleen.
RED: Don't   worry, honey. It's not as bad as   it sounds. It'll take you about   10 minutes to suck the air out.    Probably won't even feel it.
RED: C'mon, let's go.
ARLEEN: Well finally. Are you coming to breakfast? I've been calling you.
RED: Sure thing, honey.
JEFF: Amy?   Amy, can you hear me?
JEFF: (louder) Amy?
JEFF: Hang on, baby. They're in the house; I can't use the lights. I'm gonna get you out.
JEFF: Fuck!
JEFF: It's not working. If I make any more noise, they'll hear.
JEFF: I'm going to get you out of there, Amy.
JEFF: I love you. (under his breath) Please, God, let her still be alive.
JEFF: (under his breath) Fuck you, asshole.
RED: ... So there I am, it's a howling snow storm, I've got 2000 live chickens that are supposed to be in Denver days ago, and this cop is busting my balls because I haven't got chains...
RED: So what happens but   this big old rooster, damn thing   must've weighed ten pounds,   he reaches out toward that highway   patrolman...
RED: ... just reaches out with his beak, see, and...
JEFF: Give me the key.
RED: (placating) Now hold on, mister. I don't know who you are or what you want --
JEFF: Give me the fucking key!
RED: (a beat) Mister --
JEFF: Don't mister me, you sonofabitch! My wife is locked in a hole in your fucking barn! You don't give me the key, I'll blow your fucking head off!
ARLEEN: (clueless) Warren? What's going on?
JEFF: (to Arleen) (gestures)
DEKE (O.S.): Stick 'em up.
RED: (firm)
DEKE: (voice quavering) My daddy keeps his rifle loaded all the time. He showed me in case I needed to protect Mommy when he's away.
JEFF: I understand that, Deke. I'm not gonna hurt Mommy. But if you pull that trigger, there's a chance I'll still kill your father.
RED: He's lying, Deke. He can't get me. Just pull the trigger.
JEFF: No, Deke, don't listen to him. He's wrong.
RED: Plug him, boy!     Do what I tell you!
RED: That's right, boy.       Do it.   Don't worry about me.
JEFF: Deke, no -- !
AL: Oww -- goddammit, you little shit!
JEFF: Don't fucking move!
JEFF: Deke?   Deke?   Get on your feet!
JEFF: It's okay, kid. Go over there, stand next to your mother. Hurry up.
JEFF: Okay... on your feet.   Now, everybody!
JEFF: Let's go.      Out.
RED: Do like he says, Arleen.      He's crazy.
JEFF: (to Red) Okay. Reach into your pocket and hand the key to your wife.
RED: This ain't gonna work, boy.
JEFF: (jams pistol at him) Do it.
RED: It's okay, Arleen.      Take it.
JEFF: (indicating barn door) Okay, now unlock it.
JEFF: Good.  Now give me the keys. (turning to Deke) Deke, push the door open. Quickly.
JEFF: That's enough, Deke. (gesturing them inside with gun) Let's go. Move it.
JEFF: Deke, I need you to open this.
JEFF: It's okay, Deke. There's a freezer down there with a woman in it. I need you to let her out.
DEKE (O.S.): (voice quavering) I can't see.
RED: (a beat, to Deke) The switch is on the right.
DEKE (O.S.): Dad...
RED: It's all right, son.     Just ignore that stuff.
JEFF: (to Deke) Deke!    You at the freezer?
DEKE (O.S.): Yeah.
JEFF: Okay. You're almost done. Just open it up, let the woman out.
DEKE: She's all tied up with tape.
JEFF: You got that Swiss Army knife your dad gave you?
DEKE (O.S.): Uh-huh.
JEFF: Good man. Use that.   Make sure you don't hurt her.
JEFF: (to Red) You better pray she's all right.
DEKE (O.S.): I got her --
AMY (O.S.): Jeff!!??
JEFF: Amy!!!
AMY (O.S.): I'm almost free!!!
JEFF: Amy, come up here!
AMY: They were going to kill me.
JEFF: I know, baby. It's okay.       They can't hurt you now.
JEFF: (to Red, Arleen, and Al) Okay.    Everybody in the cellar.
JEFF: Do it!
RED: Remember this moment, pretty boy. 'Cause whatever happens, no matter how far you run, I will hunt you down and kill you like a dog.
JEFF: Go to hell.
JEFF: Let's get out of here.
JEFF: Amy, no!    It's not safe --
AMY: (turning)
JEFF: One of them's still loose.      C'mon -- this way!
JEFF: Hello?   Hello?     Anybody home?
JEFF: (shouting) Hello? Anyone home?
JEFF: C'mon, c'mon...
JEFF: (re: keys) Take it. We may need to get out of here -- (into phone, suddenly) Hello! This is Jeff Taylor. I'm reporting an emergency... I don't know the address, the house belongs to a Red Barr -- I mean, Warren something... No, I don't know his name!
AMY: (suddenly hearing something) Jeff --
JEFF: No -- he kidnapped my wife, he's locked in a barn... Jeffrey Taylor. If you contact the police in --
AMY: (panicked) Jeff!
JEFF: Amy?!
JEFF: C'mon!
AMY: Jeff, go!    Go!
AMY: Can't this thing go any faster?!
JEFF: What the fuck?!
JEFF: Get down!
AMY: Jeff!
JEFF: It's glass!   Use the rifle!
BILLY: Sonofabitch!
AMY: Look out!
RED: Sonofabitch --
JEFF: Hang on!
JEFF: You all right?
AMY (O.S.): Jeff...
JEFF: Yeah?
AMY (O.S.): Jeff... I can't get out...
JEFF: What is it?
AMY: (wriggling) It's just... I can't get out...
AMY: I mean I can't get out!
JEFF: C'mon, Amy, push!
JEFF: Push, goddammit!
AMY: (turning, reacting) Jeff!
AMY: (panicked) Jeff?
RED: You think you can come into my life and fuck with me? Nobody fucks with me!
RED: You think you can fuck with me?!
AMY: Oh God... Jeff...
JEFF: C'mon, Amy, it's all you now... you can do it...
AMY: Don't let me go, Jeff...
JEFF: I won't, baby... I won't ever let you go...
JEFF: How's the sheriff?
FBI AGENT: Out of surgery. It looks like he's gonna make it. As for the wife and kid, she's not talking, he's being turned over to Protective Services.
FBI AGENT: We've got I.D. on the dead suspects. Turns out they were all licensed truckers. One of 'em had a rap for check kiting. Otherwise they could've been model citizens.
JEFF: What about the leader?
FBI AGENT: Same thing. His real name's Warren Claney. Three speeding tickets in five years -- apart from that, he's clean as a whistle.
AMY: (dazed) How could they do it? How could they treat it like a... business?
FBI AGENT: (shaking his head)
FBI AGENT (CONT'D): It was simple, efficient and organized. They stayed on the move, spread it over a dozen states. As long as no witnesses survived, it's an untraceable crime. (looking at them) You were just a couple of the lucky ones.
FBI: (re: media)
AMY: Promise me one thing...
JEFF: Name it.
AMY: Next time... we fly.
