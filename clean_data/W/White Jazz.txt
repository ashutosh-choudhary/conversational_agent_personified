WHITE JAZZ: Written by Matthew Michael Carnahan & Joe Carnahan
ME (V.O.): I'm old. And all I have left is the will to remember...
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): ...and the fear I'll forget...
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): I killed innocent men. I betrayed sacred oaths. I reaped profit from horror. The names are dead or too guilty to tell. The events so brutal they beg to be re-told...
ME (V.O.): Lieutenant Dave Klein, Vice Division. LAPD. That's what my face looked like before.
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): Junior Stemmons. A partner I never asked for. The scowl meant to hide a shit-scared kid who'd been teaching evidence classes three months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD lifer who never got past Sergeant.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: We should make our move now.
ME: Mid-fight? Look at the crowd: you wanna be at the center of a riot?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: I don't wanna be here when Noonan and the Feds show up.
ME: We let Sanderline finish this beating, we get his gratitude.                          *
JUNIOR STEMMONS: We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight too-
ME: -relax Junior.
ME: Sanderline, I'm Lieutenant Klein of the LAPD and a real big fan-
JUNIOR STEMMONS: -you're under arrest.
ME: No you're not. Reuben is-
REUBEN RUIZ: -Lieutenant Dave why you arrest-
ME: -for being a ranked fighter who still steals hubcaps. Shut up. (off Ruiz, back to Sanderline) If I was gonna arrest you, I wouldn't have let you finish: and that hook-uppercut combo you got is something special. (from Reuben, beat) Reuben's in custody. But you could be our Guest. Whaddya say?
RING ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentleman...due to circumstances beyond our control, Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this-
ME (V.O.): Welles Noonan, US Attorney. Ivy League Crimefighter. Launching a big boxing probe as a way to begin prying into everything else crooked and corrupt in LA.
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): Unaware the LAPD was walking away with his two big witnesses.
ME: Then you can stop pointing at him.
ME: Hungry Sanderline?
SANDERLINE JOHNSON: If they got shrimp.
ME: (into the phone) Shrimp cocktail. (over to Reuben) You want something Reuben?
REUBEN RUIZ: To know why the fuck I'm here-
JUNIOR STEMMONS: -mind your tone, Shitbird...
REUBEN RUIZ: Shitbird went out with Vaudeville. You get your badge in a cereal box?
ME: You're here because we want you to remember where you live.
SANDERLINE: (grade-school mind) City of Angels.
ME: Excellent Sanderline.
REUBEN RUIZ: What?
ME: You live in LA, Asshole. You do not live in `Federal Government.'
JUNIOR STEMMONS: We get to spend time alone now.
REUBEN RUIZ: Want some perfume?
ME: Stop laughing.
ME (CONT'D): What were you gonna tell Welles Noonan? (watch as he flinches) He has a subpoena with your name on it, Sanderline. Why would someone like you need to talk to the U.S. Attorney?
ME (CONT'D): You're a legbreaker for the Mob. I know the Men that pay you for that will murder you if they hear you're about to talk to the U.S.-
SANDERLINE JOHNSON: -but they don't know...
ME: (beat, small smile) And they don't have to. Now tell me what you were gonna tell Noonan-
SANDERLINE: Bet you they ran outta shrimp.
ME: Yeah.
UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.): The Spook with you?
UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (CONT'D): C'mon, we know he is. We're just trying to be mysterious-
ME: -who's `we?'
UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.): Me and Sam G.
ME (V.O.): G for `Giancana.' I owe him favors for the rest of my life.
UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.): We're out at the place in Palm Springs. You should come out for the weekend.
ME: Tell Sam if I get minute-
UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: -yer gonna have to make a minute for him. Now. See, we think the Spade might testify that Sam owns him and how we was grooming him for a title shot he was gonna tank. A fight everybody woulda' got flush off of, including the Spade.                        * (beat, quieter) Have him look out the window Klein.
ME: Sanderline, you gotta see this...
SANDERLINE JOHNSON: What'm I-
ME (CONT'D): Remember where you live.
ME (V.O.): LA's version of the Young Turks, only meaner.
(MORE): ME (V.O.) (cont'd) Boyce Bradley, Chief of Detectives. Smartest man in town. And one of the richest: Dad was a Real Estate Developer who owned a strip of land that's now known as the Santa Monica Freeway. On either side, Bradley's book-ends: D.A. Bob Gallaudet, not the smartest man in town: `Gas Chamber' Bob cribbed my notes at USC Law. And Tom Bethune, running for a City Council seat that'll decide if this Mexican slum called Chavez Ravine gets bulldozed and renamed `Dodger Stadium.'              *
BRADLEY: Turn it off.
ME: I was pissing. He was jumping.
BRADLEY: `US Attorney Noonan is accusing the Los Angeles Police Department in general, and Lt. David Klein in particular, of murder at worst, gross incompetence at best...'
ME: Noonan had Sanderline scared. After he sang to me he panicked & jumped.
TOM BETHUNE: He did spend a month in Camarillo Mental Hospital last year-
GAS CHAMBER BOB: -and wearing that hotel robe over his clothes makes him look even more looney-bin.
TOM BETHUNE: Plus, Reuben Ruiz recanted. So Noonan's Boxing Probe is dead. He's got nothing-
BRADLEY: -but time, a mandate and new targets...I need to speak to the Lieutenant alone.
BRADLEY (CONT'D): Describe to me your duty, as you understood it, regarding Sanderline Johnson and Reuben Ruiz.
ME: Take both men into custody before Noonan and the Feds could, and find                   * out what they were going to tell-
BRADLEY: -and why did I choose you for this?
ME: Because I'm a Cop with a law degree, and you thought my legal-
BRADLEY: -because your a thug with a law degree. Because I thought by now you'd be so indebted to this Department for not indicting and/or                   * imprisoning you, that diligent, honest discharge of duty would be assured. (beat) And I made a horrible misjudgment.                    *
ME: Bethune and Gallaudet don't think so.
BRADLEY: Bob's happy because he wants to be State Attorney General and his most likely opponent will be Welles Noonan. Tom's happy because Morton Diskant, who's leading their City Council race, is endorsed by Noonan. Thus, they're not seeing the larger play. (with calculated emphasis) Noonan's new target will likely be the LAPD itself.
ME: How do you know that?
BRADLEY: Because that's where I would aim: a subpoenaed Federal witness plummets to his death in the company of two LAPD detectives? (beat) This screams Police Corruption.                      * This offers Noonan the possibility of payback in the form of national headlines.
ME: Johnson did that stint at the Nut House -- leak his file to your friends at the times-
BRADLEY: My friends would be more interested in this. (beat, flipping file open) Coroner's preliminary: white paint chips found embedded in Sanderline Johnson's scalp. A matching dent on the white window sill. I checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your room at about the same time Johnson flew out of it. (beat, proclamation:) It shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the Chicago mob would take precedence over the LAPD.
ME: (fuck drawing this out) Alright. Where's this going?                         * (pull my badge, table it) Gun? Shield? What?
BRADLEY: The appearance of disciplinary measures taken against you are mandated post-Sanderline Johnson,                    * so your suspension will be recorded but sealed...and kept quiet for now-                 *
ME: So if the papers or Noonan come sniffing around-
BRADLEY: -we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal.
ME: But you're not dismissing me.
BRADLEY: Just on paper. (closes the file) Since I misjudged the Cop I thought you were, I'm going to leverage the Cop that you are.
BRADLEY (CONT'D): Morton Diskant is to be removed from the City Council race. The means and methods implemented to that end I will entrust to you.
ME: (throw a thumb at Bethune) You want me to torpedo Diskant so your buddy Bethune can win a City                      * Council seat uncontested-
BRADLEY: -or spend the next month in lock-up                    * before being arraigned on charges                      * of gross misconduct and dereliction                    * of duty. The preamble before you                       * face life in prison for murder.                        *
BRADLEY (CONT'D): Diskant works Saturdays. Late.
ME (V.O.): Bradley's stooge now. A smart play suspending me: a built-in shield                        * for him if things go sideways.
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): Black Buick...five Cars back...feels like a tail...
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): ...or maybe I just need sleep.
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): Press camped out post-Sanderline, looking for quotes to hang me with.                     *
ME (V.O.): Retreat to Meg's. My kid sister and only living family. Mom and Pop died in `51 when their first plane ride became their last.
MEG: (glances from paper to me) I already got the Times inside.
MEG: How much is true?
ME: How many times have I lied to you?
MEG: Zero.
ME: You've always liked your Men mean.
ME: What would Mom and Dad say?
ME: Nothing. That's where I learned it.
MEG: Poor you.
ME: Yeah, pour me...a cup please. Black, no sugar.
ME (CONT'D): Pretty please.
ME (CONT'D): How's work?                                             *
MEG: It's work.
ME: How's Pete?
MEG: More work.
ME (V.O.): Big Pete Bondurant. One-time LA Sheriff. Bounced when he beat-dead a Prisoner who spit at him. A duly impressed Howard Hughes hired him on as his full-time muscle. My Sister's new Hump. My oldest living Friend.
PETE: (turns back at me) You look like Death taking a shit.
MEG: He's still got that MGM-face.
PETE: You're still the only guy who ever traded movie-potential for Police work.
MEG: Because in the movies they make you pull your punches.
ME: Wanna do LAPD a favor tonight?
MEG: No. We're going to the Cocoanut-
PETE: 'Favor' mean `free?'
ME: Means $500 an hour.
MEG: Gimme the phone so I can find another Date-
ME: -you're the only Woman I know who calls Men-
MEG: -you're the only Man I know who doesn't call Women.
PETE: What are we doing?
ME (V.O.): Morton Diskant, a man who preferred migrant workers to million dollar ballparks. Beating Bethune in their City Council Race despite getting outspent 10 to 1. (beat) If he wins, the Dodgers don't get a Stadium, Mexicans get to keep raising chickens two miles from City Hall and Bradley makes sure I                   * burn for Sanderline Johnson.                         *
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): Junior brought along because he begged. Already hip to how many ways you can make money with a badge.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: You got a birthday coming up.
ME: What?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: On the 16th, right? How old?
ME: Old. What are you writing?                          *
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Just notes...about work-
ME: -what `work'?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Mostly compare and contrast stuff. Street work versus textbook-
ME: -chapter 1: don't write shit down. Chapter 2: or other Cops might kill                 * you.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: So you think Noonan will come after you for the Sanderline thing? He seems like a real hard charger.
ME: (the deadest deadpan) I heard he was coming after both of us.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: What?
ME: Indictments. Prison time. Whole nine.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Holy Jesus. Is this true?
ME: I'm seriously thinking about turning Junior...testifying against you.
ME (CONT'D): Here we go.
ME (V.O.): Seen Pete do this a dozen times and every time the same thought:
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): God help me if he ever hits me like that.
ME (V.O.): Junior picked up this Quiff jocking other Fags in a Men's Room. But Quiff was a Law Student who wanted his record kept clean.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: He should suck his dick. Y'know? Put the icing on it.
PETE: What?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Tell me that wouldn't sell it...plus he's a Communist.
ME: We're ruining his career, not his soul. Reload the camera.
MORTON DISKANT: Off me!
ME: Drop out of the City Council race or I send these pictures to the papers.
MORTON DISKANT: I'll fight you rotten-
ME: -and maybe salvage something that's a close cousin to `respect.' But what about your wife and kid getting hold of those pictures?
ME (CONT'D): Take the Quiff home.
QUIFF: My name's Franklin-
ME: -of course it is.
ME (CONT'D): I need a nod from you Morton, let's me know you get it-
DISKANT: -don't say my name...
PETE: He gets it.
ME: Someone from the Times will call for a quote. Whatever your reason for dropping out make it real.
DISKANT: (not looking at us) You eventually lose the ability to reconcile the things you've done to people. That's Hell.
PETE: (pocketing the money) Y'know Hughes has a job you're tailor-made for. I already gave him your-
ME: -no thanks.
PETE: Stop pretending you're not a pig for all this, Klein.
ME: I still got a day job, Pete-
PETE: -tossing more Bantamweights out                       * windows?
ME: The Mutt jumped.
PETE: (laughs small, then:) Not even the people who don't know you believe that. If somebody from the DA's office decides to dig, you could fry Boy-o. Be nice to be in with a billionaire who's got a fleet of planes, fly you outta the country on a moment's notice. (beat) C'mon -- it's a cake legal gig. He                    * just wants you to burn some actress that stopped fucking him.
PETE (CONT'D): Tomorrow. Hughes Aircraft, 7pm                        * It'll be worth it.
ME (CONT'D): Klein-
BRADLEY (O.S.): -you know who Hector Magdalena is?
ME: (as cobwebs clear) ...yeah...Narco's Snitch.
BRADLEY (O.S.): He's missing. His home was broken into at some point within the last hour.
ME: So send Robbery.
BRADLEY (O.C.): The only thing taken was him. Wilshire Station is on-scene. Get over there right now.
ME: Why me?
BRADLEY: Call it penance.
ME: I thought that's what Morton Diskant was-
BRADLEY: -that makes one of us. 1284 South                         * Tremaine.
(MORE): BRADLEY (cont'd) (edge to his voice) This kind of timing makes for disasters, Lieutenant.
ME: Junior. Meet me at 1284 South                         * Tremaine. 20 minutes.
ME (V.O.): Captain Dan Wilhite, Head of the LAPD Narcotics Division. A Michigan Catholic poisoned by 25 years in this desert. Recently divorced despite seven kids with his Ex.
WILHITE: Why are you here?
ME: You smell like bourbon Wilhite-
WILHITE: -fuck off. This is handled. And pull your idiot partner out of there-
ME: -Junior's already here-
WILHITE: -Magdalena was my Snitch, so it's my scene.
ME: Then get Bradley on the horn, so you can relay that order. I'm here on his word. Now, what happened?
WILHITE: (dragged out of him) Guard dogs are dead. Magdalena's missing.
ME: Alright, you better cut out before                      * people start asking why the head of Narco is at a missing persons.
WILHITE: Get a conviction. Grab Tommy and pin this thing fast or you'll have a whole division of disgraced cops at your front door.
ME: What are you talking about Wilhite?
WILHITE: You queered the Fed's   Fight Probe by killing that boxer   and they already had a hard-on   for the LAPD-                   * Bradley sent you down   here as damaged goods...think   about it. Everybody sees what's   coming. (beat, closer) Now close this quick.
ME (V.O.): The God-sized problems I triggered tossing Sanderline take shape: the LAPD's sanctioned dope-pusher vanishes -- that's a pretty juicy                       * spot to stick a new probe.                              *
BIDDIE: (mid-sentence) -shifty...colored...y'know Negros are planning an invasion! After our white women and our water supply-
OFFICER: -where was this Peeper you saw?
BIDDIE: Bushes. Spyin' on Lucille. Seen him                   * there before! He's a black saboteur                   * looking for fertile white wombs. Wanna breed a mulatto master race-                    *
ME: Officer.
ME (CONT'D): Besides bat-shit insanity, is there anything else about her that rings true?
OFFICER: Heard an argument, loud, maybe a minute or two, then silence.
ME: What's this `Peeper' riff she's on?
OFFICER: She saw someone in the bushes earlier. She's reported that kind of thing a dozen other times. She's also reported flying saucers, so...
ME: See if any of the other Neighbors can verify this `Peeper' thing.                       *
JUNIOR STEMMONS: No one touch a thing `til I say.
JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D): Dave-
ME: -Lieutenant Klein. I said `meet me' in twenty minutes' not `go in without me.'
JUNIOR STEMMONS: All I've been doing-
ME: (hard/harsh/low) -is stepping on dicks. You don't know the history, the players or the play.
ME (CONT'D): The Department gave Magdalena a                      * monopoly on the LA dope trade decades ago-
JUNIOR STEMMONS: -what Department?
ME: Us Pollyanna -- LAPD. We bullet- proofed him in exchange for 60% of his profit and a promise he only deal drugs in Darktown and East LA-                  *
JUNIOR STEMMONS: -Black and Mexican-
ME: -give the man a prize. He'd also                     * rat his competition and kill the ones we couldn't convict. Now keep your mouth shut and stay on my hip.
JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *: Fine.                                                *
JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)                   *: Loaded him into a car-
ME: -are all the Magdalena vehicles accounted for?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Except for the Son's: Tommy.                         *
ME (CONT'D): The old lady hear dogs barking?                       * Gunshots?
OFFICER: No, I asked. Just the yelling.
ME: She didn't hear barking...so they were either lousy guard dogs...or they knew the Killer. (point to the wounds) You can't hit something this clean unless you're point blank. He could've been petting them when he fired: look at the burn pattern-                      * (point) Like when you shoot something with a silencer.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: How do you know that?
ME: (stare so he gets it) I've shot things with silencers... And the old lady didn't hear any                      * gunshots.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: You make a family member for it? Tommy?
ME: Maybe...                                              *
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Do you want to issue an APB?
ME: I want to talk to Bradley first. Where are the Mother and Daughter?                   *
ME: It's Klein.
BRADLEY (O.S.): Update.
ME: Hector's gone. Blood that may or may not be his leads out to the                      * garage. Two guard dogs shot dead but no other signs of a struggle. The house is intact.
BRADLEY: Family?
ME: Wife and Daughter are here.
BRADLEY: Describe their state.
ME: Mother Madge aggrieved.                              * (aim my gaze at Lucille) Daughter Lucille...indifferent. The                  * son is persona non grata and a strong early suspect.
BRADLEY: Alright, kick everyone out. Including all police personnel.
ME: How's that?
BRADLEY: Don't question me. Is your partner on hand?
ME: Yeah...                                               *
BRADLEY: Have him bag and seal everything and bring it to Wilshire Station. Find Tommy Magdalena post-haste and take him into custody. No APB's, nothing to alert Noonan and the FBI to this situation.
ME: You want me to-
BRADLEY: -no more information over an open                     * line. I'll be at the Bethune event later on today. Find me there.
ME: I'm giving you on-scene command.                      * Bradley wants everyone removed from the premises and the entire house bagged for evidence and brought to Wilshire Station. (more of a dare) Can you handle this?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Entirely. Where are you going?
ME: To find Tommy Magdalena.
KLEIN (V.O.): Big yawns. Half haze from no sleep. Buzz dispatch. A message from Pete. `Reminder: Hughes aircraft, 7 PM.                      *
ME (V.O.): Another Black Buick. Call it a Fed                     * Tail. Noonan already up my ass.                        * (beat) Let's see if they got guts enough to keep following me South.
ME (V.O.): Dispatch gave me Tommy's make and model: A `32 Ford Deuce with a bent eight. Hot-rodder Tommy liked to goose the cops into giving chase.
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): Noonan tail confirmed: Fed faces                       * glow like Martians this far down Crenshaw.
ME: (flop badge on bar) Get Lester and get me a scotch                        * straight.                                             *
BARTENDER: Sanderline Johnson was my second                      * cousin, Peckerwood. I wouldn't                        * drink that with my gun hand.
ME (V.O.): Lester Lake. One-time velvet voiced crooner. But a dabble in the dope trade cost him a set of slashed vocal cords at the hands of none                      * other than Hector Magdalena.                          *
LESTER LAKE: Lieutenant Dave Klein. Slayer of                      * Sanderline Johnson...y'got stones                     * showing up this far South.                            *
ME: What happened to your face?
LESTER LAKE: (beat) Tommy Mag wanted to make sure I understood something he was saying.
ME: Where is he?
LESTER LAKE: Left an hour ago. Emptied my safe.
ME: Shit. He's wise.
LESTER LAKE: To what? You looking for him?
ME: (at the reefer) Just never got this...
LESTER LAKE: Too white to appreciate good grass.                   *
ME: Hector Magdalena is missing, presumed dead. Tommy is our sole suspect.
LESTER LAKE: Muthafucker -- there is a God. If only I'd known this an hour ago.
ME: Heartbreaker, huh? You let him gig here last night?
LESTER LAKE: I don't let him, he just does. Nails on a chalkboard too. He rushed the stage last week when we had Charlie Mingus drop in for a set. Mingus looked at this half-Mex                   * greaser kid trying to play `Round                     * Midnight,' said that fool couldn't                    * find them keys with a flashlight.'
ME: Tommy's playing days are over.
LESTER LAKE                                 *: Things up off the street. Rumors.                     *
ME                                       *: Like?                                                 *
LESTER LAKE                                 *: Hector had turned her out. Using                      * her the way the Romans used to use                    * their daughters when they did                         * business: Some pussy to sweeten the                   * pot. Rumor was she got picked up in                   * this trick sweep few weeks back.                      *
ME                                          *: Hector was whoring her?                               *
LESTER LAKE                                 *: Hector was an evil Muthafucker.                       *
LESTER LAKE (CONT'D)                        *: ...born with ruthless bones.                          * (sitting up)                                      * And if he really is dead and gone,                    * this game `bout to explode.                           *
ME                                       *: What game?                                            *
LESTER LAKE: Drugs. Especially here in South Central. Hector ran it uncontested. Lotta cats gonna rush in now, try to plant a flag.                                      *
ME: Tommy can't hold the throne?                          *
LESTER LAKE: Tommy couldn't hold his pecker without Hector's help and he knows                    * that. He's gonna bury himself like                    * a tick. Good luck turning him up,                     * he took six or seven grand out the                    * safe tonight.
ME: Eyes and ears for me Lester. He turns up, you get in touch.
LESTER LAKE                                   *: If I don't kill him first.                              *
REPORTER #1: Councilman Bethune, was Mr. Diskant dropping out the only way you could have won this race?
TOM BETHUNE: Not at all. My message of civic advancement manifested in that beautiful blue baseball team was starting to hit home.
REPORTER #3: Anything you'd like to say to future constituents?
TOM BETHUNE: I like my Dodger Dogs with mustard and relish!
ME (V.O.): Fritz Koenig. German born. Former                       * US Spymaster, current Head of the                       * LAPD's Intelligence Division. He                        * and Bradley in the middle of their own Cold War -- each fighting to be the second most important member of                     * the LAPD behind Chief Parker.                           *
KOENIG                              *: These functions aren't normally               * open to Jews.                                 *
ME                                  *: Someone with your accent should               * never be allowed to say `Jew'                 * again.                                        *
KOENIG                              *: That accent allowed me to execute             * many a Nazi.                                  *
ME                                  *: Then we're both Traitors: Ellis               * Island said Grandpa's `Kleinsasser'           * was two syllables too long.                   *
KOENIG: I wouldn't have expected so public a showing after Sanderline Johnson.
ME: He jumped Fritz.
KOENIG: I'm sure he did. And where is your young partner this day?
ME: Working his first big job.
KOENIG: Might the job involve the LAPD's most important missing Wetback, Hector Magdalena?
ME: It does.
KOENIG: I've known Stemmons since the academy. He was a top pupil. A                * peculiar little pain in the ass, but very good with details.
ME: Kid might have some climb in him. (look back at Bradley) Reminds me of another pain in the ass.
KOENIG: I'm puzzled as to why the Bradley would assign you to the Magdalena                     * case when you're neither Homicide nor Robbery...
ME: There's no body, and nothing was taken except Hector.
KOENIG: He does know how to delegate doesn't he...and also I'm sure that poor Negro's nosedive has put you squarely in his debt.
ME: Something like that.                                  *
KOENIG: Keep me abreast will you? Chief Parker is understandably nervous. Situations like these tend to yield grief...and we've the FBI poking                      * around our garden patch.                              *
ME: My ass first Fritz, yours second.
ME (CONT'D): Tommy Magdalena has gone to ground and he's got a war chest to keep him there. The only way we take him quickly is to issue a citywide APB-
BRADLEY                                    *: If he's alive, bring him to me. If he's dead, have him John Doe'd at                    * the morgue until Noonan can be                       * drawn off and this FBI situation                     * sorted out.                                          *
ME: Wilhite. He was operating Hector-
BRADLEY: -don't worry about Dan Wilhite. You deal directly with me. Now go out the back. I don't want the press recognizing you.
ME: You got a light?
WOMAN: (searches my empty hands) You got a cigarette?
WOMAN (CONT'D): If you snap a picture of me, I get to set you on fire. Fair?
ME: It didn't look like you were all that upset with the attention.
WOMAN: Good thing you're not a cop.
ME: (beat) How's that?
WOMAN: Your power of observation leaves lots to be desired.
ME: Thank you.
WOMAN: Don't thank me: these things are bad for you.
ME: You believe everything you read?
WOMAN: You believe anything you read?
ME: (hail-mary) Do you eat Dinner?
WOMAN: No.
ME (V.O.): Make a note: steal Bethune's guest-                     * list, then go door-to-door until                        * you find her again.
ME: This everything from the house?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: ...No.
ME                                            *: And there's reasons. Respect them.                      *
ME (CONT'D)                                  *: Now we need surveillance set up on the house and revolving tails on both Madge and Lucille Magdalena. Their alibi is they were in Santa Barbara when Hector vanished. Find out if that's real. The tails and the stakeout start tonight. (beat) Can you manage this?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Sure, Lieutenant.                                       *
ME (V.O.)                                     *: Police blotter gets me bupkis. Buzz                     * dispatch. Looking for license hits                      * on that `32 Ford Deuce. Nothing.                        * Zoom Darktown again. Zilch. Tommy                       * dug in deep.                                            *
ME: Shit.
ME (V.O.): Howard Hughes. Billionaire germ freak. Boob man. Pete's prime benefactor. Nobody had seen him in years.
(MORE): ME (V.O.) (cont'd) Now he only communicated through a small standing army of lapdog lawyers he kept on staff.
MILTEER: Gregory Milteer. Attorney-at-Law. A pleasure Lt. Klein.
ME: Dave. Sorry I'm late.                                  *
MILTEER: Indeed. (motions to sit) Please.
MILTEER (CONT'D): Thanks for your time on a Sunday.
ME: (a wink for Pete) Where's Mr. Hughes?
MILTEER: Unavailable. Unfortunately. But I've been given full authority to-
ME: -I'm not contagious...if that's what he's worried about.
MILTEER: I don't find that the least bit humorous Lt. Klein.
ME: Yes you do. What's your pitch Mr.                      * Milteer?
MILTEER: An `Actress' named Glenda Bledsoe signed a Service Contract that she's now willfully violating by acting in a Z-grade horror picture presently `shooting' in Griffith Park. Despite entreaties for her to cease participation in this absurdity, she continues to revel in her outlaw status with us. Thus we would like her destroyed.
ME: What makes you think I can do a better job than your people?
MILTEER: Mr. Bondurant says you're one of the smarter people he knows-
ME: -dubious honor if you knew the other people Pete knows. (beat) So you want to catch her in violation of her Service Contract? Something like that?
MILTEER: Exactly. The morality clause in particular as the damage to her reputation would be most devastating: Nymphomaniac, Criminal, Communist...anything along these lines. Once you visit the set of her `Attack of the Atomic Vampires,' you'll see the void that is her character. We haven't a photograph handy, but she's playing the lead female role.         *
ME: I'm happy to help. But my price is $10,000. Not 5.
MILTEER: $10,000 should buy more than help.
ME: For 10 give it any name you want. I'm a salaried employee of LAPD,                      * that means I'll have to find time off hours to do this.
MILTEER: Agreed. Start tonight. Someone's                      * been stealing groceries from our talent domiciles. There's no proof that it's her, but it's her. Peter will provide you addresses.
ME: (faux fey) Thank you Peter.
MILTEER: We look forward to your updates.
ME: Sergeant, pass a message to Stemmons: I want him to meet me at the one-thousand block of South Tremaine tonight at 11 and at some point between now and then, I'll need him to do a preliminary work- up on a woman named Glenda Bledsoe. (beat, check spelling) B-L-E-D-S-O-E. Thanks.
ME (V.O.): Twice in a day doesn't happen. Not in a city like LA. Not like this. (beat) This is fate. This is Cupid firing his whole fucking quiver. Move. Make sure she's real.
DIRECTOR: This is the big Armada landing, so I need everybody's energy up, up up! Where's my Alien Commander?
ME (V.O.): Mickey Cohen: one-time LA crime kingpin and West Coast Mob heavy who now trawls for loose change.
ME (CONT'D): Cecil B. Demoted.
MICKEY COHEN: Where Klein goes tsuris follows. This is what I hate about being down, lip from the likes of you.
ME: If this is `down' I never want to see `out.' How the mighty have fallen.
MICKEY COHEN: (gives it right back) Which one of us are you talking about Klein? Word is the Federal Bureau is all hot and bothered with you Gonif. Hey, I hear J. Edgar schtups his personal assistant and makes him wear ladies hose.
ME: What else are you hearing?
MICKEY COHEN: That this Welles Noonan character has developed quite a crush. That you might want to consider relocating to Dogdick, Delaware.
ME: Been a marked man for years Mick.
MICKEY COHEN: But the bullseye on your back's never been quite so big...if you need a new line of work, I got this faygele leading man needs replacing-
MICKEY COHEN: His agent told me he could play straight.
ME                                          *: His agent lied.                                       *
MICKEY COHEN                                *: You interested?                                       *
ME: No. But I am interested in your                       * leading lady. Bradley sent me. Saw                    * her at the Bethune-
MICKEY COHEN: -not a chance. I'm still trying to play hide the submarine.
ME: You want Chief Bradley angry?
MICKEY COHEN: Ten years ago I could call for that                   * little Pisher's head on a stick. (looks around) And now...
ME: And now the only thing you're putting on sticks are corn dogs. What's her name, Mick?
MICKEY COHEN: Glenda.
ME: (still looking for HER)                           * Why was she there?
MICKEY COHEN: Low-budget strategy: I send Glenda and Rock to any event where there's cameras -- Glenda gets guest-a'- honor treatment everywhere with that shape a' her's...
ME: What she drive?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Coffee's in the kitchen. Let's go over this quick because I'm beat.
DIRECTOR: We're set on a place where we can stash you and Rock. It's in Topanga Canyon, two weeks-
ROCKWELL: (petulant) -two weeks? My body'll fall apart-
GLENDA BLEDSOE: -think of it as 14 days of push-ups- (to the Director) Are you sure about this Sid? Seems shaky. Was this Mickey's idea?
DIRECTOR: And I think it's brilliant! Inspired! The two leads of Mickey Cohen's magnum opus get kidnapped! The press'll eat it up! They'll write about `Gangster Mickey,' the glory days. Couple a' headlines like that and interest in Atomic Vampires will go through the roof! (to Glenda) Who's gonna grab you?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: A charmer I knew in another life...George Ainge.
SID FRIZELL: Is he okay with making it look real-
ROCKWELL: -he can't hit me in the face!                         * That's a deal-breaker!
GLENDA BLEDSOE: He'll be thrilled to knock me around. Plus he's holding something of mine, so we can kill two birds. He'll grab us Tuesday in front of the Pacific Dining Car.                               *
ROCKWELL: What about Hughes?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: What about him? That angle can only help us.
SID FRIZELL: I'm dying to know...was he the Spruce Goose between the sheets?
GLENDA BLEDSOE (O.C.): Hung like a newborn and he called my tits `propellers.'
ME (V.O.): The real howler: fake kidnappings always bomb.
ME (V.O.): Thinking I could tip Milteer off to the kidnap plot and pick up the other half of my payment... (stare at that money) Thinking I should just give the first half back now...'cuz I know right now I'll never hurt her.
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): No sense of time. Exhaustion steals it. A full hour earlier than I told                     * Junior to meet me. I need sleep.                        *
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)                            *: This routine had been done before. That old broad babbling about a Peeper. The only other link to Hector Magdalena's disappearance.                       *
WELLES NOONAN: That's for Sanderline Johnson.
ME: (nod at the Peeper trail)
WELLES NOONAN: -what were you firing at?
ME: The only lead on Magdalena -- we're after the same guy you idiot!
WELLES NOONAN: (to one of the goons) -write that name down: `Magda-LEE- na' or `Magda-LAY-na.' (back to me) No, we were after you. But thanks for the name.
ME (V.O.): Assumed the Feds were smart. Assumed they were ready to stick a new probe into the LAPD's deal with Hector, like Bradley warned, like everyone feared. But they had no                        * clue and I just handed them the whole God damn thing. (beat) Like I said: I need sleep...
ME (CONT'D): First punch you ever thrown Noonan? Your Mom have to teach you how because Dad was the same no-chin, Connecticut Faggot you are?
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): I think I hit the Noonan family dynamic, dead-on.
WELLES NOONAN (O.C.): Drop him.
DERBY #1 (O.C.): You don't want to take him in?
WELLES NOONAN (O.C.): I only want to bring him in when I know he'll never leave.
ME: Coffee?
KOENIG: Ice. Bradley's on his way down.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: That's mine...you needed some                        * mopping up.
ME: Who found me?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: I did. I got there at eleven like you said, right as two black & white's pulled up: you were out                      * cold in a gutter `round the block.                   * (this blithe little grin) Did Noonan knock you out?
ME: He hit me with his car first.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: (a nod to Koenig) The Captain was the only one here at this hour...                                      *
KLEIN: If I need your help later on, can I count on it?
KOENIG: Of course you can.
KOENIG (CONT'D): Chief.
BRADLEY: What are you doing here?
KOENIG: The Lieutenant was thirsty.
BRADLEY: Progress on Magdalena.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: No fingerprints. Clean crime scene. Canvassed the neighborhood. A senile neighbor did report a possible Peeper-
ME: -confirmed Peeper.
BRADLEY: Is that who knocked you out?
ME: Noonan knocked me out.
BRADLEY: (beat) He's having you tailed then...
ME: And he knows the Magdalena name and that I was chasing a suspect -- the                    * Peeper Lucille strips for.                             *
JUNIOR STEMMONS: She knows someone watches?
ME: And who he is. She has to. (back to Bradley) I want access to her juvie sheet or                    * whatever arrest records exist.                         * Rumor was Hector whored her out to                     * dealers he did business with.                          *
BRADLEY: That's immaterial.                                     *
ME                                          *: (as my teeth grit)                                 * It is if you're eliminating her as                     * a suspect-                                             *
BRADLEY                                    *: -did you confirm their alibi?                        *
JUNIOR STEMMONS                            *: I spoke with a Mr. and Mrs. Preston                  * Mott of Santa Barbara, the parents                   * of Madge Magdalena nee Mott and                      * they've confirmed their visit and                    * also corroborated the argument that                  * resulted in them leaving early.                      *
BRADLEY                                    *: (back to me now)                                 * One alteration to my previous orders-
ME                                         *: -previous orders being what? Assign the Cop Noonan blames for his dead boxing probe to the case that's becoming his new crusade?                            *
BRADLEY                                    *: Step out Stemmons.                                   *
BRADLEY (CONT'D)                           *: No direct approach on the mother or                  * the daughter.                                        *
ME: No. Madge was a battered wife and                    * Lucille was a suborned whore. If                     * that's not motive, what is? You                      * want answers then we brace those                     * two hard.
BRADLEY                                    *: If you do so directly, if they're                    * formally questioned then Noonan may                  * find out and go after them with Federal warrants.
ME: Noonan will figure out who and what Hector was sooner or later.                     *
BRADLEY                               *: Yes he will, so we buy time, keep him busy-
ME: -until when?
BRADLEY: Until Tom Bethune votes on the floor of the city council in two days, ratifying the official start of construction on Dodger stadium-
ME: -this is bigger than a fucking ballpark! Hector Magdalena and Narco is the powder-keg, blows the              * whole Department to hell.                       *
BRADLEY: Don't be dramatic, it looks weak. Right now, Noonan needs a pursuit, so I supply him with one-                       *
ME: -me. You want me to draw him off-               *
BRADLEY: -you've been drawing him off. And the more he sees you the less he'll think of anything other than getting you. Now find Tommy and                 * take him alive. Do not let Noonan               * get to him. As a potential major                * case witness against the LAPD,                  * Tommy Magdalena isn't just a powder-            * keg, he's an atom bomb.                         *
ME (V.O.): Bradley has a bigger angle and I'm getting close to it...I just haven't hit home. Yet.                          *
ME: Seltzer will take the blood out.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: I give you the shirt off my back                        * and you bash me!                                        *
ME: When a Superior Officer tells you to leave the room, you leave the                        * fucking room.                                           *
JUNIOR STEMMONS: I made a file on the Bledsoe broad. The one you asked about.
ME: Thanks. But forget it.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: I spent a whole day putting it together and this skirt's got skeletons.
JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D): Shoplifting in Bakersfield at 17. Prostitution arrest at 21. Known associate of a Kern County homicide victim, this convicted pimp named Dwight Gillette, probably her pimp. Stabbed to death in his home, weapon never recovered-
ME: Forget it. Burn it, s'not important now.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Why is it not important?
ME: I need an address on a guy named Ainge, George Ainge-                                    *
JUNIOR STEMMONS: -what about Magdalena?
ME: -after you get the Ainge address,                       * get back to the Magda-
JUNIOR STEMMONS: (picks up Glenda's file) -is Ainge related to this Cunt?
ME: We're partners in name only. You want to stay in the room next time, Junior? Do something to impress me: like finding that address.
ME (V.O.): Noonan replaced the Buick with a                        * Packard and a better Shadow-Man.                        * But I could still spot the tail.                        *
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): This jet-engine urge to see her. Needing it like a junkie does. No logic. Just the push.
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Better looking than the last guy Howard hired. Once you heal. (she recognizes me) Wait a minute. You were there, the other night, the Bethune Party...                     *
ME: Yeah.                                                 *
GLENDA: Mickey told me this `Bent Cop' everybody used to call- (mocking, I love it:) -`The Enforcer' was asking about me. Told me to be careful. So you're LAPD after all...
ME: In theory.
GLENDA BLEDSOE: You're going to arrest me for breaking and entering?
ME: Depends. (nod to groceries) Those Howard's?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Everything's Howard's.
ME: Except you.
GLENDA BLEDSOE: That's why I left.
ME: You just shop here now?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Some of our extras haven't had a vegetable since Truman.
ME: Attack of the Atomic Vampires...
GLENDA BLEDSOE: (smiles, no flinch) We can't all be Audrey Hepburn. Plus it pays bills.
ME: Better than a billionaire does? Go make amends and finish out your service contract Ms. Bledsoe.
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Not if there was just one day left on it.
ME: Why?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: I'm better than that.
ME: You're also better than a starring role in schlock horror flick that'll never see a screen, regardless if it's leading lady gets `kidnapped' or not.                              *
GLENDA BLEDSOE: This isn't the first time you've spied on me.
ME: Nor the second.
GLENDA BLEDSOE: (beat) Well you've got me all giftwrapped, Enforcer-
ME: -Dave. You're on Hughes' bad side Ms. Bledsoe. It's not a bright place to be. So please go-
GLENDA BLEDSOE: -Glenda. (this smile just for me) And tell Howard I'll take my chances with the fake vampires.
ME: Klein. Go ahead...                                      *
DISPATCH: Message from a Lester Lake: asked that you contact him immediately.
ME: Get me Lester. This is Lieutenant Klein, LAPD-
ME (CONT'D): (push this out pronto) -this is LAPD-put Lester on the phone or I'll have your liquor license and after-hours permits yanked inside the hour...
LESTER LAKE: Dave?
ME: Got your message.
LESTER LAKE: Girl that works here, gigs the late sets, the torch stuff Fridays and                 * Saturdays, name of Tilly Hopwell.                 *
ME: I saw her singing the other night.
LESTER LAKE: I think she's been truckin' with Tommy Mag. Got pipes like Ella but she's a junk fiend: caught her                    * mainlining in the ladies room a month back.                                       *
ME: Heroin? Tommy get her hooked?
LESTER LAKE: Dunno, but when he'd get drunk,                   * he'd trade Horse for blowjobs out                 * back a' the club.                                 *
ME: Where's this girl now?                            *
LESTER LAKE: Didn't show up for work last night.               * Called a friend of hers, a waitress that works here too, said she was                 * at Bido Lito's in Hollywood. Said                 * she was `hiding out.'
ME: She actually said `hiding out?'                   *
LESTER LAKE: Then she got off the phone. Fast. If Tilly's running with that demon,               * you gotta get her out of there. She               * got a lot more good in her than not-              *
ME (V.O.): Smart Tommy. Dodging Darktown altogether. Holed up in Hollywood. Hiding in plain sight.
ME (V.O.): Stakeout work. Browse mugs. Match a face out front if I get lucky. Wait till Bido Lito's gets busy before I make my move.
ME (V.O.)                                  *: Tommy's Deuce.                                       *

JUNIOR STEMMONS: Dave? (when I don't respond)                            * Dave!                                                 *

ME                                          *: Good.                                                   *
ME (CONT'D)                                   *: Nothing's going to happen to you...                     *
GLENDA BLEDSOE                                *: I don't know that.                                      *
ME                                            *: I'm not gonna let it.                                   *
ME (CONT'D)                                   *: This is my sister's number. Name is                     * Meg. Call if there are problems.                        *
ME (CONT'D)                                 *: Sleep.
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Impossible.
ME: Me too.
ME (V.O.): Looking for leverage. Figure out Bradley's angle before I fry. Madge and Lucille in custody. No Hector and no Tommy equals No leads. Save one.
ME (V.O.): Dan Wilhite. (beat) Dispatch shot me his temporary address. Some beach flop he fled to after his wife put him out.
ME (V.O.): My first thought, pure panic: Noonan figured the Narco-Magalena connection.
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): But it wasn't a Federal Subpoena. Wilhite was being called to testify by Bob Gallaudet, a man who doesn't piss without Bradley's say-so. (beat) Bradley trying to beat Noonan to the punch and burn the LAPD himself...why?
ME (V.O.): Swap my car for Wilhite's. The former head of the LAPD's Narcotics division dead in the trunk. Call it the leverage I was looking for -- his body can buy me out of bad spot-
ME (V.O.)                                    *: Wilhite was the Peeper. Bent on                        * Lucille, a girl younger than his                       * youngest daughter. Call it grounds for divorce...Call Wilhite Hector Magdalena's murderer...
ME: Bradley trying to bury me too. That subpoena means my fifteen year career with the LAPD just went up in smoke.
ME: Hey-
PETE (O.S.): -Junior's left the fucking planet.
ME: You find him?
PETE: Yeah. I swung by his apartment, car was out front. I scoped it: a sawed- off shotgun in front, canned tuna in the back seat. Think he's living outta that car. After he left, I tried to get inside his place: The front door is triple pad-locked.
ME: (out loud) That knife is in there-
PETE: -the what?
ME: Meet me down the street from his place. You got bolt cutters?
PETE: I'll bring `em.
ME: Thirty minutes.
PETE: Who's car is that?
ME: Long story.
PETE: Junior looked real skeezed this morning. Like he was on a dope jag.
ME: Yeah?
PETE: Sweated up like a stuck pig. And be careful. He was fucking around with his front door before he left. I don't know what he was doing.
ME: Two honks if he shows. Then meet me in the alley, back of his place.
PETE: (handing me bolt-cutters) What about this Bledsoe broad? Milteer has called me twice.
ME: (taking the bolt-cutters) One thing at a time pal.
ME (V.O.): Junior the Insane: You couldn't hide what he was hiding in 1958 LA, and not have it rot your mind.
ME (V.O.): Junior stealing evidence from the Magdalena crime scene.
ME (V.O.): Junior the Climber, trading me up to Noonan. Thinks bootlicking will buy him a Bureau gig.
MY NARRATOR VOICE (V.O.): The safe scared me more than all of it because a safe doesn't get installed overnight...he'd been working on something, planning something...
PETE: Asshole!
ME: Get it open if you can and meet me back at Meg's!
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Stay right here. I'll get it all and come back. Don't move.
ME (V.O.): Call it. Keep going and give up Wilhite's car and the corpse inside, or lay back and deal with Noonan's Buzzcuts.
ME (CONT'D): Civil servants can't afford manicures?
WELLES NOONAN: Breaking and entering, theft, and willful destruction of private property...and I'll add attempted murder to the current first degree murder charge I'm about to file against you.
ME: Proof. If you had it, you wouldn't be fucking around with shitty shakedown routine -- you'd file. Coercion equals confession. So let's see you pound it out of me.
WELLES NOONAN: Where are the files you stole from Sergeant Richard Stemmons.
ME: Junior. Your secret weapon right? I mean, I know J. Edgar is a slanted fuck, but traditionally `vicious fags' don't make the best major case witnesses. (beat, keep pushing) I'm worried those burning dildos may have damaged his credibility.
WELLES NOONAN: Oh I don't need his testimony Klein. I'll just force yours.
WELLES NOONAN: I don't believe you'd turn. Treacherous yes, traitorous no. Tell me where Stemmons' files are.
ME: I'll bring them to you.
WELLES NOONAN: You're not leaving here Klein.
ME: Then like I said: you only get me.
WELLES NOONAN: I'll take it.
ME: I give you the body of Dan Wilhite, head of LAPD's Narcotics Division. Proof of a 20-year criminal collusion between his department and Hector Magdalena and my testimony to link the dots. (beat, make him believe) Then I leave LA for good.
WELLES NOONAN: What happened to Wilhite?
ME: Suicide.
WELLES NOONAN: Like Sanderline Johnson?
WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D): Get me Stemmons files and Wilhite's body by noon tomorrow.
ME: No more tails. I don't want anyone else incriminated.
WELLES NOONAN: Agreed.
ME: (nod to agreement) I get a copy of that?
WELLES NOONAN: After a judge signs it. Now Leave.
WELLES NOONAN (CONT'D): We wait for him to deliver, then we arrest him. You never saw that agreement.
DEPUTY #1: Tail him?
WELLES NOONAN: No. Let him get comfortable...let him believe me.
ME (V.O.): Running out of room, time, both. Trapped between Bradley and Noonan.
PETE: I know what Feds look like -- those were Feds with Junior...
ME: Yeah and they made me leaving the scene. Had to barter out.
PETE: Barter what?
ME: My Testimony. I signed a Federal Witness Agreement.
PETE: You what?
ME: It's bullshit. Noonan's got no intention of honoring it. (beat) They want Stemmons files though. I think Junior's been working angles for awhile, doing his own investigations.
PETE: What did you do to his place? Nice quiet neighborhood one minute, Nagasaki the next.
ME: (point to safe) He had a hand grenade tied to that. (as Pete resumes drilling) How much longer do you need?
PETE: Few more hours. Maybe. Junior didn't skimp on this thing. I gotta bore right through the face plate. (beat) You got some time now, why don't you get Milteer off my back and go work that Bledsoe broad.
ME: You read my mind.
ME: ...tell me if I'm being too rough.
ME: Tell me anything. Tell me everything.
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Where would I start?
ME: Why here?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Why L.A.? (this amazing smile) Why is anybody here? Want the rest of the world to know who they are.
ME: You?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: No...I don't think so. (beat) I just love it. I grew up in Seattle. My aunt, every week, she'd take me to the movies.
GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D)                     *: The idea that you can outlive yourself...that a part of you goes on, long after you're gone. (beat, grins) Sounds silly doesn't it? `Attack of the Atomic Vampires' being-
ME: -your ticket to immortality?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Hughes told me he could get me in for this screen test two years ago. Movie with Gregory Peck at Universal. He thought he was humoring me...until I got it. They offered me the role...there in the room. So Howard, who I'm sure never thought in a million years I'd land that part, makes some phone calls and just like that they don't want me anymore. (beat) Nobody calls now. I can't get in to see any studio casting people. He's ruined me in those circles.
ME: And you still want it-
GLENDA BLEDSOE: -bad enough to put on a silly cheerleading skirt and try to make the most god-awful dialogue sound decent.
ME: Surrounded by winos in werewolf suits. (she laughs, I laugh) That's...dedication.
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Or desperation. Depends on the day.
GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D): I'll get there though. (beat) I'll get there.
ME: Dwight Gillette.
GLENDA BLEDSOE: He asked me to take his `niece and nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard. These beautiful, funny little kids. (tears she doesn't swipe) I dropped them off. Didn't ask any questions -- I believed Dwight. A week later I saw their pictures in the Post Office. A week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near San Pedro. (beat, tears stream) I'll never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought I was part of it. That I knew what was going to happen to them. So I pray to God that he let them look in when I put that knife into Dwight. (beat) But I'll never ask his forgiveness for doing it... (beat, clears her eyes) Why do they call you `Enforcer?'
ME: I've killed 44 men.
ME (CONT'D): 33 for War. 2 for principle. 9 for profit -- mostly. Why did you sign with Hughes, knowing what he was?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: `For profit -- mostly.'
ME: I'm not much good.
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Me neither.
PETE (O.C.): The Knife ain't there. File on top of that middle pile: George Ainge in an `undisclosed locale.'
PETE: Junior documented everything like a fucking Monk. (pulls a file) Like here: `has evidence' you murdered Sanderline Johnson.
(MORE): PETE (cont'd) Kept track of `suspected contract killings' you pulled for the mob.
ME: You been up all night?
PETE: In-case Stemmons made a house-call. He's got every goddamn address of everybody you know... (beat, hard) And you should've told me about the Bledsoe broad.
ME: There's nothing to tell.
PETE: Then call Milteer about this dead Pimp Gillette. I'm no legal mind like you, but I'll bet a murder beef would violate her morals clause quick. (beat, hands phone) Collect the rest of your money.
ME: I don't want it anymore.
PETE: Then give that five grand back.
ME: Junior stole it.
PETE: People are gonna start lining-up to see you bleed, Pal.
KOENIG: (formal-frosty) Your young partner called me at my home, early this morning.
KOENIG (CONT'D): Heavily inebriated. Speaking inarticulately of `betrayal,' & how the LAPD was set to be `blitzed by justice.' Is this the `bind' of which we spoke earlier?
ME: Yeah.
KOENIG: And his apartment -- there was some type of disturbance? A fire?
ME: That's why I needed his address. I was trying to help him before something like this happened. The kid snapped-in-half Fritz. He's literally lost it. (beat, deadpan) He say anything else to you?
KOENIG: Only that he was in possession of materials that might deeply damage Chief Bradley...and yourself.
ME: Like I said Fritz, he's flipped his lid. I don't want to go to Internal Affairs but I'm afraid Junior might've forced just that.
KOENIG: Let me try to locate the lad first Dave. Be a shame to ruin such a young career so soon.
ME: Be careful Fritz. He's dangerous.
ME (V.O.): Fritz Koenig, the best inspector in the LAPD, digging. He'll find Junior and when he does he'll find Ainge...then Glenda...
ME: Where is he?
SECRETARY: (frowns at my informality) Out at the Ravine Lieutenant.
ME (V.O.): Noonan's deadline lapsed ten minutes ago. An official fugitive from justice now.
ME (V.O.): Bradley doing damage control, the forced relocation of the Ravine's immigrants has the press in a feeding frenzy. Reuben Ruiz forced along as the token Mexican mouthpiece.
BRADLEY: -this area has long been rife with crime and venality, but with a brand new Stadium, we can make this horrible blight a bright spot and give our Los Angeles Dodgers the home they deserve. (like Ruiz was an orphan) Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his travails growing up in this horrible slum and why now is the time to `Redeem The Ravine.'
REPORTER #2: Chief Bradley, U.S. Attorney Noonan has promised to deliver surprise witnesses before the Federal Grand jury on-
BRADLEY: -Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous hack politician whose smear campaign against us will fail, for he has grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the Los Angeles Police Department.
BRADLEY: Now if you'll excuse me, I'll leave you with Reuben Ruiz.
ME: Your subpoena hasn't caught up to me yet, Chief...
ME (CONT'D): (hand him Junior's file) Hurwitz Holdings.
ME (CONT'D): You, Bethune, and Gallaudet bought big chunks of Chavez Ravine over the past two years through a shell company called Hurwitz Holdings. (beat, look around) If the Dodgers move here the value of the land booms...you could sell it off for a fortune -- or hang onto it and make even more. The parking lots alone would make you all multi-millionaires.
ME: Word gets out that the three City Officials who were pushing hardest for a Stadium also stood to gain a mint -- might color public opinion. Might color it even more to know that the LAPD's Chief of Detectives was trying to purchase a huge tract of that land from the biggest dope dealer in town.
ME: Hector Magdalena owned ten and half acres of this land. (beat, ram him) You didn't give a shit about solving his disappearance. You were worried that your real estate deal was going south.
(MORE): ME (cont'd) That's why you wanted Tommy found, not because he was a murder suspect or you were concerned that Noonan might tap him as a federal witness...you needed him to finalize your fucking land grab. To sign paperwork in place of his dead Dad. That's why you've got Madge and Lucille in custody now. (beat) Maybe I'll let your subpoena find me now Chief, maybe I'll walk right into it...the tales I could tell.
BRADLEY: How?
ME: Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence teacher. His `excellent ratings' didn't stop him from stealing the Magdalena seizure and doing his own investigation.
BRADLEY: Why would he investigate me?
ME: That was stapled to the cover. (beat) Why would Noonan worry about a Turd like me now...when a high profile target like you can be taken down.
BRADLEY: Where is Stemmons?
ME: No idea. If you haven't spoken to Internal Affairs today, I'm sure they've called. Junior's apartment caught fire. Deeply deviant material inside. Round him up- (my angle) -and anyone he's got with him.
BRADLEY: I'll issue an A.P.B. saying Stemmons is a known deviant targeting kindergarten children.
ME: Now, quid pro quo...you subpoenaed Wilhite too.
BRADLEY: How do y-
ME: -don't worry `how.' Why?
ME (CONT'D): You're going after Narco yourself.
BRADLEY: Exposing the corrupt parts of the LAPD will redeem the whole. I'll prove that Police can police themselves-
ME: -so you show-up Noonan...co-opt his crusade and condemn your own before he can...Jesus Christ can you turn lemons to lemonade.
BRADLEY: No Cop will testify against other Cops. This is why Wilhite has suddenly disappeared.
ME: And how. (beat) So where do we go now Chief?
BRADLEY: (beat, eyes flick again to the files I'm holding...) There are other forces at work here...faces we need to identify. Names we need to know. A third party.
(MORE): BRADLEY (cont'd) Find out who Klein and I'll reinstate you, rescind that subpoena & burn the coroner's report on Sanderline-
ME: -that report is only useful to Noonan now.
BRADLEY: No. It ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that Stemmons file. Which I know you won't do until you figure out how it will best benefit you.
ME (V.O.): A mistake to underestimate me now Chief. The price to keep your secrets is steep...and you're going to pay up. Soon.
SIX-PACK: Something in your trunk smells to high hell Lieutenant.
ME: Dead body.
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): Borrowed time burning fast. My days are done. Only hours remain. Whatever moves I have left...make them now.
PETE: Fucking Christ. You can't keep that car in the garage, the smell's coming into the house.
MEG: Open the windows.
PETE: That's not gonna help.
ME: (still scribbling) Take a couple bottles of bleach, pour it over the trunk.
PETE: What do you got in there?
ME: My foreseeable future.
MEG: I'm going to work.
ME: You taking her?
PETE: (God damn glowering) I'm taking her.
ME (CONT'D): What?
PETE: Hughes.
ME: This is almost over Pete -- I'll give Milteer the five-grand back.
PETE: It's more than that.
ME: I'll square it. It's my thing.
PETE: That you made mine.
ME: I'm sorry.
PETE: Look as bad as I've ever seen you.
ME: Things are as bad as they've ever been...
ME (V.O.): Bradley's Third Party Theory. Everything linked: Wilhite, Magdalena, the Ravine...I've got my own theories...and the one that sticks is the one I pray I'm wrong about.
ME (CONT'D): Klein.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: MOTHERFUCKER -- you better meet me! That Cooze you threw everything away for is still cooked! I got the knife. I got Ainge-
ME: How'd you get this number Junior?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: I got everything on you! AND I'M
ME: -you're a broom-closet Queer. Your career is over.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: The knife for MY file on Bradley. I know you already burned that Whore's but don't think I can't re- do investigations.
ME: You snitch to Noonan, then what?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Fuck Noonan. I got stronger Allies.
ME: Who? The Soviets?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Meet me in one hour with that file, Fern Dell Park-
ME: -Where you used to snag fruits for Vice? A volunteer gig I'm guessing.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Be there with Bradley's file or I scratch your scabby Bitch.
ME: Hey, did the Feds dig your pad?
ME (CONT'D): -I see anybody near there Junior, the deals off and I gift that file to Bradley to fuck you with-
GLENDA BLEDSOE: -Dave?
ME: (big beat) Glenda?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Sorry...you gave me this number...
ME: Jesus...hey...
GLENDA: Who were you talking-
ME: -no, no. It's nothing. I had a phone call, just before yours.
GLENDA: Was it him? The Cop you were telling me about?
ME: I don't want you to worry. I'm handling it. But I might send my friend Pete out there.
GLENDA: You don't think it's safe?
ME: I'd just rather have someone there with you.
GLENDA: I wish you would've woken me up this morning.
ME: I'm better-looking in low light, I didn't want to blow it for myself.
ME (CONT'D): Stay by the phone.
GLENDA: I miss you.
ME: Where's the knife.
ME: Turn your lights off...and just come out and talk to me...Fritz.
ME (V.O.): Third Party Confirmed...I fucking knew it.
KOENIG: Not much with these sub-rosa things...
ME: (a nod to the Packard) I thought it was Noonan tailing me.
KOENIG: Bradley's greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side.
ME (CONT'D): Wilhite ran Magdalena for you, not Narco.
KOENIG: When did you know?
ME: I didn't. I had a feeling. I smelled cover-up all over Hector's disappearance and Wilhite wouldn't have the muscle or the mind-set to kingpin something that big by himself...you knew about Bradley trying to buy him out?
KOENIG: He was offering to exonerate Hector and clear his criminal record. Hector met with Wilhite and I to inform us of his decision...
KOENIG (V.O.): ...to accept Bradley's deal...
KOENIG (V.O.) (CONT'D): ...and although the terms of that deal worked well for him. I found them less than favorable...
KOENIG: Darktown. Chavez Ravine. Hot Spots for Human Vice. These are slums I run & profit from. If these slums suddenly become Stadiums, that profit goes elsewhere...that crime goes elsewhere.
ME: Bradley...you two got greed in common.
ME: You knew about Wilhite and Lucille. That's how you were operating him.
KOENIG: I was aware of his sexual predilections.
ME: (a scowl for Junior) ...and someone else's...
KOENIG: (that great white grin ) We share an eye for human frailty and we're both born blackmailers Dave. (beat) I knew young Stemmons here had a fondness for Lads, stretching back to his days at the academy.
ME: And now you're his only ally. (back at Junior) This sad queer who fell out with cops and flunked out with the Feds. (back to Koenig) So you get this file to battle Bradley with. What's Junior get in return?
JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D): (two inches from my face)
KOENIG: (turning his back) I don't want to watch...I'm sorry it came to this, Dave.
JUNIOR STEMMONS: I hope the Bledsoe whore was worth it...'cuz she's still fucked. For a crooked cop, you think small.
ME (V.O.): Whatever moves I had left...I just made.
KOENIG: This isn't it!
KOENIG: Poorly played Dave...poorly played...
KOENIG: Could I talk you into something? Cut you in on something?
ME: Won't work for me Fritz.
KOENIG: Give me a minute then?
KOENIG: (with a nod) Okay...
BRADLEY: Who?
ME: Fritz Koenig.
BRADLEY: (going pale) Where?
ME: Dead. Along with Wilhite, Junior...and Hector Magdalena.
BRADLEY: Why are you here?
ME: To collect. I have the things you need to destroy Noonan's play. These same things can be used to destroy you.
BRADLEY: Things like?
ME: Stemmons files...and Wilhite's body. He committed suicide after you subpoenaed him.
BRADLEY: This body is in your possession?
ME: And it's what you need to burn Narco to the ground...but if those files and his body were to be given to Noonan and the Feds, with me providing the cherry-on-top testimony of a rogue cop. Well. The word `Cataclysmic' comes to mind.
BRADLEY: What will this cost?
ME: A percentage of your Dodger Stadium stake in perpetuity. You buy my silence for a fourth of Hurwitz Holdings.
BRADLEY: Doubtful.
ME: What'd you expect? A stick-up? Empty your safe? I'm about to disappear for good, and you're gonna fund my new life. You can't counter-punch out of this. Arrest me and I snitch the world. (point to the file) I'll hold that over your head for the rest of your life. Renege on our deal and it won't matter if it's tomorrow or ten years from now...I'll fry you with that file. (at my cracked Hamilton) I'm officially outta time now Chief. Call it.
BRADLEY: Wilhite's body...Bury it.
ME (V.O.): Shaking to see her, touch her...
ME: You go to bed drunk, or just been up all night.
KLEIN: Where's Glenda, is she asle-
ME (V.O.): Seen Pete do this a dozen times and every time the same thought: God help me if he ever hits me like that...
ME (CONT'D): Don't kill me.
MILTEER: The harder you hit him the quicker I say `stop' -- and cease that absurd crying.
GLENDA BLEDSOE: (at Milteer)
MILTEER: -touch me and he dies.
MILTEER (CONT'D): Kick him-kick him-kick him.
MILTEER (CONT'D): (prim, official) -you may stop. (beat, for the room) Howard determined that this was the price for your time together.
MILTEER: You still have a job.
PETE: ...I'm sorry Dave...
ME: I put you here...that Powerhawk-
PETE: -there's a body in the trunk-
ME: -burn it.
PETE: I'm so sorry....
GLENDA: Let me take you to a hospital.
ME: We'd never make it inside.
GLENDA: (big beat) I'm worried.
ME: I'm through the worst of it.
GLENDA: I don't believe you.
GLENDA (CONT'D): (at a whisper) Was I worth this?
ME: Whatever the cost.
GLENDA: Just like that then?
ME: Just like that.
ME (V.O.): My deadline with Noonan: two days old. He and Bradley playing chess by press release.
(MORE): ME (V.O.) (cont'd) Bradley relocates the deaths of Captain Fritz Koenig and Sergeant Richard Stemmons to Chavez Ravine...both given posthumous Medals of Valor. Junior dies a hero after all.
ME (V.O.): Cop-killings clear the way for Bradley's "Redeem The Ravine' mandate. Dodger Stadium construction moves forward. (beat) Captain Dan Wilhite and Hector Magdalena. Missing. APB's issued. Bradley's press fodder cast them as `outlaw cop and drug dealer' who most likely fled to Mexico. Narco under a full-blown, Bradley-led investigation.
BRADLEY (ON SCREEN): ...police unit run amok, who's long tradition of graft, does not extend to other divisions of the LAPD...
ME (V.O.): I haven't loved you long enough to leave it all behind...Too many enemies. Too many ways for you to get hurt. Too close to me...a decision that will haunt me the rest of my days...
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): "My Heaven: the hours I had with you. My Hell: the years ahead, without. Someday I'll see you before you even know I'm looking."
PETE: ...be nice to be in with a billionaire who's got a fleet of planes, fly you outta the country on short notice...
ME (V.O.): Pete's penance beating built me a brand new face...nobody gives me a second glance...not even the cops I recognize.
ME (V.O.): My will to remember. My confession complete. Still not enough. (beat) Post-scripts.
(MORE): ME (V.O.) (cont'd) Me: gringo exile rich off funds from Stadium Parking lots. Meg and Pete: still married. Three boys. Boyce Bradley: Lt. Governor, then a Gubernatorial primary loser to some chump who acted in Chimp movies. Welles Noonan, convicted of jury tampering in `64. Prison suicide in `66. Howard Hughes: a shut-in shitting in coffee-cans at the Vegas Hilton. (beat) George Ainge: body found, murder unsolved. Madge Magdalena, liver failure in `68. Lucille Magdalena: Mother of five.
ME (V.O.) (CONT'D): Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding her name. Only a photograph, yellowed with years-passed, reminding me of everything I never was. (beat) Then a week-old Times at the place I buy coffee. Her picture sees me before I realize she's looking. Her Face eternal-beautiful...
ME (V.O.): ...and it asked me to revoke our time apart, redeem it...tell her anything...tell her everything...
