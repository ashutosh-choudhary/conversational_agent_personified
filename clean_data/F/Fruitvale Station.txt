OSCAR (CONT'D): It's my day off.
KATIE: Oh, okay. (beat) Well, I'm cooking dinner tonight for my friend, before we go to the city. And he really likes fried fish, like southern style. And I maybe lied a bit, and said that I know how to cook like that.
OSCAR: Is he black?
KATIE: What? Who?
OSCAR: Your boyfriend.
KATIE: He's white. But he knows a lot of black people... He's not my boyfriend either...
KATIE (CONT'D): I'm not sure what type of fish he wants. And most of these recipes are different on this site.
GRANDMA BONNIE: (into phone) Hello?

GRANDMA BONNIE: Oh, I thought you were up there playing on the phone.
OSCAR: Naw grandma. But I got this girl here, she wants to fry fish for her boyfriend, but she don't know how. You think you could tell her what she needs to know and everything?

EMI: It's a little nuts right now, holiday and all. But what's up?
OSCAR: I just want... (beat) I need my job back. I need my job back.
EMI: Position's been filled. Take care man.
OSCAR: Look, I was going through some shit, trying to get back on my feet. But I need this job man. I'll show up early every day. You can start me back off with one shift a week or whatever. I'm here. You can work me 40 hours a week and pay me for 20. I'm here.
EMI: Oscar, dude. I hired somebody else. For me to hire you back, that means I have to let someone else go. Someone with no felonies. Who's never showed up late once. I like you man, but I can't do that. I'm sorry. If something else opens up, maybe I'll let you know. Take care of yourself.
KATIE (O.S.): Hey!
OSCAR: You sure you got enough?

OSCAR: C'mon Chantay.
CHANTAY: Hey, gotta do it. Moms understands. But I need you to get her a card and sign it for me.
OSCAR: Aight.
CHANTAY: And Osc, don't get me a fake ass card with white people on it. I want a black card. And not one of those joke cards either.
OSCAR: Aight. I got you.
CHANTAY: Thank you Oscar, love you.

OSCAR (CONT'D): My girls come over last night?
WANDA: We played board games.
OSCAR: "Candyland"?
OSCAR (CONT'D): Yall let her win too, I bet.
WANDA: Of course.
OSCAR: Yall hella weak for that. She gets no easy victories with me around.
OSCAR (CONT'D): What?
WANDA: Do you remember that microwave popcorn you bought a while back?
OSCAR: Yeah, the kettle corn. Hella good.
WANDA: Yes, kettle corn. I popped some of that for us, and I was putting it into a bowl. Tatiana's looking up at me, like she wants something.
OSCAR: C'mon. What she say?
WANDA: She looks up at me and says,"Grandma, do we have any dark butter?"
OSCAR: Dark butter?
WANDA: Yeah, I'm thinking she saw "Food Network" or something. So I say, "what's dark butter sweetheart?" She says, "When Daddy took me to see WALL.E he asked for light butter, so I want to try some dark butter this time."
OSCAR: She is gettin way too smart.
CALE: (just loud enough for Oscar to hear) This moms right here?
CALE (CONT'D): She a snitch to?
OSCAR: What? What the Fuck you say about my Mom bruh?
WANDA: Oscar!
CALE: Fuck you and that bitch.
OSCAR: You tough in here with these guards huh?
CORRECTIONS OFFICER 1: Is there a problem here?
OSCAR: Naw, we good.
CALE: That's my best friend right there.
WANDA: Oscar, Calm down.
WANDA (CONT'D): What happened to your face?
OSCAR: Dark butter huh? She always listening.
OSCAR (CONT'D): She too smart for her own good man. The preschool said we should think about starting her in school early. Phina tell you that?
OSCAR (CONT'D): Yeah, we're gonna put her in private school. I was lookin at St. Bede the other day. It's this other school that starts them off learning Spanish, then it gradually gets them back going on English. It's like a new thing-
WANDA: I'm not coming to see you anymore.
OSCAR: What you mean?
WANDA: I'm not coming here, to these visits anymore. This is the last time.
OSCAR: I know I know I know. This is my last time too. I told you that. I ain't goin down no more.
WANDA: You want to keep putting Sophina through this... go ahead. But Tatiana doesn't deserve this. She didn't have a choice.
OSCAR: She too young to know what's going on right now.
WANDA: I guess that's why she asked me why you love taking your vacations more than being with her.
OSCAR: She aint say that.
WANDA: So I'm the liar now.
OSCAR: Tell her that I love her more than anything in the world. And that I-
WANDA: Tell her yourself. Next time you call. Tell your daughter how much you love her over the phone. Or better yet, just let her come visit you?
OSCAR: I don't want her to see me like this.
WANDA: Like what?
OSCAR: In a box.
WANDA: But this is how you are right now.
OSCAR: I don't want her to be exposed to this.
WANDA: You've already exposed her to it!
OSCAR: So you really not gonna visit me no more? I got four more months!!
OSCAR (CONT'D): (whispering) Ma, this shit aint like Rita. It's crazy in here. I don't know if I can make it without you seeing you that long.
WANDA: I love you Oscar, I'm praying for you, and I'll see you when you get home.
OSCAR: Ma, hold up. Let me get a hug.
OSCAR (CONT'D): Ma!
OSCAR (CONT'D): Ma! Hold up!
CORRECTIONS OFFICER 1: Grant, back in your assigned visiting area.
OSCAR: Get the fuck off me!
OSCAR (CONT'D): Ma!
OSCAR (CONT'D): Get off me! Ma! Ma!

MARCUS: Right on Osc, then bruh.
OSCAR: What flavor did you get.
SOPHINA: Carrot cake.
OSCAR: Why you didn't get ice cream?
SOPHINA: Cause it aint your birthday nigga.
SOPHINA (CONT'D): Can you take me by my grandma's house so I can get changed?
JASON: Yeah. You know it would be hella easier if you just had your stuff at my spot right. When you gonna move in.
SOPHINA: Probably when you stop having trees in the car before we pick up T.
TATIANA: We played "Freeze Tag" today.
OSCAR: Oh yeah?
TATIANA: They couldn't catch me.
OSCAR: You think you're faster than daddy?
OSCAR (CONT'D): What's that right there?
TATIANA: You cheated!
TATIANA: Bisabuella!
MARIANA: Hola Tatiana!
SOPHINA: Grandma, can you watch T tonight? We gonna go to Frisco.
MARIANA: Ask your sister.
SOPHINA: But Rose got hella kids to watch.
MARIANA: But what's the difference between watching six kids, and watching seven?
MARIANA (CONT'D): (to Tatiana) Quieres pasar la noche con sus primos?
MARIANA (CONT'D): (to Oscar) How's work?
OSCAR: You know... it's work.
MARIANA: Hmm.
SOPHINA: (into phone) Alright... We'll be through there at like 10..
SOPHINA (CONT'D): Rose gonna watch T.
SOPHINA (CONT'D): What you think?
OSCAR: (disinterested) It's cool.
SOPHINA: You okay? You been hella weird today.
OSCAR: Naw, I'm smooth. Just a little tired.
SOPHINA: Osc. Wussup?
OSCAR: (to himself) Fuck it. (to Sophina) I lost my job.
SOPHINA: What the fuck you mean? Did they lay you off?
SOPHINA (CONT'D): They doing cutbacks or some shit?
OSCAR: I got fired.
SOPHINA: For what?
OSCAR: Showin up late. Missed a couple days when I had to get some money.
SOPHINA: They told you today?
OSCAR: Keep it real, they fired me two weeks ago.
OSCAR (CONT'D): My bad-
SOPHINA: Don't fucking my bad me Osc! What was you doin when you was pretending to go to work? You know what? I don't even want to know.
OSCAR: I thought I was gonna be able to get my shit back.
SOPHINA: (to herself) You think life a fucking joke... You think you're gonna get fired and then somebody is gona give you thier job back? What world do you live in?
OSCAR: Phina,
SOPHINA: You aint shit, you know that? You lie to me, you lie to your fucking daughter. You don't give a fuck about us.
OSCAR: I didn't have to tell you shit.
SOPHINA: So you would have just kept faking like you were going to work? And would have just been out bustin nocks? And doing whatever else, or WHOEVER else you do while I'm at work?
OSCAR: I thought you wanted the truth... But you ain't trying to hear that.
SOPHINA: I want you to be honest with me. But off top. From the fucking jump. Not after you lie for two weeks get cornered, and don't have a choice. (beat) What did you today. Hmm. I bet you sold that fucking zip.
OSCAR: I dumped it. I'm done with that shit. I'm tired. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Thought I could start fresh today. But that shit aint working out.
SOPHINA: You threw it away?
SOPHINA (CONT'D): You tossed a whole zip of weed. And you don't have a job.
SOPHINA (CONT'D): Oh my God I could slap you right now.
SOPHINA (CONT'D): What are you gonna do?
OSCAR: I don't know? Something legal. Gonna see if my sister can hire me again, while I look. Maybe if I can just not fuck up, for 30 days.. Oprah said that's all it takes to form a habit, right?
SOPHINA: Look at me.
SOPHINA (CONT'D): You really done with that shit?
SOPHINA (CONT'D): You better be. Don't make me have to do this shit alone, again. I don't know if I can.
OSCAR: Happy Birthday!
WANDA: Hey baby. You guys are just in time.
WANDA (CONT'D): Oh my god, you guys got a cake too?
WANDA (CONT'D): Osc. You know all I needed was two, you didn't have to spend so much money.
OSCAR: Don't trip, it wasn't that much.
OSCAR: Who you goin for in the Super Bowl Unc?
CEEPHUS: Steelers.
DARYL: A Raiders fan, cheering for the Steelers.
CEEPHUS: Black uniforms, black players, black coach. Coach even has a black wife. I'm going with the Steelers.
DARYL: You're insane, you know that?
GRANDMA BONNIE: If somebody told me say twenty years ago, that I would live to see it happen, I'd have laughed in their face.
OSCAR: If somebody would have told me that two years ago I would have laughed in their face.
DARYL: And here we are. 2008 and its happened.
CEEPHUS: But I think it's a sign of the times. The country is in bad enough shape for them to hand it over to a black guy. Look, if Bush hadn't have messed the country up so bad. Would he have even had a shot?
DARYL: I think he still would have had a shot.
CEEPHUS: But would he have won though?
WANDA: Well, I'm happy the did win. If the country really is as messed up as you say, I think he's our best chance of fixing it.
SOPHINA: I keep thinking about how much it means for T.
OSCAR: When I was coming up, Teachers used to love to tell me, "You can be the President of the United States."
WANDA: You'd make a great politician. You can talk your way out of anything.
OSCAR: But I'll never forget, in my fourth grade classroom we had this poster. It had all 40 some odd presidents on that thang. And I looked at all they faces. And it was all white dudes. At that point, I realized my teachers was lying to me. (beat) A part of me aint believed what no teacher has said to me since.
DARYL: Now there will be a black face on those posters.
GRANDMA BONNIE: Well let's let him get in there first.
WANDA: I know, I still feel like it's just too good to be true.
CEEPHUS: What's so good about it?
DARYL: A black man, one of us has been elected president, fair and square.
CEEPHUS: But he's not one of us. He wasn't affected by slavery.
WANDA (O.S.): Thanks for your help tonight.
OSCAR: Oh, Come'on Ma, don't mention it. You shouldn't even be doing this.
WANDA: I enjoy washing dishes. It's relaxing.
WANDA (CONT'D): I really enjoyed having you here. (beat) You think it's safe for me to get used to having you around?
OSCAR: I told you. I aint missin no more parties.
WANDA: You guys got plans for tonight?
OSCAR: Yeah, nothing major. Gonna meet up with Cato, Jack, Jason and couple other cats. Head out to the City.
WANDA: You guys gonna go OUT OUT?
OSCAR: Naw. We gonna keep it low key. Probably just catch the fireworks, and then roll around after that.
WANDA: Roll around?
OSCAR: Yeah, just chill, we'll be cool. Sophina's got work in the morning too.
WANDA: You guys gonna be drinking?
OSCAR: I'm sure they will. I'm not gonna be drinking.
WANDA: Why don't you catch BART out there? That way you can drink and hang out, and not have to worry about anything.
OSCAR: Yeah we might catch BART.
WANDA: No traffic either. You know its gonna be crazy. Going and coming back.
OSCAR: Yeah, we might have to do it.
WANDA: Promise me, if you and your friends go, you'll catch the train. (beat) I'm serious.
OSCAR: Okay, I promise.
WANDA: Aight. Don't make me follow you guys to make sure... you remember Prom.
TO CATO:: Let's catch BART out there. Tell everybody to meet at South Hayward Station.
FROM CATO:: Aight bet. We'll see you there in minute.
OSCAR: Alright we out, Birthday Girl. Love you.
WANDA: Love you too, son. And Happy New Year.
OSCAR: (whispering) You don't want to just call it a night?
SOPHINA: (whispering as well) I want to go to the city... It's been a minute since we been out together too.
OSCAR: Alright.
OSCAR: Happy New Year!!!! ARRRGHHHH!!!
KIDS: Uncle Oscar!!!!!
ISSAC: You gonna sleep over uncle Oscar?
LALA: Pleeeaaaase mommy can Uncle Oscar spend the night?
ROSE: C'mon Osc, I just got them ready for bed...
OSCAR: Ok, ok, ok. My bad. Stop you guys. Time out.
ROSE: You guys let your uncle up.

TATIANA: But what about you daddy?
OSCAR: I'll be just fine. I'll tell you what, tomorrow when we wake up, we'll play "Candyland". And then guess what we can do after that?
TATIANA: Go to the park?
OSCAR: Better.
TATIANA: "Toys R Us?"
OSCAR: Better than that.
TATIANA: What?
OSCAR: Chuck e Cheese's.
TATIANA: Really?
OSCAR: I promise. We'll play all the games. And daddy's gonna give you lots of tokens okay?
TATIANA: Okay.
OSCAR: And me and you are gonna eat up all the pizza okay? We're gonna even eat mommy's pizza because she can't have carbs.
TATIANA: What's a carb?
OSCAR: Don't worry about that.
OSCAR (CONT'D): I'm gonna head out now baby, okay?

OSCAR: How'd you get the ring?

PETER: I own a web design company. We do a lot of business with companies in the valley.
OSCAR: Peter? (beat) Oscar.
PETER: Hit me up if you ever need anything man. But about that ring bro, it doesn't matter. If she loves you, any ring'll do.
