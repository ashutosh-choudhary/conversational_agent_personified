FROZEN RIVER: Written by Courtney Hunt
T.J.: We're out of Capt'n Crunch.
RAY: Just give him toast.
T.J.: We got no butter, we got no jelly.
T.J. (CONT'D): What are you doing?
RAY: Listening for the trucks.
T.J.: Are they really coming?
RAY: Yeah.
T.J.: Where's dad?
T.J. (CONT'D): (says it slow) Where's dad?
RAY: I don't know how he found it, T.J.
T.J.: Found what?
T.J. (CONT'D): The money?
RAY: I locked it in my glove compartment.
T.J.: That was stupid.
RAY: Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were coming before the bank opened.
T.J.: Did you tell him you had it?
RAY: Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out.
T.J.: Jesus Christ! The glove compartment!? That's the stupidest place you could have put it.
RAY: He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months. I thought it would be okay!
T.J.: Did he leave anything?
T.J. (CONT'D): What are you gonna do?
RAY: Nothing.
T.J.: You could look for him?
RAY: He could be anywhere.
T.J.: We should look for him.
RAY: Where?
T.J.: The Rez,
RAY: With more than four thousand dollars, he's probably in Atlantic City by now.
T.J.: So let's go, let's find him before he blows it all.
RAY: I can't.
T.J.: What do you mean?
RAY: I just can't do it anymore.
T.J.: But he'll lose it all.
RAY: T.J., we can't make him stop.
T.J.: He stole our money. Call the Troopers.
RAY: It's not stealing if you take it from your family. Anyway, he made some of it, too.
T.J.: So you're just gonna sit there?
RAY: I'm sorry.
T.J.: Another Christmas in the tin crapper.
RICKY: Is it here?
RAY: Hey, little sleepy head.
RICKY: Is it here yet? `Cause I'm ready.
RAY: Wait a sec-
T.J.: (to Ricky) Get down.
RAY: We're all ready for ya'.
VERSAILLES: We'll need the balloon payment to unload.
RAY: We have it, it's just that they called Troy from Titus last night. That's where Troy works. The ski place? And anyway-
VERSAILLES: Have you got the $4,372 dollars or not?
RAY: It was some emergency with the lifts. So he took off without thinking with the money. Completely forgot you were coming. So as soon as he gets back-
VERSAILLES: When's he gonna be back?
RAY: As soon as he can get here, I'll just run it down to you.
VERSAILLES: (ironic smile) This is the second time you've dragged me out here. If you don't come up with it by Christmas, you've lost your fifteen hundred dollar deposit.
RAY: Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at ALL FOR A DOLLAR. They're probably gonna make me a manager after Christmas so I can handle the payments if you just leave the house-
VERSAILLES: Call me when you have the balloon payment.
RAY: I'll call you...
RICKY: Wait, where are they going?
RAY: Listen to me. We'll get them back.
RICKY: But why are they leaving?
RAY: Ricky, I'll get them back. I promise, honey.
RICKY: That's our house!
RAY: We're gonna get it back.
RAY (CONT'D): (to T.J.) You better hurry or you're going to miss the bus. Let's get your clothes on, Ricky.
T.J.: I can get a job you know.
RAY: You're 15, T.J.
T.J.: They won't ask any questions.
RAY: You're finishing school.
T.J.: Come on, you don't think we can live on what you make at All for a Dollar do you?
RAY: You're going to school.
T.J.: I bet I could make more than you do.
RICKY: Where's daddy?
RAY: He'll be back.
T.J.: Aren't we even gonna look for him?
RAY: No! I'm going to work and you're going to school.
T.J.: That's it?
RAY: The only thing that changed is that your dad started gambling again. Everything else is the same.
RICKY: Where did he go?
RAY: He had to take a business trip.
T.J.: Aren't you even gonna look for him?
RAY: And miss a day of work? No. Not again. We just have to live our lives. Now go get your backpack.
RAY (CONT'D): Go on!
RICKY: When is daddy coming home?
RAY: I don't know, Ricky.
T.J.: I can't believe you're not even gonna look for him.
RAY: Where? Where do I look? (He can't answer)
T.J.: The reservation.
RAY: I told you, he could be in Atlantic City by now.
T.J.: (shakes his head) The glove compartment. That's so stupid.
RAY: You're going to school.
RAY (CONT'D): Wait, wait.
RAY (CONT'D): Here. Lunch money.
RAY: (soft) Matt. Could I talk to you?
RAY (CONT'D): I need to come on full-time.
MATT: I see you as a short timer.
RAY: What is that?
MATT: A short timer. Not here for long, not really committed.
RAY: When I started you said it would be six months before I could come on full-time. And that was two years ago.
MATT: It's my opinion.
RAY: Well, I mean, you know, I do show up. Pat's late everyday. She's late now. She's always late.
RAY (CONT'D): See ya' tomorrow.
MOHAWK TEENAGER: Fill it up?
RAY: Just three...uh, no...two seventy one, two, three, four.
MOHAWK TEENAGER: Two seventy four.
RAY: (yells out window) Make that seven seventy four.
RAY (CONT'D): Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here last night?
MOHAWK TEENAGER: Blue Acclaim...no, but I only worked until 9 PM. You can ask inside.
RAY: No, that's okay.
MOHAWK TEENAGER: Did you want to support our Mosquito Lacrosse League. It teaches basic Lacrosse skills to the kids three to five.
MOHAWK TEENAGER (CONT'D): Thanks, anyway. Have a good day.
RAY: Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you thank you...
RAY (CONT'D): You son of a bitch!
TICKET TAKER: Sunrise session is almost over. Next session starts at 10:30.
RAY: I just need to look inside.
TICKER TAKER: It's $5 dollars for admission.
RAY: I don't want to play, I just need to look around for a second.
TICKET TAKER: I'm gonna need the five.
RAY: I'll stand right here at the door. I won't even go inside. I just need to see if my husband's in there.
TICKET TAKER: You still gotta pay admission.
RAY: He's gambling away the money for our house.
TICKET TAKER: What does he look like?
RAY: Long brown hair. Tall. Skinny. Ponytail.
TICKET TAKER: He's not in there.
RAY: Can I just look?
TICKET TAKER: I told you, lady, he's not in there.
RAY: Hey!
RAY: That's my car.
LILA: Huh?
RAY: (points to the Acclaim) What are you doing with my car?
LILA: That? I found it.
RAY: You stole it.
LILA: The keys were in it.
RAY: So you just took it...?
RAY (CONT'D): We'll just see what the troopers say about that.
LILA (O.S.): (From inside camper) Go ahead, they got no jurisdiction here. This is Mohawk territory.
RAY: (knocks with the gun) You can cut the bullshit and give me my keys now.
RAY (CONT'D): (low voice) Troy, are you in there?
RAY (CONT'D): If you're in there you better come out.
RAY (O.S.): (tentative, controlled) Troy? Versales says as long as we get the money in by Christmas we won't lose the deposit. (pause) I think we need to talk about this, so come on out.(Pause) Troy? Troy?
RAY (O.S.): I'm not kidding, honey, come on out.
LILA: (from behind the door) The Tribal police don't like people shooting holes in other people's houses.
RAY: This is New York State so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys!
LILA: This camper belongs to my brother in law. He won't like this.
RAY: (over her shoulder) Then you should quit stealing cars.
LILA: I thought it was abandoned, the guy driving it got on a bus.
RAY: Did you see where the bus was headed?
LILA: New York or Buffalo, I'm not sure.
RAY: (under her breath) Shit!
RAY (CONT'D): I'm not leaving this here.
LILA: (points at the Acclaim) I got a friend who might buy that.
RAY: It's not for sale.
LILA: He'll pay more than it's worth.
LILA (CONT'D): Maybe two thousand.
RAY: Why's that?
LILA: He's always looking for cars with button- release trunks.
LILA (CONT'D): He don't need papers or anything.
RAY: Does he use them to rob banks or something?
LILA: All I know is he pays good for a car like this.
RAY: Where does he live?
LILA: Through the woods. Not far.
RAY: What's in it for you?
LILA: He'll give me something for finding it.
RAY: If you try anything, I'm not afraid to use this.
LILA: Yeah.
LILA: Turn up there.
RAY: Where?
LILA: Where that stump is.
RAY: (nervous) There's no road.
LILA: There's a path.
LILA (CONT'D): It's not far.
LILA: Not too fast. There's ruts.
RAY: I'm not crossing that!
LILA: Don't worry they already put out the Christmas trees. There's no black ice.
RAY: That's Canada.
LILA: No, it's Mohawk land. The Rez is on both sides of the river.
RAY: What about the border patrol?
LILA: There's no border.
RAY: I'm still not crossing that.
LILA: Don't worry, it'll hold a Plymouth. I've seen semis cross it.
LILA (CONT'D): The only other way is the Cornwall bridge and they won't let you take that. (points at the gun).
LILA (CONT'D): They plow it and everything.
RAY: (under her breath) This is so fuckin' stupid.
LILA: Not too fast, there are ruts.
LILA: You gotta pick up some speed to get up the bank.
LILA (CONT'D): It's just on the other side of those trees.
LILA: Honk the horn.
LILA (CONT'D): Just keep your mouth shut.
LILA (CONT'D): Just keep it shut. Okay?
JIMMY: Thunder! SHUT UP!.
JIMMY (CONT'D): Get back under there!
LILA: Hi, Jimmy.
JIMMY: He don't like whites, Lila.
LILA: Sorry.
JIMMY: And your late.
LILA: Sorry.
JIMMY: I shouldn't even be dealing with you.
LILA: I know. Sorry.
LILA: Count it.
RAY: What's going on here?
LILA: Just count it.
LILA (CONT'D): How much is there?
RAY: Twelve hundred.
LILA: (to Ray) Let's go.
RAY: Wait, who the fuck are they?
LILA: Just back up.
RAY: I'm not moving until those people get out of my trunk.
LILA: I'll give you half. Now let's go.
LILA (CONT'D): Let's go!
RAY: I'm not taking them over the border. That's a crime.
LILA: There's no border here. This is free trade between nations.
RAY: This isn't a nation.
LILA: (under her breath) Let's go.
LILA: Why'd your husband leave you?
RAY: Fuck you.
LILA: Maybe he wanted a younger women.
LILA (CONT'D): That's what usually happens.
LILA (CONT'D): I never have to worry about that. My husband is dead. Went down in the river on a run. They never found him. Probably tangled in river weeds.
LILA (CONT'D): You better slow down there are ruts out here. You could get stuck in one.
LILA: Keep going.
RAY: What if the troopers stop us.
LILA: They won't stop you. You're white.
LILA: Pull around back then wait for him to come to the window.
LILA (CONT'D): Roll down your window.
LILA (CONT'D): Count it.
RAY: Twelve hundred.
LILA: Let's go.
LILA: Turn down there.
LILA (CONT'D): Stop here.
LILA (CONT'D): Now open the door.
LILA (CONT'D): Open the door.
LILA (CONT'D): Now get out.
RAY: You can't have my car.
LILA: Get out.
RAY: You can't have my car.
RAY (CONT'D): No!
RAY (CONT'D): (gasps) Fuckin' bitch!
RAY (CONT'D): (calls after her) Little bitch!
RAY: I told you not to use that thing when I'm not here.
T.J.: If I get it working I can sell it.
RAY: I don't care. Don't use that thing when I'm not here!
T.J.: Rentaworld called. They're coming to get the TV if you don't pay by four tomorrow.
T.J. (CONT'D): Did you find him?
RAY: No.
T.J.: Where was the car?
RAY: At the bus stop on the Rez.
T.J.: I bet he went to Atlantic City.
RAY: You don't know that.
T.J.: Yeah, but you could figure it out. Just find out what buses came through last-
RAY: And then what? Chase him across the country. Miss work. No.
T.J.: What happened to your face?
RAY: Nothin'.
T.J.: What, did you get in a fight with somebody?
RAY: It was no big deal.
T.J.: You got in a fight, for real?
RAY: Some Indian chick tried to steal your Dad's car.
T.J.: No way. I say we go back there and kick some Mohawk ass.
RAY: It doesn't matter.
T.J.: Where's your car?
RAY: I'll get it tomorrow.
T.J.: You left it on the rez? That's so stupid.
RAY: I didn't have a tow rope.
T.J.: I still say we go back there and kick some Mohawk ass.
RAY: Forget it T.J. Did you and Ricky eat?
T.J.: That would be kinda miraculous since there's no food in the house.
RAY: There's food.
T.J.: Popcorn and Tang.
MIKE: (In Mohawk) Hi, Lila
LILA: (In Mohawk) Mike.
MIKE: How's life at the Bingo Palace.
LILA: Good. How's business?
MIKE: Oh, you know, okay.
LILA: How much for that one?
MIKE: Come on, Lila.
LILA: What?! I've been saving up.
MIKE: You know what.
LILA: Does Bernie Littlewolf run your whole life?
MIKE: No, but he said not to sell you a car.
LILA: I gotta walk down 37 with the semis kickin' up snow and mud in my hair just to get to the work.
MIKE: For you, all I got are two Chevettes,a Horizon and a Civic.
LILA: I don't like Chevettes.
MIKE: I figured.
LILA: I'll give you a thousand for the Malibu.
MIKE: Nothing with a trunk.
LILA: That thing has been sittin' here for six months.
MIKE: I don't want Bernie in my face. Okay?
LILA: He doesn't have to know.
RICKY: Mommy, I was thinking. What's gonna happen to the tin crapper when we get our new house?
RAY: (half asleep) They're gonna flatten it out and send it to China.
RICKY: Then what?
RAY: They're gonna melt it down and make little toys out if it.
RICKY: Then what?
RAY: They'll send them back here so I can sell them at All for a Dollar.
RICKY: And you can buy me some?
RAY: That's right.
RICKY: Yes!
T.J.: I'm not eatin' that again for dinner.
RAY: We just have to make it to my paycheck on Friday.
T.J.: What about Rentacenter?
RAY: What about them?
T.J.: They said they're coming to get the furniture if they don't get a payment by 4 o'clock.
RAY: You told me that already.
RAY (CONT'D): Here, lunch money.
T.J.: Look I don't see why you won't just let me get a job with Mitch.
RAY: (to T.J.) Who's Mitch.
T.J.: He's got like this whole business he runs.
RAY: He sells pot to kids?
T.J.: No, it's computers. He works on computers.
RAY: You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so forget it.
T.J.: That's so stupid. We're gonna lose the TV while I'm sitting in some Christmas assembly when I could be-
RAY: Your job is looking after your brother. Who's gonna take care of him?
T.J.: (going out the door) I still say we should go back to the rez, get the Horizon and kick some serious butt.
RAY: (low tone) I want my part.
RAY (O.S.): (knocks with the gun) You hear me!
RAY (CONT'D): I want my part.
RAY (CONT'D): I want my part.
LILA: I'll give you the money if you give me the car.
RAY: No way.
LILA: The money's gone.
RAY: Then I wanna get some more of those Chinese.
LILA: It's gonna cost me to get that hole fixed. I froze last night.
RAY: I just need enough for the balloon payment on my doublewide then I'm out of this. I'm no criminal.
LILA: It's not a crime.
RAY: You people can call it what you want to. I just want my double.
LILA: I don't usually work with whites.
RAY: Suit yourself.
LILA: How many bedrooms?
RAY: Three. I got kids.
LILA: How old?
RAY: Five and Fifteen.
LILA: I got a boy. Almost one.
LILA (CONT'D): He lives with my mother-in-law. (after a moment) She stole him from me.
RAY: Stole him?
LILA: Yeah. Right out of the hospital.
RAY: Stole him?
LILA: Tribal police don't get involved in stuff like that.
JIMMY: Bernie was askin' if I'd seen you. I told him no.
LILA: Thanks.
JIMMY: I don't want any trouble with him, Lila.
LILA: Don't worry about it.
JIMMY: This guy's been calling all morning. He's got two up at the Old Casino.
LILA: Okay.
RAY: What's going on?
LILA: We gotta pick them up.
RAY: (hesitates) Where?
LILA: Not far.
RAY: Where's that?
LILA: An old casino through the woods. They used to have gambling there in the bootlegger days.
RAY: What the hell is he doing?
LILA: Keep that thing down.
LILA (CONT'D): Roll down the window and see what he wants.
RAY: What the hell is going on here?
LILA: Just roll it down.
BRUNO: (Quebec-French accent) D'ey don't like de women driver.
LILA: Count it.
RAY: Twelve hundred.
LILA: Open it.
BRUNO: D'is will keep d'em from running.
RAY: Why would they want to run?
LILA: To get away from the snakeheads.
RAY: What's that?
LILA: The snakeheads pay to get them here and then they gotta work off what they owe .
RAY: How much does it cost?
LILA: Forty, fifty thousand. Depends where they're coming from.
RAY: To get here?
LILA: Sometimes they gotta work for years to pay it off.
RAY: (disbelief) To get here? No fuckin' way.
RAY (CONT'D): God those are ripe.
LILA: They always stink.
T.J.: -Hello (in a grown-up voice) Is this Mrs. Irene ThreeRivers? -Mrs. Bonaparte, I have good news.
T.J. (CONT'D): -I'm the business manager of Mr. E.F. ThreeRivers and I have been authorized to inform you that you have inherited money. -Are you still there? -Wait, I don't WANT any money, I want to GIVE you money. -That's right. You have inherited money from his computer fortune. -He was the second richest man next to Bill Gates. -He left you Twenty-six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars.(pause)
-TWENTY-SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND: -Oh no, you have no obligation whatsoever, Mrs. ThreeRivers, just a small processing fee of 29.00 dollars will authorize me to send out your first payment of thirteen-thousand three hundred and seventy five dollars. -You can put it on any major credit card. (pause) Of course, you can always refuse the money. -Sure, I can hold.
RAY: Are they always there?
LILA: Yeah, but they can't stop you unless you give them a reason.
RAY: Have you ever gotten caught?
LILA: Once.
RAY: What happened?
LILA: They gave me the choice of paying a fine or spending three months in jail.
RAY: What did you do?
LILA: I paid the fine. I made the money back in two nights of smuggling. But back then it was cigarettes and everybody did it. Some of the troopers were into it, too.
RAY: Smuggling?
LILA: Yeah. But when they lowered the tax on cigarettes in Canada most people got out of it and the rest switched over to Chinese.
LILA: Count it.
RAY: Right, I know.
LILA: Well, be sure it's right. I don't wanna get stiffed.
RAY: Then why don't you count it?
LILA: I got bad eyes.
RAY: You're welcome.
LILA: What about mine?
RAY: We're even now.
T.J.: My mom told me to give you her credit card number.
RENTACENTER MAN: (weary) We only take cash or money orders.
T.J.: Well, my Mom might be late.
RENTACENTER MAN: She's got three minutes.
RAY: It's okay. I got it right here. (she waves a wad of fifties and twenties). Two fifty five, right?
RICKY: Mommy!
RAY: (to Ricky) Who wants to go the Price Chopper and get some Cap'n Crunch?
RAY: Wanna to go to the Price Chopper?
T.J.: Where'd you get that?
RAY: (a beat) Matt made me an assistant manager.
T.J.: No way.
RAY: Is that so hard to believe?
T.J.: It's been like two years.
RAY: Exactly, and that's why he gave me a bonus.
RAY (CONT'D): Do you wanna go to the Price Chopper or not?
EVELYN: Chance! Chance, get in here before you freeze your ass off.
WEATHER MAN (O.S.): Temps will dip tonight and tomorrow. Expect a Clipper from Northern Ontario to bring 8 to 12 inches of snow and winds gusting 25-45 miles an hour making it feel like minus 30. Area farmers are advised to bring in livestock. More on this after a message.
T.J.: That's what he wants.
RAY: What?
T.J.: For Christmas.
RAY: What is it, again?
T.J.: (recites it quick) Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt Challenge Set.
RAY: -Hot Wheels Tech Trax, what?
T.J.: Air-Stunt-Challenge-Set.
RAY: I got something even better than that.
T.J.: What?
RAY: The double wide. But don't mention it to Ricky, just in case.
T.J.: Yeah, "just in case."
RAY: This time is for real.
RAY'S VOICE: Hi, it's me. leave a message, and maybe I'll call ya back.
RAY: (fake cheerful) Hi....it's me...leave a message and I'll call ya' back.
RAY (CONT'D): (less cheerful, forced) Hey, leave me a message and I'll call ya' back. (under her breath) You son of a bitch.
RAY (CONT'D): Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right now, but if it's you, Troy, please at least tell me you are alive, because the boys are worried about you.
TROY (O.S.): Hey, I just got done here. I made two hours overtime fixing one of the snow- making machines. Pretty cool, huh? I'll be home late. I'm gonna catch that meeting at 7:30. Love you, bye.
BERNIE: Lila. Get up. I got a job for you!
BERNIE (O.S.): Lila! Get up.
BERNIE (CONT'D): They got two people out sick today, so if you get down there you got the job.
LILA: Huh?
BERNIE: Get dressed, I got coffee. Let's go!
LILA: Where is it?
BERNIE: Get in, I'll tell you on the way.
BERNIE: Rita said you quit.
LILA: She fired me.
BERNIE: That's not what she said.
LILA: Well, she should have. I can't see to count the money. I told you that. I come up short half the time.
BERNIE: Then get some glasses.
LILA: They make me carsick.
BERNIE: Gimme a break.
LILA: So where are we going?
BERNIE: The Tribal Council needs someone to answer phones.
LILA: No way!
BERNIE: Why not? You can answer a phone, can't you?
LILA: Not there! Not with them.
BERNIE: (suspicious) What's that?
LILA: I bought it.
BERNIE: From who?
LILA: Some white lady.
LILA (CONT'D): What?
BERNIE: What do you need a car for?
LILA: To get to work. So I don't have to walk in the breakdown lane. Last week I almost got hit by the plow.
BERNIE: You'll live. And you know what I'm talking about.
LILA: It doesn't have a trunk.
LILA (CONT'D): All right, all right! I'll go.
RAY: That's $87.50.
RAY (CONT'D): Sorry. Didn't go through.
RAY (CONT'D): (in a low voice) I can try to put it though again.
CUSTOMER: (yells back at Ray) You got a problem with your machine, lady!
RAY: (rings him up) That'll be three seventy six.
TROOPER: I got exact.
ROSALIE: Do I have any messages?
ROSALIE (CONT'D): I can't read this.
LILA: I think it's a "T.".
ROSALIE: No, I can't read any of it.
LILA: I told Bernie I couldn't see.
LILA (CONT'D): Nevermind. I'll go.
LILA: We gotta get extra fluid.
RAY: I gotta get back before KMART closes.
LILA: What for?
RAY: I got nothing for under the tree.
RAY: Don't you people even take Christmas Eve off?
LILA: Mohawks don't celebrate Christmas.
RAY: You could fool me the way they were all lined up at All for a Dollar today.
LILA: Those are Christians. The converted.
RAY: From what?
LILA: From the Longhouse ways.
RAY: That's awful not to have Santa Claus-- for the kids, I mean.
RICKY: Daddy is gettin' me that for Christmas.
T.J.: What about Santa Claus?
RICKY: He's bringing the new house.
RAY: Wait. They're not Chinese.
LILA: They're "Pakis."
RAY: What does that mean?
LILA: They're from Pakistan.
RAY: Well where's that?
LILA: I don't know. What difference does it make?
RAY: A big difference.
LILA: If we wait much longer we won't be able to get back across the river.
RAY: Look, I'm not driving just anybody across the border.
LILA: Do you want the money or not?
RAY: I wanna know what's in the bag.
RAY (CONT'D): What's in there?
LILA: They don't understand you.
RAY: Well, if they want to come over here so bad, they ought'a take the time to learn English.
RAY (CONT'D): Just hold on a second.
RAY: I'll take that. Lila What are you doing?! Just count the money and let's go.
LILA: If we keeps snowing like this we won't be able to get across the river.
RAY: I just hope these aren't the ones that blow up themselves and everybody with them.
LILA: We don't have time.
LILA: Is that a two or a five?
RAY: (glances down) A five.
RAY (CONT'D): Shit!
LILA: You gotta stop so I can fill up the wiper fluid.
RAY: I'm not stoppin'.
LILA: It's a hundred feet deep out here if we get on black ice
LILA (CONT'D): What are you doing?
RAY: Nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't tell what they might have in there. I'm not gonna be responsible for that.
RAY (CONT'D): -Hi, I'm gonna be a little late.(pause) -I have to work. Is Ricky asleep? -Put him on. (pause) -Ricky listen to me, he's not coming until you go to sleep. (pause)
RAY (CONT'D): -No. Not yet. He's still flyin' over Canada okay? He's not even done with Canada yet, so he's not coming until you get to sleep. Now put your brother on. -I'll be home in a little while, okay? -No, I haven't got it,yet. What's it called again? -Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt whatever, right, right, I'll get it if I can! -I can't promise T.J. -There are more important things to get for Christmas this year. Be home in a little while. Okay, bye.
RAY (CONT'D): (to Lila) You'd think a new house would be enough.
T.J.: (dials the phone) -Hi, is Mitch there? (a long pause)
T.J. (CONT'D): -Hi Mitch. It's T.J. No, T.J. from school. Yeah, man. Right. Uh, I was wondering if you still needed those numbers we were talking about `cause I got one. -How much? -Cool, but the thing is I don't really have any wheels at the moment. -On Moira road off 37. -Yeah, but there's one more thing...(he whispers into the phone inaudibly)...no the air stunt challenge set. -Yeah, exactly. Yeah, man. Thanks a lot. Bye.
T.J. (CONT'D): (to Ricky) Ricky, time to eat.
RICKY: Hey T.J., watch this!
T.J.: Yeah, that's pretty cool. But it's gonna hurt when you sit down.
T.J. (CONT'D): Now unwrap yourself, it's dinner time.
DEALER: (heavy accent) They say there's a bag.
RAY: It was too heavy. We had to unload it.
RAY (CONT'D): What's the matter with her!?
DEALER: She had something in the bag.
RAY: What is she saying!?
DEALER: She says her baby. Her baby was in the bag.
RAY: It didn't feel like there was anything in that bag.
LILA: We gotta go back.
RAY: I can't believe they put their baby in a duffle bag.
LILA: I can't believe you left it out there.
RAY: If you'd let me search it I would never have taken it-
LILA: We gotta go back.
RAY: I know! I know that.
MITCH: That's what you wanted, right?
T.J.: Close enough.
MITCH: Thanks Man, Have a Merry One.
LILA: Look, there. Tracks.
RAY: (squints) Where?
LILA: Up there.
LILA (CONT'D): Slow down, I don't want to run over it. Stop. I think it was here.
RAY'S VOICE: (faintly heard though the phone) Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right now, but if it's you, Troy, please at least tell me you're alive, because the boys are worried about you.
LILA: It's dead.
RAY: Come on!
LILA: It's dead.
RAY: Tap the bottom of his feet.
LILA: Why?
RAY: That's what they did to get Ricky breathing when he was born.
LILA: I don't want to touch it.
RAY: Well, I can't hold it and drive.
LILA: I don't think it matters.
RAY: At least put him next to your body. That will warm him up.
LILA: But it's too late.
RAY: Just do it! We can't give it back to her cold.
RAY: Shit!
LILA: Calm down.
RAY: Oh shit. What do I do?
LILA: Calm down. Just pull over.
RAY: What if he saw us go by before. To Bob's.
LILA: He's got no reason to stop us, unless you give him one, so keep your mouth shut.
RAY: What if he searches the car. What do we say about-
LILA: He won't, just remember you're white.
TROOPER NAPOLI: License and registration?
TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D): Could you step out of the vehicle, ma'am.
RAY: (fakely nice) I wasn't speeding, was I?
TROOPER NAPOLI: Just step out of the car.
RAY: Did I do something?
TROOPER NAPOLI: (suspicious) Ma'am I'm just directing you to step out of the vehicle?
RAY: Okay.
TROOPER NAPOLI: Step around to the back of the vehicle.
TROOPER NAPOLI: See that.
TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D): Your left rear parking light is not illuminated.
RAY: Oh, I didn't know.
TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D): I'm gonna give you a provisional citation. Get this repaired in the next 48 hours and you'll have no problem.
RAY (CONT'D): Thanks.
TROOPER NAPOLI: (he looks into the car) Who's your friend?
RAY: She looks after my kids when I have to work late.
TROOPER NAPOLI: Have an enjoyable Holiday.
RAY: Yeah, you, too.
LILA: (nervous) What did he want?
RAY: Just a blown out tail light.
LILA: That's it?
RAY: Yeah.
RAY: We gotta take it in.
RAY (CONT'D): What is it?
LILA: It's moving.
RAY: What? Are you sure?
LILA: Hello little baby.
RAY: He was just cold.
RAY: We found him.
RAY (CONT'D): (to Lila) Come on. Let's go.
LILA: He was dead.
RAY: He was just cold.
LILA: He was dead.
RAY: Okay, whatever, you brought him back to life.
LILA: That was the Great Spirit, not me.
RAY: All I know is Kmart is closed and I got nothing for under the tree.
RAY (CONT'D): What?
RAY (CONT'D): Look, I don't have time for that. I can't get deep about every little thing. I just have to keep on going. I only need one more run to have enough for my double.
RAY: Here.
RAY (CONT'D): Merry Christmas or whatever.
LILA: Yeah.
RAY: What's that?
T.J.: Hot Wheels.
RAY: Where'd you get it?
T.J.: I called a friend.
RAY: Mitch? Is that the friend you called? It's probably stolen, you know.
T.J.: No, its not.
RAY: Well, I don't want you hanging around him. That kid is bad news.
T.J.: It's not like you were gonna get it.
RAY: Look , Mister, I got more important things to worry about than toys. I'm trying to get our doublewide.
T.J.: Oh, yeah. I forgot.
RAY: Hey, you can lose the attitude. Anyway, Kmart was closed by the time I got off work.
RAY (CONT'D): What's that smell?
T.J.: Popcorn.
RAY: I told you to be careful with the microwave, didn't I?
T.J.: Sorry.
LILA: Bernie!
RICKY: Daddy?
TROOPER NAPOLI: Is there a Ray Eddy here?
RAY: Yes.
TROOPER NAPOLI: Can I speak to you outside for a minute.
RAY: I haven't gotten the light fixed-
TROOPER NAPOLI: It's not about that. I just have a few questions.
RAY: Sure.
TROOPER NAPOLI: This is about the woman who was with you.
RAY: Yes.
TROOPER NAPOLI: How long have you known her?
RAY: Not too long. She looks after my kids.
TROOPER NAPOLI: She's a smuggler.
RAY: Really?
TROOPER NAPOLI: Yes.
RAY: Wow. That's a shock.
TROOPER NAPOLI: Yes, well, there is that element on the Reservation I'm sure you know.
RAY: Yeah, I've heard about it but I didn't know she was involved.
TROOPER NAPOLI: How did you happen to meet her?
RAY: Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I get my gas.
TROOPER NAPOLI: I just thought you should be aware of that. She's known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country.
RAY: Oh my God.
TROOPER NAPOLI: If I were you I'd find a new baby sitter. You don't want her around young kids.
RAY: Absolutely.
TROOPER NAPOLI: Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday.
RAY: Thanks. You, too.
RICKY: Why is the police man here?
T.J.: Shh.
RAY (O.S.): T.J. could you come out here for a minute.
T.J.: What did he want? Did something happen to Dad?
RAY: No.
T.J.: Then what did he want?
RAY: Did you have a fire last night?
T.J.: The pipes froze so I fixed `um.
RAY: You fixed um?
T.J.: Yeah.
RAY: Did you happen to use the blow torch?
RAY (CONT'D): Look at this. We can't live here anymore!
T.J.: It's just a tin crapper.
RAY: No, it was our house.
T.J.: So, we're gettin' a new one, right?
RAY: Jesus, you could have killed yourself and your brother.
T.J.: It's not yours, he gave it to me.
RAY: Put it down.
T.J.: No!
RAY: Put it down.
T.J.: Are you gonna shoot me now, too?
RAY: Put that thing down!
T.J.: Maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his own house. Maybe that's why he left.
RAY: That was an accident.
T.J.: Some accident you shot him in the foot.
RAY: He spent the food money on scratch cards,
T.J.: So, he'd done it before.
RAY: Gimme that thing.
RAY (CONT'D): T.J. come on now.
T.J.: You can't have it. It's mine.
RAY: He was clean for 23 months.
RAY (CONT'D): (chokes back tears) I didn't know how else to keep us together. I mean...he's a good dad when he's not gamblin'.
T.J.: Yeah, awesome dad. Robs us and takes off a week before Christmas.
RAY: I know.
TICKET TAKER: The game's over. They're verifying the last winner.
RAY: That's okay. I still wanna buy a ticket.
TICKET TAKER: I can't sell you one.
RAY: I got money.
TICKET TAKER: Sorry.
RAY: I just want to buy some scratch cards.
TICKET TAKER: Go to Wolf Mart, they sell `um there.
LILA: I quit smuggling.
RAY: (rolls down the window) T.J. set the trailer on fire.
RAY (CONT'D): He didn't mean to, but the pipes froze and he got that damn torch out -- which I told him not to do touch when I wasn't there -- and he tried to thaw them out-
LILA: I got glasses and now I can see up close.
RAY: There's a hole in my bedroom floor. We gotta move.
RAY (CONT'D): I just need one more run to get the double.
RAY (CONT'D): Look you can have the Acclaim. Okay?
LILA: I don't want it.
RAY: What is it then?!
RAY (CONT'D): Are you still mad about that baby? `Cause it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. I mean who puts their kid in a duffle bag?
RAY (CONT'D): You're gonna need a lot of money to take care of a one year old baby.
LILA: I got enough.
RAY: Yeah, but you gotta get him first.
RAY (CONT'D): I'll help you. You can even borrow my gun.
RAY: You should see the inside.
LILA: How many bedrooms?
RAY: Three. And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom.
LILA: Wall to wall carpet?
RAY: Oh yeah. But the best thing is the insulation. The pipes can never freeze.
RAY (CONT'D): I'll be back.
VERSAILLES: ...what I think you'll find with the Commodore -- and you'll be the judge -- is that the vinyl wall covering is perfect for small children. There is never a need to repaint or even touch up-
RAY: I wanna schedule a delivery.
VERSAILLES: (to the couple) Give me just a second.
VERSAILLES (CONT'D): What do you want?
VERSAILLES (CONT'D): Is this all of it?
RAY: It's three thousand but I want it delivered tomorrow.
VERSAILLES: I told you all or nothing.
RAY: Take it as a deposit. All you have to do is show up. If I don't have the rest you keep it.
VERSAILLES: Can't argue with that. You'll have to sign something, though.
LILA: Blow the horn.
JIMMY: Heat wave!
LILA: You got a run for us, Jimmy?
JIMMY: (shakes his head) It's pretty slow after Christmas. Unless you wanna to go off the Rez, there's a guy up in Montreal who's usually got heads.
LILA: How far?
JIMMY: Twenty miles or so. But...you gotta watch out for the Mounties and the Surete. and...this guy deals in ya' know girls.
RAY: Have you ever been there?
LILA: A few times. Have you?
RAY: No, Troy didn't like to travel. He liked to work in his shed, mostly.
LILA: Up there. That's it.
RAY: Can't miss that.
BARTENDER: Oui?
LILA: Bruno.
BRUNO: (French accent) You looking for a job.
LILA: No, Jimmy called-
BRUNO: Oh yeah, Jimmy. Okay.
BARTENDER: (softly) Put your hands up.
BRUNO: Okay we go.
BRUNO (CONT'D): D'is way.
BRUNO: D'at your car?
BRUNO (CONT'D): Open the trunk.
LILA: We need to get paid, first.
BRUNO: Oh, yes.
LILA: You only got six hundred here.
BRUNO: You get the rest at drop off.
LILA: It's six hundred apiece.
BRUNO: That's the deal I make with Jimmy, now you want to change?
LILA: It's twelve hundred.
BRUNO: You want to make a problem?
BRUNO (CONT'D): (annoyed by Ray) ...because you're not making a problem for me. And you're making a problem for them. Let me show you something.
LILA: (to Ray) Let's just go.
RAY: Okay. We'll take them.
LILA: Let's go.
RAY: Just open the trunk.
BRUNO: You must be the brains of the operation.
RAY: Turn around!
RAY (CONT'D): I want the rest.
BRUNO: (cool) I don't have any more.
RAY: (to the Bartender) Go get it.
BRUNO: (to the bartender) Give it to her.
LILA: (from inside the Acclaim) Let's get out of here. I'll give you the rest of the money.
RAY: No. But thanks.
LILA: You're gonna get us all killed.
RAY: Put it there.
BRUNO: (to the bartender) You aren't so smart as you look.
RAY: He shot me.
LILA: You should'a just taken the money from me?
RAY: (blood streams down her face) I'm tired of people stealing from me.    Is it all there?
LILA: We gotta get outta here, first.
RAY: Just COUNT IT and make sure it's all there!
RAY (CONT'D): Is it there?
LILA: It's all there.
RAY: Good.
LILA: Slow down a little. We gotta keep it under the speed limit.
LILA (CONT'D): We gotta get off this road.
LILA (CONT'D): Slow down!
RAY: I can't.
LILA: We gotta get off this road!
RAY: How much farther to the reservation?
LILA: Just up at the tree line.
RAY: What the hell? We're on the reservation.
LILA: They can't arrest us but if they catch us they'll take the money.
RAY: Shit!
LILA: That ice is black out here.
RAY: Will it hold us?
LILA: I don't know.
DISPATCHER: ...the Quebec Surete in pursuit of a vehicle with New York State plates, identified as a blue Plymouth Acclaim and the suspects are two women, suspected to be carrying illegals...
LILA: We gotta crawl out the window.
JIMMY: Hi Mom.
VELMA: Jimmy, I told you not to bring no more half frozen people in here off the river.
JIMMY: (ignores her) We just need to borrow your oven, Mom.
VELMA: I don't see how I can get any baking done. I'm supposed to be baking 200 doughnuts for pee wee Lacrosse and now I have people bleeding and dripping all over my kitchen.
VELMA (CONT'D): (to Ray) Sit down, I can't reach up that high.
VELMA (CONT'D): (to Ray) Looks like somebody tried to blow your brains out.
VELMA (CONT'D): Get outta here, Jimmy. They gotta strip down. (to girls) Gimme those jackets.
VELMA (CONT'D): Somebody's been beatin' up on you.
VELMA (CONT'D): You, too.
THREE RIVERS: -Good, good Mike. What can I do for you? - -You say non-native smugglers? -A white woman? On the Rez? -I'll look into it and give you a call back. Sure thing. (pause) -I'll take your request to the Tribal Council and give you a call back. -No problem, Mike. You bet.
THREE RIVERS: Hi, Rosalie.
ROSALIE: (puts on her glasses) Billy.
THREE RIVERS: We have a situation with a couple smugglers. They got chased by the Quebec police and crossed the river but their car went in and now the troopers know they're on the Rez.
ROSALIE: Who is it?
THREE RIVERS: Lila Littlewolf and some white woman.
ROSALIE: What do the troopers want?
THREE RIVERS: A surrender of the two illegals and the Non-Native smuggler. They need an example here.
ROSALIE: Do you know where they are?
THREE RIVERS: Probably over at Velma's.
ROSALIE: (to the other Chiefs) What do you think?
BARBARA: Turn them in.
ROSALIE: What about Lila Littlewolf?
BERNIE: We got our own court system.
ROSALIE: We don't charge people with smuggling.
BARBARA: Maybe we should.
BERNIE: If we did, we'd have to arrest half the people on the Rez.
BARBARA: We can expel her.
BERNIE: You can't start throwin' Mohawks off the Rez, Rosalie. There's only, what, six thousand of us as it is.
ROSALIE: She makes the Mohawk people look bad.
BERNIE: But she has a Mohawk son.
ROSALIE: She cost us a Mohawk son.
BERNIE: Jake was a big boy. He knew what he was doin'
ROSALIE: She'll never be anything but a smuggler.
BERNIE: We've had smuggling on the Rez since Al Capone.
ROSALIE: Then we'll take a vote.
JIMMY: Hi, Billy.
THREE RIVERS: Velma, seen any smugglers tonight?
JIMMY: Come on, Billy, you never bothered with smugglers before.
THREE RIVERS: Rosalie is worried people are gonna think the Mohawks let in terrorists. Plus, I got the Troopers on my back. They want the illegals and they say there's some white lady with them too. Is that true, Jimmy?
THREE RIVERS (CONT'D): You got white women doing it now? Jesus. (after a moment) Well, if you see any, let me know.
RAY: I gotta go.
RAY (CONT'D): No. You stay here.
BERNIE: Hi, Lila.
LILA: Hi Bernie.
BERNIE: You're in a lot of trouble.
BERNIE (CONT'D): The council voted to expel you.
LILA: Expel me?
BERNIE: For five years. You can appeal, but you'll never be able to change Rosalie's mind.
LILA: They can't do that.
BERNIE: They'll make your life miserable if you try to stay.
LILA: They've already done that.
BERNIE: Believe me, it could get even worse.
RAY: I thought this was all legal on the reservation.
RAY (CONT'D): (to Lila) Look, I gotta get home.
BERNIE: If she leaves, they'll turn you in Lila. The troopers want somebody.
RAY: But, she's a Mohawk.
BERNIE: The Chiefs want her out, so there's nothing standing between her and the troopers.
RAY: Listen, my kids got no one but me.
BERNIE: If you leave she won't see her son again.
LILA: Let her go.
BERNIE: Lila, you're giving up on him and he's only one year old.
LILA: (to Ray) Just go.
RAY: At least you got family to take care of him, ya' know?
LILA: He might be better off.
BERNIE: Jake wouldn't agree with that.
LILA: It was all for a new crib. I wanted the baby to have a pretty new crib, not some handmedown. And he wouldn't let me go alone. (laughs) I was too fat to get behind the steering wheel.
BERNIE: He wanted to keep you and little Jake safe.
RAY: It's just a few months, right?
RAY (CONT'D): I got baby stuff in the shed.
RAY (CONT'D): Get a good used single wide with insulation. Insulation is the key thing. Versailles will give you a hard time, but that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of months. Ricky's allergic to penicillin.(a moment) And you can't feed `em Pringles all the time. Okay?
RAY (CONT'D): Okay?
RAY (CONT'D): But you gotta get there quick, before the police, `cause T.J. will get scared. I don't want him to get scared, you know.
LILA: Okay.
RAY: And don't let him jerk you around. Versailles, I mean. (to Bernie) Go with her. Okay?
BERNIE: Sure.
RICKY: Can I have more corn?
LILA: (shows her empty hands) Sorry, Thunder, I got nothing for you.
EVELYN: What do you want?
LILA: I need his coat.
LILA (CONT'D): Where's his coat?
EVELYN: You can't have him.
LILA: Say goodbye to your Dudah.
BERNIE: She's gonna kill me for taking this out of her car.
RAY: How long is it for me. You know if I confess?
TROOPER NAPOLI: As long as they're not on a watch list. Four months.
TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D): I don't think you have much to worry about judging from the look of them, probably brought here to work in the sex trade.
RAY: Will they get sent back?
TROOPER NAPOLI: Not necessarily. They can apply for asylum.
RAY: Can I have a cigarette?
TROOPER NAPOLI: Is there somebody I can call for you? To take care of your children.
RAY: I got somebody.
TROOPER NAPOLI: A relative.
RAY: A friend.
RAY (CONT'D): But I need to call my kid.
T.J. (O.S.): Hello. Hi, Mom.
T.J. (CONT'D): -Mom are you there? What's wrong? -What kinda trouble? -What did you do? -A smuggler!? Holy shit! -Are you in jail? -But are you're going to jail!?
T.J. (CONT'D): -Yeah, okay. What does that mean? But why? I can take care of him, I do it all the time. But I don't see why we need-?
T.J. (CONT'D): -Who? (pause) A baby? No way. -Yeah I know where the stuff is. It's in the shed, but that's so stupid!.
T.J. (CONT'D): (holding phone) -Yeah, I'm here. Somebody's at the door.
T.J. (CONT'D): -Okay. Bye.
T.J. (CONT'D): (to Ricky ) You're gonna have to get the little pieces up high -- or he'll eat them.
RAY (O.S.): (her voice message plays) Hi, (happy) You've reached Ray. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you just as soon as I can.
TROY (O.S.): (sad sack voice) Ray, are you gonna pick up or not?
TROY (O.S.) (CONT'D): (pause) I need you to send me some money so I can get home. I'm stuck here. I could already be back at work by now.(pause) Please Ray, I'm at the YMCA in Tampa. I love you. I miss you. Please call me here. Seriously. And tell the boys-
