HENRY'S CRIME: Written by Sacha Gervasi
A CAR: Approaches. Henry straightens, slides open his window. But the CAR veers over to the automated EZ-PASS LANE... Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the horizon again. It's cloudy out there.
A CLOCK: flips to 6:00.
HENRY: Smells good.
DEBBIE: Sit down. He sits. She smiles. Starts buttering the toast.
HENRY: Wow. Thanks. He digs in.
DEBBIE: How was your night?
HENRY: Good. How was yours? She's still buttering the toast. Carefully.
DEBBIE: Good. She sets it down.
HENRY: This is great. She sits down next to him. Watches him eat.
HENRY (CONT'D): Your shift's at eight thirty? She nods.
HENRY (CONT'D): You not eating?
DEBBIE: I already did. He takes another bite.
HENRY: You okay?
DEBBIE: Are you coming with me to Cindy and Bill's on Saturday?
HENRY: Sure. What time? Pause.
DEBBIE: For the baby shower.
HENRY: Right. She just stares at him...
DEBBIE: Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and Bill's.
HENRY: What?
DEBBIE: I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come here.
HENRY: Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime. Pause.
DEBBIE: Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us? Henry stops eating.
HENRY: You're talking about kids.
DEBBIE: Of course I am.
HENRY: Okay.
DEBBIE: 'Okay' you want kids? Pause.
HENRY: I love kids. He looks down, resumes eating. A beat.
DEBBIE: Henry? He looks up again.
DEBBIE (CONT'D): Do you still love me? He's still as a stone.
HENRY: Of course I do. She looks at him.
DEBBIE: Because I know you did once. A very long pause. Henry doesn't do anything now. She's crestfallen.
DEBBIE (CONT'D): What happened, Henry? He just sits.
EDDIE: Henry Torne.
HENRY: Eddie Vibes.
EDDIE: So how you doin', man?
HENRY: I'm okay. What's going on?
EDDIE: Listen, I got a man down here.
EDDIE (CONT'D): Mind if we come in for a second?
DEBBIE: He's hot. He starts to retch.
JOE: (holding it in) I'm sorry.
DEBBIE: You better come with me. Eddie glances at Henry as Debbie leads him expertly toward the bathroom.
EDDIE: Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels.
HENRY: Yeah.
EDDIE: So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's our first baseman. And he's not exactly game-ready as you can see...
HENRY: Yeah. Eddie stares at him. Smiles.
EDDIE: So, what do you say?
HENRY: What do I say what?
EDDIE: You feel like playing a little ball? Filling in for Joe?
HENRY: It's November.
EDDIE: Yeah. They keep the field in perfect shape.
HENRY: Oh. Beat.
EDDIE: So what do you say? Henry looks around the room. For a moment he watches Debbie with Joe in the bathroom, the door half open. She's tending to him, caring for him... Debbie looks up. Sees Henry staring at her.
EDDIE (CONT'D): Henry?
EDDIE: Appreciate you driving, man.
HENRY: So where's this game?
EDDIE: Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes.
EDDIE: Pull up right over here. We gotta grab some beer money at that ATM. The car pulls up to a row of stores including the FIRST
EDDIE (CONT'D): Just hang tight. We'll be right back. Eddie and the guys get out. Henry notes this is strange.
BEHIND HIM: In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two guys slipping on SKI MASKS...
HENRY'S POV: A PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his store and enters. He says good morning to all the animals. It's a strange one man show.
A GUN: Is pointing at him through the windshield.
FRANK (CONT'D): Freeze! Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel. Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the distant sound of BLARING SIRENS grows louder. Holding on Henry's stunned expression...
DETECTIVE: Henry, we know this wasn't your deal.
DETECTIVE (CONT'D): All you have to do is give me those names. And you can go home. It's that simple. Henry's still silent.
DETECTIVE (CONT'D): Come on. Why are you sticking up for these people? They're not your friends. You've got a wife. You've got a job... don't you care?
(THEN): All you have to do is say something. Henry looks up at him, making eye contact for the first time.
JUDGE: ...the court sentences Henry Torne to four years in prison for the crime of Felony 1st Degree Armed Robbery.
HENRY: Huh.
MAX: I said what are you in for? A beat.
HENRY: Bank robbery. MAX (60s) pulls up his pants, flushes the TOILET.
MAX: Good. Clean. Simple. I like it. Henry just watches.
HENRY: But I didn't do it. Max smiles. Goes to the sink. Washes his hands.
MAX: Ah. Mistaken identity. A perennial favorite. Identities are just constructs, anyway. They're mistaken all the time. He dries his hands. Presents one of them to Henry.
MAX (CONT'D): I'm Max.
HENRY: Henry.
MAX: Go on. Make yourself at home. Henry sits down on his bed.
HENRY: So...what are you in for?
MAX: Life. A beat. It's starting to hit Henry...
MAX (CONT'D): Don't worry, you'll get used to it.
MAX: Hurry up. We gotta go. Henry's disoriented.
MAX (CONT'D): Breakfast. A GUARD, seeing Henry still in his bunk, bangs his baton against the bars of the cell.
MAX: `Monday is whole wheat bun-day.' Henry's lost in thought...
MAX (CONT'D): What are you thinking about?
HENRY: Nothing.
MAX: You're thinking something. Let me guess. You're thinking, `How did I get here?' Henry puts out his tray.
MAX (CONT'D): How do you think any of us got here?
HENRY: I'm not sure.
MAX: I'll tell you how. Because we committed crimes. But we committed to the wrong thing. You see that was our mistake. We didn't fulfill our potential, we got angry and we took it out on other people. A bald, TATTOOED GANG-BANGER walks right past them to a table.
MAX (CONT'D): See him?
MAX (CONT'D): Hector. He wanted to be a doctor. He could've been, but he chose not to fulfil his potential, he chose not to commit to his dream. And now look at him.
(THEN): Bad choices, see. Henry does.
MAX (CONT'D): By the way, I recommend the potatoes.
MAX: That's the real crime, Henry. Not committing to your dream. They begin to eat.
MAX (CONT'D): So what's yours?
HENRY: My what?
MAX: Your dream.
HENRY: Not sure I ever had one.
MAX: Never had a dream? What kind of a life is that?
HENRY: I don't know. A pretty good one?
MAX: Henry, you're in jail. Henry thinks about that. Puts a piece of potato in his mouth.
MAX: But here's the good news. We got all this time to do. And time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it.
MAX (CONT'D): Knowledge. Self respect. Forgiveness. And in your case, you can figure out what your dream is. Max takes his arm :
MAX (CONT'D): Your dream is your truth is your destiny. Henry looks at him.
HENRY: I told you. I'm here by mistake. Max shoots a look back at him.
MAX: There are no mistakes. Max suddenly glimpses some activity over Henry's shoulder.
HENRY: What? Several convicts are making their way towards them... He pulls Henry close, his tone suddenly intense :
MAX: But you're going to have to fight for that dream, Henry.
HENRY: I am.
MAX: You're at a crossroads now. There are going to be tests!
HENRY: What tests?
MAX: This is your moment. Whatever you do now defines you. Go get em! Henry gets up : CHARGES the inmates, arms swinging, taking several down. He gives it everything he's got. They pile into him, pummeling him. Henry just keeps fighting...but it's hopeless. GUARDS rush in. Max watches.
MAX: You did good, Henry.
HENRY: I don't feel good.
MAX: You're doing better than you feel. Henry touches his swollen eye. It stings.
MAX (CONT'D): Go to sleep, Henry.
(BEAT): Sleep is for the blessed.
DEBBIE: Hi.
HENRY: Hi. You look beautiful.
DEBBIE: Thank you. How are you doing?
HENRY: I'm okay. How about you?
DEBBIE: I'm good. A beat.
DEBBIE (CONT'D): Listen, Henry. I have something I need to talk to you about.
HENRY: Okay.
DEBBIE: I fell in love. Henry takes that in.
HENRY: Oh. Pause.
DEBBIE: I just...I mean it just happened. Pause.
HENRY: Okay. Wow...
DEBBIE: I'm sorry, Henry.
HENRY: It's alright.
DEBBIE: You're not mad? He thinks.
HENRY: No. He looks at her.
HENRY (CONT'D): I want you to be happy.
DEBBIE: You too, Henry. No one moves.
MAX: I ever tell you I was married? Henry turns to him.
MAX (CONT'D): I mean nearly. I had a lovely correspondence going with Jocelyn Steinberg in Utica. Problem was when she finally came on visitor's day she said I was too short. Henry thinks.
HENRY: Books and covers.
MAX: Right. Books and covers.
MAX: Clean as a whistle.
FINK: (checking himself out) Max, I think you missed your calling.
MAX: Thank you.
(THEN): Who do we got next, Henry? Henry checks the schedule by his side, calls out a name.
HENRY: Hector. You're up. Standing just outside, A GUARD watches the make-shift barbershop carefully. Hector takes his seat. Max wraps a sheet around his neck.
HECTOR: Hey, Max. When are you up for parole?
MAX: October.
HECTOR: Show us what you did for the board last time.
MAX: I'm working. The other INMATES egg him on.
OTHER INMATES: Show us!
MAX: Leave me alone.
INMATES: Come on! Show us. Max finally puts his clippers down.
MAX: All right, so I'm sitting there, and the head of the board asks me what I'm going to do if they let me out this time. And, so... Max's face starts to shudder...his shoulders jerking back a little bit...
MAX (CONT'D): I get this twitch! and then I give him my answer: "I'm gonna break in your house, set your dog on fire, eat all your food, go on a naked rampage through your garden, dance in the streets of your l'il hometown like a crazed harpee, hurl myself headlong flaming through the ethereal sky like God's blackest angel and explode like a goddamn heavenly fireball! Eyes ablaze and face beetroot red and twitching like a mad man...
MAX (CONT'D): Oh, yeah. You don't want ME. You don't want THIS. Not out THERE. The inmates look slightly scared. Max casually picks up his clippers and smiles :
MAX (CONT'D): Believe me, I'm not going anywhere. They crack up. A beat.
HECTOR: Hey, White Shadow. When's your review coming up?
HENRY: Next month.
HECTOR: You gonna do the twitch like your cellie?
HENRY: Nope.
HECTOR: What, you don't like it around here?
MAX: Everyone knows Henry's innocent. Laughter.
(TO HENRY): The board don't like it when you deny the crime.
HENRY: I didn't do the crime.
HECTOR: Hey, but you got the time...so you may as well have done it. Everyone laughs.
MAX: I like it! `You got the time, so you may as well have done the crime!' Everyone laughs again.
MAX (CONT'D): Now that's funny, Henry.
HENRY: Yeah, you're right. Henry ponders.
HENRY: You know you never did tell me what your dream was, Max.
MAX: I'm living it.
HENRY: Really?
MAX: Sure! It's easier to live in here. You don't have to do anything. You just show up. In fact they even do that for you. I'm living the life.
HENRY: This place is horrible, Max. Max thinks, lathering his hair...
MAX: So why didn't you just say something?
HENRY: When?
MAX: Back then. When you had the chance. When you were still innocent.
HENRY: I thought maybe this was my way out.
MAX: And was it?
HENRY: Yeah.
MAX: See. There are no mistakes.
MAX: You got everything, kid?
HENRY: Yeah. Henry, silent for a moment.
HENRY (CONT'D): Maybe you should think about getting out of here sometime. I'll buy you a cup of coffee on the outside.
MAX: The only thing I've ever missed in twenty three years is a hot bath. And that ain't worth walking out of here for. The cell door slides open.
MAX: Don't forget. Your dream is your myth is your truth. Pause.
HENRY: I thought it was my dream is my truth is my destiny.
MAX: Just testing. Henry continues...stops at the door.
HENRY: I'm going to miss you.
MAX: Yeah, well. I hope I never see you again. Henry smiles.
HENRY: I'm still gonna miss you.
MAX: Get out of here, Henry.
JOE: The guy who got sick several years before. He's wearing a suit and tie now.
JOE: Henry. How you doing?
HENRY: Hey.
(CALLING OUT): Debbie! Henry's here.
(TO HENRY): Come on in. Make yourself at home.
HENRY: Thanks.
JOE: Don't mind me. I'm just getting set up for my meeting. You want a beer?
HENRY: Sure.
(CALLING OUT): Honey, do mind getting Henry a beer?
DEBBIE: Hi.
HENRY: Hi. It's not so awkward.
DEBBIE: I think that's everything you wanted.
HENRY: Thanks. A beat. They just stand there for a moment.
HENRY (CONT'D): Are you happy?
DEBBIE: I am, Henry.
HENRY: I'm glad. He means it. Henry picks up the box, shoulders the bag.
DEBBIE: So what are you going to do now?
HENRY: I don't know yet. Joe enters.
JOE: Honey, they're starting to arrive. Joe grabs a DISPLAY STAND featuring kitchen products.
(TO HENRY): We're having a meeting. It's his new business.
JOE: Hey, maybe you'd be interested, Henry. You could become a distributor for Jin Chi. They all head out of the garage.
JOE (CONT'D): It's Korean kitchenware. The future of food storage. Plus, if you recruit distributors, you get paid even more. Passing through the living room arriving GUESTS notice Henry walking out carrying his box.
HENRY: You mean like a pyramid scheme?
JOE: No! God, no. It's a multi-layered marketing paradigm.
(HENRY'S LOOK): Anyway, why don't you give it some thought? Henry nods, starts to head out.
JOE (CONT'D): Henry.
HENRY: Yeah?
JOE: Listen, I just wanted to thank you. For not giving up my name. A beat.
HENRY: I don't know your name.
JOE: Sure you do. It's Joe. A beat.
HENRY: Right. You're welcome Joe.
(TO DEB): I'll see you Deb.
DEBBIE: Take care of yourself, Henry. He leaves.
NEIGHBOR: Henry! How are you? Henry looks over.
HENRY: I'm good. How are you?
NEIGHBOR: Great. How was Greece?
HENRY: Greece?
NEIGHBOR: Debbie told us all about your trip. A beat.
HENRY: I was in prison.
NEIGHBOR: In Greece?
GUY": He studies the image a moment, flips to the inner cover, graffitied with hand-written messages from classmates including : "Henry don't be such a fag, Eddie Vibes" Henry puts the yearbook back in the box. Next to it are a pile of photographs spread out...images from Henry's childhood...of him and Debbie...of different times. He finishes putting everything back.
(ON TV): Take a chance on life, take a chance on Buffalotto! Henry closes the lid of the box, regards it.
HENRY: Good. Thank you.
HENRY: About what?
HENRY: Sure. Sounds good.
HENRY: Thanks. She sits down at her desk.
HENRY: It does?
(THEN): How does it feel? Henry takes a breath.
HENRY: Good.
CUT TO :: HENRY'S DIRTY BOOTS march along the street with purpose... We follow them. After a while, the boots stop.
JULIE: What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Are you okay? (into cell phone) Stan. I gotta call you back! I just ran someone over. No, he looks okay.
JULIE (CONT'D): You idiot, you weren't even looking where you were going! Are you okay? Henry's a little delirious.
HENRY: I think I'm okay. He grabs his thigh. Winces with pain. Tries to get up.
JULIE: No. Stay on the ground. The bank Guard FRANK rushes over.
FRANK: Is he alright? Don't get up. I'll call an ambulance.
HENRY: No, don't. (Starts to stand) I think I'm okay.
(RECOGNIZING HIM): You!
(RECOGNIZING HIM): Yeah. Me.
JULIE: (to Frank, confused) Is he alright?
FRANK: Are you alright?
HENRY: Yeah. Fine.
JULIE: He just walked right out into the street. He came out of nowhere.
FRANK: I saw the whole thing. You were on the phone. You weren't even paying attention.
JULIE: Yes. I was. I know how to drive. Cars are honking now as Henry limps his way over to the sidewalk.
JULIE (CONT'D): What are you doing? Get back on the ground!
FRANK: Park your car. I'm going to take him into that cafe. She jumps back in her car and pulls it over to the side. Frank comes over to Henry, takes his arm.
FRANK (CONT'D): They let you out, huh.
HENRY: Yeah.
FRANK: Let's get you a seat in here.
FRANK: Pierre! Une Verre d'eau.
HENRY: Thanks. Julie comes in.
JULIE: Did you call an ambulance? I'm calling an ambulance.
HENRY: It's okay. I really am fine.
FRANK: Yeah. He's alright for a guy who just got run over. (sucks his teeth) Lucky I guess. Frank leaves.
JULIE: I think we should call a doctor. Henry just stares at her. For a long moment.
JULIE (CONT'D): What? Are you okay? He keeps staring...
JULIE (CONT'D): Hello, guy? Are you okay? Do you need a doctor? A beat.
HENRY: No. You look familiar.
JULIE: What? It takes Julie a moment.
JULIE (CONT'D): Oh. That.
HENRY: What?
(SINGS): 'Take a chance on life, take a chance on Buffa-lotto'? A beat.
HENRY: Oh, that's why. An awkward moment.
JULIE: Well, I guess you seem to be okay.
HENRY: Yeah. I'm okay.
JULIE: Okay. So you're okay?
HENRY: Yeah.
JULIE: Great.
(THEN): So I can go now?
HENRY: Sure.
JULIE: Bye.
(THEN): And be more careful.
HENRY: Thanks.
WAITRESS: Anything else I can get you?
HENRY: A bathroom?
HENRY: Hobbles down the hallway. He notices the photos on the wall. A series of HISTORICAL SHOTS of OLD BUFFALO.
`TUNNEL DISCOVERED': After a moment Henry starts peeing again. Thinking about what he's just read...
MAX: Emerges with a guard.
MAX: I thought I told you I didn't want to see your face again. Henry smiles.
HENRY: Nice to see you too. He goes to hug him.
GUARD: No contact. They sit. They look at each other a moment.
HENRY: I figured it out.
MAX: What?
HENRY: My destiny.
MAX: Good. What is it? A beat. Henry leans in.
HENRY: The bank.
MAX: The bank is your destiny?
HENRY: Yeah.
MAX: What bank?
HENRY: The one I didn't rob. Pause.
MAX: But you went to jail for it.
HENRY: Exactly.
MAX: What are you talking about Henry? Henry looks around. Closer --
HENRY: I did the time, I may as well have done the crime.
MAX: Ah, that. Time. Crime. Right.
(THEN): I still don't get it. Pause.
HENRY: I need your help.
MAX: What for?
(A WHISPER): To rob the bank. Pause.
HENRY (CONT'D): So what do you say?
MAX: I'm in Jail. That's what I say.
HENRY: You've got your review coming up --
MAX: -- So?
HENRY: So you can get of here. If you want to.
MAX: No. It's not as simple as that.
HENRY: Yes, it is.
MAX: No, it's not.
HENRY: Yes. It is.
MAX: No, it's not.
MAX: I'm happy here. This is my home.
HENRY: This is not a home. This is a prison.
MAX: Whatever you want to call it, I'm happy here. A beat. Henry looks at Max now. He looks frail.
HENRY: Max. You can't die in this place.
MAX: I can die wherever I want.
HENRY: You really want to die here?
MAX: What do you want, Henry?
HENRY: I'm asking for your help.
MAX: To rob that bank?!
HENRY: I've thought about it. It's the right thing.
(THEN): For both of us. A long beat. Max gets up :
MAX: Henry. I got cards.
MAX: Great to see you, kid.
HENRY: Max! Max exits.
OPENS NOVEMBER 23: Henry approaches, takes in the large photo of Darek and the PLAY POSTER, featuring a TREE, for the upcoming
PRODUCTION:: Each `tree branch' of this poster dangles a small cherry- shaped PHOTO of the various ACTORS starring in it, including JULIE IVANOVA, the girl who ran Henry over, as Madame Ranevsky. A black and white American flag wrapped around the trunk of the cherry tree with bloody roots. Henry regards this with some interest, tries the theatre door. This one's open.
JULIE: The girl who hit him with her car. She's in mid-speech :
JULIE (CONT'D): (as Madame Ranevsky) I think I must be dreaming. God Knows I love my country. I love it deeply. I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much.
(SHE'S TEARFUL): But...I must drink my coffee...thank you Firs, thank you, you dear old man. I'm so glad to find you still alive. Henry's transfixed. She's good. ARNOLD, regional actor extraordinaire, plays Lophakin :
(CONT'D): I just want you to believe in me like the old days. I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did
DAREK: Stop! Stop! DAREK, the CZECH DIRECTOR -- greasy-haired, balding and smoking -- stands up in his seat in the stalls.
DAREK (CONT'D): Too small, too safe! Stop showing me your `safe face' --
ARNOLD: -- But I was --
DAREK: Not you. You're doing the best you can. You. He points to JULIE.
DAREK (CONT'D): What are you doing?
JULIE: I'm...listening.
DAREK: Listening? You look like you're hearing. To hear is to be weak. To listen is to be strong. To listen is an action. Julie cocks her ear, mockingly. Darek marches up to her.
DAREK (CONT'D): What is that?
JULIE: An action. I'm listening. Is this what you mean, Darek? Is this what you want?
DAREK: No, Djula.
JULIE: Then what do you want? They stare each other down.
DAREK: I want you to be more. I want you to be better than that. He snatches the cup from her hand.
DAREK (CONT'D): Now go drink coffee. And don't think about what I want, think about what you want!
JULIE: Fine. I'll go drink coffee. Julie marches off stage...
DAREK: I'll go drink coffee too! Let's all `go drink coffee'.
(SHOUTS): Ten minutes everyone! (to his Eastern European
ASSISTANT): Olga! Coffee. Coffee for everyone. We'll all have coffee Djula! Every single one of us! And think about what we want!
HENRY: Watches as Julie comes up the aisle. She notices him.
JULIE: What are you doing here? She doesn't wait, just walks right past... Henry follows.
JULIE (CONT'D): Are you here to sue me?
HENRY: No.
JULIE: Then what are you doing here?
HENRY: I saw your picture outside. The door was open. I came in. She exits.
HENRY: Is it always like that?
JULIE: What?
HENRY: (gesturing back to the
THEATRE): That.
JULIE: You mean rehearsal?
HENRY: Yeah.
JULIE: It's a process.
HENRY: Looks complicated.
JULIE: It's all pain.
(THEN): Chekhov, right? They reach the Cafe. He opens the door for her :
HENRY: I thought you were listening. She looks at him, curiously.
HENRY (CONT'D): I'm Henry by the way.
JULIE: Julie.
PIERRE: Madame Julie!
JULIE: Coffee, Pierre. She points at Henry.
JULIE (CONT'D): You want one?
HENRY: Sure.
JULIE: Two. They stand right there at the bar. Silence. Henry notices the play poster on the wall over her shoulder. Looks at it. Then back at her. Comparing her photo to the live person.
JULIE (CONT'D): What? She turns to see what he's looking at. A beat.
JULIE (CONT'D): So what do you think?
HENRY: Doesn't look like you.
JULIE: No, I meant the poster.
HENRY: Oh. It's funny.
JULIE: Actors on a tree is funny?
HENRY: Yeah. She smiles. Pierre puts the coffees down on the bar.
JULIE: That's the director's joke. She starts dropping cubes of sugar in her cup.
JULIE (CONT'D): He's making a comment on the American culture. Actors faces as falling fruit. Birth, death, the consumption of the ID. Henry's interested.
JULIE (CONT'D): To him, the American dream has become the world's nightmare. "You are the country of apocalypse."
(THEN ): That's what he told us on the first day of rehearsal, anyway.
HENRY: Oh.
JULIE: The irony is, he loves the American dream. I mean that's why he's here, right?
(WHISPERS): But I know for a fact he hates himself for loving it. It's always an inside job, isn't it?
HENRY: Yeah. I guess. Pause.
JULIE: But the truth is I wasn't listening. I was playing it safe.
(THEN): He was right. The jerk. About that, anyway... She drinks her coffee.
JULIE (CONT'D): You know the Cherry Orchard was Chekhov's last play. He was dying when he wrote it. She thinks. He listens.
JULIE (CONT'D): It's perfect.
HENRY: Why?
JULIE (CONT'D: It's my last play too. Here in Buffalo.
HENRY: You're leaving? She downs the last of her coffee.
JULIE: Right after we're done.
(THEN): I'm glad you came by. Thanks for not suing me. I'll see ya. She leaves. He watches her through the glass as she walks across the street...right past the bank on her way back to the theatre.
(CALLING OUT): Hey Barber, tomorrow lunch, right?
MAX: Right.
ANOTHER CONVICT: Give `em hell!
MAX: I always do, Felipe! As Max reaches the end of the walkway, an OLD GUARD opens the next steel door for him.
GUARD: Morning, Max. Here we are again.
MAX: How's your grandson?
GUARD: Just started first grade.
MAX: That's great. The socialization begins! The Guard smiles as he leads him toward the PAROLE BOARD ROOM at the end of another long corridor. They stop at the door.
GUARD: How many more of these you think you got in you, Max? Pause.
MAX: As many as it takes. The Guard shakes his head, opens the door for him.
(CONT'D): Mr. Saltzman. Could you please tell the board why you believe we should grant you parole? They all wait for Max's answer. He's silent.
(HALF AMUSED): Come on, Mr. Saltzman, what have you got for us this time? Closer on Max. He looks like he might start to twitch at any moment....
(CONT'D): (o.s.) Mr. Saltzman?
MAX: Well...
HENRY: Appears. Smiling.
HENRY: I knew you could do it. Max looks around nervously.
MAX: Where's the car?
HENRY: I don't have a car.
MAX: You don't have a car? What's wrong with you? You came to pick me up without a car. That's not picking a person up.
HENRY: Yes, it is. I'm here. I'm picking you up.
MAX: I don't know about this. Maybe this is a mistake. Max turns....walks back towards the gates. Starts to POUND on them.
MAX (CONT'D): Dave! Carl!
HENRY: Max, it's okay. You're free.
MAX: Open up! DAVE! No response. Henry approaches. Takes Max's bag.
HENRY: Come on, Max.
MAX: I don't like this.
HENRY: Take it easy. There's nothing to be frightened of. I promise. You're okay. The bus station's just a short walk. Max starts to hyperventilate :
MAX: I can't breathe. I -- can't breathe... Henry hesitates a moment, puts an arm around him...
HENRY: You're going to be alright.
MAX: (nearly on his knees) I'm going to die right here. I told you!
HENRY: Come on, Max, we're going to miss that bus. Henry helps Max back up again.
HENRY: You hungry? He opens his bag and pulls out a sandwich. Offers it to him. Max doesn't say anything.
HENRY (CONT'D): It's pastrami. On rye. A beat. Max opens one eye...
HENRY: Here we are. Henry indicates the tiny bed in the corner of the living room. There are some second hand books on the bedside table like `Future Shock' by Alvin Toffler and Dostoyevsky.
HENRY (CONT'D): That one's yours.
MAX: Thanks.
HENRY: Anything else you need? A beat.
MAX: Yeah.
MAX: (reads the label) Ah. The land of milk and honey. Pours it into his bath.
MAX: What is this obsession with coffee, Henry? When did that happen?
HENRY: I'm not sure, Max. But it seems to give people a lot of purpose. They walk into the Cafe Orpheum.
MAX: Oh my God. Are you kidding? This was eighty years ago. It's ridiculous. Oh my God. That tunnel's probably not even there anymore! Are you dreaming, Henry?
HENRY: It's a start.
MAX: A start? This was your plan? An old cartoon in a pissoir?
HENRY: It's an article.
MAX: Whatever, Henry. Why don't we just go in with guns and do it the old-fashioned way?
HENRY: No. No guns.
MAX: What?
HENRY: Someone could get hurt. Pause.
MAX: That's sweet, kid.
HENRY: (the tunnel photo) Maybe it's still there, Max. A beat.
(SURE): Uh-huh.
HENRY: Maybe it is. Max looks at him.
MAX: Right. Okay. Yes. First things first. Why don't we go take a look at this bank of yours?
(THEN): At least we know that's still there. Henry looks at him.
MAX: Money is a mistress with a hard heart.
MAX (CONT'D): I'd like to speak to your manager please. I'm interested in opening an account.
CUT TO :: A NAME-PLACARD : `HOWARD TUTTLE, Assistant Manager'.
MAX: What kind do you have?
(INTERRUPTING): You know my uncle put all his money in that vault when I was a kid, after we came from Europe, before the war...the Brownshirts. He said that vault will be there for three hundred years!
MAX: He was never wrong. How long's it been there already Mr. Tuttle?
MAX: And in the very same spot, correct?
(TO HENRY): See, my boy!. History. It's all about history.
(INTERRUPTING): You'll have to give us some time to think about which one. Max gets up.
MAX (CONT'D): Thank you. You've been very helpful.
(CONFUSED): No. Thank you. Henry and Max walk out past Frank. He watches them leave...
FRANK: Have a nice day, gentlemen.
HENRY: The vault is here. He walks across the alley...
HENRY (CONT'D): The tunnel runs under here... He follows it toward the back door of the theatre.
HENRY (CONT'D): And ends up somewhere in there. He turns to Max.
MAX: It's virtually robbing itself! Henry laughs. THE DOOR HITS the back of his head as it SWINGS open.
JULIE: Jesus...goddamn! Goddamn Czech Chekhov shit!
HENRY: (rubbing his head) Hi.
JULIE: Jesus. Henry? She looks at Max.
HENRY: Julie, Max. Max, Julie.
MAX: Hiya.
JULIE: What are you doing here?
HENRY: Oh, we were, you know --
MAX: I was just showing Henry the place I used to perform. Henry shoots Max a look.
JULIE: Oh. What? The door opens. SIMON, the Stage Manager, pokes his head out.
SIMON: That's lunch, Julie.
JULIE: Thank God.
MAX: Chekov's tough stuff. It takes a steel stomach.
JULIE: You know Chekhov?
MAX: Of course. Apart from Gorbachev he's my favorite Russian. She laughs. Max approaches her.
MAX (CONT'D): Would you mind if we took a look around? It's been over thirty years since I've been inside. She considers the request.
JULIE: Sure. She gestures them inside.
JULIE (CONT'D): Sure. Yeah. Come on in.
MAX: Thank you. As Henry passes :
HENRY: How you doing?
JULIE: Great. I'm in hell.
MAX: Home again.
JULIE: So what productions were you in?
MAX: Oh. Shakespeare, Ibsen, Mahoney, the greats.
(A SMILE): And the not-so-greats! Simon arrives.
(TO JULIE): Mary wants to fit your wig at four. Darek says to stay hungry.
JULIE: Fuck him.
SIMON: Got it. Max and Henry exchange a glance.
MAX: Would it be a tremendous imposition to have a little tour for old time's sake?
JULIE: He used to perform here.
SIMON: I don't see why not. We're on a break.
MAX: That okay, Henry?
HENRY: Sure. Go ahead. Julie and Henry watch them go.
JULIE: Is that your dad?
HENRY: No. He's a friend.
JULIE: He seems like your dad. Henry walks out onto the stage where Max was standing, getting the feel of it.
HENRY: It's peaceful out here. Beat.
HENRY (CONT'D): Is it fun?
JULIE: What?
HENRY: Pretending to be other people. She thinks.
JULIE: It's not really like that. I don't pretend to be someone else. I find some part of me, and reveal it in a new way...just inside of a character.
HENRY: So, in a way, you're still playing `you'.
JULIE: Yes. Exactly. In a way.
HENRY: So what part of `you' are you playing now?
JULIE: That's the question you always have to ask yourself.
MAX: Ah, the inner sanctum. The magic before the magic! I remember it like it was yesterday. They enter the Green Room where ARNOLD is holding court.
ARNOLD: People often make the mistake in Chekhov of going down...but you must always always go up... Other ACTORS look at him with blank faces. Max gestures Simon closer. With a conspiratorial whisper -
MAX: Simon, did you know there used to be a speakeasy down here during prohibition days?
SIMON: Yes. And they hid the booze in the bank!
MAX: I know.
SIMON: And there was a tunnel too!
MAX: I know!
(THEN): I forget. Where was it?
JULIE: So what's your story, Henry?
HENRY: My story?
JULIE: I mean, like...what do you do? Henry crosses the stage, goes to sit in the chair opposite her.
HENRY: I'm figuring that out.
JULIE: Does that mean you don't have a job? A beat.
HENRY: I just got out of jail. ON JULIE. She wasn't expecting that.
JULIE: Jail!
HENRY: Sounds worse than it is.
JULIE: Really? Jail sounds bad.
(THEN): Why were you in there? She takes a big bite of her sandwich.
JULIE (CONT'D): Are you a murderer or something?
HENRY: No. Do I look like one? She studies him.
JULIE: No.
HENRY: What do I look like? She studies him some more.
JULIE: I don't know. A criminal. He laughs.
HENRY: I do? She laughs. Then stops. Dead serious :
JULIE: Yeah.
SIMON: We got to be quick. Arnold doesn't like people in his dressing room.
(ENTHUSIASTICALLY): It was right here. Max comes up. Feels it now too.
MAX: Booze, broads and lucre. The good old days. I like it.
SIMON: They filled it in, in 1931 when they built the theatre. Max pads the wall like it's a good old friend, testing it...searching...
SIMON (CONT'D): Times have changed.
MAX: All good things must come to... (he hits a hollow spot) ...an end. Max stops. Turns to Simon, and with a broad smile :
MAX (CONT'D): Do you need volunteers?
HENRY: The Cherry Orchard. (leafing through it) So what happens? What's it about? Is it funny? Julie gets up out of her chair.
JULIE: A woman returns to her family estate in the Russian countryside and realizes she has no choice but to sell her beloved Cherry Orchard, the magical place of her youth, the only place she ever felt safe.
HENRY: I guess it's not funny. She looks at him.
JULIE: It's about being forced to let go of the past and create a new life in order to survive. Max's voice booms :
MAX (CONT'D): Thank you, Julie. And thank you, Simon. I'll see you tomorrow.
JULIE: Tomorrow?
SIMON: Max has very kindly offered to volunteer at the theatre!
JULIE: Oh.
MAX: Henry, let's get out of these people's way! Henry turns to Julie.
(TO JULIE): What are you doing after rehearsal?
JULIE: Why?
HENRY: Do you like Chinese?
JULIE: Yeah.
HENRY: Golden Dragon?
JULIE: It's okay.
HENRY: Eight o'clock?
JULIE: Sure. They look at each other as ACTORS return to the stage. DAREK moves towards his place in the front seats.
DAREK: Work. Work! It's time to work Americans!
(SEES HER): Even you Djula... Max grabs Henry --
MAX: Let's go.
HENRY: See you, Julie.
JULIE: Stay out of jail. Henry waves.
MAX: You were right, Henry. You got a nose like a bloodhound!
HENRY: You found it?
MAX: Yeah. Right there. In Lophakin's dressing room.
HENRY: Who?
MAX: Lophakin. We find a way to get into his dressing room and we're right as rain! Henry and Max notice FRANK standing at the corner of the alley having a cigarette. He glares at them as they pass...
MAX: I can see it, Henry. It's all in front of me. The vault. The bank. The tunnel. The pieces of the puzzle are on the table. All we got to do is put them in the right order!
(THEN): The only thing is the dirt...where does the dirt from the tunnel go?
HENRY: What about the vault?
MAX: First things first. I'm on the dirt.
HENRY: Okay. How do I look?
MAX: Like Henry.
(THEN): We had a good day, Kid. It's good to be back in the soup.
MAX (CONT'D): (he starts to take off his
CLOTHES): Go have a nice supper.
A CHOPSTICK: Henry places it between a PLATE and a NAPKIN, linking them together like...a tunnel...
JULIE: Sorry I'm late. I'm starving. She sits. Looks at the menu. A GUY who's leaving, sees her :
GUY: Julie.
JULIE: Bruce. The guy glances at Henry. Leaves.
JULIE (CONT'D): That guy's a total dick. Hi, Henry. She studies the menu.
HENRY: Hi. How was rehearsal? She puts it down. No answer.
JULIE: I feel like duck.
JULIE: I don't just want to be good, I want to be great. And I don't just want to be great in Buffalo.
HENRY: Where then?
JULIE: Don't laugh.
(THEN): Hollywood.
HENRY: I guess that's where people go.
JULIE: I don't want my legacy to be a Buffalotto commercial. And it's not going to be. Soon as this thing is done I'm out of here.
(THEN): Before it's too late.
HENRY: Sounds like a plan. The waitress brings over the check and the fortune cookies.
JULIE: I hate fortune cookies.
HENRY: We going anywhere in particular?
JULIE: (hits the joint) Want some? Henry shakes his head no. She turns the radio up.
JULIE (CONT'D): You know there's a whole bunch of bodies down there churning around. Just caught in the current.
(BEAT): They all took the risk and look what happened to them. Same in death as they were in life. Imagine that. You kill yourself and nothing changes.
JULIE (CONT'D): All those dreams churning around down there. It makes you sick.
(THEN): I got to get out of here.
HENRY: I get it. They start to walk...
JULIE: So what did you do before jail, Henry?
HENRY: I worked at a toll booth.
JULIE: Which one?
HENRY: Rainbow bridge.
JULIE: No!
HENRY: Yes.
JULIE: I had family that used to live on the other side. I took that bridge all the time. We must of met a hundred times! He nods. She's probably right.
JULIE (CONT'D): Wow. So you were one of the guys in the tollbooth with those weird rubber gloves?
HENRY: Yeah. She laughs.
HENRY (CONT'D): What's so funny?
JULIE: You were watching everyone go somewhere and you were going nowhere.
HENRY: That's funny?
JULIE: Yeah. Funny sad, not funny funny.
HENRY: I worked nights. It gave me time to think.
JULIE: About what?
HENRY: About where I wasn't going.
JULIE: See, that's funny.
(THEN): What about now? Where you going now?
HENRY: I'm working on it.
JULIE: What'd they send you to jail for Henry?
HENRY: For trying to rob the First Buffalo Bank.
JULIE: What!
HENRY: I thought I was on my way to a softball game. It was a mistake. Pause.
JULIE: Sounds like it. He looks at her. Decides :
HENRY: But now I'm going to rob it for real.
JULIE: You're going to rob the bank you already went to jail for robbing?
HENRY: Yeah.
JULIE: Ha!
HENRY: There's a tunnel.
JULIE: What tunnel?
HENRY: Runs from the bank to the theatre.
JULIE: My theatre?
HENRY: Yeah.
JULIE: Ha! She looks out the falls.
JULIE (CONT'D): You're fucking hilarious, Henry.
(SERIOUSLY): Thank you. A beat. We can't tell what she's thinking...
JULIE: You know what?
HENRY: What?
JULIE: I'm hungry.
HENRY: What for?
JULIE: (as the thought occurs) Ice cream.
JULIE: I can't believe I'm sitting here.
HENRY: Neither can I. She gets up.
JULIE: I want to dance and clap my hands. She moves through into the lounge. Henry follows.
JULIE (CONT'D): I think I must be dreaming! She starts moving around the room, dancing to the music.
JULIE (CONT'D): God knows I love my country. I love it deeply. She sits down.
JULIE (CONT'D): I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. Henry's not sure what she's talking about. She gestures to her copy of `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' on the coffee table.
JULIE (CONT'D): Page twenty one. Henry opens it.
JULIE (CONT'D): I couldn't see out the train window I was crying so much. But I must drink my coffee.
(THEN): Read Lophakin. She points to the right place. Henry, awkwardly :
HENRY: `I have to go to Kharkov on the five o'clock train. Such a bother, I wanted to stay and look at you and talk to you.
(TO HER): You're as wonderful as ever....' He stops, looks at her :
JULIE: Read the next line!
HENRY: `Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.'
JULIE: Say it like you feel it. Like it's real. Say it to me. Henry takes a beat. This time he makes it his.
`HENRY: Even more beautiful, and dressed like a Parisian...you could blow me down.' She laughs like a little girl.
JULIE: You're good. Keep reading! And get up. Walk around!
HENRY: `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money-grubber.'
JULIE: Yes, you are. You're a bank robber, Henry! He laughs.
HENRY: (the text again) `I don't care a bit. I just want you to believe in me like the old days!'
JULIE: (pulling him around the room) Don't stop --
HENRY: `I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.'
JULIE: Again! Henry's getting into it.
HENRY: `I just want your wonderful tender eyes to look at me like they did then.' She laughs some more. Comes closer.
JULIE: I'm glad I ran you over. Henry puts the book down.
HENRY: Me too. They kiss...
(SOFTLY): Good morning.
HENRY: Good morning. She climbs on top of him. Henry smiles.
HENRY (CONT'D): Good morning.
MAX: Henry!
MAX: (pulling up his boxers) I figured it out! Once we're in that dressing room the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof!
MAX: (rushing out into the front
ROOM): That bank doesn't stand a chance. HENRY is standing right there, holding a bag of groceries, JULIE is right next to him. Max goes white. He's in his underwear.
MAX (CONT'D): Ah. Company.
JULIE: Good morning, Max.
HENRY: It's alright. She knows.
MAX: She does?
JULIE: I didn't know the dirt from the tunnel goes out through the roof. She laughs a little. Max looks at Henry like `what the fuck?'
HENRY: We brought breakfast. How do you like your eggs? Henry enters the kitchen...leaving Max and Julie there.
JULIE: It's okay. I'm not going to tell anyone.
MAX: Hold on. Max follows Henry into the kitchen.
MAX: You told her?
(A WHISPER): About what we're doing?
HENRY: Yeah. I did.
MAX: It's a crime. You're supposed to keep crimes a secret.
HENRY: It's okay, Max.
MAX: No. It's not kosher. Pause.
HENRY: How do you like your bacon?
(PISSED): Crispy. Max leaves the kitchen for the front room where Julie's waiting, amused by the whole thing. Max just stands there in his underwear a moment, sizing her up.
MAX (CONT'D): Okay. I'll get dressed.
JULIE: So what were you in prison for, Max? Max slurps his coffee.
MAX: I'm a confidence man.
JULIE: You mean a `con' man?
MAX: I never liked that word. It's only half of what it is. The word confidence comes from the latin. Fides. With Faith. Belief.
(THEN): That's what I'm about. She considers this.
JULIE: You mean you make people feel good...and then you rip them off?
MAX: Yes. He glances at Henry.
MAX (CONT'D): But I was always much better at the feeling good part than the ripping off part.
(THEN): Hence, the prison.
JULIE: Aren't you guys worried about getting caught?
MAX: Not really. For me it's a win-win situation.
JULIE: How?
MAX: I like jail. Three hots and a cot. Julie looks at Henry now...
JULIE: You too, Henry? You like jail?
HENRY: No. I like it out here.
JULIE: So why would you take the risk? Is it the money? Henry doesn't answer, starts to collect the plates.
JULIE (CONT'D): It must be the money. Henry smiles.
JULIE (CONT'D): You are a criminal. A greedy little criminal.
HENRY: (washing the plates) `Your brother Leonid says I'm an upstart, a money grubber...
(THEN): ...but I don't care a bit'. He turns to her.
HENRY (CONT'D): `I just want you to believe in me like the old days.'
JULIE: You remember!
MAX: What is that?
JULIE: It's Chekhov!
MAX: Chekhov?!
HENRY: We read it last night.
(TO HENRY): You really are good.
(TO MAX): He's a natural.
MAX: I thought you were on a date.
HENRY: We were.
MAX: Reading Chekhov's a date? Beat.
HENRY: Yeah. She downs her coffee. Stands.
JULIE: I got to get to the theatre --
MAX: Can you give me a ride there?
JULIE: Why?
MAX: I'm a volunteer! She regards him a moment.
JULIE: You weren't in any of those plays, were you?
MAX: No.
(THEN): But can you give me a ride?
JULIE: All white! All White! Oh, my Cherry Orchard. After the dark, stormy autumn and the winter frosts you are young again and full of happiness; the heavenly angels have never abandoned you...
JULIE (CONT'D): Oh, if only I could be free of the stone that weighs me down! If only I could forget my past!
REVEAL HENRY: Watching from the back of the theatre in the semi- darkness. He's transfixed. Max watches too. He wears his volunteer badge.
GAYEV: Yes and now the orchard will be sold to pay our debts, which seems impossible...
JULIE: Look! It's mamma walking in the orchard...in a white dress! (laughing with joy) There she is.
GAYEV: Where?
VARYA: Momma, don't! A PROJECTION OF THE MOTHER FLOATS ACROSS THE SCREEN and dissolves into one of the Cherry Trees... Henry and Max speak in hushed voices :
MAX: This is driving me crazy.
HENRY: What?
MAX: We could be digging right now!
HENRY: We could?
MAX: If we were in that dressing room.
HENRY: It's rehearsal. There are people everywhere.
MAX: This is pissing me off. Max leaves....after a moment he stops where he is...freezes... ...then turns back to Henry...
HENRY: What?
MAX: I got an idea.
HENRY: What?
MAX: You have to be Lophakin!
HENRY: What?
MAX: If you did we'd be able to get into that tunnel whenever we want.
HENRY: I'm not an actor.
MAX: You're not a bank robber either! And you're doing that.
HENRY: Max. Come on.
MAX: She said you were a natural. That means you can do it.
HENRY: No, it doesn't.
MAX: Yes, it does Henry.
(SHAKES HIM): You ARE Lophakin! A man who came from nothing. A man who's not afraid to create a new life.
(POINTS): A man who's in love with her! Henry stares at Julie, mid performance, on the stage.
MAX (CONT'D): Your dream is your truth is your destiny! Henry thinks...
HENRY: I can't be Lophakin. They have a Lophakin. Max thinks...
MAX: What if they didn't?
HENRY: There has to be another way. Max, frustrated :
MAX: Kid, You forced me out of jail to help you. And I'm going to goddamn help you. But you got to help me help you. Now I need to know... (a fierce stare) ...do you want this bank or not? On Henry...
HENRY: Yes. I want it.
HENRY (CONT'D): Then you're gonna be Lophakin!
ARNOLD: Walks down the street. It's snowing. He approaches the theatre.
ARNOLD: Good morning, everyone! None of the actors pay him much attention. He pours himself a cup of coffee, makes his way toward his dressing room.
ARNOLD: You knew this day would come. You deserve this, lubya. He closes his eyes. Bows his head. Starts to weep...
DAREK: Unprofessional shit!
ARNOLD: Mr. Millodragovich --
(HISSING): Shit!
MAX: What's happening?
JULIE: Arnold's leaving the production.
MAX: Oh. Gosh.
ARNOLD: But I have no choice it's Willie Lohman we're talking about! (brandishing the letter) A Ken Waterstone production!
DAREK: OOOH-LA-LA! A Ken Waterstone production. The heaven's have opened. You lucky boy.
DAREK (CONT'D): Run, run, to that pandering, populist, piece-of-shit-Waterstone and his spineless productions! You're perfect for it.
ARNOLD: Good-bye, Darek.
(THEN): I'm sorry. Arnold marches off the stage with his case.
DAREK: Simone! I need a new Lopakhin. Now.
(CALLING OUT): I'm dying, Olga! Cigarettes! Cigarettes NOW! And COFFEE!
SIMON: We'll hold auditions this afternoon, Darek! I'll get the list -- Darek ingests caffeine and nicotine at an alarming rate :
DAREK: I've seen that shit-list! It's a disaster.
SIMON: What do we do?
DAREK: I must think. He moves stage left past Julie...
DAREK (CONT'D): Djula! Your orchard cannot be felled before she has a chance to grow. And with that he disappears with Olga out the door.
JULIE: Perfect. Beat.
(A SHRUG): It is Ken Waterstone. She shoots him a look, picks up her stuff and goes...
JULIE: Yes, Stan, yes! I know it's bullshit but that's what's happening...
(SHE LISTENS): I don't know, he's `thinking'... She gets in the car. Tries to find a roach in the ashtray. A KNOCK at the passenger window. She looks up. It's MAX.
JULIE (CONT'D): What? He gestures, `Can I come in?'. Max gets in.
JULIE (CONT'D): Sorry, I can't give you a ride --
MAX: You said he was a natural.
JULIE: Stan. Let me call you back. (she hangs up, to Max) What?
MAX: Henry.
JULIE: Henry what?
MAX: Henry would be perfect for it.
JULIE: Perfect for what?
MAX: For Lophakin. It takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea.
JULIE: You mean Henry should play Lophakin?
MAX: Yes. She laughs.
JULIE: He's not even an actor!
MAX: Exactly. He'd be playing himself. (off her shocked look) Think about it Julie! He is Lophakin.
MAX (CONT'D): A man who came from nothing. A man who's not afraid to create a new life and put his past behind him. A man who's in love with you...Madame Ranevsky. A beat. She does think about it.
JULIE: Why do I feel like the earth is suddenly shifting under my feet?
MAX: Fact is you need a Lophakin and Lophakin needs a dressing room.
(BEAT): Can you get him in to see Darek? She hesitates...
JULIE: What's going on here, Max? What are you doing?
MAX: Nothing. She regards him. Suspiciously.
JULIE: You made this happen, didn't you?
MAX: Sometimes a good guy needs a less good guy to help the good guy be good. He smiles. A beat : She SLAPS him hard across the cheek.
MAX (CONT'D): Fair enough. They just sit there for a moment...
JULIE: What am I supposed to do now?
MAX: He just needs a shot. One audition. Let the chips fall where they may.
JULIE: What if it doesn't work?
MAX: They'll get someone else. She thinks...
MAX (CONT'D): Give him a shot. One shot. That's all I'm asking, Julie. She thinks some more...
JULIE: Okay, confidence man.
DAREK: Circles HENRY...walking around him...an animal tracking its pray...he's chain-smoking...
DAREK: ...you've never had any training...you've never been in a production...you don't even know the play...
HENRY: I read it. I think I know the scene.
DAREK: Think. He glances at Julie. Then back at Henry.
DAREK (CONT'D): Start.
(READING): `Your brother , Leonid Andrevich...'
DAREK: How can you perform Chekhov and not be able to say AND-REY-E-VICH! Now say it!
HENRY (CONT'D): Your brother, Leonid ANDREYEVICH says I'm an upstart, a money grubber --
DAREK: A what?
HENRY: A money-grubber!
DAREK: Are you?
DAREK: Convince her. Darek pushes Henry closer to Julie. She stands :
HENRY: Your brother, Leonid Andreyevich says I'm an upstart, a money grubber. He can say whatever he likes. I don't care a bit --
DAREK: (into his ear)
HENRY: I just want you to believe in me like in the old days.
JULIE: Show me, tell me. Darek laughs, circling... Henry takes her hand now...his voice drops...
HENRY: Good God in Heaven. My father was one of your father's serfs, and your grandfather's serf before that. But you, you did so much for me in the old days that I've forgotten all that... His yearning is suddenly palpable. Intense. Tender.
HENRY (CONT'D): I love you...like a sister...more than a sister. Henry drops to his knees, supplicates.
DAREK: You piece of shit! Yes! Henry just breathes. He's unbreakable. A beat.
DAREK (CONT'D): Good.
HENRY: Good?
DAREK: Yes. Darek considers him.
DAREK (CONT'D): Tomorrow. Be more good. Henry and Julie share a look. He actually did it.
JULIE: Does this make me an accessory?
HENRY: I think so. A beat.
JULIE: Things have certainly gotten a lot more interesting since you showed up.
HENRY: You mean since you ran me over... She smiles.
JULIE: So why are you robbing the bank, Henry? He doesn't answer.
JULIE (CONT'D): It's not just about the money, is it?
HENRY: No.
JULIE: So why are you doing it? It takes a moment for him to answer.
HENRY: I used to sit in that toll booth and think about just getting in one of those cars, going wherever they went. Just joining someone else's life.
JULIE: You were asleep at the wheel. Henry smiles.
HENRY: Yeah, I was.
(THEN): It was easier for me to go to jail than tell my wife the truth.
JULIE: Which was?
HENRY: That I was going along with everything. I didn't know I could change it.
(THEN): So now I'm changing it.
JULIE: Robbing the bank is changing it?
HENRY: It already has. She gets the honey out of the cupboard. Pours some in her tea.
JULIE: What was your wife like?
HENRY: Nice. A beat.
HENRY (CONT'D): Are you sure you're okay with this? I know it's a lot. She turns to him.
JULIE: Not for a girl like me, Henry.
DAREK: This is Mr. Henry Smith. He will be taking over the role of Lophakin. If you please. He leads a light round of applause. Henry acknowledges
HENRY: Thanks. Thank you. Looking forward.
DAREK: Top of act three. Twenty minutes. Olga, cigarettes! Henry walks briskly away. Julie watches him...
MAX: Tracks! Trolley tracks! The beam scours the blackness ahead looking for the end....and there it is. A soot-covered WALL maybe ten feet ahead. They reach it. Henry touches the damp, decrepit brick, turns to Max.
HENRY: There's still twenty feet to go. He turns back to him :
HENRY (CONT'D): We're going to need another pair of hands.
HENRY: That's him.
MAX: That's him? Henry and Max watch as JOE grabs his head, flops into a chair. Max looks concerned.
HENRY: Thanks for meeting us.
JOE: Sure. Joe is looking worse for wear.
HENRY: How's your pyramid scheme?
JOE: It wasn't a pyramid scheme.
HENRY: Okay. Joe hits his Schooner Longneck.
JOE: It all fell apart.
(THEN): We were banking on that money, Henry. And now all I've got is a garage full of dumb Korean plastic.
MAX: What's he talking about?
HENRY: Kitchenware.
MAX: Oh.
JOE: See what happens when a person tries to go `legit'?
(THEN): It's killing me. Joe drains his beer. The WAITRESS arrives with a bucket of steaming wings.
HENRY: So how's Debbie?
JOE: She's worried, Henry. The baby's due in a couple months. He grabs a wing. Rips off the meat.
HENRY: She's pregnant?
JOE: Yeah, she's pregnant.
HENRY: Congratulations.
JOE: Thanks, Henry.
(THEN): It's okay if you want to punch me out. Tonight would be a good night. In fact I could use it.
HENRY: Come on. This is great news. (off Joe's hopeless look) It's going to be okay.
JOE: Really? It is? You know how much diapers cost? You know how much it costs to send a kid to college?
MAX: You want to send your baby to college? Joe keeps going on the wings. He's making a meal of it...
JOE: Of course not. I'm just saying. The kid needs stuff. Stuff that's expensive. Stuff it deserves.
(THEN): These things are hot! I'm on fire.
HENRY: Listen, Joe, maybe we can help. A beat.
(WIPING OFF): How?
HENRY: We might have a job for you. Max shoots a look at Henry. Joe chugs a glass of water, looking at both of them now.
JOE: No foolin'?
HENRY: There's maybe twenty feet till the bottom of that vault.
JOE: That's a lot of dirt, Henry. Max studies Joe.
HENRY: So what do you think?
JOE: I think we should get some guns and go get the money through the front door!
HENRY: No guns. People could get hurt.
JOE: What about fake ones?
HENRY: They're still guns.
MAX: Listen Joseph, guns are dangerous and we're not doing a simple hold-up. Tellers and tears and chump change. We're doing an old fashioned heist. We're going right into the belly of the beast.
(THEN): Are you in or are you in?
ON JOE: Considering it... He picks up a shovel and CRUNCHES into the wall of dirt.
JOE: I hope we don't get caught.
JULIE: I hate that commercial.
HENRY: I like it. She looks at him.
JULIE: So what's your plan?
HENRY: For what?
JULIE: For when it's done. After. (making light of it) Am I going to see your picture in the post office or something?
HENRY: I hope not.
JULIE: But have you thought about what happens after?
HENRY: Not really, no. He thinks carefully before he says it :
HENRY (CONT'D): I don't know. Maybe I could meet you out west...
JULIE: Out west?
HENRY: Yeah. Maybe you could meet me there.
(SHE LAUGHS): When did you think of that?
HENRY: Just now.
(THEN): So what about it?
JULIE: What about what?
HENRY: Meeting me --
JULIE: -- I'm not going anywhere, Henry --
HENRY: You're not?
JULIE: No.
HENRY: I thought that was your plan. Do the play
JULIE: Plans change, Henry. Okay? She gets out of bed. Throws on her robe.
JULIE (CONT'D): I think I ran out of maple syrup.
HENRY: Is there a reason you didn't leave before?
JULIE: Because life is fucked. It never works out the way you want it to. Silence...
HENRY: Yeah. Well. Maybe...
(THEN): But you could still meet me.
JULIE: Right! On the lam? You're dreaming.
HENRY: It was just an idea. Why not --
JULIE: This isn't going to work out, Henry. She turns to face him.
JULIE (CONT'D): Didn't we both know that? On Henry.
HENRY: I didn't.
JULIE: I did. Silence.
JULIE (CONT'D): I think you should leave. Henry just stands there...stunned.
MAX: Palm trees. Sandy beaches. All you can eat sunshine. Grapefruits as big as your head! Henry sits across from him.
HENRY: Why couldn't I have met her after?
MAX: Who?
HENRY: Julie. I asked her to meet me. After we're done.
MAX: Oh yeah? What'd she say?
HENRY: She said no.
MAX: Of course she said no.
HENRY: Why of course?
MAX: Because life ain't like that. There's always a cost. That's why they call it life. You got to pay somewhere. The piper must be paid to pipe.
HENRY: I paid already, Max.
(THEN): I don't want to leave her. Max looks at him. About to say something -- A KNOCK at the door.
MAX: Who's that?
HENRY: I'll check. Henry walks to the door.
HENRY (CONT'D): Who is it?
JOE (CONT'D): Sorry, Henry.
EDDIE: The same bank. Shit, Henry. Now that's poetry! I like it.
MAX: Who is this guy? Eddie beams at Max.
EDDIE: Your new partner. Max looks at Henry : `huh?'
MAX: What do you mean?
EDDIE: I'm in. Or you're out.
JOE: I screwed up. Sorry, Max. Joe lies down on the floor. He's drunk as a skunk.
EDDIE: (amused by the whole thing) Joe tells me you guys might need a little help with that vault. I know the whole story.
EDDIE (CONT'D): And I don't dig. Dig?
(THEN): Got any cold ones?
MAX: Joe doesn't know what he's talking about. He's a drunk. He made a mistake. Get out of that chair. Eddie laughs. Leans back on it.
EDDIE: Relax, old man. Henry and I go way back. We've known each other since high school, isn't that right?
HENRY: Yeah. I know you.
EDDIE: Appreciate you keeping your mouth shut, Henry. One thing I admire in a man is the quality of loyalty.
HENRY: What do you want, Eddie?
EDDIE: Nothing. Just the American dream.
MAX: I'm gonna kill him. With a knife.
HENRY: You can't kill him.
JOE: (slurred, on the floor) Yeah. You can't kill him, Max. He's got the vault --
MAX: Shut up, Joe.
JOE: Deb says we can't have sex till the kid's born. Says the kid'll know about it.
MAX: Go home. Please. Before it's too late.
TROFIMOV: I'm sorry to be blunt, but, for God's sake, the man has robbed you.
MADAME RANEVSKY: (stopping her ears) No! No! No! Don't say that!
TROFIMOV: He's a scoundrel: everybody knows it but you. He's a petty scoundrel, a user... ON HENRY, feeling like the accused. From the stage Julie sees him.
MADAME RANEVSKY: You are twenty six or twenty seven, and you're still in the lower grades!
TROFIMOV: Who cares? She locks eyes with Henry now :
MADAME RANEVSKY: You ought to be grown up by now. At your age, you ought to understand about love --
DAREK: Where are you, Djula? Where?!
MADAME RANEVSKY: (with double the fire) You ought to love someone yourself! You ought to have an affair. Yes! Yes!
DAREK: Yes. Yes. Good Djula! Scene.
(THEN): Carlotta and the girls.
(A CLAP): Let's run the magic scene! Julie walks off the stage. She knows Henry is waiting for her.
HENRY: What happened last night?
JULIE: I came to my senses.
(THEN): And you should too. She walks on. He follows...
HENRY: We should talk about it. She turns.
JULIE: I don't want to, Henry.
MAX: (tugging the pulley) Three feet of it so far today. We'll make it. Henry goes to the open doors of the Armoire. The tunnel is deeper now and all lit up...
JOE: What do you think guys? If it's a boy do I cut him or not?
MAX: Well, you know what they say, cleanliness is next to Godliness.
JOE: What do you say, Henry? Before he can answer :
FRANK: Now I see you coming out of the theatre behind the bank. Frank sucks his teeth.
FRANK (CONT'D): I know what you're up to Gentlemen. Henry, Max and Joe look at each other. Frank moves closer. Checks around to make sure no one can hear them.
FRANK (CONT'D): And I want in.
MAX: In on what? Frank snickers.
FRANK: We can't talk here. Let's drive. Max looks at Henry.
HENRY: What's on your mind, Frank?
FRANK: The I.C.R.E. Indigenous Currency Retrieval and Exchange. They exchange glances.
FRANK (CONT'D): Once a month a truck goes to all our partner banks across the border in Canada, picks up all the currency and brings it back home. They're listening...
FRANK (CONT'D): I'd say on average eight to twelve million, held in our vault at First Buffalo for just a few hours before it's picked up for redistribution. Now they're paying attention.
FRANK (CONT'D): Only a bunch of fools would rob that bank any other time. A beat. He leans closer...
FRANK (CONT'D): I can give you that date. I can help with alarms. I can be your guy on the inside.
MAX: Hypothetically say you were right about what we're up to...which you're not. But just say...why would you help us rob your bank?
FRANK: I got my reasons.
JOE: This sounds like a set-up, man -- Frank grabs Joe. Glares into his eyes.
FRANK: I don't fuck around, kid. I told you. I got my reasons.
MAX: Well, forgive us, Frank. But we're going to need to hear them. A beat.
FRANK: The wife got sick a few years ago. Insurance wouldn't pick up all the costs. So I went to the bank. They wouldn't help cover the difference. We were going to retire to the Loire valley.
(DARKLY): We had to use all our savings to cover the bills.
(GETTING IT): The man gave it to you, huh.
FRANK: I spent everything we had -- then she died...thirty years I've been at that bank.
HENRY: What was her name?
FRANK: Annie. Her name was Annie.
HENRY: I'm Sorry. The moment just hangs there...
FRANK: November 23rd. The money's delivered at eight and picked up at midnight. He turns to Henry.
FRANK (CONT'D): I retire in two weeks. This is it.
(THEN): You set up the table. I make sure dinner arrives hot.
HENRY: Shit. ON THE MARQUEE : "Chekhov's `The Cherry Orchard'...Opens NOVEMBER 23rd, 8 PM"
HENRY (CONT'D): Opening night.
MAX: And?
HENRY: That's soon.
MAX: We're going to have pull some nights. Henry thinks...
HENRY: Maybe we should wait. Do it closing night.
MAX: We can't. He's retiring. This is a one time deal.
(THEN): I told you there were going to be tests, Henry. Henry absorbs that. Looks at Max.
MAX (CONT'D): You're going to have to leave her.
(BEAT): No looking back.
REVEAL HENRY: Walking down a corridor toward a NURSE'S STATION at the far end. The doors open for him...he hesitates
HENRY'S POV: DEBBIE in profile, smiling and talking to a seated receptionist who touches her very pregnant belly. Henry takes a step back, the doors close. He watches through the glass a moment... Debbie looks radiant. Peaceful. Happy.
HENRY: Walks back outside again. It's as if he got all the answers he needed...
MAX: There he is!
MAX (CONT'D): You okay, Henry?
HENRY: No. He turns to Max.
HENRY (CONT'D): I'm not leaving her.
JOE: Who?
MAX: The girl -- He throws down his shovel.
MAX (CONT'D): Now listen, Henry. You're digging this tunnel. And you're gonna rob that bank. You're gonna take the money and you're gonna put it in the car and we're gonna drive away.
(THEN): This is one thing. Julie is another thing. This is not that. That is not this. Understand?
JOE: Hey! I think I got something... Joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked-in dirt above his head. Suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free burying Joe who struggles to get out. Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth surface of concrete. The bottom of the vault.
MAX: We have arrived! Look at that. Joe gets to his feet - he looks dazed.
HENRY: Not a cloud in the sky.
MAX: So clear you can see tomorrow.
(THEN): You're a good man, Henry. Thank you.
HENRY: You too, Max. Let's go.
DAREK: In this `American dream' of ours, everyone is happy and smiling, they have achieved their objectives...and yet in life there is only change, upheaval, the birth of the new...and that birth is painful.
ON JULIE: avoiding Henry's gaze.
DAREK (CONT'D): Our play is about misery, disconnection, a future that we don't see hitting us like a train...but tonight, my players, we show them...that this not a future to fear! He leaves. The players applaud --
(THRILLED): Off the cushion in the corner ; double into the centre pocket! Everyone laughs.
SIMON: Ten minutes people!
JULIE: Come in. Henry appears. She's surprised.
HENRY: I want you to meet me in California.
JULIE: Henry, we've been over this --
HENRY: We're doing it tonight. She sits there...
JULIE: What?
HENRY: It's the only time we can get in the
JULIE: Of course! Opening night. What else? Like I said, everything always fucks up --
HENRY: Nothing's fucked up. If it's tonight or a month from now, what's the difference? I still want you to meet me.
JULIE: Nothing's fucked up? Have you looked around recently? You're leaving. What about the goddamn play?
HENRY: Arnold's coming back. Max arranged it already.
JULIE: I'm sure he did. He approaches her...
HENRY: I want us to be together. She laughs. That's so ridiculous to her.
JULIE: We screwed a couple of times, Henry! So what?
HENRY: You know that's not true --
JULIE: No, really. A couple of times.
(THEN): Don't you get it? I don't want to be with you. That cuts him dead.
JULIE (CONT'D): You're a thief. Go rob your bank. A beat. He leaves.
MAX: Enjoy the show, folks! He checks his watch...it's two minutes to eight. He walks briskly up the aisle...
SIMON: On a headset. Points to Henry.
SIMON: Curtain! ON HENRY, watching the curtain start to rise...
THE NURSERY: a long white post-modern room. Sounds of wind. It's may but frosty.
LOPHAKIN: Well, thank god the train is in. What time is it?
DUNYASHA: (checks his watch) Almost two. (blowing out the candle) It's light already. Henry yawns and stretches.
LOPHAKIN: The train's late. At least two hours.
BERNIE: How you doin', Frank? He un-holsters his weapon, covers as Stan opens the back of the truck. Through the glass, Frank smiles.
FRANK: Doin' good, Bernie. Real good. He sucks his teeth.
MADAME RANEVSKY: My nursery, my dear, beautiful, sweet nursery! This is where I used to sleep when I was a little girl! Henry as Lophakin turns to face her, waiting for her to say hello...instead she breezes past him.
GAYEV: Your train was two hours late. How do you explain that? Is that good management?
"YOU": He unzips a fanny pack, pulls out a WIRE CUTTER, but his hands are trembling and he drops it... Thirty feet to the ground.
MAX: Shit.
MADAME RANEVSKY: Oh, my childhood, my innocent childhood! I used to sleep in this nursery.
HENRY: Isn't she beautiful?
SIMON: Yes. She looks out toward the window through which there is now a projection of the ORCHARD, this time in autumnal decay...
MADAME RANEVSKY: Oh, my cherry orchard...
ON FRANK: Waiting...as he and Bernie watch Stan load the money into the vault.
BERNIE: You ever think what you could do with all that money, Frank?
STAN: I know what you'd do. Buy the Bills and put them in first place.
BERNIE: You'd need a lot more money than that. But I guarantee you I'd have them back in the Super Bowl within two seasons.
STAN: Perfect. Another chance to lose. Frank laughs nervously.
MAX: Oh god, oh god. Where are you, you little pischer? He finally finds the right one and CUTS IT :
BERNIE: We're good. Bernie closes the vault.
MADAME RANEVSKY: I'm sure it wasn't in the least funny. I believe people like you should examine their own lives instead of going to the theatre to observe other peoples!
LOPHAKIN: True enough. To be honest. We live a stupid life.
STAN: Well this is it, Frank.
BERNIE: We got you something.
STAN: A little retirement gift. Bernie produces a neatly wrapped gift.
STAN (CONT'D): Go ahead. Open it. Frank does. It's a bag of coffee.
FRANK: Thanks guys.
BERNIE: We wanted to get you something from France.
STAN: You like French Roast, right?
FRANK: Thanks.
(THEN): You know this isn't from France.
BERNIE: What are you talking about? It's French roast.
FRANK: Right. But over there they call it coffee.
STAN: (slightly baffled, at Bernie) But this is French roast...
EDDIE: Where is he? Where's that old man?
MAX: Julie -- Break a leg!
JULIE: Play's already started, Max. She walks past him.
JULIE (CONT'D): Good-bye confidence man.
MAX: Good-bye, Julie.
MAX: Go! Go! Go!
EDDIE: About time, old man.
MAX: Do your job. Joe leans over and pukes on the ground.
EDDIE: Jesus! Not again! What is it with you?
JOE: Sorry.
EDDIE: You're a pussy, Joe, you know that? Eddie grabs the drill. Starts to make a hole. Joe starts to prepare the charges...
MADAME RANEVSKY: Well, what should we do? Tell us what to do?
LOPHAKIN: I tell you every day. Every day I say the same thing over and over. You must rent out the Cherry Orchard and the rest of the Estate for villas. At once, right this second, the auction is coming up very soon -- A muffled BOOM (o.s.) Henry freezes. Julie looks at him.
MADAME RANEVSKY: It's all so vulgar! Another muffled BOOM (o.s.) this time the audience looks around. Julie glares at him.
MAX: That was good, kid. Good acting.
JOE: (a little giddy) There she is. Henry reaches up, touches the steel vault bottom, rubs it.
EDDIE: Get out of there! Eddie arrives in his protection suit, holding a thermite burning tool.
EDDIE (CONT'D): This shit comes straight from hell.
EDDIE: Welcome to my world, bitches. They all look up at THE HOLE.
JOE: Fuck, yeah.
(SMILING): You're on, Henry!
LOPHAKIN: Yes.
MADAME RANEVSKY: Who bought it? Pause.
LOPHAKIN: I did. Madame Ranevsky is overwhelmed by the news. Varya takes her keys and throws them on the floor. Exits in a rage.
LOPHAKIN (CONT'D): I bought it. Wait a minute ; don't rush me. I'm all dizzy. I can't talk...
JOE: Deb's gonna freak.
LOPHAKIN: ...and now the Cherry Orchard is mine. Mine!
(LAUGHING): God! God in heaven. The Cherry Orchard is mine! Tell me I'm drunk, tell me I'm out of my mind, tell me I'm dreaming!
MAX: That's everything.
EDDIE: Yes, it is. Max freezes, suddenly notices Eddie is standing there with A GUN pointed at him and Joe.
MAX: What's that, Eddie?
EDDIE: It's a gun, Max. Max doesn't seem so surprised.
EDDIE (CONT'D): (with the gun) Joe! Take the money out back to my car. Joe doesn't move. Eddie waves the gun.
EDDIE (CONT'D): Joe! Max boldly steps right in front of the gun.
MAX: Stay right where you are, Joe. Eddie puts the gun to Max's stomach.
EDDIE: Don't be stupid, Max.
MAX: You're not going to do this, Eddie. Eddie smiles.
MAX (CONT'D): You can shoot me dead if you want, but you're going to have to shoot me dead. Eddie PUNCHES Max in the gut, then pops him in the head as he throws him back.
EDDIE: I'm not playing with you, old man.
JOE: What are you doing, Eddie? The door swings open -- HENRY -- walks in on the scene...
EDDIE: Welcome to the party, Brando. Seeing the gun, Henry freezes at the door. Eddie's in the middle, Max and Joe by the mouth of the tunnel, Max on the floor, a gash on his forehead from Eddie's blow.
HENRY: What are you doing, Eddie? Eddie turns at him.
EDDIE: It's money, Henry. Money.
MAX: This was your chance you idiot. You could've been a better man but you did it again. You messed up. And now you're back with the maggots. Just one big missed opportunity. Eddie kicks him again.
JOE: Yeah. Come on, Eddie. We're here. We're done. He's right. Come on, man.
EDDIE: Shut up, Joe. Get the money. Put it in the car. Shut up. He turns back to Henry.
EDDIE (CONT'D): Now move, Torne. No happy ending for you. He gestures to the tunnel. Joe suddenly turns back, grabs Eddie's gun hand from behind. THE GUN GOES OFF. They wrestle. Joe bites Eddie's hand.
EDDIE (CONT'D): You animal! Max, straddling Eddie, grabs his head, bangs it on the
MAX: Famach deh mohl! Gey lig mitt'n vahntzin son of a bitch! Henry, a little dazed, picks up the gun.
(TO HENRY): Get the extension chord. He does. They roll Eddie over, start to hog tie his hands then his legs. Eddie starts to freak out.
EDDIE: You couldn't have done this without me.
MAX: Our new partner. Huh. Max stuffs a glove into Eddie's mouth but Eddie still kicks like crazy. Max notices Henry's thigh.
MAX (CONT'D): You ok? Henry sees it now too. It's a graze.
HENRY: I got shot. Henry hears the tannoy. It's his cue. He's late.
HENRY (CONT'D): I gotta get on stage. He rushes out...
GAYEV: Thank you, my friends, thank you. Lophakin rushes on stage. He's late. Yasha, holding a tray with small tumblers of champagne, shoots him a look. Madame Ranevsky enters from the other side, hands out cash to the line of hooded figures.
YASHA: The peasants have come to say good-bye.
(THEN): They're good fellows, Yermolai Aleksayovich but in my opinion a little stupid...
GAYEV: (to Madame Ranevsky) You gave them everything in your purse, Lyuba. Wrong, quite wrong!
MADAME RANEVSKY: I couldn't help it. I couldn't help it. Gayev and Madame Ranevsky walk past Lophakin, ignoring him on their way out.
LOPHAKIN: (still a little out of
BREATH): Won't you please come here and drink a glass as a good-bye?
MAX: Old man, huh. Eddie tries to scream but he can't. As Max shuts the door all light is blotted out.
MADAME RANEVSKY: We're going and not a soul will be here until after we're gone.
LOPHAKIN: Until spring. She notices he's clutching his thigh...
JOE: Where is he?
MAX: Any minute now.
ANYA: Goodbye, home! Goodbye to the old life!
TROFIMOV: Hello to the new life! Trofimov exits with Anya. Varya looks around the room and exits. Yasha and Carlotta exit with the dog. Lophakin to Madame Ranevsky and Gayev :
LOPHAKIN: Until the spring, then. Goodbye my friends, until we meet again!
ON HENRY: As he and Julie exchange a final look. She watches him go...it's as if he's moving in slow motion...
GAYEV: My sister! My sister!
MADAME RANEVSKY: Oh, my dear, sweet, lovely orchard! My life, my youth, my happiness, farewell! Farewell!
MAX: How's the leg?
HENRY: It's fine. Go. Joe guns it.
ON HENRY: Sitting in the back.
JULIE: (as Madame Ranevsky) One last look at these walls, these windows...Dear mother used to love to walk about in this room.
GAYEV: My sister! My sister!
JULIE: (as Madame Ranevsky) We're coming. The sound of the HOODED FIGURES as they chop the trees behind her. It's horrific. Madame Ranevsky holds her hands over her ears and falls to the ground...and begins to weep...
HENRY: Stop the car!
MAX: Henry!
HENRY: Joe, stop the car.
MAX: He can't stop the car, it's the getaway!
JOE: Yeah, you can't --
MAX: What the hell are you doing? Henry starts to run back toward the theatre as best he can... Max sticks his head out the window.
MAX (CONT'D): Henry! But he's already gone...
LOPHAKIN: I had to come back. I couldn't get on the train. The moment I stepped on the platform, the blood drained from my heart. ON JULIE, in shock.
LOPHAKIN (CONT'D): I knew I might never see you again. He steps up on the stage...
DAREK: What is he doing? Why is Lophakin back?!
LOPHAKIN: I had to come back.
(A WHISPER): Henry, what is this? What are you doing?
LOPHAKIN: This is the only way you'll listen to me. She looks out to the audience. EAGER FACES awaiting Madame Ranevsky's response...
MADAME RANEVSKY: You should have gotten on that stupid train. You made a mistake.
LOPHAKIN: The mistake would have been getting on that train without telling you how I feel.
MADAME RANEVSKY: Ha! Don't pretend you care about me. All you care about is money.
LOPHAKIN: You think this is about money?
MADAME RANEVSKY: Yes. He grabs her.
HENRY: It's never been about money. You know that.
MADAME RANEVSKY: Let go of me!
LOPHAKIN: No.
MADAME RANEVSKY: Damn it! Just leave, Henry! (under her breath) Get off the fucking stage --
HENRY: Take a chance. Meet me in Moscow.
MADAME RANEVSKY: No, I'm perfectly happy here.
HENRY: That's not true. Meet me in Moscow. She tries to get away again...
MADAME RANEVSKY: Let me go!
HENRY: I can't. Pause.
MADAME RANEVSKY: Why are you doing this?
LOPHAKIN: You're just afraid.
MADAME RANEVSKY: I'm not afraid of anything -- She kicks out at him.
LOPHAKIN: You're afraid because I love you. That hits her. Pause. She breaks away from him, stepping back...
SHOCKED ACTORS: On the side of the stage.
MADAME RANEVSKY: ...what? She searches his expression now...
HENRY: Meet me in Moscow. She can't move. The audience is rapt.
(SOFTLY): Tell me you'll meet me in Moscow. There are tears in her eyes now...
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Go with him!
DAREK: at the back of the theatre. Stunned :
(TO SIMON): He loves her.
JULIE: Henry. You're bleeding.
HENRY: I know.
DAREK: (whisper to Simon) Lights down ten. Down ten more. Slowly... Julie and Henry in silhouette now.
JULIE: Oh, fuck, Henry... The lights fade, as an image of WHITE CHERRY BLOSSOMS appears on the projection screen...
FRANK: Hello miou-miou. He looks out at the lush valley below. Smiles.
DAWN: A state of the art hospital room. No expense has been spared. A shaky image of DEB's face as JOE frames the video camera. THE BABY comes into view now. It's beautiful. And screaming its little lungs out.
DEBBIE: A girl.
MAX: Time is a medium of exchange. You can buy things with it. Education. Self-respect. You can even figure out your dream. The Guy nods. Max turns. We see him now. He's super tan. He pulls the sheet off his client.
MAX (CONT'D): You're done. Next! Another YOUNG CUSTOMER sits down. There's a few of them waiting their turn, enjoying Max's schtick. The front desk girl hands Max the mail. CLOSE ON A POSTCARD : `Our dream is our truth is our destiny...Love H... xx' Max smiles. Flips over the postcard and only now when he pins it above the mirror do we finally see what it is -- an image of THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN.
MAX (CONT'D): So tell me, Javier. What's your dream?
JULIE: Look. You can see the ocean. He puts his arm around her.
HENRY: `Your brother says I'm an upstart, a money grubber...but I don't care a bit.' She laughs...they kiss in the sun for a while...
EDDIE: I told you before. Dopey. Sleepy. Happy and Doc -- WHAACK! The slap knocks Eddie to the ground. He's under the table now, his face crushed by the Detective's BOOT :
EDDIE: I may be all those things but one thing I'm not...is a rat. Eddie smiles. His face squashed sideways like that, it's a pretty strange kind of smile...
