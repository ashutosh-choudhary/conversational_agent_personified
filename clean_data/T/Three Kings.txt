TROY: Are we shooting people, or what?
TROY: what I'm trying to find out.
SOLDIER #3: It looks like a grain of sand, but I don't know how I'm gonna get it out--
CAPTAIN VAN METER: they don't surrender, then shoot.
VIG (V.O.): (deep southern accent) Congratulations, you got yourself a rag head, my man.
VIG: Dag.
TROY: "Gettin' bugged drivin' up and down the same old strip, gotta find a new place where the kids are hip, I get around --"
SOLDIER #1: I didn't think I'd see anyone get shot over here.
VIG: It looked like the guy's head blew three feet into the air --
SOLDIER #1: Bullshit, that's not what happened.
VIG: I said it happened, but then we got here and he was still breathing.
SOLDIER #2: Oh, my God, it's just like 'Predator,' where the guy, the black guy --
SOLDIER #3: Carl Weathers. His arm gets shot off.
VIG: And when it hits the ground, his hand keeps on firing.
SOLDIER #5: Take my picture.
VIG: Do you still want to sell pictures?
TROY: (distracted monotone) For twenty.
SOLDIER #5: Twenty dollars, man, what's the meaning of life?
TROY: You're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war.
VIG: War's been over five days, Jim, ain't gonna be much more of this.
SOLDIER #5: Bobby, take my picture.
SOLDIER #4: If he shot the guy, it's up to him.
SOLDIER #5: It's not like he shot a fucking deer. It's the enemy.
VIG: Troy's enemy, yours for twenty.
TROY: Accept no substitute, this is the real thing, oh, Jesus [winces] --
VIG: What's wrong?
TROY: I got a really bad headache all of a sudden--
VIG: No free pictures, motherfucker.
BILL SMITHSON (O.S.): Spirits are high and the music is boisterous as these young troops celebrate -- Shit. Let me try that again.
BILL SMITHSON (O.S.): Spirits are high and the music is fucking motherfucking sand in my eye --
ARCHIE GATES: Is that what you got from this experience? A goddamn watch?
HAVICHON: Ees a great fucking watch.
ARCHIE GATES: There's 700 million in gold out there and you're fucking around with a watch?
HAVICHON: Bon dieu de merde, that's a lot of gold, man.
ARCHIE GATES: One bunker of gold and we retire from this horseshit, Hashy--
ARCHIE GATES: is how do you find it?
HAVICHON: Like one sowsan bunker out sair --
ARCHIE GATES: Maybe two sowsan bunker out sair, Hash, how do you find Saddam's bullion?
BILL SMITHSON: for Chrissakes?
ARCHIE GATES: My goodness, Bill, what seems to be the problem?
BILL SMITHSON: I'm trying to do a story here and the fucking sand is blowing in my face --
ARCHIE GATES: You want me to stop the sand? I can't do anything about that.
BILL SMITHSON: No, you're too busy talking about the fucking gold, which by the way makes a great story if you'd get me a goddamn lead on it --
ARCHIE GATES: I think the Saddam story goes more for the jugular, journalistically speaking, I mean, he's still here beating the shit out of his country.
BILL SMITHSON: Would you just be my guide and not my fucking producer? You're my guide.
ARCHIE GATES: OK, go do your celebration story, Bill.
SOLDIER #6: Waaaa-hooooo--
BILL SMITHSON: You're heroes.
SOLDIER #6: We're heroes.
SOLDIER #7: Give war a chance.
BILL SMITHSON: You've exorcised the ghosts of Vietnam with a clear moral imperative --
SOLDIER #5: Is that what we did?
BILL SMITHSON: reporters, goddamn it.
SOLDIER #1: We kicked ass.
SOLDIER #6: We didn't get rid of fucking Saddam --
SOLDIER #8: Which totally sucks a big dick.
SOLDIER #6: Those people are getting reemed --
SOLDIER #7: Bullshit, we saved Kuwait, man.
BILL SMITHSON: Who's getting reemed? The Shiites?
SOLDIER #8: I don't know who they are, man --
SOLDIER #6: We got big firepower but we ain't saving them --
SOLDIER #5: Fuck that, we liberated Kuwait.
SOLDIERS (CHANT): 'If tomorrow all the things were gone that I worked for all my life and I had to start again with just my children and my wife--'
SOLDIERS (CHANT OS): 'I'd thank my lucky stars to --
CHOPPER PILOTS: '--be livin' here today because the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take that awayyyyy --'
TROY: (screaming the song) And I'm proud I to be an American, where at least I know I'm free. And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me. And I'd gladly stand up; next to you and defend her still today. Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God bless the U S A --
CAPTAIN VAN METER: this beer come from we gotta take more Iraqis prisoner tomorrow.
TRANSLATOR (MEGAPHONE): Hasnala shi aluno quibaan --
CAPTAIN VAN METER: We will not hurt you. Lay down your weapons, get on the ground --
TROY: It's cool, no one's gonna hurt you --
VIG: Did you rape and torture anybody in Kuwait, Abdul?
TROY: You're making them all hysterical.
VIG: Take your fucking rags off, take this off. No comprende English, motherfucker?
TROY: What is your fucking problem, Conrad?
VIG: I'm trying to git him to obey the spirit of things but he won't take his rags off.
TROY: (leans down) Sir? We need you to disrobe like all the other towel heads, OK?
VIG: Whoa, it's a freaky thing, Troy.
TROY: There's a document in that guy's ass, Conrad.
VIG: That's the freaky thing.
WALTER: Do you think he ate it?
TROY: It wouldn't come out perfect like that if he ate it.
TROY: Go get it, Private.
IRAQI OFFICER: Hasa man timal!
TROY: Open it up.
VIG: You only gave me one glove.
TROY: I'm sorry I don't have another, but you gotta open it up. That's how the chain of command works.
VIG: What the hell is that?
TROY: Important enough to squeeze your cheeks for.
CATHY DAITCH: You are a trained warrior, trained warrior, trained warrior, Jesus Christ, Colonel!
CATHY DAITCH: (breathless) What's Bill got?
ARCHIE GATES: Just the celebration story.
CATHY DAITCH: That's it?
ARCHIE GATES: That's it --
ARCHIE GATES: How about you? Did you find anything?
CATHY DAITCH: It could be another bullshit lead but I need you to help me find a guy who might have something on the gold --
ARCHIE GATES: Who's the guy?
CATHY DAITCH: Somebody Barlow, maybe in Company
ARCHIE GATES: Barlow.
CATHY DAITCH: Got a map out of a prisoner's head.
ARCHIE GATES: Out of a prisoner's head?
CATHY DAITCH: Or his ear, or his ass, or his dick, and they got like a fifty page full-color mini atlas of Saddam's bunkers --
ARCHIE GATES: Out of a guy's dick?
GENERAL PYE: This is not the way we service the media, Major. Stop her --
MP: You are in violation of code 37D, grinding Major Gates.
ARCHIE GATES: You guys have no manners whatsoever --
GENERAL PYE: We're handling this, OK?
BILL SMITHSON: and he took off on me--
ARCHIE GATES: That's a lot of bullshit.
GENERAL PYE: I give you a prestige job in the media war of the century and the guy feels neglected.
ARCHIE GATES: I'm helping him plenty with his big celebration feature -- Where did you get this fucking star?
GENERAL HORN: They made me a general, pal.
ARCHIE GATES: For what? I don't even know what we did over here, but Schwartzkopf gets a book deal, you get a star, Powell gets to be fucking president--
GENERAL HORN: Are you high? This is a huge win for us.
ARCHIE GATES: Running the press pool's a real big win for me.
GENERAL PYE: You want us to kill more Americans to occupy Iraq?
ARCHIE GATES: I'm just saying it's ironic, that's all.
GENERAL HORN: What the fuck is ironic?
ARCHIE GATES: We got the biggest army in the world here but Iraq still has the d-bag dictator in power, but that's how the world works I guess.
GENERAL PYE: Just take care of Smithson and maybe he'll hook you up to consult on movies.
GENERAL HORN: It's either that or be a security guard when you retire.
ARCHIE GATES: Fuck you, Ron.
GENERAL HORN: I'm a general now, you can't say fuck you to me.
ARCHIE GATES: OK, sir, but there's another thing I'd like to say, if you don't mind.
GENERAL HORN: Go right ahead, Colonel.
ARCHIE GATES: Fuuuuuck yooouuuu, Ronnnnn.
TROY: You've washed your hands like a thousand times, Conrad.
VIG: Lord knows what vermin live in the butt of a dune koon.
DOC: Why do you let this cracker follow you around?
TROY: He's a good kid.
DOC: He's a wall-eyed cracker.
TROY: He's got no high school, man, he's from a group home in Jackson --
DOC: I don't give a shit if he's from Johannesburg. I don't want to hear dune koon or sand nigger from him or anybody.
VIG: Captain uses those terms.
TROY: The point is, Conrad, 'towel head' and 'camel jockey' are perfectly good substitutes.
DOC: Exactly.
VIG: I'm sorry, man, it's a little confusing is all.
DOC: What can I do for your headache?
TROY: Got any Vicadan?
DOC: All gone. How about Caffergot?
TROY: Excellent. Let's translate my Iraqi ass map.
TROY: Van Meter's at the big pow wow?
DOC: We're cool for at least three hours, but keep Walter on the door.
TROY: Would you take those fucking things off?
WALTER: I never got to use night vision.
TROY: They don't work during the day and stand outside the tent.
DOC: These are definitely Saddam's bunkers near Karbala.
TROY: What's inside?
DOC: According to Intelligence -- Picasso, Armani, Rolex, Mercedes, Sony you name it --  Kuwait was Muslim Beverly Hills and Saddam sacked it.
VIG: Man, get an awesome stereo system with like ten BOS speakers  --
TROY: Silver Lexus convertible.
DOC: Lexus doesn't make a convertible.
TROY: Yes, they do.
DOC: Infiniti has one coming.
TROY: You're wrong.
DOC: You can't get a car home from here anyway.
TROY: If I get enough Rolexes I could buy one when I got home.
VIG: One gold Rolex, I get a very fine split level outside Jackson.
TROY: My one problem, see, is the risk here --
DOC: What risk? We already did the risk. I signed up last year to bank some computer training--
TROY: Tell me about it.
DOC: Next thing I know I'm sitting here waiting to get hit by a Scud. I put my life on the line for what purpose I'm not sure, and now the good Lord puts this map in my path --
TROY: He could put a land mine in your path if we try to find this place --
DOC: You're safe with me.
TROY: Cuz you have a galactic plutonium forcefield.
DOC: I don't talk about it. But I do have a ring of Jesus fire.
TROY: You have a ring of Jesus fire.
DOC: I was fire baptized.
VIG: I was baptized in water.
DOC: I'm fire baptized.
TROY: I don't even know what water baptism means.
DOC: For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't, no explanation will suffice. You can benefit from my Jesus ring if you do right by me, you got that?
WALTER: This tent is restricted --
ARCHIE GATES: Get the fuck out of my way.
WALTER: May day, may day --
ARCHIE GATES: Good afternoon.
ARCHIE GATES: Would this be the proctology tent?
DOC: Yes, sir, I mean, no, sir.
ARCHIE GATES: Then maybe it's the urology tent.
TROY: Captain's at a staff meeting.
ARCHIE GATES: That's OK, I'm not looking for a proctologist or a urologist I'm looking for Sargeant Barlow.
ARCHIE GATES: You're on the path to truth when you smell shit, isn't that what they say?
VIG: I don't recognize you, sir. Are you in this division?
DOC: He's not in this division. He's Special Forces.
DOC: He's the guy taking Bill Smithson around.
ARCHIE GATES: And you would be the Three Wise Men, right, Mappy, Slappy, and Pappy --
ARCHIE GATES: That leaves Cappy outside.
WALTER: Damn. Freeze. Do not pass. Hold it, freeze. Stop. Freeze.
VIG: His name is Walter.
ARCHIE GATES: Did you good soldiers present this map to Captain Van Meter?
TROY: Not yet.
ARCHIE GATES: Then I'll take it to him.
TROY: We'll take it to him. Sir.
ARCHIE GATES: It won't do either of us any good then, will it?
TROY: He's our commander, sir. We'd have to tell him you took it.
ARCHIE GATES: It could be nothing but a sandy love letter from one Eye-raqi to another --
TROY: It's a series of bunkers near Karbala.
ARCHIE GATES: Maybe.
TROY: Not maybe, definitely. Recon photos match the map.
ARCHIE GATES: May I look at the goddamn map?
VIG: Dag.
ARCHIE GATES: That's what makes Rangers badass, we get the best flashlights.
ARCHIE GATES: Still looks like a series of three bunkers in three villages. A bit farther to the west.
DOC: Seventy-five klicks north.
ARCHIE GATES: More like 65.
TROY: Much closer to Karbala.
ARCHIE GATES: Leave at dawn, back by lunch, not a big deal. Of course --
ARCHIE GATES: -- there could be nothing inside but starving Arabs and stolen watches, but I think it's worth checking out, even if I have to do it with clueless reservists like you.
ARCHIE GATES: I mean, I could take the map, but you could talk, it starts to become a pain in the ass for me, so we'll do the gold together.
DOC: What gold?
ARCHIE GATES: You don't even know what's inside these bunkers, do you?
VIG: Rolexes.
ARCHIE GATES: Rolexes are swell, but I'm talking about Kuwaiti bullion.
VIG: You mean the little cubes you put in hot water for soup?
ARCHIE GATES: No. Not the little cubes you put in hot water for soup.
TROY: Gold bricks.
ARCHIE GATES: 5 kilos each, $50,000 in today's market.
VIG: For one gold brick?
ARCHIE GATES: I'm sure Mr. Hussein has divided his bricks. into many different hiding places, but just one hiding place should be easy to take, and that would be enough to get us out of our day jobs. Unless the three kings are in love with their day jobs.
VIG: I don't really have a day job.
TROY: What about the risk of taking a Humvee and all that --
ARCHIE GATES: We do this shit all the time.
VIG: What else did you do, sir?
ARCHIE GATES: In Panama we went sailing in Noriega's boats.
TROY: Wow.
ARCHIE GATES: In Vietnam, we got a big gold Buddha, which we unfortunately dropped in a swamp by accident.
DOC: What about Iraqi soldiers?
ARCHIE GATES: Let's see. They had the shit bombed out them for two months, they're deserting all over the place, and they've completely surrendered to us. That's a beaten army in every sense of the word.
ARCHIE GATES: You are now under my command, salute --
ARCHIE GATES: What's the guy's name outside?
TROY: Walter.
ARCHIE GATES: You will take Bill Smithson on a special mission to find the gold story, but it will be a meaningless ride that lasts all morning and takes him nowhere near Karbala, is that clear?
WALTER: How am I gonna get out of the company?
ARCHIE GATES: Your captain will be detained by a friend of mine.
VIG: Is it true you got to take an enemy ear to be Special Forces?
ARCHIE GATES: No, but if you talk to anybody about this, I'll kill you.
CAPTAIN VAN METER: How about if I lean on it, like this?
CATHY DAITCH: Very dashing.
CAPTAIN VAN METER: Does it look too posed?
CATHY DAITCH: Would you ever stand like that?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: I think I might, Jesus, this feels stupid.
CATHY DAITCH: You'll get used to it. First question: did you dream as a boy you'd be commanding an infantry company in a desert war?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: As a boy, I wanted to be either a veterinarian or a CIA sharpshooter --
DOC: Pull.
TROY: I gave you a better arc, Doc.
DOC: What are you talking about?
TROY: I threw the ball in a higher arc that was easier for you to hit.
DOC: Bullshit.
VIG: Blacks make better receivers than quarterbacks.
TROY: Stop speaking right now, Conrad.
DOC: Warren Moon is an excellent quarterback.
VIG: The Oilers have gone nowhere behind Warren Moon.
DOC: Randall Cunningham.
TROY: Don't get down in the mud with him, Doc.
VIG: The Eagles will never get to the Superbowl with him.
DOC: Doug Williams took the Redskins to the Superbowl and won, OK?
TROY: excellent black quarterbacks.
DOC: Hit it, you sorry-assed cracker --
VIG: This gun's too heavy to shoot one-handed like a movie star --
ARCHIE GATES: When we pull up to the bunker, the approach is something called violence of action, which is standard in special operations. It means your movement is so fast and decisive that the guards are frozen and we haven't fired a single shot.
TROY: Shit.
ARCHIE GATES: We dropped a lot of bombs out here and we buried some guys alive --
VIG: What do you mean?
ARCHIE GATES: Bradleys with big plows cut through the berms and covered the trenches --
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.): They had the option to surrender, but they chose to die for their country.
ARCHIE GATES: Let's rehearse.
ARCHIE GATES: We'll say the cow is the primary guard outside the bunker. We pull up fast, and stop short.
TROY: Got it.
ARCHIE GATES: And --
ARCHIE GATES: Who's hurt?
DOC: It's all cow, I think.
VIG: Yeah, it's all cow.
DOC: They said this was swept for mines.
ARCHIE GATES: Mines are forever, Doc. They never get all of 'em.
TROY: (low murmur) 'If you could, help me Rhonda, help help me Rhonda --'
ARCHIE GATES: Did you guys see any action at all?
VIG: Only night bombing on CNN, except for Troy's supercool shooting that guy in the neck--
ARCHIE GATES: Is sepsis cool?
VIG: What's sepsis?
DOC: Infection of the blood.
ARCHIE GATES: As in septic tank, because that's what happens when a bullet hits you. The lead tears in there --
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.): Makes a cavity of dead tissue that closes down in a convulsive motion typical of all gunshot wounds. The cavity fills up with bile and bacteria and you're fucked.
ARCHIE GATES: But other than a wound that blinds, paralyzes, or castrates, the worst wound I've ever seen is something called tension pneumo thorax --
DOC: I heard something about that --
VIG: Tension pneumo what?
ARCHIE GATES: A bullet, or a blade doesn't kill you, but makes a little hole in the lung, so every time you breathe, a little air leaks into the chest cavity, which starts to fill up like a balloon. And that balloon starts to push your organs to the side, crushing your lung, your liver, your heart. Your own breathing kills you, one breath at a time -- kinda like a job you can't stand or a bad lie you once told.
DOC: That's not fatal, they can stop it.
ARCHIE GATES: If you know how to make another little hole in the chest to let the air out, just like you would with an overinflated tire.
TROY: Can we play the Beach Boys when we go in?
DOC: The goddamn Beach Boys.
TROY: I'm not ashamed of liking the Beach Boys. It calms me down. Better than Mozart.
ARCHIE GATES: Bach.
ARCHIE GATES: No -- there.
VIG: We are the Army of the United States of America. We are here to protect you. Remain calm.
ARCHIE GATES: Orders from President Bush, step aside.
IRAQI MOTHER: No milk. Baby milk.
VIG: (into the megaphone) We are here for your protection and safety.
VIG: U.S. Marines in charge here.
TROY: Shit.
FRIENDLY IRAQI: I am love United States of Freedom. I am hate Saddam.
DOC: Let him go.
FRIENDLY IRAQI: No problem, my friend.
FRIENDLY IRAQI: You look for the chemical weapon?
TROY: No. We look for the gold.
ARCHIE GATES: Where?
FRIENDLY IRAQI: (points to map) This bunker. I'll take you.
SHIITE WOMAN: Hos-pital.
SHIITE MAN: America help.
BILL SMITHSON: damn story, goddamn it, where the hell is the gold?
WALTER: out by the marshes?
WALTER: in spite of massive pollution --
DOC: I'm all right, I'm cool.
ARCHIE GATES: What is the art of war, because it is not for killing people, it's a stratagem to give life to many by killing the evil perpetrated by a few -- I am burning up in this goddamn suit --
ARCHIE GATES: Discriminating use of violence as a last resort, and even then, carefully, surgically, that's what I learned, that's what I'm good at. But now they underestimate all this, bomb the same towns for six weeks  and still leave the scumbag dictator to starve and butcher his own people.
TROY: (agitated) I don't even know what happened back there. Civilians were spitting on their own soldiers; the soldiers were shooting the civilians and ignoring us --
DOC: They already surrendered to us. Now they're after Shiites.
VIG: What exactly is a Shiite?
ARCHIE GATES: They make up the ethnic majority but they don't have any power. When Bush pulled us out, he told them to start a civil war to bring Saddam down, and now they're getting wasted.
VIG: (totally puzzled) The civil war? How could it be the civil war?
TROY: It's a war inside the same country, Conrad. That's a civil war.
ARCHIE GATES: Put these on, we are now U.S. Marines.
TROY: I can't do this, OK? Because I've got a family and if I shit in a bag the rest of my life cuz I got shot after the war's already over that would be pretty fucking stupid, wouldn't it?
ARCHIE GATES: What is the most important thing in life?
TROY: What the fuck are you talking about?
ARCHIE GATES: What is it?
TROY: Did you hear anything I said.
VIG: Respect is the most important.
ARCHIE GATES: Too dependent on other people.
DOC: Money.
ARCHIE GATES: Comes and goes, man.
TROY: What is this bullshit?
DOC: What's the most important thing?
ARCHIE GATES: Necessity. That's what dictates what will happen at any given time in life. Necessity says we don't spend American lives taking out Saddam,  which leaves Saddam the necessity of taking out the Shiites so he can stay in power, which leaves us to take the gold.
TROY: We could've been shot.
ARCHIE GATES: us?  We decimated their entire country. They're scared shitless of us. [looks at his watch] There's time to try another bunker. I say we go.
DOC: Let's do it.
VIG: Rock and roll.
TROY: OK. And I'll be wearing fashionable kevlar. As a necessity.
BILL SMITHSON: (on cell phone) I'm at some goddamn marsh, all we've seen are Russian cranes.
WALTER: Pelicans.
BILL SMITHSON: (on the cell phone) I think the Saddam story goes more for the jugular, journalistically speaking, Al. Let's grow some balls and do the Shiite uprising, for Christ's sake.
BILL SMITHSON: We're going north to do the Shiites.
WALTER: I thought the gold was the hot spot.
BILL SMITHSON: Karbala's the new hotspot, and I'm driving.
WALTER: Military regulations, you cannot drive.
WALTER: Get off the vehicle, sir.
WALTER: Don't make me shoot you, sir.
CAPTAIN VAN METER: The M-16 is the basic weapon of the infantry. During Vietnam, it was fully automatic.
GENERAL HORN (O.S.): Doug?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: Yes, General.
GENERAL HORN: What the fuck are you doing?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: Well, I'm giving an interview to
GENERAL HORN: Do you have authorization?
GENERAL HORN: No.
CAPTAIN VAN METER: No?
GENERAL HORN: Who gave you this?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: Major Gates.
GENERAL HORN: Archie Gates gave you this? Jesus Christ, Doug, come with me.
CAPTAIN VAN METER: I don't get to do the interview?
GENERAL HORN: No, you don't get to do the interview.
ARCHIE GATES: (into the megaphone) United States Marine Corps. Put your weapons down.
VIG: Don't make me smoke your ass, Abdul.
ARCHIE GATES: in Safwan, March 3, the United States Marines hereby confiscate all material stolen by Iraq from the Emirate of Kuwait --
IRAQI RIFLE-LOADER: Isnam panan fatwa aznir --
ARCHIE GATES: Never hit anyone with your pistol, Doc.
DOC: Sorry about that.
IRAQI CAPTAIN: For wife.
ARCHIE GATES: I've been divorced three times.
RIFLE IRAQI #2: Newest and best.
TROY: No, newest and best has better noise reduction.
TROY: Less distortion. Get down on the floor, OK?
TROY: This is bad music, understand? It's bad for you.
DOC (O.S.): Hey --
ARCHIE GATES: (to Iraqi Captain) Where's the gold, Captain? Tell us so we don't have to kill you.
TROY: There's another room over here.
IRAQI SARGEANT: I am just do my job, buddy.
INTERROGATOR: These Shiite. Iraq problem. United States is out now.
INTERROGATOR: We take them outside, so it don't bother you, OK, sir? Kata fanam.
ARCHIE GATES: Take us to the basement.
VIG: Don't start this shit again.
VIG: I know ya'll Shiite gettin' yer asses whipped --  Hey, what the hell is going on here?
VIG: Git on the fucking ground, Arab.
IRAQI SARGEANT: Prisoner stay. Gabar matan.
VIG: What the fuck are you talking about?
IRAQI CAPTAIN: It's my ass, donkey dick, Saddam will shoot me dead.
INTERROGATOR: Saddam worries more about the Shiite than the gold.
VIG: (into the megaphone) This is the United States Military.
IRAQI CAPTAIN: It's Saddam's gold.
INTERROGATOR: Shut up, he signed the treaty.
ARCHIE GATES: Listen to me: we leave you alone to kill your Shiites, but everything you took from Kuwait, that belongs to us now, understand?
ARCHIE GATES: Put it back.
DOC: Why?
ARCHIE GATES: Stick to the plan. The plan is for gold.
TROY: Is this five kilos?
ARCHIE GATES: Yeah, that's five kilos.
TROY: Five, six, seven, eight, there's sixty bricks in this suitcase.
DOC: Times 50K each --
TROY: Three million dollars.
ARCHIE GATES: Ten suitcases; sixty bricks each. That's thirty million dollars.
TROY: I'm gonna get a fleet of Lexus convertibles in different colors.
DOC: I told you Lexus doesn't make a convertible.
TROY: I'll bet you a Lexus they do.
DOC: OK, you're on for a Lexus, but it won't be a convertible.
TROY: Shit.
ARCHIE GATES: They didn't get it here in these bags.
DOC: The tensilary strength goes to 200 pounds.
TROY: The what?
DOC: Tensilary strength, it's what the suitcase can hold.
ARCHIE GATES: Why would you know that?
TROY: He works at an airport.
DOC: 60 bars, 13 pounds each is like -- 800 pounds. The smaller Vuittons handle 65.
ARCHIE GATES: You got any more luggage here?
ARCHIE GATES: It's crazy to take it all, we're not prepared for it. It's crazy not to take it all, how can we leave it?
TROY: What's the shipping plan?
ARCHIE GATES: I told you that's handled.
TROY: How is it handled? You have to tell us now.
DOC: Yeah, tell us now.
ARCHIE GATES: (pacing) I've got a friend, he's in French Special Forces. He's gonna put it in barrels filled with oil and bury it. In a few weeks, he'll drive it to Yanbu --
TROY: Where's Yanbu?
ARCHIE GATES: It's a port in Saudi.
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.): Where another friend will ship it on a Turkish boat up the Red Sea to Perpignan, where a French boat will take it to Baltimore --
TROY: I don't know about getting them to Baltimore, but these hat boxes ain't gonna fit in the Humvee.
ARCHIE GATES: We need a trailer.
TROY: OK, I'll call U-Haul in Karbala to see what they have on the lot today.
ARCHIE GATES: See what you can get, Barlow.
TROY: Conrad, we need a trailer --
VIG: Did you get it? Troy, did you get it?
TROY: Yeah, we got it.
VIG: Is it a lot?
TROY: Yeah, it's a lot.
TROY: (under his breath) 'Little deuce coupe with a fiat head mill, she'll walk a Thunderbird like it's standin' still --'
TROY: 'She'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored --'
TROY: 'She's my little deuce coupe --'
IRAQI MAJOR: You take the Kuwaiti gold, yes?
ARCHIE GATES: We take the Kuwaiti gold. Yes.
IRAQI MAJOR: Saddam cannot keep.
ARCHIE GATES: No, Saddam cannot keep.
IRAQI MAJOR: Saddam have too many problem today.
ARCHIE GATES: He certainly does.
IRAQI MAJOR: You need help to load?
ARCHIE GATES: We can do it ourselves.
IRAQI MAJOR: Hazal jarat finan.
IRAQI MAJOR: These man help you.
INTERROGATOR: You go away fast from this bullshit.
ARCHIE GATES: Let's load up and get out of here.
TROY: Lay that one flat; OK, sideways --
ARCHIE GATES: This isn't gonna work.
TROY: Sure it is --
IRAQI MAJOR: You need a truck.
ARCHIE GATES: We'll rig two carts.
TROY: Let's take the truck.
ARCHIE GATES: We're not taking their truck.
TROY: Why not?
IRAQI MAJOR: We cooperate with peace accord. Please take truck.
TROY: Let's take the truck.
IRAQI MAJOR: Nazaran yafit haisul.
ARCHIE GATES: This has to stop.
INTERROGATOR: You get your ass kick in a war, it feel good to be strong again.
ARCHIE GATES: What did you say?
IRAQI MAJOR: You go now, please.
ARCHIE GATES: I don't think so. I'm sure you know about the Geneva Convention, right?
INTERROGATOR: Geneva convention? You bomb my house, man.
IRAQI MAJOR: That Shiite man is leader of uprising. He kill my man.
TROY: Archie, let's stick to the plan, sir. The plan is for gold, right?
DOC: We can help them first, then be on our way.
TROY: No, we can't. It's not what we're here for.
ARCHIE GATES: How much?
IRAQI MAJOR: What?
ARCHIE GATES: How much gold do you want to let these people come with us?
INTERROGATOR: Cannot do.
ARCHIE GATES: What do you mean, cannot do? I'm offering you a lot of money.
IRAQI MAJOR: Cannot let Shiite go --
INTERROGATOR: Saddam kill us.
IRAQI MAJOR: Saddam kill to me if we let them go, OK? Now you go.
ARCHIE GATES: Cover me.
TROY: Jesus Christ, we can't save everybody.
ARCHIE GATES: Are you listening? I said cover me.
ARCHIE GATES: No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is that clear?
VIG: Yes, sir.
ARCHIE GATES: Because we know what bullets do to vital organs, don't we?
VIG: Make infected pockets filled with bile, sir.
ARCHIE GATES: That's right, that's what they do.
IRAQI MAJOR: (pissed) U.S.A. is out of Shiite war.
ARCHIE GATES: No shooting.
ARCHIE GATES: Cover these three.
ARCHIE GATES: Doc.
DOC: Down.
IRAQI SOLDIER: Kazal stan hamir in fatar.
ARCHIE GATES: Put the Shiites in the Humvee.
TROY: necessity?

VIG: Grenade launcher, sir.
ARCHIE GATES: No. Let's get out of here.
TROY: It's about fucking time.
TANK IRAQI: Hazal mafan.
TROY: We were home free, you stupid son of a bitch.
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.): What's the tank doing?
DOC: Cover your face, Conrad. Cover your mouth, man.
TROY: Goddamn it.
ARCHIE GATES: Don't do it, this isn't sarin. We'd be dead by now.
DOC: Is it mustard?
ARCHIE GATES: It's C.S.
DOC: What's that?
ARCHIE GATES: Tear gas times ten, but it's not lethal. Where's Barlow?
DOC: I don't know.
ARCHIE GATES: Don't move.
VIG: What's going on?
DOC: Get in the tunnel.
DOC: You're gonna die.
VIG: him there.
VIG: Troy --
ARCHIE GATES: I had no choice.
VIG: You had a choice.
ARCHIE GATES: like that and take the gold and live my life like nothing happened, and if you can, then I hope you die right now.
VIG: What about Troy? What choice does he have now?
IRAQI SOLDIER (SUBTITLES): Can we shoot him?
IRAQI SOLDIER #2 (SUBTITLES): We're not even supposed to have American prisoners.
INTERROGATOR (SUBTITLES): He's proof they broke the cease- fire.
BILL SMITHSON: Start shooting, Paco.
WALTER: I don't like this, we gotta go--
OPERATOR (O.S.): Jalam nafad.

DARLENE: That's our little Krystal.
TROY: How's she doing?
DARLENE: She hasn't been sleeping good, and Mamma had to go back to work, so I'm real, real tired, baby.
TROY: I wish I was there to help, gooney- bird.
DARLENE: Oh, gooney-bird, when are you coming home?
TROY: I'm working on that right now, baby.
DARLENE: I saw an ad for a computer job. You want me to call and set up an interview for my war hero?
TROY: Listen, honey --
DARLENE: What date are you coming home?
TROY: They haven't given us an exact date yet. Listen --
DARLENE: I'm henpecking you.
TROY: No, you're not.
DARLENE: I'm lonely and tired and most of all, I miss you.
TROY: I miss you, too.
DARLENE: What was that?
TROY: The wall just exploded.
DARLENE: I thought the war was over, honey.
TROY: It is and it isn't, babe. Can you do me a favor and call the C.O. on base?
DARLENE: You want me to call the C.O.?
TROY: Tell him I'm stuck in a bunker near 223 north outside Karbala --
DARLENE: What do you mean 'stuck'? I thought the war was over.
TROY: I'm gonna be fine, honey, I don't want you to worry, I tried to do something for the family,  and I want you to know --
DARLENE: Know what?
TROY: That I love you.
DARLENE: What's happening, Troy?

DARLENE: What are you talking about?
TROY: Gotta go, gooney-bird, I love you--
DARLENE: Troy?
BILL SMITHSON: Spirits are high and the music is soaring as these young troops celebrate --
BILL SMITHSON: I'm being held captive by Iraqi troops in the gritty city of Karbala, where Shiite --
PACO: You said gritty city again.
BILL SMITHSON: OK, we'll go again.
PACO: What about Private Wogoman, Bill?
BILL SMITHSON: Let's lay a few of these down first. In three, two, and, I'm being held captive in a gritty suburb of Karbala, where Shiite fundamentalists are rising up --
IRAQI CAPTAIN: You better not let that fucking reporter see you doing this.
IRAQI SARGEANT: Hey, that's the CNN guy.
IRAQI CAPTAIN: Wow. He's much shorter in person.
IRAQI CAPTAIN: Get them out of here
BILL SMITHSON: At least let me keep the tape.
WALTER: Could I have my helmet, please?
WALTER: Helmet. On my head.
GENERAL HORN: Who's missing?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: Is Doc here?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: Doc's not here?
GENERAL HORN: You don't know where one of your own fucking aides is?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: How about Barlow?
GENERAL HORN: Check all the radio transmissions.
CAPTAIN VAN METER: I run a tight company, Ron. Don't break my bails.
GENERAL HORN: I'm not breaking your balls, Doug, I want to find these guys.
INTERROGATOR: (heavy accent) What is your rank, bro?
TROY: Master sargeant.
INTERROGATOR: Your company?
TROY: B Company, infantry, United States Army.
INTERROGATOR: My main man. Tell me something, OK? What is problem with Michael Jackson?
TROY: What do you mean?
INTERROGATOR: The King of Pop. 'I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it --'
TROY: Yeah, Michael Jackson.
INTERROGATOR: He is fahking the small boys, man.
TROY: What are you talking about?
INTERROGATOR: He come to Egypt with the small boys. I see picture in newspaper, always he is with the small boys in the hotel window. Hello with the white glove. I am King of Pop in my hotel with the small boys. No girls. Just the boys.
TROY: He likes kids.
INTERROGATOR: Yeah, he like to fahk them up the ass.
TROY: Bullshit.
INTERROGATOR: You are the blind bullshit, my main man.  It is so obvious he like the small boy so he all the time travel with them.
TROY: Fine.
INTERROGATOR: And if it really true? You say --
TROY: I say it's sick.
INTERROGATOR: That's because you got a sick country, bro, you got no respect for the children. That's why you bomb them over here, right?
TROY: I don't think so.
INTERROGATOR: Michael Jackson is Pop King of sick fahking country.
TROY: Wrong.
INTERROGATOR: Bullshit wrong, dude. A black man make the skin white and the hair straight. You know why?
TROY: No.
INTERROGATOR: Your sick fahking country make the black man hate hisself, just like you hate the Arab and the children you bomb.
TROY: I don't hate children.
INTERROGATOR: Do they care, buddy?
TROY: Does who care?
INTERROGATOR: Do your army care about the Shiite children? Do they come to help?
TROY: No, they're not coming.
INTERROGATOR: (in subtitles) That seemed like too much volts. You got to build it up slow.
INTERROGATOR: Just figure it out.
INTERROGATOR: Are they coming to help the Shiite?
TROY: No.
INTERROGATOR: Tell the truth, dudesky. Save us the big bummer.
INTERROGATOR: Does it hurt?
INTERROGATOR: I ask you question, bro.
TROY: Yes, it hurts.
INTERROGATOR: You bomb my family. Do you know that?
INTERROGATOR: You blow up my home. The whole street. My wife is crush by big fahking block of concrete. She lose her legs, bro, and she got nice legs, too. Those legs cut off now.
TROY: (whispers) That's horrible.
INTERROGATOR: What?
TROY: (whispers) I said, that's horrible.
INTERROGATOR: Oh, my God, buddy. I didn't even told you the horrible part yet.
INTERROGATOR: My son was kill in his bed. Did you heard that, dude?
TROY: Yes.
INTERROGATOR: He is one years old. He is asleeping with his toy doll when. the bomb come. You see that guy over there?  He lose his daughter same way: big USA bomb.

INTERROGATOR (OS): How old is she?
TROY (OS): Ten days old.
INTERROGATOR (OS): What's her name?
TROY: Krystal.
INTERROGATOR: What makes you decide to tell me about Krystal, my main man?
TROY: Because we're both fathers.
INTERROGATOR: I'm not a father no more, dude, remember? My son is dead now.
DOC: I'm OK. I'm cool. I'm a survivor.
VIG: Is that guy dead? Where you gonna put him?
SHIITE CLERIC: A shrine.
VIG: What kind of shrine ya'll got?
SHIITE CLERIC: Shrine that wash 700 year of sin.
VIG: Hey, that's a pretty good shrine, right, Doc?
VIG: I'm sorry I hit you, man. I was scared for Troy, I don't want nothing to happen to him, he's my friend. Doc? Come on, man, I know you was comin' to help me --
VIG: Maybe we got kicked out of the ring of Jesus fire, on account of stealing.
DOC: That's not how it works.
VIG: How does it work?
DOC: I take care of what Jesus puts in front of me. That's what we did with the gold.
VIG: What about now?
DOC: I'm gonna see.
ARCHIE GATES: How you doing, Conrad?
VIG: I'm good to go, chief.
ARCHIE GATES: Let's check the suitcases.
DOC: We're missing 28.
ARCHIE GATES: That leaves 92 suitcases, five bars each --
ARCHIE GATES: 23 million dollars. Not bad for a disaster, provided we can find Barlow, get back before dark and not get busted.
ARCHIE GATES: It was my choice today. So you can head back if you want. I'll find Barlow myself.
DOC: What about the gold?
ARCHIE GATES: Take what you can carry. Try to find a vehicle. Bury what you have outside camp. Be careful about it.
VIG: I want to find Troy.
DOC: I'm in.
ARCHIE GATES: OK, where does that leave us? We don't have any water, we're dehydrated. You got a radio here?
ARCHIE GATES: How is she?
DOC: How -- is -- your -- little girl?
VIG: Broken -- arms. Girl.
MAN IN GLASSES: She's traumatized, what the fuck do you expect?
MAN IN GLASSES: I went to b-school at Bowling Green.
VIG: What's b-school? Is that like terrorist training?
MAN IN GLASSES: I came back to open a couple of hotels near Karbala. I'm almost in the black when Saddam starts this stupid fucking war and you guys bomb the shit out of my cafes. Now we try to get rid of Saddam, Bush leaves us twisting in the wind, Un- be-fucking-lievable man.
ARCHIE GATES: You got a radio?
MAN IN GLASSES: No radio. No water.
ARCHIE GATES: Where's Barlow?
MAN IN GLASSES: They got him, I saw it happen. And they won't take him back to the same place.
ARCHIE GATES: Where would they take him?
MAN IN GLASSES: Oasis Bunker. It's full of Saddam's hard core guys.
DOC: Where's that?
MAN IN GLASSES: Like 17 - 18 klicks from here.
ARCHIE GATES: Take us there.
MAN IN GLASSES: We got no wheels.
ARCHIE GATES: We'll walk until we find some.
MAN IN GLASSES: Why don't you call in the Marines?
ARCHIE GATES: With what? We don't have a radio.
MAN IN GLASSES: OK, we'll find a vehicle. You drive back to get the choppers, they fly in to get your man.
ARCHIE GATES: We can't do that.
MAN IN GLASSES: Why not? You got a huge army here.
ARCHIE GATES: We're not supposed to be involved with Shiites. We killed Iraqi soldiers. We broke the peace- accord.
MAN IN GLASSES: Tell them it happened when you reclaimed the gold. Don't tell them it was about us.
ARCHIE GATES: They'd find out, we'd go to jail.
MAN IN GLASSES: You know what I think? I think maybe you're boosting the gold. That's what I think.
ARCHIE GATES: You're wrong.
MAN IN GLASSES: They got half a million men in the desert, they send four guys to pick up all this bullion? I don't think so.
ARCHIE GATES: We need to find our man. How much do you want to take us there?
MAN IN GLASSES: Fifteen suitcases.
ARCHIE GATES: That's too much.
VIG: Give it to him. We've got a lot.
ARCHIE GATES: We're gonna need it to buy our way back today, so we better spend it wisely. I'll give you eight.
MAN IN GLASSES: You need some guns, right? You lost your gear.
ARCHIE GATES: Yeah, we need some guns.
MAN IN GLASSES: You need some fighters, too. I mean, you can try to take Oasis on your own, but look at these grunts --
ARCHIE GATES: Yeah, OK, we need some fighters.
MAN IN GLASSES: So that's worth more than eight suitcases.
ARCHIE GATES: Ten.
MAN IN GLASSES: Fifteen.
ARCHIE GATES: That's four million dollars.
MAN IN GLASSES: I think we need it more than you, John Doe, don't you?
ARCHIE GATES: Archie Gates.
IMAM (MAN IN GLASSES): Imam Katar. I'll give you back five suitcases to get us over the Iranian border.
ARCHIE GATES: What?
IMAM: We gotta get to a refugee camp or we're dead. The camps are in Iran.
DOC: We can't go to the Iranian border.
IMAM: Then we don't have a deal.
DOC: We saved your life.
IMAM: And we saved yours.
ARCHIE GATES: We lost a man for you.
IMAM: What good is it if you leave us to get wasted? The big army of democracy beats the ugly dictator, saves the rich Kuwaitis, but you go to jail if you help us escape the same dictator.  You saw what happened to my wife. Look at my daughter.
ARCHIE GATES: Who's going?
IMAM: Everyone but the priests. That's
VIG: Fuck it. We'll find this place on our own.
IMAM: It's not on a map. You can look.
DOC: Somebody else will take us.
IMAM: Jarat yalam fantam uraz.
IMAM: I don't think so.
VIG: This is a human life we're talking about.
IMAM: (laughs) Tell me about it.
INTERROGATOR: I only join Saddam Hussein army to make good living for family, good car, good house, and now my son is dead.
TROY: I signed up for the extra cash, too.
INTERROGATOR: We got a lot in common, dude. I got training and guns from America.
TROY: Not from America.
INTERROGATOR: Oh, yeah, specialist guys come to Iraq, train us when we fight Iran.
TROY: What did they train you in?
INTERROGATOR: Weapons, sabotage. Interrogation.
TROY: Great.
INTERROGATOR (O.S.): So what we get from this dirty Iraq war you and me, huh?
TROY: (whispers) I don't know.
INTERROGATOR: (laughs) You don't fahking know, right?! We all scahmbag soldier who get fahked, right?
TROY: Right.
TROY: So why are you doing this to me?
INTERROGATOR: It's my job, man, for Saddam, just like your job when you bomb my house.
TROY: It's not just a job, it still matters what you do.
INTERROGATOR: Bullshit. It's all a job.
TROY: you're doing right now matters.
TROY: people, it's a stratagem to give life to many with minimum violence, minimum --
INTERROGATOR: and kill my son? Can you think how it feels inside your heart if I bomb your daughter?
TROY: Worse than death --
TROY: Don't --
INTERROGATOR: Everyday, inside my heart --
INTERROGATOR: Like this, like this, like this --
ARCHIE GATES: Did we save anything from the Humvee?
DOC: This bag.
VIG: You got the same name as the tall model who does David Bowie.
DOC: That's Im- Imam with an 'm.'
VIG: That's the same name.
DOC: It's not the same name.
VIG: Whatever. They're both attractive names.
ARCHIE GATES: Come out of the truck with your weapons in the air.
VIG: Shit. Sorry.
ARCHIE GATES: They used a lot of decoys to throw off our bombers.
DOC: Where are we gonna get a vehicle?
IMAM: I know a place that's full of deserters. Maybe they got something.
SHIITE: America!
SHIITE #2: America! Friend!
SHIITE: Freedom! Thank you to America!
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: Food? You give food?
ARCHIE GATES: We don't have any food.
DOC: Where'd you get these animals from?
IMAM: (translates) Kishan tramai jahal?
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: Kuwait Zoo. Nabal hazala fan taq.
IMAM: This is for you, my friend, to eat if you are hungry.
ARCHIE GATES: No, thank you.
IMAM: They're not barbarians, they're starving.
DOC: I'm getting really dizzy, man.
ARCHIE GATES: We need water.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: Water all gone. No one have water.
ARCHIE GATES: Radio?
FRIENDLY IRAQI: No radio.
ARCHIE GATES: No radio, no water, but yes CNN.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: George Bush get rid Saddam.
ARCHIE GATES: Not exactly.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: Congratulation!
ARCHIE GATES: Would you explain to these gentlemen that we need a vehicle of some kind?
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: From Kuwait.
DOC: Could I ask a question?
DOC: Does Lexus make this model?
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: No. Infiniti convertible only.
FRIENDLY IRAQI 2: No Lexus convertible.
DOC: Exactly what I said.
ARCHIE GATES: Listen. We use these cars to go fight Saddam soldiers.
DOC: What's so funny?
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: Cannot take.
DOC: What do you mean, cannot take? We kicked Saddam's ass. We definitely take.
ARCHIE GATES: We are the United States military.
IMAM: You're three guys with a bunch of Shiites and no Humvee.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: Need money. Have no money. To eat. To live. Kish falan azar yat imal tanat.
IMAM: He says the Americans have many tanks, many airplanes. We have nothing.
ARCHIE GATES: We will rise up together.
IMAM: Jihala vamat.
ARCHIE GATES: races, many nations. Tell him, Doc.
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: George Bush.
ARCHIE GATES: He wants
ARCHIE GATES: own.
ARCHIE GATES: a free Iraq.
ARCHIE GATES: What do you say now, my friend?
FRIENDLY IRAQI: Cannot give car.
ARCHIE GATES: Then I guess we'll have to buy them.
VIG: Judas Priest will pump you, Doc --
DOC: I already had it with the Beach Boys today.
VIG: One song.
ARCHIE GATES: We get our man, we come back to pick up the gold --
IMAM: And my people.
ARCHIE GATES: My gold isn't here, and I mean all of it, your people will not survive.
IMAM: I understand.
ARCHIE GATES: OK. Let's load and go.
VIG: Wait a second, I want to talk about this plan some more --
ARCHIE GATES: We're going to drive in and get Troy, exactly like we discussed.
VIG: I have a bad feeling like we're gonna get wasted.
ARCHIE GATES: You're scared. It's good to be scared when there's guns around.
DOC: I'm cool. I'm all right.
TROY: Your son wouldn't be dead if Saddam didn't invade Kuwait.
INTERROGATOR (O.S.): I know.
TROY (O.S.): I heard about some bad shit that happened there.
TROY: Who's got the sick country?
INTERROGATOR: Maybe Saddam is very crazy, right? And then you are crazy to bomb all of Iraq.
TROY: Too much bombing is crazy, but not saving Kuwait.
INTERROGATOR: You come here to save Kuwait people?
TROY: Yes.
INTERROGATOR: Really? (to the Second Iraqi) Jahaza fan.
INTERROGATOR: Lots of people in trouble around this world, my man. You don't fight no fahking war for them.
TROY: You invaded another country. You can't do that.
INTERROGATOR: Why not, dude?
TROY: It makes the world crazy. You got to keep it stable.
INTERROGATOR: For what? Your pick up truck?
TROY: No, for stability. Stabilize the region.
INTERROGATOR: This is your fahking stability, my main man.
VIG: Splinter.
SHIITE: Come on.
VIG: Go straight, go straight --
INTERROGATOR: Are you feeling stable enough for more?
DOC: Stop shooting, what's the matter with you?
VIG: Jesus God, I don't wanna get hit, please Jesus, watch over me --
INTERROGATOR: It's OK, buddy, we are just talking now --
ARCHIE GATES: Let's go.
ARCHIE GATES: Come on.
VIG: You gotta be my disguise, Mr. Shiite, cuz they need my help over there --
IRAQI #2: Fuck a donkey, no way.
TOUGH IRAQI: They killed your families, you fucking cowards.
ARCHIE GATES: just do what I say, do you hear me?
ARCHIE GATES: give it a five second fuse. That gives you two steps out the door.
VIG: God help me.
ARCHIE GATES: OK.  Shorter fuse this time.
ARCHIE GATES: here.
TROY: (agitated) Where's Conrad?
TROY: You got a Rolls?
ARCHIE GATES: It's been a busy day.

DOC: I think he's in shock.
TROY: It's a fucking Infiniti convertible, isn't it?
DOC: Yes.
TROY: OK. So I owe you a car. I'm not in shock.
IMAM: Take it easy.
TROY: Who is this guy?
ARCHIE GATES: He's with us.
TROY: You're the guy with the little girl.
IMAM: That's right.
TROY: What are you doing here?
ARCHIE GATES: He helped us find you.
TROY: All right. You're all right.
TROY: How's your girl?
IMAM: She's safe. For the moment.
TROY: All right. Excellent. How can we help?
DOC: Calm down, man.
TROY: I'm calm. Don't I look calm?
IMAM: We had a deal to get us to the border, but we need more vehicles for these people.
TROY: We're gonna work it out. We can do it. We have to work it out.
DOC: I'm not sure how. This is a lot of people.
TROY: OK, you choose who we take. You tell the others it's not convenient, they'll have to die.
DOC: Take it easy, man.
TROY: You think I don't know what I'm saying. I know what I'm saying. We're gonna do more than steal, that's what I'm saying. We're gonna help these people out.
IMAM: This guy was worth saving.
ARCHIE GATES: He's a soldier.
ARCHIE GATES: moves.
IMAM: (translates) Haza janav yasat.
VIG: You made it, man --
VIG: What happened to the Jesus fire, Doc?
DOC: It's around you right now, man, it works on this side or the other side.
VIG: You never told me that part. I guess I could go to one of them shrines that erase the bad you did --
TROY: We made the right choice today, Conrad.
VIG: We did good, right?
TROY: We made the right choice.
DOC: Dear Lord watch over this man, help him if you can. Our father who art in heaven --
DOC: -- hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done --
SOLDIER #5: Take my picture.
VIG: Do you still want to sell pictures?
TROY: (distracted monotone) For twenty.
SOLDIER #5: Twenty bucks?
VIG: War's been over five days, ain't gonna be any more of this, Jim.
SOLDIER #5: Twenty dollars, man, what's the meaning of life?
TROY: You're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war.
SOLDIER #5: Bobby, take my picture.
SOLDIER #4: If he shot the guy, it's up to him.
SOLDIER #5: It's not like he shot a fucking deer. It's the enemy.
VIG: It's Troy's enemy, yours for twenty.
ARCHIE GATES: I've been waiting 18 years to get that right.
TROY: He's got no family.
ARCHIE GATES: We're his family now.
DOC: He wanted to go to one of those shrines.
IMAM: Kajatar in Iran. We can take him.
ARCHIE GATES: Good. Take him.
ARCHIE GATES: Air pressure will build up about every fifteen minutes. Release the valve, close it up again.
TROY: How long can I keep doing this?
ARCHIE GATES: Maybe four hours, if you're not bleeding too bad inside.
TROY: I'm really thirsty.
DOC: There's no water anywhere.
IMAM: (to Archie) I got you hooked up if you want to call your man.
ARCHIE GATES: (into the radio) Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, do you read me?
DOC: We're gonna be court-martialed.
ARCHIE GATES: No, we're not.
ARCHIE GATES: (into the radio) Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, are you reading this?
WALTER: (into radio) This is Tar Baby, come in.
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.): Where are you?
WALTER: (into radio) About two clicks outside camp.
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.): We're about ready for the briar patch, over.

ARCHIE GATES (O.S.): You got me, Tar Baby?
WALTER: I think so -- who handles the briar patch?
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.): You do.
WALTER: Oh, OK, and the Tar Baby goes to the briar patch if everything's OK, right?
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.): No, the other way around.
WALTER: Shit, I'm sorry, sir, I don't remember how the code goes --
ARCHIE GATES: Six personnel trucks and a Humvee.
WALTER: Wow. That's a tall order for a secret operation, sir.
ARCHIE GATES: Talk to my friend Hash. Each driver will get 100K.
WALTER: Did you say 100K?
ARCHIE GATES: Roger. Brer Rabbit at 239 North. Add one medavac pack to the order, and dump the reporter.
WALTER: Roger. Give me two hours.
CAPTAIN VAN METER: There's so many transmissions --
