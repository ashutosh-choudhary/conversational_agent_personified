WILSON: Edward Rama?
ED: Eduardo. (rolling the R) Rama.
WILSON: You're home, then.
WILSON: My name's Wilson.
ED: Wilson?
WILSON: You wrote to me about my daughter.
ED: I didn't expect anyone.
WILSON: No reason.
ED: I mean, what has it been -- six months?
WILSON: Round about, yeah.
ED: I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
WILSON: It was better than a telegram.
WILSON: Who done it, then?
ED: Huh?
WILSON: Snuffed her.
ED: Now, wait up a second, man.
ED: I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
WILSON: No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
ED: Look, I sent you that newspaper clipping, all right?  I told you what I know.  It was an accident.  I didn't say anything about anybody being "snuffed."
WILSON: This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
ED: Terry Valentine.
WILSON: Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
ED: I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
ED: Valentine came into the restaurant where I work with Jenny a couple times.  He's a money guy.  Jenny would say, hey, here's my friend Eddie and he would shake my hand and everything, but he wouldn't even see me, you know what I mean.
WILSON: How long had she been in the States? (as if to himself, somewhat wistful) Near on ten years, wasn't it?  Long enough to know her way about, I reckon.
ED: There was an investigation, okay?  The car was totalled.  Jennifer was ... Her neck was broken.  On impact, they said. So she wouldn't have ... felt the effects of the fire. (helpless shrug) It happens up there.  Happens a lot. What more can I tell you.
WILSON: What more is there.
ED: I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
ED: Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
WILSON: No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride. (smokes) And people don't change, do they.
ED: I dunno ... Maybe they do.
WILSON: Going straight, are ya.
ED: (looks away) Boomerang.
WILSON: Y'what?
ED: I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face. (looks at Wilson again) I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
WILSON: (re the family inside) This ain't your lot?
ED: You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
ED: I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
WILSON: (calmly smoking) I only asked.
ED: Couple weeks before she died, Jennifer asked me to drive her downtown.  Said she was meeting -- her boyfriend -- Valentine.  But I think she was looking for him.
WILSON: (lighting Ed's cigarette) What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
ED: That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
WILSON: Where abouts?
ED: Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down. (anticipating Wilson's next question) I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
WILSON: Did Jenny know?
ED: (shrugs) Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say. (stands up again) But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing them.  Checking them out. (beat) I felt like she was covering my ass that day.
ED: I drove her back to Valentine's house.
ED: He was standing outside waiting for her. That's the only other time I ever saw him. (a short sad note) Last time I saw her.
ED: What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
WILSON: Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
ED: Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ... (beat) Those curves don't kid around.
ED: You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
WILSON: She didn't write to me, did she.
ED: She didn't know what to say. (shrugs) I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
WILSON: Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
ED: (self-conscious again) Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
WILSON: (re Ed's tattoos) I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
ED: I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
WILSON: Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
ED: But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
WILSON: Just got out meself, didn't I.
ED: Go home, man. (plane taking off in background) Get on a plane.
WILSON: I'll be needing a shooter.
ED: (comes quickly over) You're kiddin' me, right?
WILSON: What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
ED: (an urgent whisper) These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
WILSON: (looking around) Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
ED: Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
WILSON: Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
ED: Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
WILSON: Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
WILSON: Which is why I thought, save some time, get what I need under the table, like.
ED: Under the table?
PA SYSTEM: Attention:  the long-range vermin- shooting panel is due to commence in two minutes in the blue room at the rear of the Convention Center.
BEAM SALESMAN: BeamSight II is easily mountable on any shotgun, rifle, or sidearm and will project a small, bright red dot directly onto the point where your weapon is aimed ...
DEALER: Man knows what he likes.
ED: (he'll talk if Wilson won't) Lookin' good.
DEALER: (while Wilson checks) That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
ED: What'd you call that -- the Protector?
DEALER: Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
ED: CQ what?
DEALER: Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
WILSON: Trouble is, I'm not at home, see. Fancied a bit of target shooting, y'know, while I'm here -- with me mate.
DEALER: Oh really?  Where you from?
WILSON: England. (sighting the weapon) Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
DEALER: You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
WILSON: Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
DEALER: You're in gun country now, my friend.
WILSON: (picks up another, checks it out) Been to the Boat Show.
DEALER: (re Wilson's new selection) Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
ED: (playing the reluctant buyer) He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
WILSON: Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
DEALER: I can take care of the paperwork.
WILSON: Yeah?
DEALER: No problem.  If with me reporting this gun stolen.
WILSON: No.  Not at all. (to Ed) Do we?
ED: Not me, man.
WILSON: I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
DEALERS: Well, I'll have to add another two hundred on top of that.
WILSON: Oh, aye?
DEALER: (another look) ... for the paperwork.
WILSON: Violation of my parole, this. (a perfect pause) -- Goin' abroad.
ED: You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
WILSON: Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
ED: Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
WILSON: It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
ED: Five years, I think.  Long time.
WILSON: Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
ED: (remembering) Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile. (beat) You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
WILSON: (confused) Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
ED: He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
WILSON: And that's where you met Jenny.
ED: No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
WILSON: How'd the two of you hook up, then?
ED: Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
SUPERVISOR: Hey!
SUPERVISOR: How'd you get in here.
WILSON: Walked.
SUPERVISOR: You walked. (coming over) What the hell are you doing here.
WILSON: Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
SUPERVISOR: He's expecting you?
WILSON: (beat) I doubt it.
SUPERVISOR: So why would he want to see you.
WILSON: I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
SUPERVISOR: Jennifer Wilson.
WILSON: You know her?
SUPERVISOR: Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
WILSON: Is Valentine here?
SUPERVISOR: What do you think?
WILSON: Where is he, then?
SUPERVISOR: Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
SUPERVISOR: Do you hear me, asshole?
SUPERVISOR: Jesus, you really want your ass kicked, don't you?
SUPERVISOR: Go on, get outta here.
SUPERVISOR: Fuckin' nut.  Go on.
WILSON: You tell him.  You tell him I'm coming!!
VALENTINE: (into phone) Not before.  Not before.  Think about it. What does it mean?  What -- no, I'm not. Think.  Yes.  See?  You figured it out all by yourself.  I know.  Are we done? Okay.
VALENTINE: Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
ADHARA: I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
VALENTINE: Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
VALENTINE: Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
ADHARA: I guy in your house.
VALENTINE: Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
ADHARA: Then what good is he?
VALENTINE: Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
ADHARA: Is that a problem?
VALENTINE: Not for you, clearly.
ADHARA: I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
VALENTINE: Am I a thing?
ADHARA: Well, you're certainly not a person.
VALENTINE: I'm not.
ADHARA: No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
VALENTINE: I'm so glad we're having this chat.
ADHARA: It's not a knock.
VALENTINE: It's not a compliment.
ADHARA: It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
VALENTINE: As soon as you get dressed.
ADHARA: What kind of food?
VALENTINE: Anything but Japanese.
ADHARA: Why?
VALENTINE: I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
ADHARA: Like you.
VALENTINE: I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
ADHARA: You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
VALENTINE: It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
ADHARA: For some, eating is a sensual experience. The sensual experience.
VALENTINE: That's what Gordon's always saying.
ADHARA: Oh, god.
VALENTINE: (into phone) Yes.
VALENTINE: (into phone) I'll be there as soon as I can. VALENTINE (cont'd) We can leave as soon as you're ready.
ADHARA: Okay.
VALENTINE: What.
AVERY: There's been some trouble downtown.
VALENTINE: What kind?
AVERY: What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
VALENTINE: Our black friends?
AVERY: No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
VALENTINE: I thought he was in prison, in England.
AVERY: Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
VALENTINE: What do we do?
AVERY: We wait, and we watch.
ADHARA: Italian?
VALENTINE: I'm sorry.
ADHARA: Italian.
VALENTINE: Who?
ADHARA: Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
VALENTINE: Sure. VALENTINE (cont'd) Yes.  Are you ready?
ADHARA: As long as I don't have to pass Gordon again.  I'm never ready for that.
VALENTINE: No.  I know another way out.
ELAINE: You're Jenny's father.
WILSON: Had a feeling it was you.
ELAINE: You look alike.
WILSON: (cigarette in hand) Perhaps it was the smoke.
ELAINE: Not her brand.
WILSON: She used to pinch 'em off me. (trying to defuse Elaine's cold stare) Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
ELAINE: Why did you come here?
WILSON: Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
ELAINE: No, why did you come here?
WILSON: Sort a few things out.
ELAINE: Been busy, have you.
WILSON: How d'you mean?
ELAINE: It's been a while.
WILSON: I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
ELAINE: That's not what I heard.
WILSON: What was that, then?
ELAINE: I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
WILSON: It was the bars, then.
ELAINE: In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
WILSON: Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
ELAINE: And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
WILSON: (trying to conceal his surprise) Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
ELAINE: Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
WILSON: Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
ELAINE: (without looking back) Try calling me again.
ELAINE: I was just going to toss some vegetable rolls in the microwave, open a can of diet soda. (beat) Want to take me out?
WILSON: ... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
ELAINE: Sounds like Beverly Hills.
WILSON: Here, are you always this sarky?
ELAINE: Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
WILSON: Weren't you on a television series?
ELAINE: (has he seen it?) If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
WILSON: (yes) Said it went on for donkey's years.
ELAINE: Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail. (blinks coquettishly) I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
WILSON: Oh, it just ended, then.
ELAINE: Now who's being sarcastic?
WILSON: When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
ELAINE: I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went. (raises her drink) It must've been the bars.
ELAINE: It's a kind of prison, doing a series. Early to bed, early to rise, no time off for good behavior, you grab the boodle for as long as it lasts. (the kicker) Only difference is you can't get arrested afterwards.
WILSON: I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
ELAINE: Not embarrassed.
WILSON: (correcting) Ashamed.
ELAINE: Not ashamed.
ELAINE: Disappointed.
WILSON: She never told Eddie, though.
ELAINE: She never told anyone else. (making light now) About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
WILSON: How'd you manage that, then.
ELAINE: When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
WILSON: Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
ELAINE: Modelling.
WILSON: Learnin' 'ow to speak proper. (putting it on a bit there. Then, upper crust:) Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper. (indicating himself) Show up the old man, you know.
ELAINE: You weren't disappointed in her, then.
WILSON: In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
ELAINE: She was twenty-one when she came to me. (looks at him) ... Straight from leaving you.
WILSON: Footloose and fancy free.
ELAINE: She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
WILSON: That's the trouble, n' it. (hard as nails again) She enjoyed life.
ELAINE: When did you get in?
WILSON: Yesterday.  Afternoon.
ELAINE: (occurs to her) You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
WILSON: No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
ELAINE: I might've been away for the weekend.
WILSON: Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
ELAINE: And you've seen Eddie Rama.
WILSON: Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
ELAINE: I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
WILSON: He give me your address.
ELAINE: I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
WILSON: Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
ELAINE: Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
WILSON: Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
ELAINE: The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
WILSON: Nah, accommodation address.
ELAINE: What's that, like a P.O. box.
WILSON: Something like that, yeah.
ELAINE: Where you get your bank statements.
WILSON: Well, you gotta have something permanent, don'tcha.  Even if it's a hole in the wall.  No matter which jug I might be transferred to, I always got someone on the out checks up on it for me, see. Anything I need to know, comes round on visitor's day -- word in my ear.
ELAINE: Some word.
WILSON: I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
ELAINE: (watching him) That's what was estimated.
WILSON: Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ... (beat) Something had happened to Jen.
ELAINE: Make yourself at home.  Steal something.
ELAINE: There's nothing I can't afford to lose.
ELAINE: Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
WILSON: Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
ELAINE: Rock n' roll, is what we called it.  He's sort of a forgotten figure now, but back when the West Coast was the grooviest place on earth, Terry Valentine was where all the happenings happened.  More of a kind of promoter, I guess, whatever that means.  Just took that whole Southern California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with it.  Packaged and sold it.  Made out like a bandit.
WILSON: What's he done lately.
ELAINE: (brings a tray over) Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
WILSON: Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
ELAINE: -- Your employer?
WILSON: -- Mr. Lindgren.
ELAINE: Who's Mr. Lindgren?
WILSON: My employer.
ELAINE: What line is he in.
WILSON: Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
ELAINE: I see.
WILSON: Based in London, but with international concerns.
ELAINE: I bet.
WILSON: Various enterprises, style of thing.
ELAINE: I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
WILSON: Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
ELAINE: (she gets the picture) Right.
WILSON: Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
ELAINE: In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
WILSON: This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
ELAINE: -- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
ELAINE: So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
WILSON: Why not.
ELAINE: Are you serious.
WILSON: Have you ever known me not to be.
ELAINE: You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
WILSON: What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
ELAINE: You don't believe it was a car accident.
WILSON: What do you think.
ELAINE: Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
WILSON: Depends, don' it.
ELAINE: On what.  What makes you so certain.
WILSON: I'll bloody well ask him.
ELAINE: There's the phone.  You want his number.
WILSON: I got his number.
ELAINE: I'm not going to help you.
ED: (mindful of the odd car driving past) Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
WILSON: Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
ED: (alarmed) Who'd you butcher at the house?
WILSON: Butcher's hook.  Look. (doesn't anyone speak English in this fucking country?) I don't much reckon those minders of his.
ED: Huh?
WILSON: He's brought in the heavy mob.
ED: What?
WILSON: Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
ED: Has he?
WILSON: They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry. (ducks suddenly) Watch it.
ED: That was one of them?
WILSON: (sits up again) See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
WILSON: Look at that.
WILSON: What's so fucking funny?
ED: Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
WILSON: Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
ED: party.
WILSON: Keep it handy, mate, all right?  We're not stopping long.
VALET: Yes, sir.
WILSON: Cheers.
WILSON: Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
ED: (nervous being here) I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
WILSON: Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
ED: No one else is even here yet.
WILSON: First in, first out, that's me.
BARTENDER: Gentlemen.  What can I get you.
WILSON: (suggesting Ed take first crack) Dubonnet with a twist?  Baby sham? Tomato juice and Tabasco sauce?
ED: (to Bartender) Got a Coke?
ADHARA (O.S.): You have the same posters.
VALENTINE: Hmm?
ADHARA: That you have down at your office.
VALENTINE: Different ones.
ADHARA: I like the colors.
VALENTINE: We all did.
ADHARA: It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
VALENTINE: Have you ever dreamed of a place ... you don't really recall ever having been to ... a place that probably doesn't even exist except in your imagination ... somewhere far away, half-remembered when you wake up ... but when you were there you spoke the language, you knew your way around ... (significant pause) That was the 60's.
VALENTINE: No, it wasn't.  Wasn't either.
VALENTINE: It was '66 ... early '67. (comes back to now) That was all.
VALENTINE: Hi.
ADHARA: Shit.
ADHARA: Hello?  Hey!  Great.  You got my message? Yeah.  No, Crestview Terrace, not Crestview Place.  Yeah, there's like three different ways up the hill; the quick way is to bear to the right.  Sure.  Okay. Okay.  'Bye!
ADHARA: That's me.
ADHARA: Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
VALENTINE: I'm a gracious host.
GUY: Excuse me?
GUY: Don't you work with Ian?
WILSON: Ian?
GUY: I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
WILSON: Sorry.  Wasn't me.
GUY: You sure?
WILSON: Unless I'm not who I think I am.
GUY: That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
WILSON: Yeah?
GUY: Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
WILSON: No kidding.
GUY: What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
WILSON: Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
GUY: Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
WILSON: Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
ED: If you could afford a house like this you would buy a house like this.
WILSON: What are we standing on?
ED: Faith. ED (cont'd) (nods to the hazy distance) You could see the sea from here if you could see it.
WILSON: Could you?
WILSON: Why don't you go nick one of those little cooker what's its warming up the sausages cocktail and meet me in the garage.  Look about for a toolbox while you're at it.
ED: Okay.
VALENTINE: Hi.  Terry Valentine.
WILSON: Pleasure.
VALENTINE: Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
WILSON: EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
VALENTINE: Ah.
WILSON: You must know Ian.
VALENTINE: I don't.
WILSON: Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
VALENTINE: I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
WILSON: Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
EXCITED GUY: Terry, Terry ...
WILSON: Glad I got to meet you.
EXCITED GUY: Ter ... Ter ... you gotta ...
VALENTINE: Thanks.  You, too.
WILSON: Be seein' you.
EXCITED GUY: Charles Grodin is here.
WILSON: Got it?
WILSON: Toolbox?
WILSON: Put the Sterno on the ground, near the center of the garage.
WILSON: (gives Ed parking ticket) Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
ED: You goin' back inside?
WILSON: One thing I need.
WILSON: Steady on.
ED: You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
WILSON: Bloody hell.
ED: Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
WILSON: That would be too easy.
ED: Too easy?
WILSON: He's gotta know why.
ED: You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
ED: C'mon, man!  C'mon!
AVERY: You should have let me do the talking.
VALENTINE: Why, because you're my security consultant? (insecure) This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
AVERY: (more concerned about police presence) What did you tell them.
VALENTINE: I told them a long-time employee flipped out.  Had a drug problem, refused counselling.  Set the garage on fire, then committed suicide.  One of my "guests" tried to stop him -- but how do you stop Gordon.
VALENTINE: I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
AVERY: Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
VALENTINE: As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
AVERY: And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
VALENTINE: I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split. (another notion) Maybe he was Gordon's pusher.
VALENTINE: Where do
AVERY: (already turning) We'll find him.
VALENTINE: (stops him) No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
AVERY: You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
VALENTINE: You think I'm staying?
AVERY: There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
VALENTINE: Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
AVERY: I have other resources.
AVERY: Stacy.
STACY: (bored) Hey.
AVERY: Come over here.
AVERY: How they goin', kid?
STACY: Not bad.
AVERY: How'd you like to kill someone for me?
STACY: Okay.
AVERY: Same as last time -- the rest after.
STACY: (pockets it) Where do we go?
AVERY: When you find the guy, you'll know.
STACY: What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
AVERY: I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
STACY: This is un-fucking professional.
AVERY: See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
STACY: Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
AVERY: That's why I'm letting you take care of this.  I'm the one with appearances to maintain.  But who gives a shit about you?  Not even God.
ELAINE: I was in the neighborhood.  I come down here quite a bit.  Watch the planes taking off. (re this motel) Study the architecture of early David Lynch.
ELAINE: Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
WILSON: She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
ELAINE: She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming straight to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
WILSON: (measured) How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
ELAINE: You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
WILSON: (gently urging) And how did you get it?
ELAINE: ELAINE (cont'd) (starting to realize) Not long before ... (realizing) She said if anything ever happened ... (realizes) That's how you know.  That's why you're so sure. (realization) Jenny's telling you.
UNCLE JOHN: How much.
STACY: Five thousand.
UNCLE JOHN: (impressed) Hey.
STACY: (taps pocket) I got half.
UNCLE JOHN: Makin' trouble for someone?
STACY: Yeah.
UNCLE JOHN: Which kind?
STACY: The forever kind.
WILSON: How long've you lived here?
ELAINE: This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's." (thinks back) Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
WILSON: Early 70's.  I was away. (tries to remember) Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
ELAINE: These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
WILSON: You don't seem bothered.
ELAINE: You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
WILSON: Tell us about it.
ELAINE: It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one. (quickly) SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
WILSON: Oh, I was gonna say ...
ELAINE: Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
WILSON: I can see the attraction.
ELAINE: What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
WILSON: A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- after we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
ELAINE: You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
WILSON: We were lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
ELAINE: It didn't discourage you, though.
WILSON: Hey?
ELAINE: From pursuing your chosen profession.
WILSON: I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
ELAINE: I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
WILSON: Did you.  What was that in aid of?
ELAINE: Who remembers.
WILSON: Get seven years, did you?
ELAINE: Overnight.  What about just now?
WILSON: Just now? (playful, goes over, ready for more) Overnight?
ELAINE: You (lies back, regards him carefully) Or is all this just new to you?
WILSON: It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
ELAINE: I don't believe it.
WILSON: Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
ELAINE: Pushing the legal limit even then.
WILSON: Me mate introduced me to a woman up the street.  Funnily enough, she was married to a milkman.  Straight up.  I said, "Good is she?  Been around?"  He said, "Good?  Listen, mush, it's not that she's been around, it's that she's been around hell of a long time."
ELAINE: Your most recent incarceration.  What was that for?
WILSON: It was for nine years. (buttoning his shirt) The last nine years.
ADHARA: I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
VALENTINE: All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
VALENTINE: What's the matter?
ADHARA: Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
VALENTINE: The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
ADHARA: Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
VALENTINE: I sure hope so.
TOM: All I'm sayin' is travel time shouldn't be the same rate.  Travel time is down time, right?  I mean, we're not even in the same car as the client. (to Avery) You told me the job was at the house. When we get to it.  Well, are we shadowing the client right now or are we just going the same way?  The company I was with in Seattle, these distinctions were made. Now, I don't dispute him getting the full whack. (he means Rick, who's older) Seniority and all that.  But if I'm getting paid the same hourly rate when we're at the house as I am in this car, that doesn't sit well with me and I feel obliged to say so.  'Cause in Seattle what you're paying now for so-called travel time was half what we got for actual clock-time with the client.  So I just feel we should get more when the job actually commences.
LARRY: ... I'd really like to eat your pussy.
STACY: (after laughing loudly at a handicapped person) I believe in mocking the afflicted.  Good for 'em.  Makes 'em stronger.
STACY: (spotting a woman with a dog) Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
STACY: (as a fat jogger passes) Good luck.
STACY: (watching someone else go by) Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
STACY: (barely out of earshot of a black woman with dyed blonde hair) Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I really want to fuck you.
STACY: (after a long time in silence, just staring at someone) ... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
STACY: (regarding some other beachgoers) Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
STACY: (reading a newspaper) Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
STACY: (leaning back on his elbows) Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
STACY: (sitting up) Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
UNCLE JOHN: I don't know.
STACY: The L.A.P.D.
STACY: (observing a "fast-walker") Oh yeah, keep doing that.  That's really healthy.
STACY: (his gaze following another unfortunate) Can't you do something about your ass?
STACY: (his head turning after someone else) Other people's lives scare the shit out of me.
STACY: (watching some guy rooting in a trash bin) "Homeless" people.  Fuck them.  Remember when they were just bums?  Everyone with an axe to grind.  Like to grind in their face.  Pretty soon there'll be shit-in- your-pants rights groups.  Stupidity activists.
STACY: (glad he's who he is and not who he's looking at) Wonder what it's like being a dumb guy in a dumb suit trying to cross the street.
STACY: (staring at another sad couple) Life sure is a minefield.
STACY: (clocking another female) Look at that one.  She's really been used.
STACY: (in a contemplative mode) I'd love to be famous so I could snub ordinary people.  Imagine, you're famous, you're sitting in a restaurant, some fool comes up to you, wants you to sign your name on his napkin, his wife is there, it would be something these poor saps would cherish the rest of their lives, talk about to their cretin friends.  Bam!  You tell 'em to FUCK OFF!  God, I'd love that.
UNCLE JOHN: Is that her?  I bet that's her.
UNCLE JOHN: Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
STACY: (driving) Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
UNCLE JOHN: That don't mean nothin'.
UNCLE JOHN: She's nice lookin'.
STACY: So what.
UNCLE JOHN: I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
STACY: And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
UNCLE JOHN: What d'you mean, any happier?
STACY: Any happier than any other asshole in life.
UNCLE JOHN: I dunno.  I never met her.
ELAINE: -- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck. (pauses) One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
WILSON: You ever been to London?
ELAINE: Only in the movies.
WILSON: I've 'ardly ever left it.
ELAINE: Yeah, well, you're here now -- (re Wilson's accent) -- where hurricanes hardly ever happen.
WILSON: I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
ELAINE: Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes. ELAINE (cont'd) So, is there anybody in your family who's not a criminal?
WILSON: Not that I recall.
ELAINE: What about your grandmother?
WILSON: Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
ELAINE: He alive to see this?
WILSON: (shakes head) Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
ELAINE: What'd your father do?
WILSON: Black market during the war.
ELAINE: I guess you're just habitual.
WILSON: You sound like my fucking probation officer.
ELAINE: Won't he be looking for you about now?
WILSON: Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
ELAINE: Minor officials bother you, don't they?
WILSON: Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
STACY: Hi, kids.
THOMPSON: (stops at Wilson) Come with us.
ELAINE: Tell me you wouldn't prefer a steady income.
WILSON: I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
ELAINE: (lights up) A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
WILSON: I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
ELAINE: Yeah ... Jenny spoke fondly of her imaginary siblings. ELAINE (cont'd) Do you remember the last time you saw her?
WILSON: Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up -- (finding the word) in increments.
ELAINE: She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
WILSON: Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of
ELAINE: Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
WILSON: She used to tell me she'd turn me in. (tries to laugh about it) Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
ELAINE: She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
WILSON: I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it wasn't a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
WILSON: This is where I come in. WILSON (cont'd) How's it going, squire, all right?  Now listen -- when I was in the nick -- second time, it was -- no, third.  Third stretch, yeah.  There was this screw had it in for me.  That geezer was top of my list.  Two years after I was slung, I saw him.  He was sitting on a bench in Holland Park.  There was no one else about.  I coulda gone up behind him and snapped his fucking neck.  But I left it. Coulda nobbled him, but I didn't.  'Cos what I thought I wanted wasn't what I wanted.  What I thought I was thinking about was something else.  This berk on the bench wasn't worth my time.  See what I mean?  It didn't matter.  It meant sod all in the end.
FEATHER: There's one thing I don't understand. (wants to make this clear) The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
WILSON: Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
FEATHER: Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
WILSON: I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
FEATHER: But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
WILSON: Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
FEATHER: (moves to window) Yeah, I guess you are.
WILSON: Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been me for the high jump.
FEATHER: That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
WILSON: Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
FEATHER: So what's your beef, pal?
WILSON: Nothing financial.  Strictly personal. (moves to window) I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
FEATHER: (looks at him) It was you.  Downtown.
WILSON: (all innocent) Eh?
FEATHER: Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction. (pondering) Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
WILSON: No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
FEATHER: He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
WILSON: All of what?
FEATHER: Of the deal, man.
WILSON: Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
FEATHER: But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
WILSON: As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
FEATHER: (weary of his life) In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
WILSON: And that is?
FEATHER: What am I doing?
WILSON: Looking the other way. (turns to go) Gotcha.
TOM: (to Rick) I mean, how much are you getting?  Just as a point of interest.  See, I didn't realize there was a sliding scale.
STACY: Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
UNCLE JOHN: Lemme break.
CREEP: You broke last time.
STACY: Let him break - he likes to break.
CREEP: Fuck you.
STACY: I wouldn't talk.
CREEP: Huh?
STACY: I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
BARTENDER: (calls) Stacy. BARTENDER (cont'd) I can do without you inhibiting my business.
STACY: (into phone) Yeah.
GRAMMS: (re:  the burnt garage) Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
FIELDING: (by rote) My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
GRAMMS: A statement.  You see, my client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
FIELDING: Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
GRAMMS: Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
FIELDING: My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
GRAMMS: So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
FIELDING: He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
GRAMMS: Where is he now?
FIELDING: He had urgent business in the north.
WILSON: (over) Where's Big Sur?
ELAINE: (over) Up the coast.
WILSON: (over) How far?
ELAINE: (over) I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
WILSON: (over) Fancy it?
ELAINE: (over) I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this is a vacation.
WILSON: (over) Never thought of that. (grunt of laughter) Busman's holiday.
ELAINE: (over) What's in Big Sur?
WILSON: (over) That's where Valentine's scarpered.
ELAINE: (over) How do you know?
WILSON: (over) Bloke told me. WILSON (cont'd) (over) You shouldn't go back to your place.  Not till ... this is resolved.
ELAINE: (over) I hear it's a nice drive.
ED: What d'you say, Elaine?
ELAINE: Not much -- you?
ED: Same.
ELAINE: Uh-huh.
ED: Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
ELAINE: Probably.
ED: I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
ELAINE: Really.
ED: Didn't get it.
ELAINE: Well, those are the breaks.
ED: Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
ELAINE: You just cooking then?
ED: Hell, no.  I started writing.
UNCLE JOHN: We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
STACY: There's more than a measly few grand in this.
UNCLE JOHN: There is?
STACY: Something's on.
UNCLE JOHN: What?
STACY: I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
UNCLE JOHN: You do?
STACY: You bet.
UNCLE JOHN: Like what.
STACY: Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
UNCLE JOHN: Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
STACY: (savage mimicry) "He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who did just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  That's the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
UNCLE JOHN: I don't get it.
STACY: I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of -- (finding the word) -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. Avery wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
UNCLE JOHN: What's in it?
STACY: (shrugs) Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
UNCLE JOHN: How we gonna get that lucky?
STACY: While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
ED: I've been wondering something.
WILSON: Again?
ED: Do you have any friends, man?
WILSON: Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
ELAINE: (a little more pointed) Friends and colleagues.
WILSON: You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
ELAINE: Poor baby.
WILSON: Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
ED: What post office?
WILSON: The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
ELAINE: You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
WILSON: Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
VALENTINE: Hello there.
SUSAN: What are you doing here?
VALENTINE: Exercising my visitation rights.
SUSAN: Since when?
VALENTINE: I miss my kids.
SUSAN: They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
VALENTINE: You've made it ... brighter.
SUSAN: I don't want you here, Terry.
VALENTINE: Sure you do. VALENTINE (cont'd) Don't shut the door -- I have people with me.
SUSAN: What kind of trouble are you in?
VALENTINE: No trouble.
SUSAN: Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
VALENTINE: Susan. VALENTINE (cont'd) I just need ... somewhere remote.  Away from L.A.  For a couple of days. (now the kicker) I pay for this house too.
SUSAN: What have you done?
AVERY: (to Valentine) We weren't followed. (to Susan) Susan.
VALENTINE: (moving, looking around) Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
SUSAN: -- You know his name is Frank.
VALENTINE: Is he here?
SUSAN: You know I don't live with him.
VALENTINE: Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
SUSAN: Are you finished?
VALENTINE: In a couple of days this whole thing --
SUSAN: Who's looking for you?
VALENTINE: Go now.
SUSAN: It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
VALENTINE: That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
SUSAN: It everything.  Losing inhibitions and chicks without bras didn't have to lead to hardcore porno in every American household:  that was you.  The first on your block to turn on a camera in a hot tub and peddle it to your friends.  A little recreational pot didn't inevitably have to lead to the eventual devastation of the inner cities:  you made that happen, the first time you bought a bigger stash than you yourself meant to smoke.  It happened when you made your first buck hyping some so-called "event" that was over before it began or marketed some "product" whose only value was its instant disposability.  You were the first person to see there was a lot of money to be made selling Navajo rugs -- you've even stolen from the fucking Indians!  You looked at Charlie Manson when all he had to show for himself was a guitar instead of a knife and saw another merry prankster, the freedom of the frontier.  Your pal here -- (Avery) -- He saw gated communities.  Rich people coming to him with their money, terrified of what people like you had left of this society.  Why invest in a marriage and children when you had him?  He's your oracle.  But you couldn't even trust in friendship, could you?  Still he's the dog you call for its dinner.  Because everything that might once have been fun or nice or sweet you had to turn mean and cold and sour.  That was your "genius," Terry.  Haven't you read your own press?
ELAINE: (finding herself at another shithole) What is it, you just like the reassuring smell of disinfectant?
ED: Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
ELAINE: No, but I know what he means.
VALENTINE: (finally, to Avery) Do any of these guys cook?
ED: ... Reminds me of Jennifer.
ELAINE: (barely perceptible nod) Hard to miss.
ED: I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
ELAINE: I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
LARRY: Fuck.
VALENTINE: (re:  the channel) Check the news.
AVERY: Where's the remote?
VALENTINE: Where's Larry?
AVERY: Turn all the lights out.  I'll get Adhara.
VALENTINE: What's happening?
AVERY: Stay away from the windows.
ADHARA: Uh, you've heard of knocking?
AVERY: I need you to come with me.
ADHARA: Why, what --
AVERY: Please.
ADHARA: Okay.
AVERY: (off) I thought I said stay away from the window.
AVERY: Everybody in the kitchen.
AVERY: Behind the counter.
ADHARA: (scared) What's going on?
VALENTINE: We think someone is here.
ADHARA: We think?
VALENTINE: We can't find ... (what are their names?) ... two of our guys.
TOM: (fucking typical) Larry and Rick.
ADHARA: Did somebody call the cops?
VALENTINE: No.
ADHARA: Why not?
VALENTINE: Because --
AVERY: Because I'm taking care of it.
ADHARA: You guys are fucking nuts, I'm calling --
ADHARA: Hey.
TOM: Mr. Avery.
AVERY: Watch my back.
TOM: Fuck.
VALENTINE: What?
TOM: Avery's down.
TOM: Fuck this.
UNCLE JOHN: Shit.
ADHARA: Where are you going?
AVERY: ... that way ...
WILSON: Tell me.
VALENTINE: What.
WILSON: Tell me.
VALENTINE: Tell you ...
WILSON: About Jenny. (closer) Tell me about Jenny. (closer) About the deal.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
WILSON: Tell me.  Tell me about it, you fucking bastard.
VALENTINE: She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
VALENTINE: She didn't want to share it, she wanted to stop it.  To stop me.  She said she'd turn me in.
VALENTINE: She said, "You go ahead with this, I'll turn you in, Terry."
VALENTINE: She was serious.  She would have done it. She had the phone in her hand.  She was going to do it.
WILSON: Ta.
LADY: You're English.
WILSON: Yeah, that's right.
LADY: I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
WILSON: I would have preferred staying home, me.
LADY: You're a reluctant traveller, then.
WILSON: Got called out to L.A., unexpected like, to do a job of work.
LADY: You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
WILSON: Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
LADY: No rest for the wicked.
WILSON: Been away a lot.
LADY: Where else?
WILSON: Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
LADY: Nine years? (laughs) Is that legal?
WILSON: Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
LADY: But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
WILSON: I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
LADY: (reacting slightly to his "colorful" language) Sounds like you need a rest.
WILSON: Could do, yeah.
WILSON: But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
LADY: The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
WILSON: Yeah.
WILSON: Them next.
