GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS: We are inside a human brain.  A pack of neurons FIRE OFF to the left, and rocket their way across synapses to the optic nerve.  Passing the eye socket, they speed toward a silky, curvilinear membrane (the retina) on which we see an image projected:
AN UPSIDE DOWN COMPUTER SCREEN: Neurons PING into the membrane: the picture suddenly FLIPS RIGHT SIDE UP and we follow the light, flashing in a blur through the iris and cornea until, exiting the eye we reverse POV and
CLOSE ON A PAIR OF EYES: Deep deep blue.  Radiating more intelligence than wisdom.  Inside each pupil is the reflection of a COMPUTER SCREEN.  A deferential VOICE sounds from off camera.
VOICE: Professor Pentcho?
VOICE (ARLETTE): Multi-tasking again? Pentcho raises his blue eyes from the computer screen and up at ARLETTE (50's), his mannish Swiss assistant.
ARLETTE: We can start the descent now.
A SERIES OF SHOTS: as Pentcho and Arlette stride through the facility.  They pass a group of green-tagged VISITORS and their Swiss-accented GUIDE.
GUIDE: Two hundred feet below us is the world's largest particle accelerator... His VOICE continues on overlap as they reach a hallway.
GUIDE (OC) (CONT'D): 27 kilometers in circumference, the beam pipe actually runs beneath the borders of Switzerland and France...
PENTCHO: Did you get that data off to Braverman at Cal Tech? They are facing the CAPSULE/ELEVATOR that leads to the tunnel.
ARLETTE: Done. Next to the elevator, two plants are dying in their pots, their growing lamps off.  Pentcho looks around, finds the plug, pushes it into the socket.  The lights glow.  He peers at a leaf: a tiny bug crawls across...
GUIDE (OC): ...at the moment of impact the electrons inside the pipe are travelling six hundred sixty six million miles per --
ARLETTE: We need to progress. He breaks out of it, swipes his I.D. card.  The capsule doors WHOOSH open.  Pentcho nods at the man inside.  This is JACQUE, his accent heavily Italian.
JACQUE: Hey, it is 3-P-O!  P, P, P!  Professore Paulo Pentcho!
PENTCHO: That's not an official nickname, Jacque. Pentcho looks from Jacque to Arlette, who blushes.  Pentcho sits down in the heavily consoled captain's chair.
JACQUE: Beh!  Eets just tun-nel humor. The giant lab disappears from sight as they DROP twenty stories below the earth.
PENTCHO: Did they recalibrate the 3k turn? Jacque nods.  They hit bottom.  Pentcho keys in data on the console computer as the capsule moves LATERALLY on a track parallel to the beam pipe, stopping in front of the RF CAVITY, bursting with a billion dollars worth of nanotechnology.
PENTCHO (CONT'D): Give me more angle-control on the bounce.
JACQUE: Benissimo, Professore. ON PENTCHO: a little bored, manning the console.
PENTCHO: Fifteen seconds Arlette...
DOUBLE CLICK: We see an image draw itself on the empty 'page' of the field:
A BLACK DOT LOOPING INTO A STRING: accompanied by the following thought text: "...two spatially separated particles will irresistibly attract..."
MOUSE CLICK - A WOMAN'S FACE: wide-set brown eyes brimming with emotion.  A hint of a SONG playing somewhere in the BG.
MOUSE CLICK: to the previous 'page' where the LOOP has formed into a sheet moving through space, followed by the floating thought text: "...until the force of the collision fuses them into..."
PENTCHO'S VOICE: Ten, nine, eight...
MOUSE CLICK - POV: LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN AT: the BROWN-EYED WOMAN, her face dreamy, her body naked beneath silk sheets.  PULL BACK: she's floating on an enormous Renaissance mural - a wedding scene - that is a bedroom floor.  Off in the corner, PENTCHO sits hunched over a clunky laptop, his fingers dancing, dervish-like, across the keyboard.
PENTCHO'S VOICE (CONT'D): Four, three, two...
WOMAN: Then goodbye... CRACK!  Suddenly, the woman drifts away.  Pentcho looks up: THEIR
POV - ONE LIGHT INFUSED ELECTRON: BLASTING through the beam pipe like a COMET, fused inside of a looping, twenty seven kilometer single lane race track. WHOOOSH! As the electron accelerates, so too does the sound, rushing to GUT SPLITTING, EAR WRENCHING DB'S.  Heading around the turn, it barrels STRAIGHT INTO THE PATH OF THE SECOND ELECTRON on its own speed-of light power surge. HERE COMES THE IMPACT POINT... but SCREEEEECH! What disc brakes might sound like, slammed to the floor of a vehicle travelling six hundred sixty six million miles per hour.
SUDDENLY THE ELECTRON HAS STOPPED, SUSPENDED,: its phosphorescent glow trained like a spotlight on:
PENTCHO - EXTREME CLOSE UP: the dual computer screens reflecting out of his pupils, again.  A VOICE speaks from nowhere, sonorous and packed with reverb:
FEMALE VOICE: The camera SURGES into Pentcho's eyes as the brain field opens to the sounds of a nine alarm fire.  DING DING DING DING DING! The thought text marches by in giant, attention-getting letters: "ELECTRONS DON'T
FEMALE VOICE (CONT) (CONT'D): More thought text scrolls by on the field, now in RED LETTERS: "I'm having a psychotic episode." The field collapses back into PENTCHO, ashen-faced, watching his computer screen, and seeing: the cursor (electron) blinking.
JACQUE'S VOICE: Impact! Suddenly, we are back inside the pipe, HURTLING toward
KABLOOM!  THE SUB-ATOMIC EXPLOSION: A particle meteor shower of magnificent proportions.  They glow and charge off and disappear, as the laws of E=mc2 take visual flight inside this billion dollar kaleidoscope.
HIS DRINK GLASS IS MOVING: sliding slowly across the tray table.  It stops near the edge and waits, as Pentcho looks up from the window.  As his head drifts back toward the clouds outside
SPLITS INTO TWO DIMENSIONS: One stays focused forward, while the SECOND ONE turns to the side and watches in amazement as
THE GLASS SLIDES ACROSS THE OPEN TRAY TABLE: Suddenly a horn BLARES, and CRASH!
SLOW MOTION EFFECT: A three car COLLISION with Pentcho in the middle, an object lesson in physics seen from ten different camera angles:
SCREECH CRUNCH CRUNCH: Bumpers crumple, metal tears, human molecules SNAP forward.  POP POP POP!  Like gunfire, bullet AIRBAGS clamp the drivers' heads back against their headrests.
VOICE: What the hell were you thinking?  What?  I want to know!  WHAT?!! This is WILL (30's), a scratch over one eye, peering in at Pentcho, still behind the air bag/steering wheel, craning his stiffening neck forward and back at the crumpled row of red automobiles.  He blinks, then answers in an eerie voice.
PENTCHO: Probability of this happening, same make, model, color and year is less likely than the proof for the existence of God.
WILL: (seething) Sorry I asked. (beat) You got insurance?
WILL: Up the ramp.  Yeah... I'll -- (he turns) There you are!  See me?  See?  They won't let you in?  Just walk... Here I am. He waves at a red Dodge Durango on the street below. PENTCHO stares idly at the Durango as we
SINGER'S VOICE: I know this world is kil...ling you...
CLICK - THE PICTURE SHARPENS: on a man and a woman, MAKING LOVE on a big brocade couch.  Their bodies rock in unison, faces unseen.
SINGER'S VOICE (CONT'D): My aim is true-ooooh. The field collapses closed upon:
WILL: I'll be there, Trent.  Yes.  20 minutes -- Click.  Will reddens, sees the sunglassed face of the woman, looking past him and over to PENTCHO, signing the tow truck papers.  The battered front end of his Beetle CRANKS upward.
WILL (CONT'D): Son-of-a-bitch.  As if it was my fault I got rear-ended by... The woman stares, curiously, at Pentcho.
WILL (CONT'D): ...some schmuck dreaming about God.  Mia? She doesn't hear him.  Takes off her sunglasses, slowly.  Wide-set brown eyes.
WOMAN: Paul...? Finished now with the tow truck driver.  His head turns.  She moves closer.  Will's voice protests from the BG.
WILL'S VOICE: Mia...
IT'S MIA, YOUNGER, THE SAME WIDE-SET DARK EYES: Pentcho's heartbeat pounds LOUDER, drowning out the whisper:
MIA: Then goodbye...
PENTCHO: Less likely than the existence of God. Mia brushes back a strand of hair.  Bites her lip.
PENTCHO (CONT'D): I've been dreaming about you.
MIA: Day or night? Pentcho loses himself in her brown eyes.
PENTCHO: Both. Atoms are vibrating, interchanging by the billions.  Another voice gets in the way.
WILL'S VOICE: Mi.
PENTCHO: Is that your...
MIA: No. (beat) Not yet. She shifts her weight from one slim leg to the other.
PENTCHO: Could we go somewhere?
MIA: I'm heading out of town.
PENTCHO: (deep breath) Okay. Mia does a tiny double-take.  It's very sexy.
MIA: What?
PENTCHO: I could go out of town. Mia laughs.  This is so preposterous.
MIA: Could you?
PENTCHO: (nodding) Where to?
MIA: A place you've never been.
PENTCHO: That's the physicist's playground.
MIA: Why am I doing this?
PENTCHO: It's an experiment. Mia turns onto a private road.  A MANSION appears in the distance, cresting the hill. A massive wooden door.  Mia holds a flashlight, slips an oversized key into the lock and turns.
POV: THROUGH THE DOORWAY: An enormous hall.  Scaffolding rises from the stone floor.  Forty foot high walls are draped in thick sheets of plastic. They enter like thieves. Mia stands on top of an eight foot riser.  Pentcho passes up harnesses and rope to her outstretched hands.
MIA: We flopped the first time out.
PENTCHO: At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways. Mia slings the gear over her shoulder.  Looks very much in her element.
MIA: And you think this is relevant to our relationship? Pentcho starts his own climb up the scaffolding.  Reaches the first plank.
PENTCHO: Could be.
MIA: (wryly) What universe are you in, Paul?
PENTCHO: A quantum one. Pentcho clips a safety line to his belt.  The two of them wear yellow hardhats and climbing harnesses.  They suddenly KICK OFF the scaffold and DANGLE twenty five feet above the stone floor.  Hand over fist, they start to ascend, hoisting themselves up the tug ropes.
PENTCHO: The shorthand is, when you send electrons through space, it's impossible to say precisely what they are: particles or waves. They spin around slowly like tops as they hoist themselves up.
PENTCHO (CONT'D): They come into being as one or the other at the moment we observe them. His words echo off the giant walls.
PENTCHO (CONT'D): Nothing is real until it's perceived.
MIA: The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
PENTCHO: How? Mia reaches an electric box, hanging a yard below the ceiling.
MIA: Baby, reality is what you choose to make it. She flips the switch.  A set of lights FLARE ON.  Pentcho swallows a breath.  In awe.
PENTCHO: God.
A GIANT RENAISSANCE-STYLE FRESCO COVERS THE ENTIRE CEILING.: Flocks of ANGELS fly above a GODDESS.  Cherubs.  Heralds. Pentcho's face flushes.  He's exhilarated.  She takes note:
MIA: But only if you live your life that way.  If you experience every moment as discovery. Pentcho's already there.  He kicks his legs out.  Joyrides on the tug rope, arcing back and forth like a mad pendulum.
PENTCHO: Mia!  You're restoring heaven with dabs of paint.  You're bringing new order to the universe. She beams from his excitement.
MIA: I always said we were in the same business... His wayward motion swings him STRAIGHT INTO HER.  They lock arms. The ropes shudder.
PENTCHO: If you're right, we have a chance. (beat) To be together. Pentcho reaches out to kiss her.  Doesn't see that their collision has jogged the clutch on his harness rope.  Now it opens all the way.
WHOOSH!: In an instant, he's gripping air, FALLING at the speed of Newton's discovery. He hurtles downward in slow motion.  There's a SOUND rushing in behind him, the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE. Pentcho catches a glimpse up over his shoulder: the angels, the goddess, Mia, all of it has been
SUCKED OUT OF EXISTENCE...: as Pentcho's eyes stare for a millisecond at
THE VOID.  NOTHINGNESS.  NADA.: And then he's FALLING again, accelerating toward his own last particle collision, when a VOICE murmurs from somewhere.
VOICE (OC): I'm not done. THWACK!  The safety line holds, dangling Pentcho a meter above the stone floor. They camp on old couch cushions, side by side, staring up at the illuminated fresco.  Pentcho is bruised, battered, vulnerable.
PENTCHO: When I was a kid I used to snap my head back like a gunfighter on the draw, hoping to catch a glimpse behind me. Mia props her head up on one elbow.
MIA: Of what?
PENTCHO: God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia. It's a plea.  She turns, stares directly into his eyes.
PENTCHO (CONT'D): The universe is snapping my head back.  I'm losing my focus. Mia's face fills with light.  Her best smile.
MIA: Welcome, Paul.  Welcome. She traces a line from his forehead to the bridge of his nose, quoting Yeats (from "The Second Coming") as a celebration:
MIA (CONT'D): "Things fall apart; the center will not hold.  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world." He pulls her close to him.  They lie, spooned together, breathing in unison, gazing up at the painted heaven. A firefly enters from outside, flutters in the air above them, blushing a trace line of yellow light.
PENTCHO: An electron spoke to me yesterday.  (beat) I swear. Mia tries to suppress a giggle.  Can't.
MIA: What did it want?
PENTCHO: That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
MIA: Like now? He hesitates, then surrenders to the fact.
PENTCHO: Yes. The firefly dances above them.  Pentcho sits up (and away from her). Mock serious:
PENTCHO (CONT'D): Did you know electrons have lovers? Mia notes his distance.  Faces him, cross-legged.
MIA: No.  I didn't.  (dryly) I'm listening.
PENTCHO: Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier... She looks, sees him disappear into his head.
PENTCHO (CONT'D): A strip of silicon, which for you and me would be like... The vulnerability is gone.  And Mia, with it.
MIA: She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
PENTCHO: (plowing ahead) A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
MIA: Dysfunctional --
PENTCHO: That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
MIA: And glow happily ever after. Silence.  The story hangs between them like a fog.
MIA (CONT'D): Don't science me Paul.  (beat) What do you want? ON PENTCHO'S FACE: It's blank. MIA looks up at the angels, closes her eyes, TURNS AWAY.
ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN: E-mail.  Lots of it.  Hundreds and hundreds of messages scrolling by on the screen.  He turns away, sees his own rain soaked clothes forming a puddle on the floor.  LIGHTNING cascades across the sky, visible through the large bay window behind the desk.  Pentcho's eyes stray back to the screen
STILL SCROLLING E-MAIL MESSAGES: as the thunder follows almost immediately.  CRACK!  He looks up: Veins of light pulse outward, branching into a spidery network
OF GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS: A voice SOUNDS from somewhere non-local:
VOICE (OC): Paul?  Pauly? Pentcho leans toward the glass, looking out as we reverse POV: A SINGLE LIGHTNING BOLT descends from the heavens on its own speed-of light path straight at... WHOMP!  It strikes the BEETLE dead on -- (SLOW MOTION) -- scorching the roof.  Reverse POV: ON PENTCHO - pupils dilated as we surge inward to
AN OLDER MAN: wild, white Einstein hair.  He CLUTCHES suddenly at his chest, like a heart attack victim.  His lips call out, but no voice follows.  He fades, ominously, to black at the sound of
A SECOND LIGHTNING BOLT DESCENDS: on the exact same path toward...  KABOOM!  THE RED BEETLE. A plume of smoke rises out of the punctured roof.
EMPLOYEE: Rented every last ve-hicle.  'Cept one.
PENTCHO: I'll take it. It's a red 2000 BEETLE.
GRAND HOUSE GONE TO SEED.: Ditto the neighborhood.  A 7-Eleven sign blinks on the corner. Pentcho walks up the cracked sidewalk to a sagging wooden porch. Looks for signs of life.  A light.  Something. He pushes on the front door.  Locked.  Rummages through his key ring in the dark.  Slides one into the top lock.  Won't turn. Tries another key.  Gets stuck.  He pulls it out.  Presses his face close against the window.
TIRES SCREECH.  POLICE SIRENS BLARE.: Pentcho turns, his EYES lit by the flashing bubble lights.
THE EINSTEIN MAN: Crumpled on the floor, hands still clutching his chest.  The screen COLLAPSES at the sound of
A GUNSHOT ERUPTS ABOVE HIS HEAD: He drops, convulsed with fear.  Snaps his head back to see:
THE EINSTEIN MAN (ALEXANDER): in bathrobe and slippers, hands shaking around a shotgun.
ALEXANDER: Paul... Pauly... Pentcho struggles to breathe.  Staccato:
PENTCHO: I... I thought you were dead. Alexander drops the gun.  In shock, a whisper:
ALEXANDER: I must be.
ALEXANDER: Look at me. Pentcho stirs in a lump of sugar first.  Raises his eyes.
ALEXANDER (CONT'D): (contemptuous) "Alexander the Great." He lifts a kitchen chair, spins it around, straddles the back.
ALEXANDER (CONT'D): 22 I built the first machine to transfer digital bits over a land line.  I wrote the TCP/IP protocol before thirty.  This mind (tapping his temples), the one and only, was OBGYN at the birth of the Internet.  And where has it taken me? He shoots upright.  Peers out the row of double sash windows, covered by impenetrable iron grates.
ALEXANDER (CONT'D): To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
PENTCHO: You taking any medication? Alexander's eyes FLARE in anger.
ALEXANDER: Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me (pulling the gun out) to this particular switching station?
PENTCHO: Dad... He shoves the shotgun into an open trash can.
ALEXANDER: Two: what if I didn't miss?
PENTCHO: You did.
ALEXANDER: Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
PENTCHO: You did miss --
ALEXANDER: -- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?  (softer) What did your life mean? (beat) Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love? Pentcho shifts, uncomfortably, in his seat.  Ditto Alexander's mood. He does a startling one-eighty into nonchalance.
ALEXANDER (CONT'D): What was her name?
PENTCHO: Excuse me???
ALEXANDER: What was her name?  The one I met. Alexander reaches out a finger, touches the dab of paint on Pentcho's forehead.
PENTCHO: Mia...?
ALEXANDER: Yes.... He rubs the paint between his fingers.
ALEXANDER (CONT'D): The restorer... Now he wanders off, disappears into the dark. ON PENTCHO: wired, incredulous, heart thump thump thumping. He calls out after his father.
PENTCHO: I need some air. (beat) Don't shoot me.
ALEXANDER'S VOICE (OC): Good night.
INT.  ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - A SHORT TIME LATER: Pentcho paces in front of the open window, stops.  He turns to walk out, is surprised by
ALEXANDER: Standing in the dark.
ALEXANDER: We've been kidding ourselves, Pauly.  Until you look for it, it doesn't even exist.
OLD WOMAN: You would have a son with me... Pentcho blinks.  The woman is suddenly FIFTY YEARS YOUNGER:
YOUNG OLD WOMAN: ...and his name would be Hope.
PENTCHO'S VOICE: "If you could look back fast enough, at near to the speed of light, then there would be no reality behind you, because it hadn't yet been created --
A PINK NEON HEART: blinking above a tatto parlor.  His eyes lock on, see the heart
GLOWING BIGGER AND BIGGER,: its electric pulse mimicing the beating of a real organ.
CLOSER STILL - ON PENTCHO: Running from it.  Looking for it.  He stops dead in his tracks, tries one last time to play gunfighter with the quantum reality:
HE SNAPS HIS HEAD BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER: and we see him, making the same move, from four different camera angles: from his LEFT, his RIGHT, from the TOP OF HIS HEAD, and looking up FROM GROUND ZERO as
HE FINALLY WINS THE DRAW.: The RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE is unleashed.   Here it comes, rolling in with a giant WHOOSHING SOUND...
POV PENTCHO: WATCHING REALITY SUCKED OUT OF EXISTENCE: The ships, the dock, the harbor OBLITERATED by an onrushing, transparent cloud of NOTHINGNESS, EMPTINESS, a tabula rasa superimposed upon the disappeared wharf.
ON PENTCHO, FALLING TO HIS KNEES: hammered by his own victory, numb from shock and ecstasy, staring into the void as we surge forward
VOICE: Uncle, hey... A face, peering down at Pentcho.  The face belongs to the MAGIC MAN, in a mad hatter hat, and a potpourri of found item clothing.  Like a Baptist preacher on his sidewalk pulpit:
MAGIC MAN: Can you feel it, uncle?  Can you feel it right down to your bones?!
ON PENTCHO: EXTREME CLOSE UP: Inside each pupil is the reflection of the NEON HEART.  We pull back on Pentcho's face.  Calm.  Serene.
PENTCHO: Yes.  (beat) Yes I can.
INT.  UPSTAIRS HOUSE - AN ORNATE TILE SHOWER - NIGHT: He stands beneath the stream of hot water, cleansing himself of a day that began a very long time ago.
INT.  THE GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT: Pentcho dresses, taking in the smell and texture of fresh clothes against his body.  He sits down on the bed.  Sees a clock.  5:00 a.m. TUGS UP one of the double sash windows that faces the 7-Eleven. VOICES rise from the parking lot. Pentcho stretches out on the musty bedspread, eyes on the carved plaster ceiling.  Suddenly, floating up through the open window:
WOMAN'S VOICE: What do you want?! Pentcho cranes his head.
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D): Tell me!  Now!  Now! The old sash falls shut.  BOOM.  It's like a dam bursting inside him, only the flood is LAUGHTER that starts deep in his belly, as a giggle, then a chuckle that cascades upward and out into enormous GUFFAWS.  The sound rocks the house.  Pentcho's smile is a mile wide. His eyes sparkle, then tear up as the
FRONT DOORBELL RINGS: He jumps off the bed, and bounds down the stairs.
ALEXANDER: Guess who's coming to dinner. Mia jumps right in.  To Pentcho:
MIA: I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
PENTCHO: Wait.  I want to tell you something. He takes her arm, steering her away from Alexander, into the living room.  She stops cold at the sight of the MURAL.
MIA: I've been dreaming about this.
PENTCHO: (excited) Then you get it.  You'll understand.
MIA: What? His face has the look of the little boy who has just stumbled upon the pirate's treasure.
PENTCHO: I know what I want.  I let go, and a second later you materialized at the door.  You see?
CLOSE ON PENTCHO: feeling the feelings.
PENTCHO (CONT'D): Mia.  I can create reality.  (beat) I can choose to love you with all my heart. Tears pool along the rims of her eyes.  She stares straight at him, hiding nothing.
MIA: You know those people who won't be photographed because they're afraid you're stealing their souls...? (long beat) I came to take back my picture.  The one I keep leaving with you. His heart deflates.  His voice follows.  Barely audible:
PENTCHO: Why?
MIA: So I can move on.  You too. A horn blares from outside.
MIA (CONT'D): Be who you are, Paul.  I love who you are. I do. She turns and runs out the front door.
MIA'S VOICE: I'll drive. She circles the car, disappears behind the wheel.  Will gets in his side.
ON THE FRONT PORCH: Pentcho, agitated, pushes open the door.  Alexander's already outside, watching Mia motor off.  He turns, stares at his son.
ALEXANDER: Do you want to think about it some more? PENTCHO SPRINTS DOWN TO THE CURB.  Jumps into the Beetle.  The headlights FLASH ON in the pre-dawn night.
WILL: You okay? She nods.  Barely.  They merge onto the highway.
PEARLS, PLAYING OUT, LOOPING INTO A STRING: whose shape recalls the original brain field.  Thought text scrolls below, accompanied now by Pentcho's own inner voice.
VOICE AND TEXT: Each part of physical reality is constructed of all the other parts...
EXTREME CLOSE-UP, ON A SINGLE PEARL: inside of which, the entire strand is reflected.
VOICE AND TEXT (CONT'D): A web of connections created by the interdependence of all things... The field collapses back into:
LIFT OUT OF HER MIRROR: and train its phosphorescent glow on:
MIA - EXTREME CLOSE UP: the point of light reflecting out of her pupils.  PENTCHO'S VOICE speaks from nowhere, sonorous and packed with reverb:
PENTCHO'S VOICE: What do you want? Mia blinks again.  The beam is gone.  She looks over at WILL, oblivious, checking his watch.
BACK ON MIA: the understanding flooding her eyes as
SHE SNAPS HER HEAD BACK (JUST LIKE PENTCHO THE GUNFIGHTER): And we see her making her move from FOUR DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLES, from her left, right, up above, and from the back seat of the car as the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE WHOOSHES BY...
POV MIA: THE BRIDGE, THE CARS, THE BAY: all sucked out of existence until nothing remains but
PULL BACK: FROM THE BRIDGE: as the two of them move toward the same point.  Suddenly, tiny sparks of light GLOW and JUMP from portions of the bridge cable.
SLOW MOTION: PENTCHO AND MIA: gliding still closer.  A VOICE sounds:
VOICE: Impact! Their bodies CONNECT, arms intertwine, lips touch lips...
PULL BACK - HIGHER: It's like a plug in the socket of the physical landscape
LIGHTING THE ENTIRE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM: Every cell line, radio wave, satellite feed, fiber-optic cable, all stretching in every possible direction
FROM BRIDGE TO SEA TO SKY: pulsing outward into a spidery network of
