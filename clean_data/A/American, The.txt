THE AMERICAN: Written by Rowan Joffe Based on the novel A Very Private Gentleman by Martin Booth
INGRID: What are you looking for?
JACK: Nothing.
INGRID: There are no wolves in the woods so close to the city.
INGRID: Snow-hare.
INGRID: A hunter?
INGRID: You have a gun.
INGRID: You have a gun! How do you have a gun? Why should you carry such a weapon?
INGRID: Jack?
INGRID: Jack talk to me!
INGRID: Who is he?
JACK: A hunter.
INGRID: He's not dressed like a hunter. Why is he alone? Hunters always go in pairs. For safety.
JACK: Go for help. Call the police.
JACK: Blending in?
LARRY: Jack. What brings you to Rome?
JACK: I closed the Stockholm account.
JACK: But there were complications.
JACK: Collateral damage. Two shooters. Unidentified. [A beat] And a girl.
LARRY: There's a bar across the street: the L'Aquila. Freshen up. Sit tight. Give me two hours.
LARRY: (genuinely shocked) You started smoking again?
JACK: Guess so.
LARRY: Since when?
JACK: Since now.
WAITER: Cafe?
LARRY: Due.
LARRY: Stockholm account. Final installment.
LARRY: You can't stay here, Jack. You won't see `em coming, not in a big city. But you can't go far, either. If the gentlemen whose accounts you closed belonged to Brink, Gallazzo, Simenov- any of the first division- you have four or five hours at most before every airport, train station, bus stop, toll booth and ski lift from Stockholm to Skopje is under surveillance.
JACK: So.
LARRY: So. You find a hole- somewhere nearby- and you crawl into it and you stay put until I say it's safe to come out.
LARRY: Turn right outside the bar then second left. Via Spinetti. You'll find a silver Citroen C2 with Chieti plates. Check the glove box and follow the map. Castelvecchio. It's a fucking fortress. Literally. And as dead as a graveyard. Anyone within a three to five mile radius you'll see `em coming.
LARRY: Get there. Stay there.
LARRY: Do nothing `till you get my call.
MAN ON DUCATI: Buon giorno!
JACK: Buon giorno.
MAN ON DUCATI: Da dove provenite?
JACK: America.
MAN ON DUCATI: Ah! L'Americano!
JACK: Si. Il Americano.
MAN ON DUCATI: L'Americano ! L'Americano!
VOICE (O.S.): Can I help you?
JACK: I'm no good with machines.
FATHER BENEDETTO: You are American.
JACK: Si.
FATHER BENEDETTO: You speak Italian?
JACK: Poco.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Va bene! You stay at Pensione Arbruzzo.
JACK: Not for much longer.
FATHER BENEDETTO: On vacation?
JACK: Working vacation.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Lavoro? Che genere de lavoro?
JACK: Photographer.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Va bene. Che genere de fotografia?
JACK: Pictures of the region. Architecture, landscapes...
FATHER BENEDETTO: People?
JACK: No people. Sights and landmarks. For guidebooks, magazines...
FATHER BENEDETTO: Ah! Magazine! Which magazine?
JACK: Actually it's a syndicate. Lots of different publications. Um... Casa editrice.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Va bene. So you must share a glass of wine with me. Questa sera. This evening.
JACK: You're very kind, but I...
FATHER BENEDETTO: Certo. You want to know the truth about Abruzzo? A priest sees everything.
LARRY (V.O.): Do you have any idea how long I've been trying to reach you? What happened to the cell I gave you?
JACK: Did I forget to mention my electromagnetic hypersensitivity?
LARRY (V.O.): Don't get jumpy on me, Jack. That cell was secure.
LARRY (V.O.): I've got a job. It's a custom fit. You don't even have to pull the trigger.
JACK: Who's the client?
LARRY (V.O.): Relax. She triple checks out. Plus she comes to you. You don't have to move an inch.
JACK: This is a small town, Larry. I don't like small towns. I grew up in one. Besides, I'm already attracting attention.
LARRY (V.O.): So will anyone who's trying to kill you.
JACK: I'll think about it.
LARRY (V.O.): Think about this. I cleaned up your shit and made you disappear. You owe me my usual twenty percent commission plus the first installment. The rest is yours. After this you're free.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Que siamo! The quality of the brandy is good, the liquor is smooth and the glass warmed by the sun.
FATHER BENEDETTO: (in ENGLISH) The only good thing to come from the Francesi, everything else...
FATHER BENEDETTO: The French are... pezzi di merda. This is not an American discovery. Italians have known this for centuries. [In ITALIAN] When Rome called France the province of Gaul, they were just the same. Arrogant sensualists. Their cuisine is fussy and their wine effeminate. Only their brandy is worthy of any attention.
FATHER BENEDETTO: (in ENGLISH) Forgive me. I speak too fast. You study our history?
JACK: No.
FATHER BENEDETTO: You come to Italy to make a guide book and you don't care about history?
JACK: I take pictures, father.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Of course. You are American. You think you can escape history. You live for the present.
JACK: I try to, father.
JACK: Un po' di formaggio, per favore.
OLD WOMAN: Quale? Pecorino, parmigiano?
JACK: Questo.
JACK: E un po' di pecorino.
WOMAN: Grazie.
JACK: Prego. You're welcome.
WOMAN: You're American.
JACK: "Amidst gathering clouds".
WOMAN: You're assuming I'm English or you'd never have mentioned the weather. In fact I'm Belgian but I went to boarding school in England. And am quite happy to converse on all subjects meteorological.
WAITER: Buon giorno. Desidera?
WOMAN: Una spremute di limone. Per favore.
WAITER: Signore?
JACK: Una gelata alla fragola. Per favore.
JACK: Edward.
WOMAN: Mathilde.
MATHILDE: It's hot. My car has no air conditioning. I asked for it, but...
JACK: What car did they give you?
JACK: Range?
MATHILDE: One fifty to one seven five meters.
JACK: Time?
MATHILDE: Five seconds. Seven at the most.
JACK: Targets?
MATHILDE: One.
JACK: Fire rate?
MATHILDE: Rapid.
JACK: Magazine capacity?
MATHILDE: Large. Preferably 9mm Parabellum.
MATHILDE: The weapon must be fairly light. And compact. Possible to be broken down into its constituent parts.
L'AMERICANO: How compact?
MATHILDE: As compact as possible.
JACK: You want a submachine gun to fit in a lady's purse?
MATHILDE: A small vanity case would be permissible.
JACK: A small briefcase would be possible.
JACK: X-rays? Camouflage: lap-top, DVD player, MP3 or digital camera?
MATHILDE: Not necessary.
JACK: Noise?
MATHILDE: Silencer.
JACK: No such thing. You'll have to make do with a suppressor like everyone else. It'll dampen the decibels, dislocate the sound source and reduce muzzle flash. I can't make you silent but I can make you invisible as the Finnish phrase goes, but only as long as you're prepared to lose some range.
JACK: Two o'clock.
MATHILDE: Excuse me?
JACK: By the clothes stall. Light blue shirt, open at the neck, expensive buff suede shoes. Is he with you?
MATHILDE: I didn't see him. In any case, I'm alone.
MATHILDE: I can accept a slight loss of range.
JACK: You want a weapon with the firing capacity of a submachine gun and the range of a rifle.
MATHILDE: Can you do it?
JACK: Give me a month. To trial. Then a week for final adjustments.
JACK: Buon giorno.
JACK: Il fermo posta?
POSTMASTER: Nome?
JACK: Clarke.
POSTMASTER: Clarky?
JACK: Clarke. Una pacchetto.
POSTMASTER: Pacchetto!
POSTMASTER: Clarky, Clarky, Clarky. Ecco.
JACK: Grazie.
POSTMASTER: Identificazione.
ITALIAN GIRL: Amore?
JACK: Your source in Rome.
LARRY (V.O.): Clean bill of health and no OC. This was a straight favour with a dollar chaser, Jack. The guy's got a second cousin in NOCS on the graft who filched him the Socimi.
JACK: I hope you paid below the odds. The more you pay them the more cops gossip in the locker room.
LARRY (V.O.): No one's gossiping, Jack.
JACK: Yet.
FATHER BENEDETTO: All the sheep in my flock are dear to me, but some are dearer than most. Especially those that have strayed from the fold.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Fabio. He is a... [in ITALIAN] 'car doctor'. But I suspect his practice is not entirely sound. Ecco!
FATHER BENEDETTO: Fagiano. Pheasant. With sauce of orange juice, orange peel, chestnuts, garlic, Marsala wine and... Come si dici in Inglese? Brodo di Pollo. Chicken broth.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Also: salsify in garlic butter. Mange-tout. Fried wild mushrooms with truffle.
JACK: Sinful.
FATHER BENEDETTO: The Holy Father eats better than this.
JACK: Have you ever wanted to be anything other than a priest?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Have you ever wanted to be anything other than a... come se dice in Inglese...?
JACK: Photographer?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Photographer.
JACK: I do what I'm good at.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I'm sure you have other talents. You have the hands of a craftsman, not an artist. You are good with machines. Yet you told me just the opposite when we first met.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Journalism cannot make you a rich man.
JACK: No.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Perhaps you are rich already?
JACK: I'm not a young man. I have my savings.
FATHER BENEDETTO: (in ITALIAN) My meagre income is subject to the vagaries of the stock market and with church attendance declining there's less and less money in the offertory. But if a man has God in his vaults...
JACK: I don't think God is interested in me. Father.
FATHER BENEDETTO: (in ENGLISH) I know better than to try to make a convert over pheasant and Trebbiano.
JACK: What are the snakes for, father?
FATHER BENEDETTO: "The grave soul keeps its own secrets, and takes its own punishment in silence."
JACK: Sono un amico di Padre Benedetto.
FABIO: L'Americano?
JACK: Buon giorno.
JACK: I'm taking pictures forty minutes north of here. Right up in the mountains. Father Benedetto said you might be able to help.
FABIO: (in ITALIAN) You need models. For your photographs? Italian girls?
JACK: My publisher wouldn't stretch to a four by four and the park trails are playing havoc with my chassis.
FABIO: (in ITALIAN) Want me to take a look?
JACK: Not really. I just need something to work on a ruptured driveshaft.
FABIO: (in ITALIAN) You're a mechanic?
JACK: Just a hobby. I tinker.
FABIO: (in ITALIAN) Help yourself. [In ENGLISH] My garage is your garage.
JACK: I appreciate that.
JACK: Bene?
FABIO: Si! Si! Va bene!
JACK: Quant'e?
FABIO: Niente!
JACK: Ciao. Grazie.
FABIO: Ciao, Americano!
JACK: E Clara qui? [Is Clara here?]
SECOND GIRL: Non e stasera qui. [She's not here tonight.]
SECOND GIRL: Volete una bevanda? [Would you like a drink?]
JACK: Forse un altro tempo. [Perhaps another time.]
LARRY (V.O.): Jack?
JACK: I've got company.
JACK: If he's not baby-sitting the Belgian contract then he's either a Joe, a cop or a shooter. He's not with The Company, they're fast: it's been three days and no TA. He's not intel: they're deep background and he wants to be noticed. He might be a cowboy but he can't be a cop: they work in pairs and he's alone. Strike Guarda di Finanza, State Police and NOCS: he's not Italian- he doesn't look like one, dress like one or behave like one. So who the hell is he?
JACK: Larry?
LARRY (V.O.): You got a long list of enemies, Jack.
JACK: What's he waiting for?
LARRY (V.O.): Jack?
LARRY (V.O.): Want me to help take care of this?
JACK: I can handle it.
LARRY (V.O.): You sound spooked.
JACK: It's a bad line.
LARRY (V.O.): Jack?
JACK: Yes?
LARRY (V.O.): I appreciate the value of a pre- emptive strike in circumstances like these, I really do, but if you're going to go Generation Kill then do me a favour, OK, because I'm running out of bribe money. [A BEAT] Make it look like an accident.
MATHILDE: Mr. Clarke. How good to see you again.
MATHILDE: Refreshments?
JACK: The Carabinieri around here like roadblocks. It's cover.
MATHILDE: You picked a beautiful spot.
MATHILDE: You would be hard pressed to make a fast get away in this.
MATHILDE: I would have thought you to have had at least an Alfa Romeo.
JACK: This attracts less attention.
MATHILDE: Is it far?
JACK: Fifty minutes.
MATHILDE: Up there?
MATHILDE: The train was tiring. One has to keep alert so much in cities.
JACK: I'll wake you before the turn-off.
MATHILDE: Are we nearly there?
JACK: The turn-off's up ahead.
MATHILDE: I told you I work alone.
JACK: Just a precaution.
MATHILDE: Are those houses occupied?
JACK: Derelict. I checked three days ago.
MATHILDE: We should check again.
JACK: I'll check alone. There are adders the mountains. And vipers. Your shoes.
MATHILDE: I'll be careful.
MATHILDE: You have tested the gun here before?
JACK: Yes.
MATHILDE: It's beautiful here.
MATHILDE: I wish everywhere could be this tranquil.
JACK: You'd be out of a job.
MATHILDE: You don't like the peace?
JACK: It's hard to like something you know nothing about.
MATHILDE: Rounds?
JACK: I've made up two sorts.
JACK: Thirty lead and thirty jacketed.
MATHILDE: I should like a hundred of each.
MATHILDE: And fifty explosive.
JACK: Not a problem.
JACK: Will mercury do?
MATHILDE: Mercury will do very nicely.
MATHILDE: I have made my own targets.
JACK: Watch out for vipers.
MATHILDE: Muzzle velocity?
JACK: At least three hundred and sixty miles per hour. That's including twenty off the top for the sound suppression.
MATHILDE: Socimi?
JACK: Eight-two-one.
MATHILDE: I've not had one before.
JACK: You'll find it easy. I've re- balanced it for the longer barrel. The fulcrum is two centimetres forward of the grip now. Which won't matter if you're firing- and I'm guessing you are- from a fixed position.
JACK: No major recoil issues. You should be able to hold onto any target. Even the smallest.
MATHILDE: You've done a good job, Mr. Clarke. Thank you. Thank you very much.
JACK: Good shot.
MATHILDE: Go to the stones and fire near me.
MATHILDE: Say...
MATHILDE: ...into the bush with the yellow flowers. Two bursts. Five seconds apart.
MATHILDE: The sound suppression is superb. I couldn't place the direction of fire.
MATHILDE: I shall require the rounds and the weapon by the first of next month. In the meantime would you tighten the adjusting screws on the sight, they are too loose. And lengthen the stock by three centimetres. I also want a sixty round magazine.
JACK: You'll upset the balance.
MATHILDE: I'm prepared to accept that.
JACK: Then I'm happy to oblige.
MATHILDE: What about the a case?
JACK: A briefcase. Samsonite. Standard pattern in black with combination locks. Is there a number you'd prefer?
MATHILDE: Eight-two-one.
JACK: Eight-two-one.
MATHILDE: What do you want done with these?
JACK: Throw them in the lake.
MATHILDE: How thoughtful.
MATHILDE: I don't know Italian wine.
JACK: Aspirinio. Like Mosacata but frizzante.
JACK: It wouldn't look right if the picnic wasn't touched.
MATHILDE: You chilled the wine. I thought...
JACK: It had to be chilled. They're Italian cops.
MATHILDE: (disappointed) You think of everything.
JACK: I'm paid to. Don't move.
MATHILDE: Wow.
MATHILDE: It's so beautiful.
JACK: Parnassius apollo. It's endangered.
MATHILDE: You like coming here.
JACK: It serves its purpose.
MATHILDE: You've never taken a woman here before?
JACK: No.
MATHILDE: (sadly) Perhaps you do not have a woman in your life. It is not easy for us to keep relationships. Not in our world.
JACK: I have an acquaintance.
MATHILDE: Friendships are transitory. It is...
JACK: Wild boar.
MATHILDE: I wish you hadn't brought me here.
MATHILDE: This is the sort of place I wish I'd discovered by myself. Then maybe one day I could have retired here. But you already know it.
JACK: I'm much older than you. By the time you've retired I'll be dead.
MATHILDE: We will meet as before?
MATHILDE: On the first of next month?
MATHILDE: Around noon?
MATHILDE: Thank you for a lovely day. Mr. Butterfly.
MATHILDE: You must take your mistress to the meadow for a picnic.
BARMAN: Sergio Leone. Italiano.
BARMAN: (in poor ENGLISH) You like cow boy movie?
JACK: Hokey.
CLARA: Morboso?
CLARA: (with certainty) Morboso.
JACK: Morboso?
CLARA: Morboso is like... when you can't stop thinking about something.
CLARA: Or someone.
JACK: You needn't act.
CLARA: Act?
JACK: You might have to act with your other clients but you don't have to pretend anything at all with me.
JACK: I want you to be yourself with me. Be as indifferent as you like. I came here to get pleasure, not to give it.
CLARA: Maybe I pretend very well. I got more tip than the other girls usually get.
JACK: I don't sleep with the other girls.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I've been looking for you.
FATHER BENEDETTO: A man was here asking questions about you.
JACK: Here?
FATHER BENEDETTO: He came to the church this afternoon.
JACK: What did he want?
FATHER BENEDETTO: To know where you live. He said he was a friend from Switzerland.
JACK: Switzerland?
JACK: And you told him?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Of course I do not tell him. How do I know him? He is maybe the police. Certainly he is no friend. A friend would know your pensione. Besides...
FATHER BENEDETTO: Friends do not carry guns.
FATHER BENEDETTO: If you live in Italy, and you are a man of the cloth, you meet many people. Besides, I lived once in Naples. If you live in Naples you know the difference between a fat wallet and a... custodia per armi di spalla. How you say in English?
JACK: Shoulder holster.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Si.
JACK: You're a true friend, father.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I am a priest.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Signor Clarke?
FATHER BENEDETTO: I make a mistake. He did not say he was from La Svizzera: Switzerland. He said- forgive me the names in Italian are so similar- La Svezia: Sweden.
BARMAN: (in ITALIAN) Someone left this for "L'Americano". This afternoon.
JACK: Grazie.
CLARA: Buon giorno!
JACK: Buon giorno.
CLARA: You are hurt?
JACK: I'm fine.
CLARA: What's wrong with you?
JACK: It's nothing really. Just a broken rib. Un costollo rotta?
CLARA: Stronzo! Let me help you!
JACK: I came off my bike.
CLARA: But you have to go to the hospital!
JACK: No, no, no. I have pain killers. I just need a strong cup of coffee.
CLARA: I know a place which make the strongest coffee in L'Aquila.
CLARA: Ve bene. Tutto posto. Signor Farfalla. [Good. Everything's OK. Mr. Butterfly.]
JACK: Why d'you call me that?
CLARA: You have a tattoo. On your back.
JACK: How did he know I was here, Larry?
LARRY (V.O.): You think I hired him?
LARRY (V.O.): Are you out of your fucking mind, Jack?
JACK: I doubt it.
LARRY (V.O.): After everything I've done for you? The car, the cell phone (which you threw away), the safehouse, the fake passport? Someone has to pay for this shit, Jack! I have to pay for this shit. It comes out of my commission. You're my lousy profit margin. Why the fuck would I take a contract out on my own profit margin? You're not thinking straight. I was the one who told you to leave town! I told you to come to Rome! God damn it you've got a job to do! Why the Hell would
CLARA: My friend Anna. This is my friend Signor Farfalla.
JACK: How do you do?
ANNA: I am very well thank you.
JACK: Will you take a coffee with me?
CLARA: That would be very good.
JACK: Prego.
CLARA: Anna is learning English.
JACK: Have you been to England?
ANNA: But you are...
ANNA: Lui Americano?
JACK: I am.
ANNA: Ah. I have not been to England only to France. But I would love to go to America.
JACK: Due cappuccini e un cafe corretto.
CLARA: Anna is like all Italians. She thinks America is like in the movies. Little Italy, "West Side Story", "Chicago".
(MORE): CLARA (cont'd) I tell her in these times America is like here, there, anywhere. The streets are not... pave-ed with gold.
JACK: If not with gold, than at least not with enough medieval cobbles to loosen every-self tapping screw in a Fiat.
JACK: Where do you come from, Anna?
JACK: Dove abita?
ANNA: Ah, yes! I live in Via dell' Argilla. Nearby to Clara.
CLARA: Perhaps we will have a drink together soon? I am free...
CLARA: ...on Monday.
JACK: Great. I'll see you then.
CLARA: But Eduardo... Where would you like to meet?
JACK: How about our usual place?
CLARA: Our usual place?
CLARA: I forgot. Where is our usual place?
JACK: You've forgotten?
CLARA: Remind me.
JACK: Maybe we should try something different.
CLARA: Where would you like to try, Eduardo?
JACK: Locanda Grapelli?
CLARA: Locanda Grapelli! Si!
ANNA: This is the best food in the area.
JACK: Good.
CLARA: Seven?
JACK: Seven.
CLARA: Locanda Grapelli.
JACK: Locanda Grapelli.
CLARA: You'll be there?
JACK: I'll be there.
CLARA: See you then, Eduardo.
JACK: See you then, Clara. It was a delight to meet you Anna. Arrivederci.
ANNA: Arrivederci, Signor Farfalla.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Buon giorno!
FATHER BENEDETTO: I walk here to meditate. Once a week, Wednesday, the farthest one can travel in the week from the Sabbath. The trees are like the Stations of the Cross: by certain trees I thank God for certain favours he has granted me, or certain gifts he has made to me and all men. For example, here by this pine, I thank him for the many friendships I have and ask him to look after those of my friends who are troubled.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Some walk here in the cool of evening. Others come at night.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I wonder how many bastards have been made here?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Perhaps you'll stay and settle here yourself?
JACK: What makes you think I'm leaving?
FATHER BENEDETTO: You told me as much when we first met. Besides, those who seek for peace seldom find it. They're always moving on, looking elsewhere. [A BEAT] And they are usually sinners.
JACK: All men are sinners.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Some are greater sinners than others. And those who seek peace have much sinning in their history.
JACK: I don't seek peace. I never have.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Until now.
JACK: Perhaps. Perhaps I'll stay. The valley. The villages. The mountains.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Forgive me. This is the priest in me speaking. And the friend. But you have done much sinning, Signor Clarke. You still do.
JACK: I see a whore. She's young enough to be my daughter.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I do not refer to the sins of carnality. But to the deadly sins...
JACK: Aren't all sins equal?
FATHER BENEDETTO: We are not discussing theology, my friend, but you. You like this town, this valley.
(MORE): FATHER BENEDETTO (cont'd) You should like to remain here and find your peace at last. Yet you cannot. There is something you cannot ignore. Some force. Some enemy.
FATHER BENEDETTO: You want to speak but you dare not. You know no one sufficiently well to share your history with them. You know I am trustworthy yet still you are cautious.
FATHER BENEDETTO: What job do you do, Signor? Are you on the run, as they say?
JACK: Who says?
FATHER BENEDETTO: It's an expression, no?
JACK: Everyone's on the run from something.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Some men watch some of the shadows. You watch them all.
JACK: I've done nothing I didn't have good cause to do.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Do you wish to tell me?
JACK: For what reason?
FATHER BENEDETTO: For your own sake. Perhaps I can pray for you?
JACK: I make things. Artifacts.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Counterfeit money?
JACK: Why do you say that?
FATHER BENEDETTO: You work in metal. You are given some steel by Fabio, the car doctor.
JACK: You know a lot about me.
FATHER BENEDETTO: I know only what you do in the town. People talk to me. I am their priest and they trust me.
JACK: And I should too?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Of course.
JACK: Fabio. The `car doctor'. Was he conceived here father?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Why do you ask me that?
JACK: He looks like you. Even more than he does in the photos you keep of each other. Where was he conceived, father? Under one of these trees? At night? Like all the other bastards?
FATHER BENEDETTO: I do not remember, Signor. It was twenty-five years ago.
FATHER BENEDETTO: In the end it is I who confesses to you.
JACK: Expecting me to reciprocate?
FATHER BENEDETTO: Perhaps. For your own good. You cannot doubt the existence of Hell. You live in it. It is a place without love. As for me, I go about my daily duties because the town requires it of me. Some know what you know. Perhaps I have no right to wear these robes. But I do have a heart full of a father's love. Something close to His heart! And for that I am both grateful and happy.
FATHER BENEDETTO: What do you have, my friend?
CLARA (O.S.): Ciao.
CLARA: I did not think you would come.
JACK: I wasn't sure you meant me to.
CLARA: Certo.
WAITER: Per due?
CLARA: Si.
CLARA: Una botiglia di acqua minerale non gasata et... una Parasini, per favore.
WAITER: Menu in Inglese?
JACK: No, grazie.
WAITER: Tedesco? Olandese?
CLARA: (to the WAITER) He speaks Italian. So do I. Listen:
CLARA: Una botiglia di acqua minerale et una Parasini, per favore.
WAITER: Gasata?
CLARA: Non gasata.
CLARA: (mostly to herself) Cittadina.
JACK: Small towns.
CLARA: Parasini. From Calabria. It is good, you will agree?
JACK: It is. Very good.
CLARA: Can I ask you something, Eduardo?
JACK: Sure.
CLARA: You are married?
JACK: No.
JACK: I doubt any of the couples here are. With the exception of the Germans at table seven. She's wearing a wedding ring and they haven't spoken a word to each other for eight and half minutes.
CLARA: I was sure this was your secret.
JACK: What makes you think I have a secret? I'm an ordinary man. I cough. I fart. I earn a living.
CLARA: I do not think you are an ordinary man. I think you are a good man. But you have a secret.
CLARA: He thinks we are a couple.
JACK: Why spoil the illusion?
CLARA: (in ITALIAN) As long as we know it is an illusion.
WAITER: Buona sera. Desidera?
CLARA: Woooow!
JACK: How is it?
CLARA: Bitchin'.
JACK: (amused) Bitchin'?
CLARA: It's- come se dice- `slang', no? Eco.
JACK: No thanks.
CLARA: Come on, Eduardo!
CLARA: It is good, you will agree?
JACK: (his mouth full) I will agree.
CLARA: (sensing his teasing) My English is nice!
JACK: It's bitchin'.
CLARA: (defending herself) You know how to swear in Italian?
JACK: Sure. Bastardo. Imbecile.
CLARA: "Imbecile?" Eduardo! Try: Mangia merde e morte: tuo cazzo un brufolo.
JACK: Eat shit and die, pimple dick?
CLARA: Perdone!
JACK: I guess I've led a sheltered life. Of sorts.
CLARA: Shell-tered?
JACK: Too much work.
CLARA: Too much work.
CLARA: I don't apologise, Eduardo.
JACK: For what?
CLARA: For this I do. My job.
JACK: Never apologise.
CLARA: Except this job is full of testa di cazzo.
JACK: Mine too.
CLARA: Lei?
JACK: Si.
CLARA: But you are too young to... pensione?
JACK: Retire.
CLARA: Si.
JACK: Liar.
CLARA: No!
JACK: Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client?
JACK: Am I a client?
CLARA: This say yes.
CLARA: This...
CLARA: This cannot be for sale. But I am not want to... come se dice?
JACK: Give it away.
CLARA: Stronzo! I buy you a present!
JACK: Grazie.
JACK: Grazie, Clara.
CLARA: Prego. Eduardo.
CLARA: My apartment is not far from here.
LARRY (V.O.): We're moving the drop.
JACK: Where?
LARRY (V.O.): We don't know yet. I'll call you ten am on the day with a venue. Give you enough time to make the noon delivery.
JACK: I don't deliver, Larry. I never deliver. It's too dangerous. She comes to me. I know the town. That's what we agreed.
LARRY (V.O.): I told `em. I told `em if there was even the slightest chance security had been breached, you'd have dealt with it immediately.
JACK: Breach? What breach?
LARRY: Our pretty young Belgian client and her associates think someone on your long list of enemies might have put a tail on you.
JACK (V.O.): Not possible.
LARRY: Course not, Jack. But if, for the sake of argument, it was possible- I'm thinking it could be Galazzo. Or Simenov. Or Italian undercover.
JACK (V.O.): Cops?
LARRY: The crooked kind.
JACK (V.O.): How come I'm still here?
LARRY: The Belgians think they're planning to wait for the drop and exterminate you and Mathilde in one swoop.
JACK (V.O.): Where the hell's this information coming from?
LARRY: I'm fucked if I know, Jack. If you want my opinion, they're just being jittery. I told `em you were the most security conscious professional I know. I told `em no one gets close to you.
JACK: They don't.
LARRY (V.O.): I told `em if we couldn't trust you to keep a tight lid on operations the who could we trust?
JACK: They can. They can trust me and so can you.
JACK: I've never jeopardised an operation in my life.
LARRY (V.O.): You don't have to tell me that, Jack. For Christ's sake, you closed your own girlfriend's account...
LARRY: Jack? [A BEAT] Jack? I'm sorry.
LARRY: That was, um.... I'm just saying you can be relied on.
LARRY: Jack?
CLARA: Ciao, Eduardo!
JACK: Put them in the back. We've got a way to go.
CLARA: Where we go?
JACK: Swimming.
CLARA: How far do we go? To Fanale?
JACK: An hour. And we're not going to the sea, we're going to the lakes. In the mountains.
CLARA: For a... come se dice... you have in the back...
JACK: A picnic.
CLARA: A pick-nick! We are going for a pick-nick. Just the two of us.
CLARA: I have practise my English, Eduardo. I love to have pick-nick. It is a beautiful day, isn't it?
JACK: It is.
CLARA: Is it more far?
JACK: Ten kilometres. Another twenty minutes.
CLARA: Twelve kilometres? In twenty minutes?
JACK: We're going off the beaten track.
JACK: Lontano. Fuori mano.
CLARA: You will speak Italian. One day, I will teach you.
CLARA: Where are we going?
JACK: You shall see.
CLARA: I think it is good we should stay close to the road.
JACK: There's no need to worry. I've been here before several times. Taking photographs.
JACK: You're not afraid of coming into the wild with me, are you?
CLARA: No!
CLARA: Of course I am not. Not with you. But this...
CLARA: ...sentiero!
CLARA: You should have a jeep. A Toyota. It is not good for a... berlina.
JACK: This is a Citroen!
JACK: This was made by the French for taking potatoes to market. Besides, I always come here in this car.
CLARA: You sure?
JACK: Of course. I don't want to walk back to town any more than you do.
CLARA: I think you are crazy. This will go to nowhere.
JACK: I assure you it does.
CLARA: Now there is no road!
CLARA: Is this where we go?
JACK: No. Not quite. We go another hundred metres, through the wood. But from here we just roll forward. No motor. No sound. And you'll see a wonder.
JACK: You won't need to hold on. I'll go slowly. Just relax and look.
CLARA: No one comes here?
JACK: No.
CLARA: Just you.
JACK: Yes.
CLARA: Well?
CLARA: I am going to swim in the lake. Are you coming?
JACK: There are vipers! Vipera! Marasso!
CLARA: Maybe! But I am lucky!
CLARA: (shouting) He is an Italian bird! We disturb his siesta!
CLARA: Come, Signor Farfalla!
CLARA: Come!
CLARA: Stand by me.
CLARA: Keep still. Watch.
JACK: If we stay here for a year, they'll devour us.
CLARA: It is said that if these fishes bite at two hands holding, then love is good for the people.
JACK: Maybe we should...
CLARA: Do you make love in the water?
JACK: I haven't.
CLARA: What's wrong?
JACK: Let's eat.
CLARA: Eduardo.
CLARA: Is this your real name?
JACK: Is Clara yours?
CLARA: Si. Yes.
JACK: Edward is my real name.
CLARA: Ed-ward.
CLARA: You are sure you are not married, Eduardo?
JACK: Quite sure.
CLARA: Will you put this on my back?
CLARA: Eduardo?
CLARA: Amore?
CLARA: Eduardo, what's wrong?
JACK: Nothing.
JACK (V.O.): Dear Father Benedetto...
JACK (V.O.): I promised myself that I would write to you- as your friend- to say goodbye.
JACK (V.O.): Everything I've ever done...
JACK (V.O.): I've done for a reason.
JACK (V.O.): I never thought the day would come when I'd run out of reasons. Reasons to worry. Reasons to run. Reasons to pull the trigger.
JACK (V.O.): Maybe that day's come.
JACK (V.O.): Or maybe I've just found a reason to change.
CLARA: Grazie, Eduardo.
JACK: I still don't understand. What's the point of a gun if it's not loaded?
CLARA: One of the girls borrow it to me after the second hooker in Chieti is murdered. With some of the clients it make me feel safe. I don't tell the police, of course, but... Madonna, Eduardo. How they do to these two women! A police agente from Rome show me photographs. They show photographs to everyone in Via Lampedusa.
CLARA: Non capito... how one person hurt another in this way.
JACK: Does the gun make you feel safer with me?
CLARA: You are not a client.
JACK: Then why's it in your purse?
CLARA: I have to work tonight, amore.
JACK (V.O.): Maybe this is suicide. Cops often put the graft on working girls. Perhaps the girl I told you about, Clara, has sold me out.
(MORE): JACK (V.O.) (cont'd) Maybe she's a cop herself, or maybe she's a hired gun. Then again, maybe Clara is who she says she is and my Belgian clients will take the gun, shoot me themselves and keep the money. Always a risk in my profession. Or perhaps my trusted colleague in Rome no longer trusts me. Perhaps even you, Father, with your connections in Naples...
CLARA: What will you do?
JACK: I guess I'll go to work too.
CLARA: And after that? Tomorrow and the next day.
JACK: I can't stay here forever.
JACK (V.O.): It's not that I've given up on life, Father. Just the way that I was living it. If you can call it living.
CLARA: I want always to stay here.
JACK: It's time to go home.
CLARA: Let me come to your home.
JACK: I can't, Clara. One day...
JACK (V.O.): If I had one request, Father, it would be this. That it's not Clara who finally pulls the trigger. But whoever it is...
CLARA: Stay forever here.
JACK (V.O.): ...by this time tomorrow I'll be dead.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Ciao Fabio, come stai?
IL POSTINO: Bene grazie, Padre.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Dear Father Benedetto. I promised myself that I would write to you- as your friend- to say goodbye...
FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.): Everything I've ever done...
FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.): I've done for a reason.
MATHILDE: Hello. I see you have brought it in from the car with you.
JACK: All there, as agreed.
MATHILDE: What's in the paper bag?
JACK: Sweets. For your journey.
JACK: I guessed you'd have a sweet tooth.
MATHILDE: That is most thoughtful of you.
JACK: I suppose I'll read about this in the Times or the International Herald Tribune. Or Il Maessagiero.
MATHILDE: Yes, I expect so.
MATHILDE: I'm just going to the ladies. Wait here.
MATHILDE: Shall we go.
MATHILDE: You won't need your piece.
JACK: You never know.
JACK: Sure. You?
MATHILDE: Everything's just fine.
MATHILDE: Final payment.
MATHILDE: Buy yourself a retirement clock.
JACK: How do you know I'm retiring?
MATHILDE: Have you taken your girl up to the meadow yet?
MATHILDE: (whispers to JACK) Do it.
MATHILDE: Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly.
LARRY: Not only did you not kill him, you gave him my fucking money?
MATHILDE: What else could I do? There were kids everywhere. Besides he's suspicious.
LARRY: He's paranoid. That's why I'm paying you the GDP of a small country to get close to him. You could have got him in the sack. You should have got him in the car park. Now you're going to have to take him out long range!
MATHILDE: I prefer it that way.
MATHILDE: The Socimi is the perfect weapon.
LARRY: Let's hope his workmanship is up to scratch.
LARRY: Sweden turned Jack into a liability. Three stiffs: two shooters and an innocent civilian. I can't afford a mistake like that again. Europol are crooked but they aren't cheap. Jack's supposed to make me money. Not run up cleaning bills.
MATHILDE: He made short work of the last guy you hired.
LARRY: Never mind Larson. He didn't stand a chance, not against someone as paranoid as Jack. The Swede was only there to take Jack's heat off you. So don't fuck this up again.
LARRY: Mind if I help myself?
LARRY: Shit.
LARRY: Is there any actual candy in this gas guzzler?
JACK: When can I see you?
CLARA: I have to work tonight.
CLARA: You come to my apartment after.
JACK: If I asked you would you come away with me?
CLARA: Come away with you?
JACK: Why not?
CLARA: Together?
JACK: Together.
CLARA: Where?
JACK: Wherever. Then when we're through, we could come back here. For good.
CLARA: To live?
JACK: Where else?
CLARA: Forever?
JACK: Forever.
JACK: Unless you have other plans.
CLARA: Other plans?
CLARA: I love you, Signor Eduardo Farfalla.
CLARA: What's happening?
JACK: Someone got what was coming to them.
JACK: Go to your apartment and pack. Wait `till I get there. Don't answer the door to anyone but me.
CLARA: Eduardo, please?
JACK: Trust me.
CLARA: I trust you.
JACK: Clara. My name is not Eduardo.
CLARA: No?
JACK: My name is Jack.
CLARA: Jack.
CLARA: You promise you're not married?
JACK: I promise. Take this.
JACK: Look after it. In case.
CLARA: (perplexed) In case?
JACK: Now go.
LARRY: You're too old for this life, Jack.
LARRY: You get sentimental then you fuck things up.
JACK: What will you tell them?
FATHER BENEDETTO: I will them that the man who wrote this letter is my friend.
FATHER BENEDETTO: Jack.
