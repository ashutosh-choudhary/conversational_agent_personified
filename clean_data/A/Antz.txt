Z (O.S.): (over a dark screen) All my life, I've lived and worked in the big city...
Z (V.O.): ...which is kind of a problem, since I've always felt uncomfortably in crowds.
Z: I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention. (pause) I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a grub.  The whole system just...makes me feel...insignificant.
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: (enthusiastic) Terrific!  You should feel insignificant!
Z: ...I should?
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: (hopping around enthusiastically) YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't mind that I don't matter!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: (incredibly "up") Z, we're part of the fastest growing species in the whole world!
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: Ask me why we're so successful.
Z: Why are we so successful?
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: I'm glad you asked me that question!
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: What do you see out there?
Z: ...Ants...
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- I'm meaningless, you're meaningless."
Z: But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: Z...you need help. (looking at a clock) Whoops!  We're gonna have to stop there.  Your minute is up!
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR: Now back to work!  We've made progress!  Remember -- let's be best superorganism we can be!
AZTECA: Hello?!  Earth to Z!  You better snap out of it, or there's gonna be a lot of pissed off ants!
Z: (snapping out of it) Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop! (looking at the dirt) Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene? (Z's stomach growls) Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's two million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
AZTECA: (sweetly) Z, old pal... (shouts) SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
Z: The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
AZTECA: No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets away, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Z: Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
AZTECA: (resigned) Break's over.
Z: (getting back to work) This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
AZTECA: Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
GENERAL FORMICA: Cut the chit-chat down there! (turning to Carpenter) We've spoiled these workers, Carpenter.  They've never had it so good, and listen to them -- always grumbling and complaining...
CARPENTER: ...Yes, sir.
GENERAL FORMICA: What have they got to complain about? Three square meals a day...
CARPENTER: Actually, sir, we've cut them down to three roughly rectangular meals a week.
FORMICA: Don't give me statistics, Carpenter. I know what I'm talking about.  DOORS!
FORMICA: (to guard ant, while passing) Oil that, soldier.
QUEEN: Ah!  General Formica.
QUEEN: General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...pains me. The thought of any of my children going hungry... (she shudders; then, to baby) Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth! (to mid-wife) Ship 'er out. (back to Formica) What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
FORMICA: We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
QUEEN: Yes, what else?
FORMICA: Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
QUEEN: (to baby) No snacking between meals!  Off you go! (to Formica) Now -- what were we saying?
FORMICA: (Oliver North-style) I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
QUEEN: Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
BALA (O.S.): General Formica!
CARPENTER: (sotto) Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
FORMICA: Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
BALA: Well -- I thought -- since we're getting married...it might be nice if we...got to know one another.
QUEEN: Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
BALA: It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
FORMICA: (uncomfortable) Conversation...yes...well... (to Carpenter) Wasn't she briefed?
QUEEN: (holding up a baby) Look, General!  A darling baby soldier! (emotionally, to baby) Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece! (handing it off) Next!
FORMICA: (using the interruption) I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
BALA: General -- we have to talk sometime!
FORMICA: Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
CARPENTER: Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
FORMICA: Outstanding.  Princess...?
BALA: So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
FORMICA: (scouring his mind) Well... (that's it!) I declared war!
BALA: (sadly) Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
CARPENTER: (under his breath) Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
FORMICA: Duty calls!
FORMICA: No squeak.  Outstanding!
QUEEN: (sympathetically) I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
BALA: (hopefully) You did?
QUEEN: Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
BALA: (unconvinced) Yes...he's wonderful...
HANDMAIDEN #1: (swooning over General Formica) The General's body segments are so...symmetrical.
HANDMAIDEN #2: (giggling) I'd let him order me into battle anyday.
HANDMAIDEN #1: Princess?  What's wrong?
BALA: Wrong?  How could anything be wrong? I'm going to marry General Formica and be a queen and have millions of babies, just like my mom. (concerned) Do I look fat to you?
HANDMAIDEN #2: (knowingly, to Handmaiden #2) Pre-wedding jitters.
HANDMAIDEN #1: You just need to blow off some steam. Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club!
BALA: The Club's so someplace different.
HANDMAIDEN #2: There isn't anyplace else -- (making a joke) Except the worker bar.
BALA: The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
HANDMAIDEN #1: But -- we can't -- there'll be workers there.
Z: We declared war again? (off Weaver's nod) Are you scared?
WEAVER: (shrugs) I'll be back.
APHIDS: (as they're slapped on bar) Ouch!  Ouch!
BARTENDER: Two aphid beers.
Z: (as Bartender leaves) Did you see that?  How he gave you the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
WEAVER: I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Z: Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
WEAVER: Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
Z: Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging. (sighs) No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
WEAVER: Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me. (quaffing his aphid beer) Don't you want your aphid beer?
Z: I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
WEAVER: Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Z: Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
WEAVER: And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Z: Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
DRUNK SCOUT: Have you?  No, ya goddam larvas!  But I have... (becoming emotional) ...Mosquitos n' caterpillars n' beetles -- all livin' in peace, stuffin their guts with food...No rules, no regulations...you can be your own ant there... (howling drunkenly) It's Insectopia!  Insectopia!
Z: Hey, Weaver, listen!
DRUNK SCOUT: I was cut off from my unit -- found it by mistake -- (slurring) It changed my life! (spraying another soldier with saliva) You see -- ya follow the great yellow egg, and you come to the land of red and white --
SOLDIERS: You've had enough for one night! Come on, Gramps, before you get in trouble.
Z: (excited) Hey, did you hear what he said?!
WEAVER: Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
HANDMAIDEN #2: We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
BALA: I'm the Princess, aren't I?
HANDMAIDEN #2: Of course --
BALA: And do Princesses do improper things?
HANDMAIDEN #2: Of course not --
BALA: Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
BALA: I'm just a common worker, cooling off after a rough day!
BARKER: (on loudspeaker) Okay, folks.  It's six-fifteen, and that means it's time to dance.
WEAVER: (draining his beer) Time to cut a rug, Z!
Z: I'm not in the mood. (disgusted) Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
WEAVER: Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
BARKER: (southern twang) And a left-right-quarterstep-back step-halfstep -- a left-right- quarterstep-backstep-halfstep -- a left-right-quarterstep-backstep halfstep --
BALA: I'm going to ask one of these mindless, primitive worker-types to dance with me!
HANDMAIDEN #1: But General Formica would be furious!
BALA: (enjoying the idea) I know.
Z: What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
BALA: Wanna dance?
Z: Me?! (regaining suavosity) Just let me finish my beer.
Z: So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
BALA: (covering up) I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Z: The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
BALA: (shocked) What?
Z: Now, let's see, I -- it's been a while since I -- I think you --
Z: Here, I'll lead.
BALA: Are you sure this is a real dance?
Z: Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
BALA: (surprised) Really?
Z: Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
BALA: You're right!
Z: (surprised) You -- you think I'm right?
BALA: Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
SOLDIER: Hey!  Watch your step,
BALA: You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
Z: (terrified) Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time. (whispering to Bala) Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble! (ineptly trying to placate the soldier) You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
BALA: Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
SOLDIER: How come you don't dance like the rest of us?
Z: Because -- because I'm an
SOLDIER #2: An individual?  Never heard of it.
MANDIBLE: You look like a worker to me.
WEAVER: Hey, lay off my little buddy!
HANDMAIDEN #1: Princess Bala!  Princess Bala!
Z: Princess?  You're a
BALA: Uh oh. (to Z) Goodbye!  Gotta run!
Z: Wait!  When can I see you again?
BALA: Let me think.  Hmmnn... (thinks) Never.  Bye!
Z: Wait!  Princess!  Wait!
WEAVER: Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Z: Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
WEAVER: It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Z: What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- bingo!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little... (wags his eyebrows suggestively) tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
Z: You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
WEAVER: (thinks) I can't think of any.
Z: (pause) Well I'm gonna start doing things for you...
WEAVER: Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Z: You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
WEAVER: Maybe I'll get lucky. (Weaver thinks about it) You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
WEAVER: Wear this.
Z: (overjoyed) You're a real buddy.
WEAVER: (sourly) Yeah, I know.
Z: What do I do?
WEAVER: Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
Z: (overjoyed) Thanks!  I owe you!
Z: Any of you guys know when the Princess will show up?  She's kind of a personal friend.
LOUD VOICE: ATTEN-
FORMICA: First of all, let me make one thing clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by thinking for himself.  All this "thinking" stuff is a load of crap. If the almighty had wanted you boys to think, he wouldn't have given you huge mandibles and a brain so small you'd misplace it if it wasn't trapped inside your head.
Z: (slapping his thigh) "Trapped inside your head" -- that's a good one --
Z: Geez -- tough room.
FORMICA: (striding back and forth) We ants survive as a species because we do what we're told.  We survive because we work together, as one, we get the job done, we do whatever it takes to persevere! (dramatic pause) Hell, we're not an army of ants...we're one giant ant, with giant fists, and giant jaws!
Z: (to the soldier ant next to him) Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
FORMICA: Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a food shortage.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for breakfast, we are gonna eat the enemy for lunch, and we are gonna eat the enemy for dinner!
Z: Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
FORMICA: (reflective moment) Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant. (he looks out at his army) And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Z: (clapping) Bravo!  Bring on the Princess!
COLONEL: Stow the gab there, soldier!  Let's move 'em out!
COLONEL: Eyes...
Z: (waving) Princess!  Princess Bala!  Hey!  It's me!  Z!  I've got your scarf!
BALA: (peering out) Who is that idiot?
QUEEN: Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Z: (excited) Excuse me, guys -- That's my date. Well, it's been fun.  Have a great war!
Z: Hey!  Wait!
BARBATUS: You new, kid?
Z: I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
BARBATUS: Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
Z: Wait a minute, there's been a mistake!  I've got to get back to the colony!
BARBATUS: Are you crazy, kid?  They shoot deserters!
BARBATUS: You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you. (off Z's look) Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Z: Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable. (nervously) So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
BARBATUS: No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Z: (alarmed) Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
ANT SOLDIERS: (to the tune of "When Johnny Comes Marching Home") We ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah!  We slaughter termites just for fun, Hurrah! Hurrah!
Z: So -- these termites, they're little, shy, retiring insects?
BARBATUS: (grim smile) No such luck.  Those dirty terms are five times bigger than us, and they shoot acid from their foreheads!
SOLDIER ANTS: We ants go marching two by two, hurrah!  Hurrah!  We'll all be dead before we're through, hurrah!  Hurrah!
Z: Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
BARBATUS: Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
ANT SOLDIERS: We ants are marching three by three, hurrah!  Hurrah!  Dead ants is what we soon will be, hurrah!  Hurrah!
Z: So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
BARBATUS: Superior numbers, kid!
BARBATUS: Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!
BARBATUS: It's too damn quiet.
BARBATUS: Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Z: (petrified) Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
COLONEL: (ignoring him) Light it up!
COLONEL: They're here!!!
BARBATUS: (to Z) Keep your head down!
Z: (looking around) Guys!  Guys!  It isn't too late for all of us to just talk this over!
Z: Wait!  Please!  Acid makes me come out in spots!  -- Could I just say I have always had the greatest respect for your species?  I mean, eating wood -- why didn't I think of that?
Z: BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
BARBATUS: Don't get all sappy about it!
COLONEL: I love the smell of formic acid in the morning.
Z: Look out!
Z: Excuse me.  I seem to be lost, and I was wondering if you could give me --
Z: (backing away) I'll let myself out.
Z: (backing away) Shoo! -- Torro!  Torro!
ANT OFFICER: (points at Z) He's killed their Queen!
Z: Hey, I'm sorry, it was a mistake --
Z: (facetious) This is terrific!   Let's exact crippling war reparations!  Let's set up a puppet government!
ANT OFFICER: Let's slaughter them all!
BARBATUS (O.S.): Z!  Over here!
Z: (hopeful) Barbatus?
Z: (shocked) Barbatus!
BARBATUS: Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Z: No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
BARBATUS: No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus. (he winces) I can't feel my legs...
Z: Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
BARBATUS: (gasping) I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Z: Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
BARBATUS: Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
AZTECA: Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
WEAVER: (covering) I'm new...I was born yesterday.
AZTECA: Tell me about it.
WEAVER: Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
AZTECA: (ogling him) Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
FOREMAN: What's the holdup here?!
WEAVER: Sorry, sir -- I was just having a little chat with my friend --
FOREMAN: (yelling at Weaver) Who said you could have a chat? You're not a chatter, you're a digger!  So shut up and dig!
AZTECA: Leave him alone!  He's new.
FOREMAN: You  too?  Well just for that, you lose your day's rations!  Now get back to work!
AZTECA: (surprised at herself) I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
WEAVER: Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
AZTECA: (flirting) Are you asking me out to dinner?
WEAVER: (blushing) No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
AZTECA: I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... downsized.
GUARD ANT: Look!  They're back!  The army's back!  Alert the colony!
EXCITED ANTS: The army's returned!  Our brave boys are back! (etc.)
AZTECA: It looks like only one soldier made it back!
WEAVER: (to himself) Poor Z -- I should never have let you go!
Z: It was horrible...a massacre, a massacre upon a massacre.  First we massacred them, then they massacred us, then it was halftime.  I've never seen such violence, such bloodthirstiness, such bad manners...I'm the only one that made it!
Z: No -- you -- you don't understand!
FORMICA: Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Z: Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
FORMICA: Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Z: (thinks)
AZTECA: Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
WEAVER: Z?
FORMICA: Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and laughs.
Z: Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
FORMICA: Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  Me!
Z: Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
FORMICA: Affirmative.
Z: So...you two are in love?
FORMICA: In love? (shakes his head) I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
Z: Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
FORMICA: Yes, and do you know food shortage?
Z: ...Not enough food?
FORMICA: Negatory. we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Z: Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
FORMICA: I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Z: (spooked) Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
OFFICER: (telling a joke) What do you call it when 10,000 workers are killed in a tunnel cave- in? (a beat) Who cares?  They're workers!
Z: But...don't you think the worker class is the very foundation of the colony -- (realizes he's getting odd looks) I mean, uh, without them, who would we stand on?
BALA: You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
Z: Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
Z: (feigning nonchalance) And you are...?
BALA: I'm Princess Bala.
Z: Ah, yes. (affected) Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
BALA: Yes.
Z: (deflated) Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.
Z: Just warming up...
QUEEN: All these parties are so marvellously alike.
FORMICA: They should be... (suspicious) But there's something funny about that soldier.
FORMICA: (glowering) May I cut in?
Z: (intimidated) Oh, of course --
BALA: (pulling Z back) No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Z: (trying to placate Formica) Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
BALA: You dance...
Z: Divinely?
BALA: No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
BALA: He was swarthy...primitive... earthy...sensual.
BALA: He was a worker.  I danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Z: (proudly) No...as a matter of fact...
BALA: (shocked)
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A: WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
Z: Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
Z: (offended) That's not what you said the other night --
BALA: (now she's panicked) Quiet -- sshhh!!
Z: (digging it in) -- At the worker bar!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
FORMICA: (furious) What's this?  A worker has been masquerading as a war hero?!
Z: Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
Z: Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
QUEEN: Oh my god!  He's taking her hostage!
Z: No I'm not -- I mean -- nobody move! Or the Princess gets it!
Z: (to Formica) Stay back, you lunatic!  Do you think I don't know how to use this?
Z: Uh-oh.
PRINCESS: This is thoroughly unacceptable!
Z: You're telling me...
BALA: I'm coming!  I'm coming!
BALA: I'm going!  I'm going'
BALA: What
Z: How should
BALA: I order you to find out where we are!
Z: Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Z: Excuse me, I -- (it passes him by; he tries the next) Pardon me -- (same response) And they call them social insects.
BALA: Climb up that tree and get a better view!
BALA: I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Z: Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
BALA: How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
Z: Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
BALA: Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Z: But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
BALA: No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Z: Look around, sweetheart.
BALA: I --
Z: Well I guess that makes us even.
BALA: Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Z: Oh come on, after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
BALA: (repulsed) I was slumming it!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Z: Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
BALA: I idiot would... (unconvincingly) ...choose who she wanted to marry?
BALA: Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Z: Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options... (he decides) You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
BALA: that's just a fairy tale!
Z: Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source... (he knows that was maybe stretching it) that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg... (looking around) That direction.
BALA: Worker!  Come back here now!
Z: I've got a
BALA: That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
BALA: (clears her throat) Worker? (no response...louder now) Oh WORKER?  Where are you? (getting desperate) Z?  Z?  Wait for me!!!
AZTECA: I tell ya, I'm gettin' sick of bein' yelled at.
WORKER #1: What do you want, we're just workers.
WEAVER: You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
AZTECA: That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
WORKER #2: I heard about this guy. (turning to the other workers) He crashed a party at the palace. Then he took a hike with one of the royal babes!  And when they tried to stop him, he just looked at a couple'a guards, and they burst into flames!
WORKER ANT #1: You're nuts, how could a worker do all that?
WEAVER: Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
AZTECA: Invisible!
WEAVER: No -- an
WORKER #2: What's
WEAVER: Well, it's...someone with his own point of view...someone who does what he wants, not whatever he's told to do!
AZTECA: (eyes lit up, watching Weaver) Someone who follows his heart!
WEAVER: (taking Azteca's hand) Right...because every ant's important!
WORKER #2: (scoffs) But that would mean I'm important.
WORKER #1: I'm outta here, this sounds like trouble to me.
WEAVER: We can
BALA: Water...water...
Z: Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
BALA: (walking along) My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Z: perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was happily miserable.
BALA: Look out!
BALA: We're going to die!
Z: Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Z: Well I'll be.
BALA: Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's wrong with me?
Z: Want a list?
BALA: (urgent) Wait, I hear something!
Z: It's...it's...
Z: This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
BALA: Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Z: Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
BALA: (annoyed) Out here I'm just what?
Z: (through the water) Hlllllllp!
BALA: (hands on hips) Stop fooling around in there.
BALA: Let me go!!!
BALA: (chants to herself) I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm going to be rescued soon.
Z: Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're not going to rescue you?
BALA: General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Z: Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
BALA: Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Z: And only you can become a Queen?
BALA: Well...no, but --
Z: So what makes you so special?
BALA: (hesitates) Well...I am the oldest.
BALA: By three seconds...
BALA: (to herself) You're right.  There are as many Princesses...as there are blades of grass.
FORMICA: Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford any delays on this project!
CARPENTER: I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
FOREMAN: (yelling at him) Where do ya think you're going?  Get back to work!
WORKER #1: Buzz off, I'm important! (joining the others)
FORMICA: Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
CARPENTER: Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
FORMICA: (calculating) No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
FORMICA: So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
WEAVER: Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
FORMICA: (patronizing) Well now you haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
WEAVER: Oh, no, sir!
FORMICA: Good.  You're a good soldier.
WEAVER: Thank you, sir.
FORMICA: So tell me.  Where's Z?
WEAVER: I...I have no idea, sir.
FORMICA: Okay, son.
FORMICA: We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No single ant matters, right?
WEAVER: (enthusiastically) That's correct, sir!
FORMICA: (points at a guard) Not that one. (another guard) Or that one.
WEAVER: No, sir!
FORMICA: (calmly, with satisfaction) Or that one?  Her life doesn't matter, does it?
AZTECA: Don't tell that tightass anything, Weaver!
WEAVER: Wait!  Just let her go!  Z's long gone anyway, following some golden egg to Insectopia!  You'll never catch him!
FORMICA: Insectopia, hunh?...See why individuality is so dangerous?  It can always be used against you. (to the guards) If this sissy here wants to dig, he'll dig.  Send them both back to the tunnel project.  Double their workload.
FORMICA: What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
CARPENTER: Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
FORMICA: Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
CARPENTER: (frightened) Ant Team Six...
BALA: (looking hopeless) I swear, we've passed this blade of grass three times.
BALA: Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Z: (too shy to look at her) Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
BALA: (sadly) What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
Z: ...The land of red and white...
Z: We've found it! all this food'
BALA: (amazed) You were right...you were right! (smiling happily) Z, it's beautiful!
Z: Let's dig in!
Z: There's - there's some kind of force field!
MALE WASP (O.S.): (lockjawed accent) Muffy, look, party-crashers.
FEMALE WASP (O.S.): (laughing) They're simply too much, Chip!
MALE WASP: (to Z and Bala) You down there, haven't you ever been to a picnic?
Z: Hunh?
FEMALE WASP: (to Male Wasp) Well I really don't know who they are.
Z: We're ants!
MALE WASP: Poopsie, we know some ants, don't we? (to Z) Are you related to the Fifth Avenue ants?
FEMALE WASP: Darling, do you have to talk to any insect from off the street?
MALE WASP: Just being friendly, Poopsie.
BALA: Hello?  I'm not just "any insect". My mother is the Queen. (momentously) I'm Princess Bala!
MALE WASP: (under his breath) They're Eurotrash, dear.
MALE WASP: Lunch! (to Z) A little piece of advice, sport -- bob and weave!  Bob and weave!
BALA: What do you mean?
MALE WASP: Well -- like my father used to say -- there's no such thing as a free meal!
THE WASPS: Excuse me -- I'll have some potato salad -- thank-you! -- don't mind if I do!  After you! (etc.)
Z: I sort of imagined Insectopia a little differently --
BALA: Oh...my...God.
MALE WASP: (shaking her) Muffy!  Muffy!  Wake up!
MALE WASP: (heartbroken)
Z: Bala, look out!!
BALA: MMMffllmmm...
BALA: Z!  Help me!!!
Z: Bala! (mournfully) I'll never see her again...
BALA: Z!!!  Get me out of heeeeere!
Z: (thinks) These things always come in twos...
Z: Take me to your leader!
Z: Whoooooooaaaa!!!
Z: Bala!  Come back here!
BALA: Z!!!!!!!  I'm stuck!
Z: (Tarzan whoop) Aa-ee-ya-ee-yaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!
BALA: Z!  You're here!
Z: (ruefully) Yeah.  I'm here.
BALA: (emotional) Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Z: (touched) Yes?
Z: We're safe...
Z: Who the
TOUGH VOICE (O.S.): Ant Team Six --
MAJOR MANDIBLE: And don't come back, you
MANDIBLE: Talk to me.
COMMANDO ANT: Z and the Princess were here, sir. Signs of a struggle.
MANDIBLE: Let's get a read on that feremone track.
COMMANDO ANT #1: (to the others) Get the sniffer!
TRACKER ANT: Bala...find Bala...
TRACKER ANT: (as he's swivelled) Nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono no...
COMMANDO ANT #3: Got 'em!  Ten clicks from here!
MANDIBLE: Z -- you dirt-digging, fancy-dancing, wisecracking, royalty-grabbing, rebel
SCUM!: (yelling into the distance)
MANDIBLE: Let's MOVE!  GO, people!  GO!  GO!
BALA: Come on, Z.
Z: Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
Z: (defeated) There's only one thing worse than an ant who goes around mindlessly following orders, and that's an ant who's too dumb to go around mindlessly following orders.
FLY: What's with the bummer attitude?
BUTTERFLY: Yeah -- nobody stresses out in Insectopia!
BALA: Did you say...
Z: (joining Bala) ...Insectopia?
BALA: (happily) Z, we made it!
FLY: (alighting on the grapefruit) C'mon in!  The nectar's fine!
Z: Yippeeeeee!
Z: (terrified)
FLY: (to Z) Hey, take it easy!  There's nothin' to be afraid of!
Z: Yeah, well, I make it a practice not to trust anyone who shoots acid out of their forehead.
CRICKET: Dude, here in Insectopia, we don't judge people by how many arms and legs we've got.
FLY: Yeah, back home, they called me a fruitfly.  But here, I'm known as... (with attitude) Superfly.
CRICKET: Anyway, big Gus is mellow.
Z: (taking his hand, disgusted) Charmed.
Z: So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
BALA: Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Z: Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
Z: Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
BALA: You held onto this all that time?
Z: Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday. (embarrassed) Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
BEETLE: Hey
BEETLE: Wanna bring back dessert?  There's a thirty foot long blimp in the next can, made completely of chocolate!
Z: (annoyed) Sure.  I wasn't busy or anything.
Z: Great timing, guys.  Ever wonder why they call you "pests"?
TRACKER ANT: Yesyesyesyesyes --
MANDIBLE: Talk to me.
COMMANDO #1: I've got a read on the Princess -- but target Z isn't accounted for.
MANDIBLE: Let's move in.
CRICKET: What if, like...we're just these tiny little things, and we're just like part of this whole other huge universe, that's like, so big we don't even know it exists?
LADYBUG: Man...that's so deep...
MANDIBLE: Alright, you hippy scum!  Make one move and I'll exterminate you!
BALA: Stop!  You don't understand!
MANDIBLE: I don't have to understand, Missy -- I've got orders.  Now where's Z?
FLY: Man, your girl is saying?
Z: (overdoing it) Oh, Bala?  I guess she's okay, you know, for a princess.  I mean, I usually date queens, or you know, empresses, because sometimes the lesser nobility are too much in awe of my smouldering sensuality.  Please stop me if I'm making you feel inadequate.
Z: What's the matter?  This place is as cheery as a Roach Motel at check-out time.
LADYBUG: Bala's been kidnapped!  Some flying ants took her back to the colony!
Z: She's been kidnapped?!  But I can't live without her!
Z: (determined) I'm going back.  I've got to get her. Who'll come with me?
MALE WASP (O.S.): I'll go.
Z: (surprised) You?!
MALE WASP: I know what it's like to lose someone...I keep hearing the sound of Muffy's flapping wings...so I'll take you.
Z: Let's go, pal!
FLY: Geez.  I feel like a real stinkbug.
Z: Wow...I never saw things this way...
Z: Things look so close together from up here...there's the desert...and the lake... (thinking about something) it's not far from the colony at all...
MALE WASP: Sorry.  Turbulence.
FORMICA: Princess Bala.  Good. (with urgency) Where's Z?
BALA: He's...he's dead. (covering for Z) You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
FORMICA: (regretfully) It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
BALA: Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now. (sadly) I miss him already.
FORMICA: (surprised) You miss him?  Why?
BALA: (angry) Because...because he's twice the ant that you are.  I could never go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an individual, and when I get married, it'll be to someone I choose.
FORMICA: (shaking his head) Princess Bala, I'm just a simple old soldier, and the ways of the feminine mind are a little too complex for me. But one thing I do know is, there are more Princesses where you came from. I just hope they're not all like you. In the meantime, maybe we can arrange for you to see Z again after all.
MALE WASP: Good luck, Z.  For a wingless insect, you're alright by me.
Z: Thanks, Chip.
Z: (to himself) How am I going to get in?  The place is crawling with soldiers!
SOLDIER ANT: You there!  Worker!
Z: Don't bite!  I surrender!
SOLDIER ANT: What are you doing out here!  All workers are to remain inside the colony, by orders of General Formica!
Z: (heading inside) Well...if you insist...
QUEEN: Very impressive, General.
MANDIBLE: Wave that flag, you maggot!
FORMICA: Is there anything wrong, your majesty?
QUEEN: It's just...How I miss Bala.  I wish she were here for this special moment.
FORMICA: (falsely supportive) She is, your majesty.  She is.
Z: Geez, this place really empties out in August.  Where is everybody?
TRACKER ANT: (sniffing) Z!  Z!  I smell Z!
Z: You "smell" me?  Well look, I -- I've been out in the wilderness for a while, and --
Z: (getting it) Hey, wait, you're...you're one of those pheremone sniffers, aren't you? Maybe you can help me...I'm looking for a friend of mine, Princess Bala.
TRACKER ANT: (enthusiastic) Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah!  Find Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeah!
Z: Just remember, I met her first.
TRACKER ANT: Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...
Z: Bala's through there?
TRACKER ANT: Bala...Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...
Z: Great.  More digging.  This is why I left in the first place.
Z: Bala!
BALA: Z!  You came back!
Z: Why do they have you tied up here?
BALA: There's something going on, Z --
BALA: They're having a ceremony to open the Megatunnel...
Z: Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it! (horrified) -- Formica's going to flood the colony!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
BALA: Oh no...
BALA: Z!  what are you doing?
Z: I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've got to warn the others.
Z: Head for the surface, Bala.  If I don't make it, well...we'll always have Insectopia.
BALA: (following him) Z!!! Wait for me!
FORMICA: Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
QUEEN: But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
FORMICA: 'Fraid not, your majesty. (with regret) Goodbye, your majesty.
QUEEN: Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
FORMICA: Alright, let's move out!
QUEEN: In the name of the colony, I declare this tunnel open!
Z: Stoooooop!
QUEEN: Bala!
BALA: Mom!
Z: Listen up!  We've all got to get out of here!  This place is going to flood!
WORKER #1: Are you
Z: You've got to believe me!
WORKER #2: Oh yeah?  What makes you so special, Mr. Know-It-All?
Z: I'm Z.
WORKER #3: You're Z?  Gimme a break!  Z's ten milimeters tall!
WORKER #4: -- and he can kill termites with his bare hands!  You're just some scrawny worker with a mental problem!
Z: I
WORKER #1: No you're not!
Z: Weaver!
WORKERS: Hey...it says! [etc].
WEAVER: Z...I'm so sorry!  I --
Z: Don't worry about it, pal.
QUEEN: (distastefully) Oh...it's that social-climbing worker again -- what does he want?
Z: (in response) To save you all!  Now we've got to go!
MANDIBLE: (talking into his antenna) Let 'er rip!
AZTECA: Listen!
WORKER #1: He's right!!!
QUEEN: You there!  Stop!  I say!
AZTECA: There's no way out!
QUEEN: We're all going to drown!!!
BALA: Z...what can we do?
Z: We've got to dig a trench around us!
WORKER #1: Uh...we don't dig any more.  We're individuals.
WORKER #2: Yeah.  We're too important to dig. You taught us that, Z.  You hate digging!
Z: (at his wits end) Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now dig!
WEAVER: You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Z: That's it!  Pass the dirt back to the center!  Go on!
Z: Your highness...time to get your hands dirty!
Z: We need to form a scaffolding around this mound -- let's DO IT!
Z: Now
Z: Okay boys -- take her up!
WORKER: He did it!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!
FORMICA: Z.  I should have known.  All that work, all that preparation, come to nothing.  All because of one stinking ant.
FORMICA: Folks, you may have survived that flood, but there's no way you're gonna escape from me.  I'll make you a deal.  Hand over the rebel leader Z, and you survive.
FORMICA: But if you don't hand him over, you're all going to die, each and every single..."individual" one of you.
FORMICA: What shall it be, workers?
FORMICA: Have it your way.
Z: Wait...
Z: ...I'm Z.
WEAVER: No,
BALA: No,
WORKERS: I'm Z!  I'm Z!  I'm Z and so is my brother!  I've been Z for weeks now!
QUEEN: (regally) We are Z.
ALL: I am Z!  I am Z!  I am Z!
FLY: Hey, guys!
WASP: It's them!
WASP: Are these hooligans giving you trouble, Z?
FLY: Say the word, Z, and we kick their butts.
FORMICA: What are you doing?!  ATTACK!! (berating his army) Come on, you yellow-bellies! (turning on Carpenter) Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
CARPENTER: Uh, actually, we sir...
FORMICA (O.S.): Help...help me...
FORMICA: Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...
Z: I thought you said that the life of one ant doesn't matter.
FORMICA: I guess it does...to the ant.
CARPENTER: Sir, if it's any consolation, I still think you're completely worthless as an individual.
Z: So, uh, that's pretty much it.  Just your basic "simple worker overthrows the government and winds up with the princess" kind of a story. You know: there was the big parade and everything...
Z (V.O.): General Formica was almost unemployable.  He eventually got a gig as a honeydew keg.
Z (V.O.): The Queen asked me to take over his job, but I said "Sorry, but I'm really not the general type.  I'm more the specific type."  So they gave the job to Weaver instead.
Z (V.O.): Weaver cut the defense budget in half.  Now we only have an army of five million.
Z: And me, I guess you could say that I lived happily ever after.
Z: I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
BALA: A
Z: Well, so nothing's perfect.  But you know?  I wouldn't change a thing.
