THE POWER OF ONE: What if the power of one becomes the power of many and the power of many becomes the power of one?
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): There comes a time in everyone's life when they discover that the only person you can truly depend on is yourself. That the only real power anyone has to get anything done is the power of one. With any luck you can make it through a lot of years before you ever have to face the reality of that fact. (beat) It was a luxury I never had. I discovered it the year my mother had her nervous breakdown.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): I was all of six.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): My father died before I was born, and even though I was raised by my Zulu nanny, with my mother, depending on her health, in nominal attendance, it was decided, with her departure, that I, too, would depart... (beat) ... for boarding school.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): But before I could be sent out into the world one very serious matter had to be dealt with. (beat) I was a chronic bedwetter. Since my nanny was the one responsible for my well-being, she did what any responsible Zulu mother would do. She called on the greatest medicine man of her tribe -- Inkosi Inkosikazi.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): The medicine man instructed me to jump off the falls and climb along the ten stepping stones, counting as I went until I reached dry land.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): Even though it was only a dream, I felt as if my struggle to reach dry land was terrifyingly real. The water was like ice, bone- chilling, cold, and as I made my way from one stone to the next I could feel my strength desert me.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): I was three rocks in when I ran out of gas. I couldn't pull myself any further. No matter how hard I
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): Inkosi Inkosikazi said the spirit of the great Zulu warriors lived in me. He told me that whenever trouble arose I should return to the waterfall and keep stepping across the rocks until the trouble passed. He said three rocks were enough to conquer my problem with the night water; that I was very brave. He said I was a man for all Africa, bound to her by my spirit, bound by my dreams. (beat) And he let me keep the chicken.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): Although I was bound by spirit
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): The school I   was sent to was attended and   staffed entirely by Afrikaaners,   the oldest of the two white tribes   of Africa.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): I spoke only English. The hated tongue. The language of the enemy who had usurped power and stolen the country through political chicanery and military brutality.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): During the Boer War of 1896, 26,000 Boer women and children were herded into detainment camps by the British, where they died like flies from dysentery,
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): And no one made this more evident to me than Jaapie Botha, a wheat farmer's son from the Transvaal.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): The only time I was at peace was when I slept. Inkosi Inkosikazi's chicken proved to be, like his previous owner, a salvation.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): During the day he would live outside the dorm, happily scarfing down bugs and grubs, secure in a little house I built for him.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): And at night he would hop through the window and, perching over my bed, squawking if any intruders came near.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): He was my best and only friend.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.): I'm sure in time a status quo would have been achieved between me and my schoolmates were it not for the cataclysmic events occurring in that faraway place none of us had ever seen. (beat) Two montjhs after I arrived at the school World War II broke out in Europe. Hitler had vowed to crush the British Empire. The Boers sharpened their swords in anticipation.
JAAPIE: God has sent Hitler to deliver us from the English bastards who stole our country and killed our people. Heil Hitler!
ALL: Heil Hitler!
JAAPIE: We will swear a blood oath. When Hitler comes we'll rise up and kill the Verdomde Rooineks.
ALL: A blood oath!    A blood oath!
JAAPIE: With your blood.
JAAPIE: We swear allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Heil Hitler!
ALL: We swear allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Heil Hitler!
JAAPIE: Death to all Englishmen in South Africa. Heil Hitler!
JAAPIE: God bless the fatherland.    Heil Hitler!
JAAPIE: See what we have in store for you when Hitler comes, Rooinek. Hoy!
BOY: No!
JAAPIE: For crimes committed against the whole Boer people. I, Jaapie Botha, the judge and Uberfuhrer, sentence you and your Rooinek kaffir chicken to death. Heil Hiter.!
ALL: Heil Hitler!
ALL: Heil Hitler!   Heil Hitler!
BOY: No!
JAAPIE: Heil Hitler!
ALL: Heil Hitler!
JAAPIE: Hang him up!
BOYS: Jaapie!   No!
JAAPIE: Hang him!
JAAPIE: You will pay for the deaths of our grandfathers and grandmothers, our aunts and uncles. All Rooineks will pay and you will be first. Pull!
JAAPIE: In the name of Adolf Hitler and the fatherland, I sentence you to die, Verdomde Rooinek.
STAFF MEMBER: What's this?
PK: I came to after being unconscious for two days, the rock missing my eye by half an inch. After a week in hospital it was decided I'd be sent to my grandfather's house in the English town of Barberton, at least until passions at school cooled. Jaapie Botha was expelled; sent home to his family's farm in disgrace.
PK (CONT'D): (beat) And so the first recorded South African casualty of Hitler's insanity was not a Boer, nor a Rooinek, but a tatter-feathered, half-bald kaffir chicken.
ST. JOHN: Very evocative, yes. Particularly the image of the chicken. Good choice there.
ST. JOHN: Any ideology that needs to attack the thing that least threatens it is an ideology that will not outlive its own generation. Inclusion, gentlemen, not exclusion, is the key to survival. (beat) Something our new government should take heed of, eh?
ST. JOHN: Next week we have Mr. Levy who will enlighten us on...
MORRIE: Sport and wager in Imperial Rome, sir.
ST. JOHN: (facetious) Very apt, Mr. Levy. We look forward to the experience. (pause) All right.
ST. JOHN: Well-written.
PK: Thank you, sir.
ST. JOHN: I've received notice from the
PK: Yes, sir.
ST. JOHN: A word of caution. Contemporary to most of these fellows means the seventeenth century. Try and keep your theme, um, classical, if you know what I mean.
PK: Yes sir. I will. (beat) Will the scholarship be decided at the same time, sir?
ST. JOHN: Money's a different matter. Different committee.
PK: Very good, sir.
ST. JOHN: And P.K...
ST. JOHN: Good luck tonight.
PK: Thank you, sir.
MORRIE: You win and your dream comes true. You lose, we're back to bread and butter sandwiches till term's end. What'd he want?
PK: My appointement before the Oxford committee came through.
MORRIE: A snap.
PK: For a brain like you, maybe.
MORRIE: Come on, you'll read one of your pieces, they'll be begging you to attend.
PK: But will they pay for the privilege?
MORRIE: Well let's bloody hope so. It'll be a lonely time without you there.
PK: Morrie Levy. Is that the voice of sentimentality I hear coming from you?
MORRIE: Sentimentality my ass. Practicality. Where am I going to find a sure thing like you to make book on at bloody Oxford?
PK: Go on.
MORRIE: You hear Sutcliffe screwed Bartlett's sister when he stayed with them over holidays?
PK: I don't believe it.
MORRIE: I heard it from Bartlett's own lips. He's selling reservations for next holiday. A pound for one night; three pounds for four.
PK: You register?
MORRIE: For both of us. Took the whole holiday.
MORRIE: You nervous?
PK: No.
MORRIE: Christ! I'm about to have a calf. This bloody Boer gets lucky, we're in the poorhouse.
MORRIE: Now remember. We're not here to exhibit our wares. We go in, we do the job, we get out. Right?
PK: Right.
ANNOUNCER: And at the end of six matches in all weight divisions, the score is Prince of Wales three victories, Helpmakeer three victories.
ANNOUNCER: And now for the final bout to determine which school will win the Johannesburg 1950 public school boxing team championship. In this corner, weighing 140 pounds, standing 5'8", from the Helpmakeer School with a record of 13-0 on the year, Jannie Geildenhaus.
ANNOUNCER: And in this corner, representing the Prince of Wales School, the current Johannesburg Public School welterweight champion, also with a record of 13-0 on the year, also 140 pounds, Kid P.K.
ANNOUNCER: We thank the native population for their spirited display of enthusiasm. But now, on to the main event. Fighters to center ring, please.
REFEREE: You both know the rules.     No butts, no elbows, no low    blows. First man to score three    knock downs wins. Let's have     a good clean fight. Good luck     to you.
PK: First row, third from the left. Find out who she is.
MORRIE: We're in a bloody war here, in
JANNIE: Blery Rooinek.     I'll kill you.
MORRIE: Get up!     Get up!
MORRIE: Up!   Up!
REFEREE: Okay.   Fight.
MORRIE: What are you trying to do, bankrupt us? What happened?
MORRIE: Christ! If they get caught in here they're dead. (beat) What the hell's going on?
PK: I don't know.
MORRIE: Well, worry about it later. In case you haven't noticed, this Boer bastard is trying to kill you.
PK: You see the way he drops his left when he throws the right?
MORRIE: Yeah?
MORRIE: Thank you, God.
MORRIE: Here you go, pal.
PK: You're the treasurer of this company. You hold it. Did you find out what I asked for?
MORRIE: Uh, listen, P.K. You know in this world there is no greater proponent of sins of the flesh than Morrie Levy. But  do yourself a favor on this one.  Take my advice. Pass.
PK: Thanks for the advice.    The information please.
MORRIE: Do you know who her father is? Professor Daniel Marais.
PK: So?
MORRIE: So? He's the Nationalist Party's resident intellectual. The man is one of the architects of this damned system of -- what are they calling it? -- apartheid? He has about as much use for a Rooinek Englishman rutting after his daughter as the Queen does for balls, pardon my French.
PK: What's her name and where do I find her?
MORRIE: Maria Elizabete Marais, Seniors Cottage, Room 22, Devilliers School. They don't call it 'Fortress Virgin' for nothing. You'll never get in.
PK: You going to take book on that?
MORRIE: Already have.    Three-to-one says you don't.
PK: Where'd you bet?
MORRIE: I took a big position you do.
MORRIE: In case you have to bail yourself out.
GIRL: Those are always cold.     Use this one.
PK: May I come in?
PK: I'm sorry to scare you.
MARIA: (nervous) You can't be here.
PK: I didn't know how else to meet you.
MARIA: I could be expelled.
PK: Girls don't usually come to boxing matches.
MARIA: We went on a dare. Please.
PK: Did you like it?
MARIA: It was... (beat) ... exciting.    You were very good.
PK: (in Afrikaans) Thank you. I'm glad I impressed you.
MARIA: (surprised) You speak the Taal.
PK: I'll speak Zulu if it'll help me see you again.
MARIA: I can't.
PK: Why not?
MARIA: I need my father's permission.
PK: Is it hard to get?
MARIA: Hard for an Afrikaaner boy. Impossible for an English one.
PK: How about your permission?    Do I have that?
MARIA: I have to finish this paper.
GIRL #2: Come when you're finished.     We'll be up late.
MARIA: Please go.
PK: You didn't answer my question.
MARIA: There are plenty of English girls. What makes me so important?
PK: The way I felt when I saw you.
MARIA: My father will insist on meeting you.
PK: I can't wait.
MATRON (V.O.): Lights out, ladies.
MARIA: Now please.
PK: (in Afrikaans) Good night, Maria Marais.
MARIA: (in English) Good night, PK.
PK: I don't remember telling you my name.
MARIA: (smiling) And I don't remember telling you mine.
MARAIS: Jan Piet Marais. My uncle. At 22 he led a kommando for three years before your people caught him and hung him.
PK: My people?
MARAIS: The English.
PK: I consider myself an African, sir.
MARAIS: As do I. As do the Zulu, the Xhosa, the Pongo, the Ndebele. We're all Africans. But all from separate tribes, ay?
MARIA: Papa, would you like coffee in the library or the parlor?
MARAIS: (pleasant) The library, mein leib.
MARAIS: I can't figure out if you're brave or foolish.
PK: Why is that, sir?
MARAIS: You come here to ask for permission to see my daughter. Correct?
PK: Yes, sir.
MARAIS: And knowing  who I am, what I stand for, do you  think this sort of discussion  is going to put that request in  a favorable light?
PK: I thought a man of your intellectual reputation wouldn't want his daughter seeing someone who didn't think.
MARAIS: Let me give you some advice then. You're right. I admire a keen mind.  But intellectual reputation or not, I am first a Marais, a member of the Volk.
MARAIS (CONT'D): And if you're trying to impress a member of the Volk with your intellect, don't do it espousing liberal ideas picked up in an English private school.
MARAIS: (joking) No doubt from an expert on race relations.
PK: Actually, sir, from an expert on cactus.
DOC (FIGURE): Ja. Perfect.    You will excuse me, please.
DOC: This I do not normally without permission do, ja? But to catch the expression. After all, it is the expression that is important. Ja? Without the expression the human being is just a lump of meat. You have some problems, I think. I am Professor Karl von Vollensteen.
PK: I'm P.K.
DOC: Such a young person with such an
PK (V.O.): That was how I met Doc, as he insisted I call him. A chance meeting between a directionless seven-year-old boy and an old German professor out collecting cacti on the African bush veldt. (pause) So began my education.
PK (V.O.): Doc believed the brain had two functions and that the South African public school system unfortunately dealt with only one.
DOC: The brain, P.K., has two functions. It is the best reference library ever, which is a good thing to have. Ja? But also from it comes original thought. In school you will get all filled up with the facts. Here your brain will learn where to look, how to look, how to think. And then you will have for yourself all the brains that have ever been.
PK (V.O.): Doc knew everything. He had a love of learning. But his real passion was centered around two things -- music and cacti.
PK (V.O.): Until he was fifty, Doc had a successful career as a concert pianist all over Europe. On his fiftieth birthday he gave it all up and moved to South Africa. From that point on it was all cactus.
PK (V.O.): Every specimen Doc found would be carefully photographed and catalogued.
DOC: If God would choose a plant to represent Him, I think He would choose of all plants the cactus. This one plant has all the blessings He tried but failed to give man. It is true. Look. The cactus is humble but not submissive. It grows where no other plant will grow. The sun bakes its back, the wind rips it from cliffs, or drowns it in the dry desert sand. Not a complaint. In good times or bad it will still flower. It protects itself from danger.
DOC: But it harms no other plant.   It
PK (V.O.): Doc was a hard man to disagree with. So when he decided I must spend as much time with him to remedy the flaw in my educational environment I didn't argue.
PK (V.O.): Appealing to my grandfather's stoic belief in the primacy of European culture in all its forms, Doc offered to instruct me in piano in return for my helping him locate and gather his precious cacti.
PK (V.O.): As a student of music I was never more than adequate, something I suspect Doc knew from the start. It is the love of music that is most important, he would tell me, and I would believe him.
DOC: Everything fits, P.K. Nothing is unexplained. Nature is one big chain reaction. Everything depends on everything else. From the smallest to the biggest. Always in life an idea starts small like a tree.
DOC: This tree can grow so high it can touch the face of the sky. But this little vine can choke it and keep it small. Most people are like these vines. Afraid of new ideas. Afraid to let things grow.
DOC: Always listen to yourself. Follow your own idea. If you are wrong, so what? You learn something. And with learning you grow stronger. And if you are right at the beginning? An even bigger bonus.
PK (V.O.): I roamed the kloofs and ridges, the dry riverbeds and jungle floors with Doc for over a year, learning more than I realize even today. (pause) I also played a lot more 'God Save the King' due to my new musical celebrity.
PK (V.O.): Barberton was a very proper English town with a proper square, a wide main street, and the colonials' overblown patriotism for a homeland most people had never seen, hanging in the air like fine dust. Not quite seen, but there nonetheless.
PK (V.O.): The only Afrikaaners to live in Barberton were sent there to work at the government prison, just outside town. Germany had covertly supported the Boers in their two unsuccessful wars against British rule, supplying food and medical supplies as well as ample stocks of ammunition.
PK (V.O.)(CONT'D): Germany was an old friend, a trusted friend. And in a country where a handshake is a friendship and a friendship a bond for life, as the war in Europe grew fiercer tensions in Barberton heated up. Suspicion was afoot. Spies were everywhere.
DOC: Grammar: satisfactory. Science: satisfactory. Mathetmatics: satisfactory.
DOC: P.K., if there is one thing I know you to be that is a lot more than just satisfactory. Ja?
PK: But I don't want to be known as a brain.
DOC: Why not?
PK: Who do you think gets beaten up on all the time in school?
DOC: My boy, to be smart is not a sin. But to be smart and not use it, that is sin number one. And as for getting beat up on, use your brain to figure out how not to be.
DOC: Again it begins. The stupidity. Do not be frightened.
BRITISH OFFICER (V.O.): Karl von Vollensteen, for the failure to register as an alien during times of war in accordance with His Majesty's government orders to do so, you are hereby sentenced to be confined at Barberton prison for the duration of the war with Germany.
PK (V.O.): And again I was alone with nothing to depend on to see me through except the power of one.
PK: Morrie.
MORRIE: All right. All right. We'll call it the 'Levy Carpet Emporium Scholarship for Poor but Proud Christian Gentlemen.' How's that?
PK: Tell your father I appreciate the offer.
MORRIE: God, I hate people who can't be bought.
PK: Why is that?
MORRIE: I don't know.    Personality disorder.
PK: Undoubtedly.
PK: (smiling)
SOLLY: And who are you?
MORRIE: The champeen's manager.
SOLLY: Oy gevalt. (beat) You know you train here it's not like those nice school fights you're used to. Three knockdowns you win.
MORRIE: What does it cost for you to train him?
SOLLY: For my personal attentinons, Mr. Manager? Fifty pounds a month. For one of them... (points to the other men working with fighters) ... less.
MORRIE: Here's for six months in advance. Three hundred pounds.
SOLLY: Six months? I don't know your boy'll last six minutes.
PK: I'll last.
SOLLY: What are you staring? Punch, don't stare. C'mon. Work or you're out.
SOLLY: That your gear?
PK: Yes, sir.
SOLLY: Go change in the back. We'll see if you couldn't find a better use for all that money.
PK: Thank you, sir.
SOLLY: Why's he want to do this, a nice- looking schoolboy?
MORRIE: He wants to be welterweight champ of the world.
SOLLY: Oh sure, sure. And I'd like to be twenty-five again.
MORRIE: You like to make book on it?
SOLLY: (joking) You giving odds?
MORRIE: You name them.
SOLLY: You both meshugah.
SOLLY: Let's just start out nice and easy now.
SOLLY: Never I seen someone so young throw an eight-punch combination. Where did you learn such a thing?
PK: In prison, sir.
SOLLY: You trying to be a comedian and a boxer? Mr. Manager, come to my office. We'll talk terms. You, get showered, and see me after. We'll talk training.
VON ZYL (KOMMANDANT): So you are PK.
PK: Yes, sir.
VON ZYL: I am Kommandant Von Zyl. The professor has requested you to be his visitor so you can continue your studies on piano and he can continue with his studies on cactus. This is the first specimen?
PK: Yes, sir.   Kalanchoe Thrysiflora.
VON ZYL: The professor taught you this, ja? Of course to your English town he is a prisoner, a criminal. To us who respect such learning and culture, he is an honored guest.
VON ZYL: This pass is good for any time, any day. Would you like to see him now?
PK: Yes, sir.
VON ZYL: Come.   I will take you myself.
VON ZYL: We have cleared a little plot behind the cellblock for the cactus. And tomorrow we have the professor's piano moved here. There is not another instrument like it in the territory. Maybe one day the two of you can give a concert for us, hey?
PK: Yes, sir.
VON ZYL: You like to box?
PK: I would like to learn, meneer. Are the boys prisoners?
VON ZYL: (laughs) No, no. The sons of the guards. See that one there? (points to a
SMIT: Sir?
VON ZYL: We have room for one more on the squad?
SMIT: He's a little small, Kommandant.
VON ZYL: We'll build him up then.
SMIT: Yes, sir.   But I really don't have anyone  to spare to teach him right now.   You know, with the tournament  coming up.
VON ZYL: There must be someone.
SMIT: Piet.
GEEL PIET (BLACK MAN): Yes, sir.
SMIT: You teach this boy basics, and you teach him good or I knock your black head flat, you hear?
GEEL PIET: I teach him best I know, baas.
SMIT: We train every day. First thing in the morning. Miss two trainings, you're gone.
PK: Yes, meneer.
SMIT: Come tomorrow.     See this old kaffir.
PK: Yes, meneer.     Thank you, meneer.
VON ZYL: Lieutenant, a word?
GEEL PIET: Don't worry, little baas. Little can beat big any day. First with the head, then with the heart. Little defeat big when little is smart. You can remember that?
PK: Yes, sir.
GEEL PIET: No, no. Don't never call me sir. 'Specially in front of the guards.
PK: What should I call you?
GEEL PIET: Piet.   Geel Piet.
COACH: Kaffir.   Towels.
GEEL PIET: Okay, baas.    Coming, baas.
MARIA: You took a big chance talking to my father the way you did.
PK: Not really. Going in I was behind on points with him. I'm English. I attend a politically suspect school. I'm a boxer.
MARIA: He likes boxers.
PK: All men like boxers. But not for their daughters. So I had to find some way to make an impression.
MARIA: You could have picked a more agreeable topic.
PK: And made much less of an impression. Talk to someone about their passion. Even if they disagree they'll remember you. It was really the most logical strategy if you think about it.
MARIA: Do you spend hours thinking about how to deal with me, too?
PK: Days.
MARIA: Know what I think? (beat)
MARIA: When I was little we would go to my grandfather's farm in the high veldt for holiday.
MARIA: My father would take    me   to the top of the highest hill    and   we'd play this game, 'What Do    You   See' until we ran out of things    to   see. Do you ever play that?
PK: No.
MARIA: Want to try?
PK: Sure.
MARIA: I see a forest. It goes      on forever. There are giant      trees which keep getting bigger     and bigger over thousands of     years. Now you.
PK: I see little trees growing on the forest floor, learning to grow with the little bit of light the big trees let in. Now you.
MARIA: I see the big trees getting bigger, their leaves and branches making one great green umbrella over all of Africa.
PK: I see the sun growing weaker, giving off less light. I see the big trees dying because they cannot live without a lot of light. I see the little trees take over the forest because they learn to adapt.
MARIA: You tell a very good story.
GEEL PIET (V.O.): (sing-song) Can't    hit you, can't hurt you. Can't    hit you, can't hurt you. Can't    hit you, can't hurt you. That's    it. Good. Good.
GEEL PIET: You wear out this old man. See? See how it can work? How little beat big?
PK: Yes, sir.     But when do I get to punch?
GEEL PIET: You not going to just punch, man. You going to combination.
GEEL PIET: One-two. One-two. C'mon.       Now you. One-two. One-two.
GEEL PIET: Oh do we have     a boxer here. Yes sir. We build      you to eight-punch combination.      The Geel Piet eight. Then you catch     afire. One-two. One-two.
DOC: How is the next Joe Louis this morning?
PK: Try and hit me.
PK: No.   C'mon.
PK: No.   Try hard.
DOC: You are amazing.
PK: And I'm going to learn the Geel Piet eight.
DOC: Yes, yes, yes. But right now you have to come learn the Beethoven Fifth for one hour so we can get to the cactus before it's too hot to plant. Did you bring her?
PK: Parchypodium Namquanium.
DOC: Excellent. Excellent. We make from you a champion and a brain.
DOC: Of course.
GEEL PIET: Every day I see you bring the bucket and in the bottom is some tobacco leaf.
PK: It keeps the roots wet.
GEEL PIET: What happens to the leaf after?
DOC: A little I use in some water to make a bug spray for the plants.
PK: And the rest we throw away.
GEEL PIET: If you leave the pail when you go plant is a problem, small baas?
PK: I don't understand.
GEEL PIET: Is like this. You see how hard the life is for the people here in prison. Only little pleasure they take from this hard life maybe sometimes when no one watching late at night -- a little smoke. Now with the big war in Europe tobacco is plenty hard to get outside. Inside it is gone. We are the forgotten in here.
PK: We have bunches of leaves at home. I'll bring a whole bucketful tomorrow.
PK: I don't understand.
DOC: What Geel Piet means is it can be dangerous. Something the guards might not want the people to have.
PK: What's wrong with tobacco? Why wouldn't they want them to have it?
DOC: What's wrong is people whose job it is to punish. After a little while it is all they know how to do.
PK: What should I do?
DOC: This is for you to answer.
BORMANN: I smell something not right here, ay, kaffir?
GEEL PIET: (submissive) No, meneer sergeant. Everything okay here.
BORMANN: I don't fuckin' believe you.
BORMANN: If you're up to something I'll find out.
DOC: Schweinhund.
GEEL PIET: No, no.  This old kaffir's okay. Sorry to make any trouble, little baas. We  just stick to the boxing now on.  Sorry, sorry.
PK: Geel Piet.
PK: I leave my bucket on the side by Doc's toilet when I practice piano.
DOC: PK, to me you are the champion of the world already. Come. Let us go box now with Mr. Beethoven.
SOLLY: Now at the end of the Geel Piet eight you do this... one-two... (he punches the air) One-two-three... the Solly Goldman thirteen. Okay?
SOLLY: That's it. That's it. Move him around. Jab jab. Slip slip. Now.
SOLLY: And... one-two... one-two-three.
SOLLY: That's it. That's it. Now work around the defense. Jab jab.
MORRIE: How do you get away with this, Mr. G? Why don't they close you down? I mean, there are laws about blacks and white boxing each other.
SOLLY: In a public match. Not in a gym. Not yet anyway. The Boer is a funny people. Outside the ring the black is not equal. Inside he is. But only in private, not in public. So I keep my mouth shut, the police go a little blind, and that's that. It's a crazy world, huh?
SOLLY: Work him on the heavy bag.
MORRIE: Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That's it.
ASSISTANT: Solly wants to see you two.
MORRIE: You wanted to see us, Mr. G.?
SOLLY: Close the door. (beat) Someone I got a lot of respect for asked me to make a request. He wants to put you in a match.
MORRIE: With who?
SOLLY: A young guy just turned pro. Gideon Mandoma.
MORRIE: A black fighter! They want him to fight a black fighter?
SOLLY: In a black township.   Sofiatown.
MORRIE: Out of the question. Not even up for discussion. C'mon, P.K.
MORRIE: Okay.    What's going on?
PK: I don't know.
MORRIE: Well why don't you tell me what you do know.
PK: There's an African myth about an outsider who comes one day and unites all the tribes into one against their oppressors. They call it the myth of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi -- the tadpole angel. That chanting at the school championships?
MORRIE: For you?
PK: I haven't heard it in years.
MORRIE: And how did this honor fall on your broad back?
PK: I told you about bringing tobacco to the prisoners at Barberton? Well after that was going for a while I learned that even though they could send and receive letters, they never did. They couldn't read or write.
MORRIE: So you did it for them.
PK: Right.
MORRIE: And after that?
PK: A clothing program for their families and a food program. One thing sort of led to another.
MORRIE: I can see where 'angel' would be an appropriate title. (beat) But it was, uh, this Geel Piet who was really behind all of it, wasn't it?
PK: He was very good at pointing things out.
MORRIE: Man like that should be running a country, not rotting in prison.
PK: He's not in prison anymore. (pause) He's dead.
MARIA: I thought I'd surprise you.
PK: Well, you succeeded.
MARIA: Mr. Goldman was explaining the theory behind the left hook.
MORRIE: Beats talking about the weather. You may have heard about me?
MARIA: Oh yes.   How d'you do.
SOLLY: Well, nice meeting you, Maria.
MARIA: Nice meeting you, Mr. Goldman.
SOLLY: We never had a girl come to the gym. (beat) It's not such a bad thing, huh?
PK: You got a pass to come out on a weeknight?
MARIA: Your tree pass.
MARIA: Do you box too, Morrie?
MORRIE: Do I look that daft?
PK: Morrie's the brains of the operation.
MORRIE: He means the bank. Your boyfriend has a great head for literature but none for finance.
PK: (in Zulu) I see you, Nguni.
NGUNI: I see you, P.K.
NGUNI: You have heard my request?
PK: Yes.    Why do you make it?
NGUNI: A woman has thrown the sacred ox bones. She has made a fire and read the smoke.
PK: What did she read?
NGUNI: That the Onoshobishobi Ingelosi who is a chief must fight the one who one day will be a chief.
PK: But it's not true that I'm a chief.
NGUNI: Who knows what is true and what is not. The legend of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is very powerful among the people. They see you box the Boer and always you win. They have heard the stories from Barberton. The people live with little hope. They must see if the spirit of the boy still lives in the man.
PK: And   if I lose? If the spirit of the   Onoshobishobi Ingelosi does not   exist in me anymore, then what will   they live with?
NGUNI: Less hope.   But still they must
POLICE #1: What's this here?
PK: An old family servant, Officer. From home. We just ran into each other.
POLICE #2: Papers, man.   Come on, be quick.
POLICE #1: Where you coming from?
PK: Gym, sir.   I train there.
POLICE #1: And you?
MORRIE: I'm his manager.
POLICE #2: (to Maria) And you're the sparring partner, hey?
POLICE #2: You have an hour to curfew and a long way to go, kaffir. Be off.
NGUNI: (subservient) Yes, baas. Going right now.
PK: Nguni.
PK: I'll do it.
MARIA: I'm scared for you, PK.
PK: Solly's a great teacher. He wouldn't put me in a fight I couldn't handle.
MARIE: I mean about how involved you are with the black people. That scares me.
PK: Because you don't understand them.
MARIA: No I don't.
PK: If you did you wouldn't be so scared. You ever have a conversation with a black person?
MARIA: Of course.
PK: Besides a servant.
PK: You should sometime.
MARIA: I hate it when you tease me.
PK: Sorry.
MARIA: (pouty) No you're not.
PK: Yes I am.
MARIA: I better go.
LEWIS: According to your submission you have ambitions to be a writer and the welterweight boxing champion of the world.
PK: Yes, sir.
LEWIS: Don't you   find seeking a career as a pugilist   and reading for a degree at   Oxford a bit, how shall we put it,   intellectually
PK: Lord Byron was a boxer, sir. And I've never heard anyone question his intellectual integrity.
LEWIS: I do not recall Lord Byron actually engaging in matches for money.
PK: Actually, sir, there are several recorded instances of Lord Byron engaging in matches for quite large sums of money.
EXAMINER #2: Quite right. Yes. In   a letter to his wife Shelley makes mention of just such a thing. For  hundreds of pounds, actually.
LEWIS: Let's move along, shall we? As your presentational you've requested to read from a work of your own fiction.
PK: Yes, sir.
LEWIS: Well, then, let us hope we'll be treated to the stirrings of another Byron.
PK: The Concerto for the Southland and the Death of Geel Piet. (pause) His name was Geel Piet -- yellow Peter. He was a mix of half the blood in Africa -- Dutch, Portuguese, Zulu, Sotha, and who knew what else. His father
PK (V.O.): When I met him he had spent forty of his fifty-five years in one South African prison or another. He was a thief, a con man, a black marketeer.
PK (V.O.): He may   even have killed a man or two in   his time. But despite all that he   was one of the kindest, wisest,   most self-effacing persons I ever   knew. He was my teacher; he was   my friend.
PK  (V.O.): Geel Piet bore no  animosity, held no hate. Should   a guard beat him he regarded it as  self-inflicted,
PK: You know every time they do that I want to jump up and say I'm just a twelve-year-old. I'm not anything else.
GEEL PIET: To them you are. You are the one who brings the smoke, the one who writes the letters, the one who puts clothes on their children when they are cold. You are Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.
PK: But you know that's not true.
GEEL PIET: Who is to say what is true and what is not true, kleine baas.
DOC: The Allied armies have crossed the Rhine into Germany. It is almost over.
PK: That's great, isn't it?
DOC: (crestfallen)
BORMANN: And you, too, little Rooinek.     But you, kaffir, Hitler comes or goes...
BORMANN: You are going to stay with me.
BORMANN: And I will find out all your secrets once your friends are gone. One slip...
BORMANN: I have you.
BORMANN: Get out of here.
BORMANN: You see, Professor, they are not like us. A white man would scream bloody murder.
PK (V.O.): As the weeks went by and the date for the concert grew closer, my life was a whirlwind.
PK (V.O.): Having obtained the cooperation of all the tribal groups, we set about instructing them. Four men from each tribe were taught the
PK (V.O.): At night the prison hummed with the men in their cells practicing.
P.K. (V.O.): My boxing instruction accelerated as well. It was as if Geel Piet was trying to give me every bit of boxing knowledge he had before we parted. And always from the corners and shadows Bormann watched and waited.
PK (V.O.): Our boxing squad, the Barberton Blues, won the State Championship with a perfect record. I won at 100 lbs. It was my first championship. It made me want
PK (V.O.): Finally the night of the concert arrived. The prison atmosphere, normally tense, was keening. Each prisoner entering the yard is searched. It was prison policy to keep tribal rivalries boiling. Divide and conquer. The policy of control.
PK (V.O.) (CONT'D): This was to be the first time in the history of the South African prison system that the tribes were allowed to mingle. And if trouble came, it would be the last.
DOC: Have you seen my page turner?
PK: No.
PK: Have you seen Geel Piet?
VON ZYL: Where is Bormann? I need Bormann to translate to the prisoners.
SMIT: I don't know, Kommandant.
DOC: Is there a problem here, Kommandant?
VON ZYL: I want to address these filthy kaffirs but I don't have a translator.
PK: I'll translate.
VON ZYL: You can speak Zulu, PK?
PK: Yes, sir.
VON ZYL: All right.   Listen up.
VON ZYL: Tell them this concert is the gift to them from the professor who, even though he is in prison, is not a dirty criminal like them but a man of culture and learning.
PK: (subtitled) The Kommandant welcomes you and looks forward to the great singing.
VON ZYL: For such a man I am happy to do this. But one hair of trouble and it's finish.
VON ZYL: One wrong move and you get marched back to your cells and don't come out for a month.
PK: (subtitled) He says tonight let us be one people under the African sky.
VON ZYL: You did a good job.
PK: Thank you, sir.
VON ZYL: Professor?
PK: No!
PK (V.O.): Geel Piet died of massive internal hemorrhage, the result of Bormann's ramming a truncheon up into the little man's body until his entrails spilled out. When I reached him he was already dead. I sat there crying, stroking his head and crying with African
LEWIS: Thank you very much. You will be notified as to the University's decision by mail.
LEWIS: Point of curiousity.
LEWIS: Your headmaster told me your work is somewhat autobiographical.
PK: Yes, sir.
LEWIS: This Bormann, he was real?
PK: Yes, sir.
LEWIS: Was justice ever served?
PK: Yes, sir. Sergeant Bormann died of cancer... (pause) of the rectum.
PK: We have to make a stop first.
SOLLY: The night won't last forever, boychick.
PK: It'll only take a minute.
SOLLY: The night I escaped from the Tsar's Army it was just like this. Six of us -- four Jews, two Ukranians. Dark as anything. No streets. In the day we hid in bushes. At night we went.
MORRIE: You deserted?
SOLLY: Whey they come take you   at thirteen years old and   tell you it's twenty-five years   in the Army, it's your duty to   desert.
SOLLY: You said the end of the road.
NGUNI: Yes, yes.    Sorry. I drive.
NGUNI: (smiling) Welcome, miss, welcome.
MARIA: Thank you.
NGUNI: The people have come from everywhere to see you.
MORRIE: Where are the men?
NGUNI: They are to be witness.
NGUNI: No worry, miss. It is the sound of happiness.
NGUNI: We are here.
MORRIE: I don't see why we have to weigh in. They're going to fight anyway.
NGUNI: It is very important the people see everything is correct.
PK: (in Zulu) I see you, Gideon Mandoma.
MANDOMA: I see you, PK.
PK: I just want you to know you fight a man. Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is just a name I was given at Barberton Prison. It means nothing.
MANDOMA: It is not for you or me to say what it means.
NGUNI: Please.
NGUNI: It is time.
WHISPERS: Onoshobishobi.
CROWD: Onoshobishopi Ingelosi. Shobi shobi Ingelosi.
OLD WOMAN: Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.
REFEREE: You are listening to me please. When I am shouting break, you must break at once. When a knockdown is coming, it is for an eight count. No heads, no elbows. You fight clean or by golly I am giving you penalty points. Good luck, boys.
PK: What do you see?
SOLLY: A very tough fight.
PK: Tell him.
MORRIE: Look -- he's taking water.
SOLLY: See. Where that water goes -- you go. Right to here.
SOLLY: You put your punches there, you win. You don't, you lose.
REFEREE: Three... four... five...
REFEREE: ... seven... eight... nine...
REFEREE: How many fingers?
PK: Six.
REFEREE: Where are you?
PK: In a fight behind on points.
REFEREE: Okay.   Continue.
MORRIE: We're in the shit now.      Nice knowing you, Solly.
MANDOMA: Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.
MARIA: The Seniors Dance is two Saturdays from now. I would like it if you could escort me.
PK: Maria Marais with a rooinek at the Senior Dance? What will people think?
MARIA: They'll think what they think and I'll think what I think.
PK: And what is that?
MARIA: I think I love you.
PK: I would be honored to be your escort.
MARIA: I didn't doubt it for a minute.
PK: I'll give you a boost.
MARIA: Thank you for tonight.    You were great.
SOLLY: When you and your manager first came to me with that meshuganah idea to be welterweight champion of the world you did not have a big believer here. But I gotta tell you. Now you do. In London lives Benny Rosen, the greatest trainer in the world today. When you go to your Oxford I give you a letter to Rosen. Whatever I can't do for you, he can.
PK: Thanks, Mr. G.
SOLLY: And I give the address of a very good bookmaker. Teach you also a thing or two. Now, go on back to being fancy-schmancy English gentlemen. I'm proud of both of you.
ST. JOHN (V.O): Gentlemen.
MORRIE: You're up early, sir.
ST. JOHN: Best time for walking.
PK: Best time for running too, sir.
MORRIE: Have to put in the roadwork, sir. You know, keep those legs strong.
ST. JOHN: Yes.   Quite a fresh bruise there.
PK: I tripped.
ST. JOHN: Maybe you should change your footwear.
ST. JOHN: To something a little more appropriate for... (beat) roadwork.
BOTH: Yes, sir.
MANDOMA: Please excuse me for coming like a thief by the window.
PK: You speak English?
PK: You are a great fighter, Gideon.
MANDOMA: Second greatest in this room.
PK: But you didn't come to talk about fighting.
MANDOMA: When you say to me, Onoshobishobi Ingelosi means nothing, you are right. And you are wrong. The legend gives the people hope for a good tomorrow. But hope alone will not make a good tomorrow for the people. You cannot write our letters, get us clothes, food, work. These things we must do ourselves, so we can be part of this country's good tomorrow. If we are not, the hope will disappear. The people will grow tired. The tired will grow angry and there will be no good tomorrow for anybody -- black or white.
PK: What are you asking from me?
MANDOMA: To be part of something you must know what everyone else knows. We have our own knowledge. We need yours.
MORRIE: We get our knowledge in schools, Gideon. We're not born with it.
MANDOMA: Then it must be the same with us.
MORRIE: You have schools.
MANDOMA: Yes. And teachers who cannot do more than their own ABC's. We have a system made not to teach us.
PK: (anxious) I am only seventeen years old, Gideon. I cannot teach five million people how to speak English and do sums.
MANDOMA: You taught the singing to thousands at Barberton Prison. You were only twelve.
MANDOMA (CONT'D): You are a great fighter, PK.
PK: Second greatest in this room, Gideon.
ST. JOHN: You are asking me for a lot, young man.
PK: I'm only asking you to put what you've taught us into practice, sir.
ST. JOHN: You are asking me to put the reputation of this school in jeopardy.
PK: The reputation of this school, sir, is based on its integrity.
PK: Then we'd better be careful to keep a firm hand on our pens... (beat) ... sir.
ST. JOHN: All right. I will allow it on a trial basis. Here are my conditions: you tell no one; you operate at night on Saturdays when the student body is gone; you involve no one besides yourself and Mr. Levy. If you can comply, you can have your school.
MARIA: Ready.   Set.   Go!
PK: You okay?
MARIA: You're supposed to let me win.
PK: Then you'd say I was being condescending.
MARIA: You were guilty of that when you gave me a head start.
MARIA: Get your formal yet?
PK: Uh... no.
MARIA: The dance is only a week away.
PK: Maria... (beat) I can't come to the dance.
MARIA: (shocked) Why not?
PK: I have an obligation.
MARIA: Can't you change it?
PK: It's a permanent obligation. Every Saturday night... (beat) It starts tonight.
MARIA: You're breaking up with me.
PK: No.
MARIA: Then what could be so important that it takes all your Saturday nights?
PK: I really can't say.
MARIA: P.K., I love you.     Please don't go away.
PK: I'm not going away.
MARIA: Yes you are.   I can feel it.
PK: I'm not.   I'm just tutoring.
PK: I started a school... (beat) ... for Gideon Mandoma and some others in the seniors library.
MARIA: I'm losing you to a bunch of kaffirs?
PK: You're not losing anything.
MARIA: No? Are you escorting me to the dance? Are you going to see me on the only free night they give us?
PK: Maria, this is important to me.
MARIA: And my life's important to me. Damn you.
DOC: (breathing hard) Ach.   You see how beautiful?
PK: You ever hear of glycerine, Doc?
DOC: Mr. Going-To-Oxford-Smarty-Pants. Of course I know about glycerine. Triglycerine. Biglycerine. Monoglycerine. What do you want to know?
PK: Why you don't use it. It's only a little pill under the tongue.
DOC: Tongues were not made to put little pills under. When I have to start with that, I become something else.
PK: Well, until you become something else, the little pills would make this easier on your heart.
DOC: Little pills or no little pills -- we don't find cover, we both turn into something else.
DOC: Look for a cave. Always in this kind of rock there is caves. Quick! Quick!
DOC: Don't look at me.     Go!
PK: You okay?
PK: What are you doing?
DOC: Exploring.
PK: Why don't you just rest?
DOC: Plenty time for resting when I am something else. Look.
DOC: When does a cave have wind?    This
DOC: Here.   See?   There is a passage.
DOC: You know the pyramids are nothing more than man's attempt to recreate the first safe home our species had -- the cave. It is the ultimate safe resting place. The first place man could lay down and have a good night's sleep without worrying about waking up as something's supper.
DOC: You hear that? There is something waiting for us.
PK: Let's hope it's not hungry.
DOC: Better, ja?
PK: What's that smell?
PK: What's that?
PK: Maybe it's stopped raining.
DOC: Who can think about rain when you are on the edge of the great unknown cave.
PK: You don't know that.
DOC: The bats didn't come from a shoebox, Mr. Know-It-All.
DOC: Sometimes I think maybe sending you off to that fancy-shmancy school was not such a good idea.
PK: It was your idea. Your'e the one who pushed for me to go.
DOC: Ja. But who knew they do such a good job of boxing up part of
PK: Which part is that?
DOC: The one where is all the questions. The curiosity center. Look.
DOC: Did I tell you?
DOC: Wunderbar.
DOC: How many hundreds of thousands of years to make this masterpiece? Everything outside can change, P.K. This remains the same. We are in the heart of Africa, P.K. The heart of Africa.
DOC (O.S.): You know, if a person stayed here for 100,000 years what would be
PK: (to himself) Incredible.
PK: I wish we had brought the camera. Think there's enough light to shoot?
PK: Doc?
PK: Doc?
PK: This is not funny.
DOC: This is incredible! The crystal. You can feel the life go right through you. Here.
DOC: Come try it.
PK: (short) No.   That's all right.   Can we go?
DOC: We have only just gotten here. What's the matter, P.K.?
PK: All day long you've been talking about becoming something else, about dying. You never talked about dying before.
DOC: I'm 87 next month.   It's natural.
PK: Not to a sixteen-year-old it's not. It's painful.
DOC: You are right. I am sorry. Sixteen-year-old ears should only hear life.
PK: I'll just set you up with some coffee here, so in the morning you won't have to bother making it.
PK: I didn't mean to tell you what
PK (CONT'D): ... becoming... (beat) ... something else. I know it's natural law and it's the way it is with everybody... (beat) I just wish it weren't with you.
PK: Doc?
PK: I'm here, Doc.
DOC: The crystal cave will be our secret, ja?
PK: Whatever you say.
DOC: Promise.
PK: I promise.
DOC: Ja.  Good. I rest a little. (beat) The heart of Africa, P.K.
DOC: The heart.
MORRIE: Christ! If someone would have told me this is where I'd be on a Saturday night, last term of my senior year, I'd call them batty. (beat) You know, you're going to owe me for the rest of your life on this one.
PK: That all? I figured you'd hold me to it longer.
MORRIE: You get the insider friend's rate.
PK: Thanks, mate.
MANDOMA: I see you, P.K.
PK: I see you, Gideon.
MORRIE: Let's get inside before the whole bloody world sees us.
MANDOMA: Morrie.
MANDOMA: You some great friend.
PK: Let's go.    Stay to the fence.
PK: All right, class.     I know you don't understand a    word I'm saying, but part of    learning a language is hearing    it spoken. So -- I am P.K.
PK: P.K.  This... (taps Morrie) ... is Morrie. Now you all have a chalkboard.
PK: Chalk and an eraser.      I will say
PK (CONT'D): Morrie will check the letter. All right? Here we go. 'A'... (in Zulu) ... say it. 'A.'
PK: Excuse me.
MARIA: I thought you might need some help. Or I can just sit and watch.
PK: Class. This is Maria. She is now the teacher. (to Maria) We're doing alphabet, from the letter 'A.'
MARIA: 'A.'     Write 'A.'
MANDOMA: (to Maria) You are one brave Boer, Miss Maria.
MARIA: Thank you.
MANDOMA: And you are one lucky English.
PK: Good night, Gideon.
MORRIE: Well, I   think I'll go... um... lay on   my back and count the cracks   in the ceiling. 'Night. Nice to   see you, Maria.
MARIA: Good night, Morrie.
PK: I am one lucky English.
MARIA: P.K.     Can I ask you a favor?
PK: Anything.
MARIA: We don't have to go in    or anything. You can hear the music    from outside. I'd love to     have one dance with you before    I graduate.
PK: Done.
MARIA: I feel so good. Race you to the gate.
PK: You need a headstart?
MARIA: No.
MORRIE: We made it!   We made it!
MORRIE: Sorry. I couldn't bear the suspense after I read mine.   I had to open it.
MORRIE: Three months and we're out of here.
PK: You're out of here.
MORRIE: What the hell are you talking about?
MORRIE: (reading) 'Dear sir. It is our pleasure to inform you that you have been accepted to matriculate at Trinity College, Oxford,' etc., etc., etc.
PK: It says nothing about the scholarship.
MORRIE: A technicality.
BOY: St. John wants to see you two in his study.
MORRIE: Good news travels fast.
PK: I'll get showered and changed.
BOY: He said to come as you are. Immediately.
PK: Wanted to see us, sir?
ST. JOHN: Yes.   Come in.     Close the door.
ST. JOHN: This is Brigadier Bretyn from the police department.
ST. JOHN: He has come to deliver, in person, an order to close the Saturday school.
PK: Why?
BRETYN: Because it is illegal.
MORRIE: We're only teaching them how to read and do sums.
BRETYN: You don't have certification to do that.
PK: Prince of Wales is a certified school.
BRETYN: Yes.   But not certified for that
PK: Can he do this, sir?
BRETYN: Of course I can do it. Would I be here if I couldn't? Come now meneer headmaster. Let's end this now. I have a full day ahead of me still.
ST. JOHN: (resigned) The Saturday school is to be disbanded until further notice.
BRETYN: Thank you, meneer headmaster. Your cooperation in this matter is very appreciated. Good day.
PK: You know it can't go on like this forever.
BRETYN: What can't?
PK: What you're doing.
BRETYN: I'm just doing my job. And if you'll take some advice, you should just do yours.
MORRIE: Is that really the end of it, sir?
ST. JOHN: For the moment I'm afraid it is.
PK: If we let them get away with it on our own grounds, it will never
ST. JOHN: History disputes you.
PK: History takes too long.
ST. JOHN: Yes it does. But it is never kind to those who try to hurry it.
PK: I feel we should resist, sir.
ST. JOHN: So do I, P.K. But this is not a subtle government. They mean to have their way and damn the consequences. And I cannot jeopardize this school, no matter how I personally feel. I'm sorry. (beat) I heard you were accepted at Oxford.
MORRIE: Yes, sir.   Received notification today.
ST. JOHN: Well, congratulations.
MORRIE: Thank you, sir.
ST. JOHN: To both of you.
PK: (tight) Thank you, sir.
ST. JOHN: We'll talk before you go.
PK: Yes, sir.   Will that be all?
ST. JOHN: That'll be all.
PK: I'd like to see Maria Marais please.
GUARD: Sorry. She's not allowed visitors.
PK: Well, if I could just talk to her.
GUARD: Sorry.
PK: Morrie.   Morrie.
MORRIE: What?
PK: I want to show you something.
MORRIE: What time is it?
MORRIE: Can I see it later?
PK: No.   Come on.
MORRIE: You know, when we get to Oxford -- separate rooms.
PK: Will you hurry.
MORRIE: Is there some girl out there waiting for me?
PK: Yeah. Stunning. Breasts like casabas. Just waiting for you.
MORRIE: Bullshit.
PK: What do you think?
MORRIE: I think you're fooling yourself into thinking the bastards won't
PK: This is a church. Didn't you ever hear of the Christian concept of sanctuary?
MORRIE: Yes. But I'm not the one who has to respect it.
PK: Even the Boer has limits, Morrie.
MORRIE: I'm sure he does, but I'd still like to see a big bolt on the inside door.
CARETAKER: Mr. Levy?
SOLLY: Now move it nice and easy, the both of you. Time.
PK: They want us to close the school.
PK: We are still game.
MANDOMA: So are we.
SOLLY: Would you two find some other time to chat. This is a boxing ring, not a social club.
PK: (cool) I was in the neighborhood.
MARIA: (whispering) They're sending me away to school in Pretoria. I told my father I wouldn't go. He said if I didn't he'd see they arrest you and ruin your chances. I couldn't let him do that.
PK: When do you go?
MARIA: Next week. (beat) I want to make love to you, P.K.
MARIA: I do.
PK: If you'll all be seated we can begin.
PK: So far so good.
PK: I want to thank you all for having the courage to come tonight. (in Zulu) Thank you.
ALL: (in Zulu) You're welcome.
PK: I will be teaching the first part of class tonight and Mr. Levy will teach the second.
PK: Gideon?
MANDOMA: Miss Marais.   Will she not be coming?
PK: Not anymore.
PK: See.
PK: I see.    You see.     We see.
ALL: I see.    You see. We see.
PK: Boy.
ALL: Boy.
PK: I see the boy.
ALL: I see the boy.
PK: Girl.    I see the girl.
ALL: I see the girl.
MARIA: P.K., it's me.
MARIA: I wanted to say goodbye to my students... (beat) ... and to you.
WOMEN: We see the girl.
BRETYN: Once warned.     Twice punished.
PK: You're violating the sanctity of the church.
BRETYN: No. You are with your damned race mixing ideas, rooinek.
PK: At least let the women go.
BRETYN: You want everything to be equal, little Boetie. Why not men and women too?
MORRIE: Now!
BRETYN: Locks keep people out but they also keep them in.
BRETYN: Get up, you bloody commie Jew!
BRETYN: Captain.
PK: No.    Wait.   We'll leave.
BRETYN: Too late. You never should have come. At the ready.
PK: No!    Stop!
BRETYN: Now.
PK: Maria!
MEN: Daniel.    No.
MORRIE: (surprised) You're applying to South African universities?
PK: In case the scholarship doesn't come through.
MORRIE: Why are you so bloody stubborn? You don't belong in a South African university any more than I belong in the priesthood. Will you take my father's loan?
BOY: There a Mr. P.K. here?
MORRIE: It's your scholarship.
BOY: Sign here.   Odd name -- P.K.
MORRIE: What's your name?
BOY: Waldo.
MORRIE: You're not one to talk about names.
MORRIE: What's it say?
PK: Doc's missing.
VON ZYL: Since his pneumonia last year I've had one of the men drop by once a week to see if he needed anything. Of course you know the professor. He never did.
VON ZYL: At the beginning of the week he wasn't home so I decided to drop by myself. Waited a whole day here. When he didn't come back I sent search parties. After three days I sent the telegram. Seven days is a long time for him to be gone. Do you have any ideas where he went?
DOC (V.O.): So Mr. Schmartypants. It did not take you so long to figure out what happened. I hope you forgive me for not saying goodbye, but I did not think it would be necessary between us. What could I say you don't already know.
DOC (V.O.) (CONT'D): That I love you with all my heart? That you have given me more in our ten years of friendship than three lifetimes could fill? That the last thoughts I have before becoming something else will be of music, cactus, and you? You know all this.
DOC (V.O.): Last night this music came into my head. It is my music for Africa. My music for you. So go. Be welterweight champion of the world. Be a writer. A great writer. Remember -- the only thing between a dream and a reality is you. Until we meet again, your friend, Doc.
PK: Hello?     Mr. G?     Anyone here?
SOLLY (O.S.): In here.
PK: Mr. Goldman, why isn't anybody
SOLLY: A repeat performance of history, my boy. Solly Goldman's being deported. Of course last time I didn't have the luxury of being able to pack.
PK: For what reason?
SOLLY: Their reason is that I'm here illegal. I didn't enter the country with a passport. Like the Czar was issuing passports to Russian Jews in 1910.
PK: This is because of me, isn't it?
SOLLY: No, boychick. This is because of them. They are the problem, not you. Don't ever think different. You look tired. Want a glass tea?
PK: No, no.   I have to get back to school.
SOLLY: You got your head screwed on right. Don't let these meshuganahs screw it on wrong. Now go on. You want to find me, look at Benny Rosen's gym in East End, London.
PK: Thank you for everything.
SOLLY: We're not finished yet.
MARAIS: You're a very good writer. The subject matter is a little inflammatory but the style is interesting.
PK: What are you doing here?
MARAIS: I came to inform you that you will not be receiving aid from the National Scholarship Fund. Neither will you be admitted to any of the South African universities. Here are your applications back.
MARAIS: I told you when you came to my house. I am first a member of my tribe and I will defend it any way I know how.
MORRIE (O.S.): They don't want you here any more than they want me.
MORRIE: Take the hint. Screw the scholarship. Come on. Let's leave.
PK: If I leave or if I stay in South Africa it's because I choose to, not because they choose for me.
MORRIE: Where are you going?
PK: Save my place at Oxford.
MORRIE: P.K., goddammit!
PK: Save my place.
PK (V.O.): Dear Morrie.     Here is how it works.
PK (V.O.): Setting charges and drilling the rock. The only way for the raw ore he takes from the sides of the stope to get to the haulage below is to pass through the spout of a funnel and out the steel doors at the bottom -- sixty feet down.
PK (V.O.): Halfway down the spout area is a set of six tungsten steel bars called a grizzly which catch all the rocks too large to make it through the funnel mouth to safe haulage.
PK (V.O.): These are taken care of by a grizzly, an explosives expert whose job it is to keep the ore flowing, and since when the ore doesn't flow, neither does the money, working the grizzly is a very crucial and therefore very well-paid position. Three months'
THOMAS: Are you crazy?     To sign on for a year?
PK: You said I was the best you ever taught, sir.
THOMAS: And you are, boyo. The absolute best.
THOMAS (CONT'D): But even the best doesn't survive a year on the bars. Down in that damn tube the luck runs out sooner than later. You may be a genius at reading the rock but you ain't no fuckin' fortune teller.
PK: You worked grizzly a year.
THOMAS: And let me show you what I have to show for it to this day.
THOMAS: And that's thirteen years after the fact, boyo.
PK: Something wrong?
THOMAS: (unconvincing) Nothing.
BARTENDER: One double brandy. One... (derisive) lemon soda.
THOMAS: Come on, then.
THOMAS: On being the best damned blaster ever taught by Ian Thomas. Cheers.
THOMAS: Another.
THOMAS: Sure you don't want one?
PK: I don't like the taste.
THOMAS: Taste?     You don't drink for the taste.
THOMAS: Hell's comin'.
THOMAS: Drillers. He's got a powder pain from breathin' too much of that damn gelignite. The pain's bad enough. Mixed with a little alcohol it's fuckin' lethal.
THOMAS: Come on.   We ain't got much time.
THOMAS: The two most dangerous things you'll ever see in your life, boyo: a hangup of rock that won't blast free on first shot and a driller with a powder headache drinkin'.
PK (V.O.): Dear Morrie. To answer your question: yes--sports are played here, but only in the loosest sense of the words "sport" and "play". The rules are different for everything, in games as well as in the rest of our lives. The managers, the foremen, the company people. They live apart from the miners. They have families. Proper gardens. Sunday dinners. The miners--the crud, as we are called -- don't. This is a society of men, many of whom have pasts better left behind. Future does not apply. It is a society only in the loosest sense of the word. The laws of survival are simple-- you either do or you don't.
PK: You know, Rasputin, I had them right where I wanted them. Another minute they were done for.
PK (V.O.): Friendships are rare--arising out of mutual need rather than
PK (V.O.): The Africans who come here looking for work are driven by a different desperation--drought, famine, locusts.
PK (V.O.): They come and risk their    lives to send money back home to    the families sitting on the    barren farms, starving, waiting    for death or rain.
PK (V.O.): Superstition runs deep in them, so a good grizzly man attracts a good crew. On the bars, the longer you live the luckier you are. And by association -- they are.
ELIJAH: Baas.   Baas.
PK (V.O.): Hangups are the worst of it. When the top of the funnel gets blocked up and the ore won't flow.
PK (V.O.): The only way to unblock it is to set a charge to blow inward. And the only way to do that is to set the charge in mud, which means climbing up to the mouth of the stope and coming face-to-face with the devil.
PK (V.O.): Sometimes the rock doesn't need the provocation of explosives. Sometimes the earth shifts... (beat) a pebble moves... (beat) you talk too loud... (beat) and in the moment before you are turned into something else by fifty tons of rock you understand why it is called grizzly.
ELIJAH: I wait for you, baas.
PK: Let's clean her off and call it a night, hey?
PK (V.O.): The Africans think the longer you survive the luckier you are. And the luckier you are the longer you survive. I know there's something inherently wrong with their logic. Still, I'm beginning to see their point. Especially with less than six months to go.
PK: Come in.
JOCKO: Ay, man. If you'd let him win once in a while we could take a little book on it here.
PK: He doesn't care if he wins.     He just likes to play.
JOCKO: And you?
PK: I like to win.
JOCKO: Which    is why I'm about visiting you.     You've come on the board, man.     There are odds on your making    it or not.
PK: How are they?
JOCKO: (low) Not in your favor, my boy.
PK: Why are you telling me this, Jocko?
JOCKO: When you come up on the boards, boyo, it's time to bow out. It's an omen.
PK: I bow out you can't make book.
JOCKO: PK, it's not a bet I want to collect.
PK: Tell me, Jocko, how high will the odds go on something like this?
JOCKO: The shorter your time, the higher they go. With you probably ten, twelve, thirteen to one when you're short a month.
PK: When the odds hit the top put me in against all bets for two hundred quid.
JOCKO: I did not come here to solicit your bet.
PK: I know that. I appreciate it. But if you don't take it, someone else will.
JOCKO: All  right. You're a bleery fool. And  I'll be prayin' every night it's  the only bet I ever have to pay  off on.
PK: And so will I.
JOCKO: You should let him win once in a while.
PK: When he wins it won't be because I let him.
PK: Checkmate.
PK: Did you hear a blast whistle?
ELIJAH: No, baas.
PK: I never heard a drill at night.
PK: It's not a ghost. It's just some driller trying to squeeze extra pay. Come on.
ELIJAH: (whispered) Baas.
PK: Not the first bloody thing!
ELIJAH: Bad sign, baas.
PK: Bad drilling's more like it. Come on. Let's get it going.
PK: (whispered) What's the matter with them?
ELIJAH: They say juju. Bad magic is in the mine tonight.
PK: She's playing with us tonight. Fuse set?
PK: Go on.
ELIJAH: I stay with you, baas.
PK: That's an order.
PK: One... two... three.
MINER #1: He's dead.   No doubt about it.
MINER #2: You give me a fair odds on ten quid?
MINER #1: Four to one.
MINER #2: Make it a sixer and you got me.
MINER #1: You're on.
MINER #2: Anyone else?   Six to one he's dead.
MINER #3: He says someone was up there. Blasted it out on PK from the other side?
MINER #4: Who's the driller?
MINER #3: Botha.
MINER #4: No one drills Botha's stope but Botha, and he only works days.
PK: (strangled) Help.   Help.
PK (V.O.): Help.
JOCKO: Well, look at ya now, boyo. Up and at 'em in no time. And rich as a fuckin' lord.
PK: What's this?
JOCKO: Your ticket to ride. Two hundred quid at fourteen to one.
PK: But I didn't make it.   I'm a month short.
JOCKO: Not according to managment. They cashed you out at twelve months for eleven worked. Last thirty days was bonus. And until someone shows me a calendar reads different, twelve months and a year are one and the same kind of thing. And the bet was for a year. So get yourself mended and get your ass out of here.
PK: There's someone I have to see first.
JOCKO: What do you want to go pressin' it for? You're rich, lad. You're whole. Why do you want to go pressin' it?
PK: Because I want to know.
JOCKO: Know what?   That the man has
PK: No worries. The luckier you are, the longer you last. The longer you last, the luckier you are.
RASPUTIN: Checkmate!   Checkmate!
JOCKO: There's an end to everything, boyo. Even luck.
PK: Well I guess this is goodbye, my friend. I'll never forget you.
RASPUTIN: PK. Botha.   Nyet, nyet.   Nyet, Botha.
PK: Take care, my friend.
RASPUTIN: PK.   Botha.   Nyet. Nyet.    PK.
DRILLER: Who you lookin' for?
PK: Botha. The driller from stope number five.
DRILLER: He's at the bar.
PK: Thanks.
DRILLER: I wouldn't disturb him. There's a reason he's there and we're here.
BARTENDER #1: PK.   You're not going to go in,
PK: Is Botha the driller in there?
BARTENDER #2: Ja. Always we give him one hour alone before we open. You don't know this because you work at night, but it is the rule.
FRITZ: Ja.   In one hour it is pffft.
PK: Are you Botha?
BOTHA: Ja.
PK: I'm PK.   I worked your grizzly.
BOTHA: Ja.
PK: Why'd you try to kill me?
BOTHA: Because I missed the first time, rooinek.
PK: Jaapie Botha.
BOTHA: You remember, rooinek.
PK: Botha.     It was thirteen years ago.
BOTHA: Because    of you they expelled me. Because    of you my father beat me. Threw me    out from the farm. Because    of you.
PK: Botha. We've made a lot of money working together. Let the past be the past.
BOTHA: You ruined the country, all you rooineks. You come and ruin the country.
PK: No, Jaapie Botha. It's hate ruining the country.
BOTHA: Jaah.
PK: Boer hate.
BOTHA: Our country.
VOICE #1 (V.O.): He's dead.   He's dead.
GEEL PIET: First with the head, then with the heart. Little defeat big when little is smart.
PK: Want to see the wages of hate?
PK: Here.   Here is what hate gets you.
PK: For my chicken. For Geel Piet. For Doc. For Mandoma. For Maria.
PK: For Africa.
PK (V.O.): I knew as I walked out of the mines, out of Africa, that I wasn't fleeing. That one day I would return. Inkosi Inkosikasi was right. I was a man for all Africa. Bound to her by my spirit. Bound by my dreams. And Africa had taught me the lesson I would take out into the world and one day bring back. Great changes can come from the power of many. But only when the many join together and create what is invincible. The Power of One.
