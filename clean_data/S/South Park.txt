CARTMAN: The hell we can't! My money is just as good as any white person's!
TICKET GUY: You have to be accompanied by a parent or guardian.
KYLE: But why?
TICKET GUY: Because this movie has naughty language, and it might make you kids start using bad words.

MR. HAT: Okay, children, let's take our seats.
MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT): We have a lot to learn and precious little time.
MR. GARRISON: Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of Sigfried and Roy?
KYLE: It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison, it's Terrance and Phillip.
MR. GARRISON: Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT): That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
CARTMAN: I hate the environment.
KYLE: Dude, how can you hate the environment?
CARTMAN: 'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
MR. GARRISON: Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
CARTMAN: Fragile?
KYLE: No, he's talking about fuck, dude. You can't say fuck in front of Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON: Kyle!
CARTMAN: Why the fuck not?
MR. GARRISON: Eric!
STAN: Dude, you just said fuck again.
MR. GARRISON: Stanly!
KENNY: Mph.
MR. GARRISON: Kenny!
CARTMAN: That's bullshit! If Terrance and Phillip can say something, I should be able to say it too!
BEBE: Wow, Cartman's cool!
CLYDE: He's like Terrance and Phillip!
CARTMAN: Fuckin' a right.
MR. GARRISON: How would you like to go to the principal's office?
CARTMAN: How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
CARTMAN: I said -
CARTMAN: (Through megaphone)
KYLE: Oh, dude we are fucked now.
STAN: Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
KYLE: Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: I am VERY disappointed in you boys! You should be ASHAMED of yourselves! I've already called in your parents, but first I want you to THINK about what you've done.
CARTMAN: Principal Victoria, can I ask a question?
PRINCPAL VICTORIA: What?
CARTMAN: What's the big fucking deal?
STAN: Yeah.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: AGH!! I want to know where you heard these horrific obscenities!
STAN: Nowhere.
KYLE: I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
STAN: Yeah!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison ever said- (Reading) 'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass spelunker' in school!
STAN: Oh, oh...
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Thank you all for coming on such short notice. As you can see, your boys are all being disciplined.
STAN'S MOTHER: This just isn't like you, Stanley!
KYLE'S MOTHER: What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: No, it was worse than that...
KYLE'S MOTHER: (Gasping) The F word?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
STAN'S MOTHER: Oh dear God...
KYLE'S MOTHER: What is 'fisting'?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: That's when the fist is inserted into the anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: What?
KYLE'S MOTHER: (To Kyle) Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
KYLE: I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
CARTMAN: It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
STAN: Dude!
CARTMAN: What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
KYLE'S MOTHER: Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: What is Terrance and Phillip?
KYLE'S MOTHER: Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
CARTMAN: Everybody's already fucking seen it.
MS. CARTMAN: Eric!
CARTMAN: I'm sorry! I can't help it!! That movie has warped my fragile little mind.
KYLE'S MOTHER: Alright, boys, that's enough. Get out and let us adults speak.
KYLE'S MOTHER: We must take action on this immediately.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
KYLE'S MOTHER: Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: But I-
KYLE'S MOTHER: You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Get out of that chair! The PTA is in charge now!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Attention students. We are now enforcing a new dress code at South Park Elementary. Terrance and Phillip shirts are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY.
WENDY: Hello?
NEWS ANCHOR: All over America, kids are flocking to the R rated film, 'Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire'. Here with a special report, is a quadriplegic midget in a bikini.
Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI: Thanks, Tom. It appears that the effects of the Canadian Comedy are far reaching indeed. All over America, children seem to be influenced.
TEACHER: Alright, this is for the silver medal. Spell 'Forensics'.
KID: Oh, fuck that, why should I fucking have to spell forensics?
KID: Here you go; S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S,
CLOWN: Hey kids, how would you like to see some magic tricks?!
CLOWN: Huh?
CHILD: Yeah, and fuck your stupid little red nose.
CHILD 2: Yeah, and fuck your yellow hair. And fuck your gay pants.
Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI: And the devastating impact of the Canadian phenomenon is Terrance and Phillip's new hit song, "Shut Your Fucking Face, Unclefucka" which has climbed the charts with a bullet --
TERRANCE & PHILLIP: (Singing)
Shut your fucking face!: Unclefucka!!
NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks, midget. Shocking report.  The controversy surrounding the Terrance and Phillip movie began in the small mountain town of South Park, Colorado where the local PTA banned the movie.  With us tonight is the head of the South Park PTA, Sheila Brofloski-
NEWS ANCHOR: Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or is it Canada?
KYLE'S MOTHER: Canada!
NEWS ANCHOR: Alright. Here with a counterpoint is the Canadian Minister of Movies.
NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you, Minister, for joining us.
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: Thanks for having me, buddy.
NEWS ANCHOR: Minister, parents all over America are concerned about your country's entertainment. Your thoughts?
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: Well, the film is R rated, and it's not intended for children-
KYLE'S MOTHER: Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
NEWS ANCHOR: But minister, it isn't like this film is the first troublesome thing to come out of Canada. Let us not forget Brian Adams a few decades ago.
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: What?
KYLE'S MOTHER: The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
TERRANCE: Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
PHILLIP: I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
TERRANCE: Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
PHILLIP: You bet, Terrance!
PHILLIP: HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
TERRANCE: (Just a skull) I sure did, Phillip!!
STAN: Did you see that, Wendy?
WENDY: Yup.
KYLE: Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
CARTMAN: Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
KENNY: Mph rmpmh rm.
CARTMAN: No way.
STAN: Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
WENDY: Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
CARTMAN: Oh shit.
WENDY: It's just... It's obvious that we don't have a whole lot in common anymore. I need somebody who's... a little deeper.
STAN: But Wendy, I can go-
WENDY: No. Don't speak. You'll only make things more annoying. Goodbye, Stan.
KYLE: Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
STAN: (Insincere) Yeah...
KENNY: Mph rmph rm!!
CARTMAN: No you can't Kenny!
KENNY: Mph rm rmph!!
CARTMAN: Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
KENNY: Mph mm!

NURSE: I'm sorry...
KENNY'S MOTHER: Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
KENNY'S DAD: You bastards!
KYLE'S MOTHER: I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
STAN'S MOTHER: He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: You bastards.
KYLE'S MOTHER: This is it! The time for action is NOW!! (Singing)
Something must be done!: This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!
STAN'S MOTHER: I agree! (Singing)
Something must be done!: We must take action fast! My child used to say 'please and thank you' Now he says suck my ass!
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: world had ever known! until those damn Canadians brought that filth into our home! I agree that there is now a battle to be won! We can't just stand here singing! Something must be done!
KENNY'S MOTHER: But what are we going to do against the media machine? It's so big and powerful!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Right! And we can use that same media machine to exploit OUR cause!  We've got to let the whole world know what the Canadians did to your son!
PARENTS: Yeah!!
PARENTS: (Singing)
Something must be done!: Something's gotta give! This world has become a bitch in which we have no desire to live!
KENNY'S MOTHER: Or a lawyer rich and true Instead he burned up like a piggy on a bar-b-que!
KYLE'S MOTHER: in memory of your son!
PARENTS: Something must be done!
PARENTS: edge And now the time has come! Something's gotta change! It's time to buy a gun! We can't just stand here singing No we can't just stand here singing No we can't just stand here singing! Something must be done!!!
CARTMAN: (Dazed) I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
KYLE: Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
CARTMAN: No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
KYLE: Oh.
KYLE (O.S.): I can't believe he's dead.
CARTMAN (O.S.): Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
KENNY: Mph rmph rm!
STAN: How can they do this?
KYLE: It isn't fair!
CARTMAN: Well, Terrance and Phillip are on Conan O'Brian tonight, we could at least go watch that.
KYLE'S MOTHER: THIS must be him, officer! This is the scum that sold R rated tickets to children!
TICKET GUY: What?! Jesus Christ, I didn't mean to!
OFFICER BARBRADY: You can explain downtown!
TICKET GUY: (Getting dragged away) Oh shit! Hey it's not MY fault! You should arrest those pervert Canadians!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Oh we will, Mr. Scumbag... We will...
CONAN O'BRIAN: Our next guests have the number one movie in the world right now, please welcome Terrance and Phillip!
PHILLIP: Hello, Conan!
TERRANCE: Hello, Brooke Shields!
CONAN: It's nice to have you here in America.
PHILLIP: Yeah, well, you being a Canadian and all, we thought what the hell!
CONAN O'BRIAN: So guys... I understand you have a comedy routine worked out for us.
PHILLIP: We sure do, Conan. And here it is. Excuse me, Terrance.
TERRANCE: Yes, Phillip?
PHILLIP: Gotcha!
TERRANCE: Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
PHILLIP: Cheers, Terrance!
CONAN O'BRIAN: (Nervous) So, guys, I need to ask you a serious question...
PHILLIP: I just farted Terrance back into the stone age!
BROOKE SHIELDS: I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon!
TERRANCE: Nobody cares, Brooke Shields!
CONAN O'BRIAN: Terrance and Phillip... Whose idea was it, to have a person lighting a fart on fire in your movie? Who is responsible for that?
TERRANCE: Phillip, I think our friend Conan has been working too hard.
CONAN O'BRIAN: Say it! It was YOUR idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie!
PHILLIP/TERRANCE: (Together) It was our idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie.
KYLE'S MOTHER: (Into her lapel) That's it!  Move, move, move!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
KYLE: Dude, what the hell is going on?
TERRANCE: Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
PHILLIP: This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us! (Pointing to Conan) You are a bad man!
TERRANCE: And you call yourself a Canadian! (To Phillip) I told you we should of done Leno!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Don't listen to them, Mr. O'Brian. They're master manipulators. You did a good job.
TERRANCE: You loved our movie, Conan!  We watched it together.  You... You laughed!
CONAN O'BRIAN: What have I done?!!!
BROOKE SHIELDS: AGAHGAHGGH!!!! Mondays at eight
KYLE'S MOTHER: You see what your filth has caused?
TERRANCE: US?! This is your mess, outraged mother!!
STAN: Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
KYLE: Our moms suck!
CARTMAN: This could mean... No more Terrance and Phillip - EVER!
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR: As The Canadian Ambassador, I hereby condemn the actions taken by America in apprehending Terrance and Phillip!
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR: We demand their release IMMEDIATELY!! As you can see from this graph, the entire economy of Canada relies on Terrance and Phillip! Without them we are doomed to recession!
KYLE'S MOTHER: If I may?
KYLE'S MOTHER: As president and founder of M.A.C., I would like to state-
UNITED NATIONS HEAD: Excuse me, M.A.C.?
KYLE'S MOTHER: Yes, Mothers Against Canada.
UNITED NATIONS HEAD: Kay.
KYLE'S MOTHER: I would like to state that Canada must learn to stop infiltrating our country with its graphic art!
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR: Last time I checked America was a free country!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Look at this!
KYLE'S MOTHER: This woman's child was KILLED by your country's humor! Look how upset she is!
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR: We will continue to sell Terrance and Phillip videos to anyone retarded enough to buy it!!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Then you leave me no choice... I call for an EMBARGO on ALL Canadian Imports!!!
CARTMAN: What the hell do you mean I can't get Cheesy Poofs?!
BOB: Sorry, kid. Cheesy Poofs are a Canadian export. We can't carry them any more.
KYLE: Who the hell made up that law?!
CARTMAN: You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
BOB: There's nothing I can do. I can still sell you Cheese-o's.
CARTMAN: FUCK Cheese-os and FUCK you!
CARTMAN: Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
STAN: About what?
CARTMAN: About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
KYLE: I don't really think you need Cheesy- Poofs, tubby-
KYLE'S MOTHER: Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
KYLE: We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
STAN: Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and Phillip?
STAN'S MOTHER: Stanly, you're too young to understand what's good for you. That's why we mothers have taken charge.
KYLE: But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
CARTMAN: Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
KYLE'S MOTHER: What was that word, young man!?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
KYLE'S MOTHER: I know what it is!
CARTMAN: (To his mother) Lick someone's ass?!
KYLE'S MOTHER: The Terrance and Phillip movie has obviously done irreparable damage to their brains.  We have to put them in rehab right away.
KYLE: What's that?
KYLE'S MOTHER: You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
STAN'S MOTHER: There are?
KYLE'S MOTHER: Well no, I guess not...  But we will establish the first of its kind right here in South Park.  All the children in town will have to attend and receive treatment from the school counselor Mr. Mackey!  Ooh I just love when I get these sorts of ideas!
CARTMAN: Why?  So you can fuck up our life some more?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
CARTMAN: But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
KENNY: Mphrmo?
SATAN: Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
SATAN: I am Satan. I am your God, now.
SATAN: Come with me. I will show you what delightful pain awaits.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
SATAN: You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
MR. MACKEY: Mkay, it's come to my attention, that you boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay. Now the sooner you recognize your problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you back to your third grade homeroom where you belong.
KYLE: But they're just words, Mr. Mackey. Our parents are over-reacting.
BEBE: Yeah, Wendy's here, and she doesn't even like Terrance and Phillip!
CARTMAN: Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
MR. MACKEY: Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
GREGORY: My name is Gregory... And I have a potty mouth.
CARTMAN: You've got a stupid accent too.
MR. MACKEY: Eric, that is not appropriate.
CARTMAN: What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
MR. MACKEY: Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
GREGORY: How are you gonna do that?
MR. MACKEY: There are times when you get suckered in, by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en. But it's when you do these things too much (Singing)
That you've got to clear your head: and get back in touch...
MR. MACKEY: mkay? With a method, there's nothing you can't do, mkay? You don't have to spend your life addicted to crack Homeless on the streets giving hand- jobs for cash as long as you follow this simple plan I'm fully convinced that it's, easy, mkay...
MR. MACKEY: about all that you'll miss addicted to this Step two: Think it all through. Think how's this gonna change my life, what am I gonna miss? Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug anything that gets in your way! And step four: Just don't do it anymore - it's easy, Mkay!
MR. MACKEY: Come on, kids! Sing along!
KIDS: (Extremely half-assed)
You can do it, it's all up to you: mkay? With a method, there's nothing you can't do, mkay? We don't have to spend our lives addicted to crack Homeless on the streets giving hand- jobs for cash
MR. MACKEY: plan I'm fully convinced that it's, easy, mkay...
KIDS: about all that you'll miss addicted to this Step two: Think it all through. Think how's this gonna change my life, what am I gonna miss? Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug anything that gets in your way! And step four: Just don't do it anymore - it's easy, Mkay!
MR. MACKEY: It's easy, Mkay?!
KYLE'S MOTHER: What the hell do they think this is?! Summer camp?!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Mr. Mackey, what is going on?!
MR. MACKEY: Uh, we're just, starting our program...
KYLE'S MOTHER: This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
MR. MACKEY: Mkay.
CARTMAN: God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
NEWS REPORTER: Tom I'm standing in front of the U.S. Supreme Court where the most important trial of the - day - is happening. Thousands of people have shown up from all over the country to show their outrage and disgust at Canada. Joining me now is Mrs. McKormick, mother of the poor little boy who was killed by the Canadians.
NEWS REPORTER: Mrs. McKormick, you must really hate the Canadians.
KENNY'S MOTHER: Yes, yes I do, Tom.
NEWS REPORTER: Did you ever think you would see the day when thousands of people were wearing your son Kenny on T-shirts?
KENNY'S MOTHER: No I didn't. But if any of you would like one they're 14.95. Available in blue or white.
NEWS REPORTER: Well, we can only imagine the intense, vehement trial that is going on inside.
JOHNNY COCHRAN: Terrance and Phillip... You knowingly, with malice of forethought were trying to destroy American culture, yes or no?
STAN: Shh! Mr. Mackey's gonna hear us!
TERRANCE: The Americans are just showing their TRUE COLORS as smelly bastards.
PHILLIP: Fight the power!
TERRANCE: The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
PHILLIP: Don't believe the hype!!
KIDS: (Adlib) Yeah! WooHoo!
TERRANCE: You cannot oppress us! We will continue to pursue our art. We know there are Americans out there who will help us!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Your 'ART' is shallow and immature! We Americans do NOT allow that for our children!!
PHILLIP: Please. You teach your children that America is the land of the free. But it's all bullshit. You're one of the most conservative countries in the world!
TERRANCE: The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
PHILLIP: Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
TERRANCE: WAKE UP AMERICA! YOUR government censors YOU from the world.
KYLE: What happened?
WENDY: The station CONVENIENTLY went blank.
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: ATTENTION AMERICA!! You have taken our national treasure Terrance and Phillip. We, in turn, have taken yours... The Smothers Brothers!
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: I'll let you catch your breath... Now, release Terrance and Phillip, or else we will EXECUTE your beloved Smothers Brothers!!
TOMMY SMOTHERS: Please listen to them!!
DICK SMOTHERS: They're not fucking around!!
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: We're not fucking around. This is not aboot deals. This aboot dignity. This is aboot freedom... This is aboot respect. RETURN Terrance and Phillip NOW!!!
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: Oh yeah... AND FUCK YOU, AMERICA!
MR. MACKEY: Okay kids, for today's rehabilitation activity, we're going to watch the Terrance and Phillip movie.
STAN: What?!
KYLE: Sweet!
MR. MACKEY: Now, this is an EDITED version of the movie, which was put out by the MPAA. That's the Motion Picture Association of America.
WENDY: Isn't that censorship?
MR. MACKEY: No the MPAA is NOT a censorship group.
WENDY: Why not?
MR. MACKEY: Uh... Because they say so... Mkay. Now I want you to watch this movie, with all the immature profanity taken out, and notice how much better a movie it becomes...
DUBBED PHILLIP: Hey Terrance. I feel like I'm going to pass gas near your head.
DUBBED TERRANCE: I would rather you didn't, Phillip.
DUBBED PHILLIP: Oh? Is that so?
TERRANCE: Oh, you are such a maroon!
PHILLIP: You would know, dummy.
TERRANCE: You are pigeon-like in your intelligence.
KYLE: Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
MR. MACKEY: So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
CARTMAN: Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
MR. MACKEY: Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
CARTMAN: You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
MR. MACKEY: Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
CARTMAN: Help yourself prickfuck!
MR. MACKEY: I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
CARTMAN: Ha, ha, you stupid asshole prickfuck.
KYLE'S MOTHER: How is the children's progress?
MR. MACKEY: Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
KYLE'S MOTHER: What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
MR. MACKEY: (Nervous) Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
KYLE'S MOTHER: Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
MR. MACKEY: Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
KYLE'S MOTHER: (Evil) I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
MR. MACKEY: (Nervous) Alright, I'll make the call...
JUDGE: Madam foreman, have you reached a verdict?
FOREMAN: We have, your honor.
JUDGE: How find you, the jury?
FOREMAN: We the jury, find the defendants... Terrance and Phillip... GUILTY of being complete bastards.
KYLE: Oh no!
TERRANCE: Oh oh, Phillip. You know what this means?
PHILLIP: We'll be farting bread and water for a few years.
JUDGE: Terrance and Phillip, for crimes against the great nation of America you are hereby sentenced to DEATH.
TERRANCE: DEATH?! You gotta be shittin' me!
PHILLIP: Aghgh!
KYLE: Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
STAN: How do we do that?
WENDY: You raise awareness by distributing buttons, stickers and leaflets.
CARTMAN: That'd be sweet! We could try to bring back Cheesy Poofs!
KYLE: Yeah, let's make Free Terrance and Phillip buttons!
WENDY: You guys don't even care. All you care about is seeing Terrance and Phillip fart on each other more.
STAN: Yeah!
WENDY: This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
GREGORY: Yes, what's next? Barcodes on our forearms? This country is the most fascist of all.
STAN: What the hell are you talking about, kid?
WENDY: You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
STAN: What? What don't I get? (To Kyle) What don't I get?
KYLE: I don't know, dude.
STAN: That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
KYLE: I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
STAN: She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
MR. MACKEY: Mkay, children, you've all made terrific progress, and are hereby done with the eight step program.
CARTMAN: Thank God, that sucked ass.
MR. MACKEY: Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
CARTMAN: The N word?
MR. MACKEY: (Reading) Norwegian Ass Raper.
CARTMAN: Oh yeah.
MR. MACKEY: The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
CARTMAN: I don't graduate?! WHAT THE FUCK IS
MR. MACKEY: Free Terrance and Phillip? Oh no... Mkay.
KYLE: (Proudly) We're protesting!
STAN: Yeah!
MR. MACKEY: Well, boys, it might interest you to know that your FRIENDS the Canadians have just bombed the U.S.
STAN: They did?!
MR. MACKEY: Yes, at six this morning they bombed the heck out of Cleveland.
KYLE: Oh. That doesn't count.
WENDY: They only bombed Cleveland because we're going to Execute two of their citizens!!
MR. MACKEY: Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
MR. MACKEY: No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
SATAN: Prepare thyself for unending pain! Unparalleled misery!!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
KENNY: Mrph mprph!!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
KENNY: Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o' fun.
SATAN: (To Saddam) Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
KENNY: Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
SATAN: Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
KENNY: Mrph?
SADDAM HUSSEIN: I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: (To Kenny) Well what are you waiting for pal?!  Get to it!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: HA HA HAHA!! What a dumbass!!
SATAN: I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
SATAN: Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Hey, come here, guy.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Who's my cream puff?
SATAN: I am.
MOTHER: Is that a new pearl bracelet, Mrs. McKormick?
KENNY'S MOTHER: Why yes. Yes it is.
KYLE'S MOTHER: As our next official order of business here at M.A.C., we will test the new V- chip. As most of you know, the V-chip was created to lock children out of watching certain shows on television. And now the N.I.H. has created a new, exciting product that they can tell us all about. Here is the Surgeon General, Dr. Pangloss.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: Thank you, parents.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: The machinery of the new 'V-chip' is very simple, and similar to that of the V- chip. The chip is placed just under the subject's skin, where it emits a small but painful shock of electricity whenever an obscenity is uttered.
STAN'S FATHER: Now wait a minute, are you telling us that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid is swearing?
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: It's just like a lie detector. Certain things happen in you when you swear just like when you lie, the chip picks up on this and gives the subject a shock.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: We are very excited to see the results of this test. (Calling) Patient 453, would you step out here, please?
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
CARTMAN: My head hurts.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
CARTMAN: Doggy.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: Notice that nothing happens. (To Cartman) Now say 'Montana.'
CARTMAN: Montana.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: Good. Now 'Pillow'.
CARTMAN: Pillow.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Go ahead, it's alright, Eric.
CARTMAN: Horsefuck-
CARTMAN: OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
KYLE'S MOTHER: And so we have succesfully removed the Canadian smut from all of our children's brains. We have made changes at school to ensure that our kids are NEVER AGAIN exposed to smut!!!!!!! It's OVER!
STAN: Hi Wendy.
WENDY: (Not even looking) Hi Stan.
KYLE: Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
STAN: (Eyes still on Wendy) I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
KYLE: Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
KYLE: Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
STAN: What's the difference?
CARTMAN: Very funny dickhead-
KYLE: Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
STAN: Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
KYLE: Hey Cartman.
CARTMAN: What?
KYLE: You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
CARTMAN: Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
KYLE: This is sweet!!
STAN: Totally!
MR. GARRISON: Okay, children, let's try a few new math problems. What is five times two?
MR. GARRISON: Come on, children, do be shy, just give it your best shot.
MR. GARRISON: Yes, Clyde?
CLYDE: Twelve?
MR. GARRISON: Okay, now let's try to get an answer from somebody who's not a complete retard. Anyone? Come on don't be shy...
STAN: Hey, what are you doing?
SOLDIER: You can't wear these in school. It's against school policy, thank you.
KYLE: What's that for?
SOLDIER 2: You get a star for doing well in school.
STAN: What's the matter, Wendy?
WENDY: Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
STAN: (To Kyle) God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
STAN: I'm so sick of these soldiers.
KYLE: Yeah, they suck.
CARTMAN: I know.  Always saying, do this, do that. They think they're so cooool. (To the soldier) Acht lieben kraft auct shpiler!
CHEF: Hello there, children!!
STAN: Hey, Chef.
CHEF: How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
KYLE: We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
CHEF: A hunger strike? For what?
STAN: To free Terrance and Phillip.
CARTMAN: But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
STAN: Chef, do you know anything about women?
CHEF: Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
KYLE: I don't know.
CHEF: Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
STAN: What's the secret to making a woman happy?
CHEF: (Dishing out food) Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
STAN: Huh?
CHEF: Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
STAN: No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
CARTMAN: Is that like finding Jesus or something?
CHEF: Uh... Nothing. Forget I said anything. Now move along, children! You're holding up the line!
STAN: Woa, I wonder what's going on, dude.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Please take your seats, everyone!!!!
KYLE: What's going on, Chef?
CHEF: Something big, children.
NEWS ANCHOR: (Very serious) This is a State of Emergency. We go now to the White House for a VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT from the President of the United States.
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Ladies and gentlemen... At five a.m. today, a day which will live in infamy... sort of... the U.S. has declared war on Canada.
CHEF: Oh, no...
MR. MACKEY: I don't believe it.
CARTMAN: Holy crap-
(BZZZT!): OW!! Hey crap isn't a swear word, what the fuck?!
PRESIDENT CLINTON: All Canadians are to leave the country immediately, or be subject to military camps. All Canadian products are to be thrown out.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: How can they do this?
MR. GARRISON: I never thought there would be war again in my lifetime...
PRESIDENT CLINTON: Do not be afraid of this war. Instead embrace it. We have God on our side. And besides, they're just Canadians, what the hell are they gonna do?
STAN: Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
CHEF: It's... It's not good children.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: What do we do? Do we go on as normal or...?
MR. GARRISON: I don't know Principal Victoria... I don't know...
PRESIDENT: And now, I would like to bring up the woman who led, and is still leading the way in this glorious stand-
KYLE: (Pointing to TV)
PRESIDENT: Mrs. Sheila Brovlofski.
CHEF: Isn't that your mother, Kyle?
KYLE'S MOTHER: My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
PRESIDENT: As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
KYLE'S MOTHER: What about air strikes?
PRESIDENT: Huh?
KYLE'S MOTHER: We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
PRESIDENT: Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
KYLE'S MOTHER: Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want...
CHEF: Damn, your mom's a bitch, Kyle.
CARTMAN: Amen to that.
KENNY: Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
GEORGE BURNS: Snacky Smores? Why the hell would I have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores? Beat it, kid.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
SATAN: I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
TV: In war news, countries from Europe and Asia are joining sides in the Canadian- American War-
SADDAM HUSSEIN: -Listen butterbuns, let's make love and forget about the whole thing-
TV: ...The death count is already on its way to 10 million with no signs of slowing down.  What started as a spat between the United States and Canada is quickly turning into World War III-
SATAN: It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
SATAN: No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
SATAN: Behold, the signs of my reign on earth are all falling into place!  The fall of an empire-
SATAN: -The coming of a comet-
SATAN: Jerry Springer's movie doing more than ten million box office-
SATAN: ....And now....
SATAN: The seventh sign!  When the blood of these Canadians touches American soil... It will be my time to rise!!!!!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
SATAN: Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
SATAN: Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
SADDAM HUSSEIN: I love you.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: You know I do.
SATAN: I know.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Yeah, you like that, don't you bitch?
KYLE: Does it say what the clitoris is?
STAN: All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
KYLE: Isn't that in Arizona or something?
STAN: What is this?
CARTMAN: They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
STAN: That book wasn't Canadian!
KYLE: Dude, don't you like Terrance and Phillip anymore?
CLYDE: Of course not! We're at war! My daddy says I HATE Canadians now!
CARTMAN: This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-
(BBBZAATT!!): AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
KYLE: And she's getting worse...
STAN: Dude... Isn't that your brother?
FIFTH GRADER: Why don't you go back to your own country, CANADIAN!
FIFTH GRADER 2: Yeah, go eat some potatoes and ride donkeys!
IKE: Eee todo ba!
KYLE: Hey! Leave him alone!
FIFTH GRADER: It's just a smelly Canadian. They're like rats.
KYLE: He's my brother!
FIFTH GRADER: You don't look Canadian.
KYLE: He's adopted!
FIFTH GRADER: Well you better get his beady eyed Canadian ass out of America before my daddy finds him!!
KYLE: It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
STAN: What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
CARTMAN: -no Cheesy Poofs.
STAN: -No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
KYLE: I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it! (Singing)
Something must be done!: Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!
STAN: I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight! (Singing)
Something must be done!: We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!
CARTMAN: that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!
STAN: But what are we going to do against this entire army?
KYLE: We've gotta get the word out. We'll get on my dad's computer and use the internet! Come on you guys!
BOYS: Something's gotta give! This world has become a bitch in which we have no desire to live!
BOYS: And now the time has come! Something's gotta change! Something must be done! Something must be done!!!
KYLE: Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
STAN: Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
KYLE: Okay...
KYLE: (Reading the screen) "Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
STAN: Wow!
KYLE: I'll just try the first one.
KYLE: Dude! It's a lady giving a blow job to a horse!
STAN: Is it Cartman's mom?
CARTMAN: Very funny!

IKE: Papa mama simi.
CARTMAN: Come on, just get to the message board!
KYLE: I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
KYLE: Damn it! They've got an access code! I'll try to reroute the encryptions...
STAN: Dude, do you know what you're doing?
KYLE: No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
KYLE: Bingo. Okay, here we go... (Typing) Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
CARTMAN: Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
KYLE: We're not gonna have pie and punch!
CARTMAN: More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
KYLE: (Typing) pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
STAN: (Dramatically) La Resistance.
KYLE: You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
IKE: Uhh...
KYLE: Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Sir! The Canadians have destroyed Des Moines!!
PRESIDENT: How can you tell?
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Good one, sir!
PENTAGON GUY: Sir, we're tracking a signal crossing into Canadian computers! It looks like we may have a resistance movement starting...
PRESIDENT: (Showing her the papers) Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
KYLE'S MOTHER: Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
PRESIDENT: Yes ma'am!
KYLE'S MOTHER: And Bill?
PRESIDENT: Yes?
KYLE'S MOTHER: I'm needing lunch.
PRESIDENT: Right away, ma'am!

CARTMAN: Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
CARTMAN: Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Oh.
CARTMAN: Mom...
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Yes, hon?
CARTMAN: If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Sure, hon. Goodnight.
CARTMAN: Go away, scary noise.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
CARTMAN: I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
CARTMAN: I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!
(BZZTZT!): AGH! I can't say pissed off?!
SATAN: The execution of Terrance and Phillip is imminent, soon all hell shall rise!!
SATAN: (Evil and scary) Are you afraid, little one? Afraid for the souls of your pitiful friends that-
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Hey Satan!  I got some great new home furnishings today!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Boy buddy Rich, it was a bitch to get something to match with that bathroom tile!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Oh, hey kid. Find those proofs of purchases yet? No?! Gee, whatta surprise! Well, keep lookin!
SATAN: Do you wanna know what
SADDAM HUSSEIN: What did you do today Satan?
SATAN: You don't care.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
SATAN: Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
SATAN: Don't call me dumb!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
SATAN: How come you always want to make love to me from behind? Is it because you want to pretend I'm somebody else?
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Satan, your ass is gigantic and red, who am I gonna pretend you are? Helen Reddy?
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Come on, kid. Help me with these shower curtains.
SATAN: (Gently)
Sometimes I think: When I look up real high That there's a whole world up there And just maybe it could be mine But then, I sink because it's here I'm supposed to stay but I don't even know how or why its supposed to be that way-
SATAN: Where babies burp and flowers bloom Everyone dreams I can dream too Up there, Up where The skies are ocean blue I could be safe and live without a care... Up there
SATAN: That my place is down below Because of my beliefs I'm supposed to stay where evil is sewn But what is evil anyway? Is there reason to the rhyme? Without evil there could be no good So it must be good to be evil sometimes Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom. Everyone dreams I can dream too Up there, Up where The skies are ocean blue I could be safe and life without a care... Up there
KYLE: You're late, Cartman!
CARTMAN: I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
KYLE: Your behind?
CARTMAN: I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-
KYLE: Did you bring the pie and punch?
CARTMAN: No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy? (Looking over each shoulder) I don't think Kenny is dead.
STAN: What?
CARTMAN: I saw him last night!
KYLE: I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.

STAN: Oh no, it's that kid.
GREGORY: This is the place--
STAN: Wendy?
WENDY: Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
GREGORY: Well, apparently you have a bigger heart than we thought. Let us get this meeting underway, there are others coming.
STAN: Everyone be seated, please.
KYLE: Wow, a lot of people showed up.
STAN: Yeah, so what do we say?
KYLE: I thought you had something planned.
STAN: Me?!
STAN: (Nervous) Kay. Uh... Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be killed, and we think that sucks ass!!
STAN: Uhh... So we think we should prank call a bunch of policemen! We can have pizzas sent to them that they didn't order! VIVA
STAN: Uhh...
GREGORY: May I?
STAN: What?
GREGORY: Terrance and Phillip are currently being held at a Canadian Internment camp two kilometers outside of town. They are to be executed tomorrow during a star-studded USO show for the troops.
GREGORY: We must sneak into the camp through this duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip inside... The war is escalating, and the American forces are preparing for a large scale attack on Canada. That means the time is now...
KYLE: Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.
GREGORY: This is a dangerous mission, so I'll go myself.
STAN: No!
STAN: WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
GREGORY: This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
CARTMAN: Fuck that!
STAN: We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
JIMBO: Oh, I'm so glad there's a war again. I was gettin' worried I'd never see another one!
NED: I know what you mean.
JIMBO: And they're giving all us troops a big USO tomorrow with celebrities and executions!

MR. HAT: You do too, Mr. Garrison.
MR. GARRISON: Boy, I can't wait for our first shore- leave so I can go get me some poontang.
GENERAL PLYMKIN: It's no secret that the Evil Canadian Federation has scored major victories all over the United State.  We have brought you here because you ar America's best, and last hope.
GENERAL PLYMKIN: Oh... Apparently you're not the best, you're simply the last. Anyway, let's strategize... Map!
GENERAL PLYMKIN: Our sources have told us that the Canadians might try to attach tomorrow's USO show and stop us from executing Terrance and Phillip.
GENERAL PLYMKIN: Now each battalion has a specific code- name and mission.  Battalion 5, raise your hands-
GENERAL PLYMKIN: You will be the all-important first defense wave, which we will call 'Operation Human Shield'.
CHEF: Hey, wait a minute...
GENERAL PLYMKIN: Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human Shield' will suffer heavy losses.  But don't lose your spirit men!  Stay until the bitter end.  Battalion 14?
GENERAL PLYMKIN: Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The Darkies'.  You will follow Battalion 5 here-
GENERAL PLYMKIN: -and try not to get killed for God's Sake.  Are there any questions men?
GENERAL PLYMKIN: Yes soldier?
CHEF: Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?
GENERAL PLYMKIN: I don't listen to hip-hop.
GENERAL PLYMKIN: If you somehow live, we will regroup on this hill outside--
GENERAL PLYMKIN: Now what's wrong with this thing?
GENERAL PLYMKIN: Fucking windows 98!
BILL GATES: It is faster, over five million--
GENERAL PLYMKIN: Alright men, get lots of rest, and prepare thyselves for battle!
GREGORY: ...after you clear this zone here, rendezvous behind this ridge where Terrance and Phillip should be held.
KYLE: Gotcha.
GREGORY: You are indeed brave, but you will need someone who's done this sort of thing before.  MOLE!

THE MOLE: Freedom... It's like cow's urine poured down your troat. You wonder 'Do I want this?' I'm thersty... But it's urine.
GREGORY: Good luck Stan, I'll make sure Wendy is... kept safe?
KYLE: Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me death!!!
GREGORY: The fate of a nation in your hands...
GREGORY: And behind you we shall fight! Until only the most righteous belief stands!

KYLE'S MOTHER: Oh.
CHEF: Oh, good job, Mrs. Broflofski, thanks a lot.
KYLE'S MOTHER: I... I was just trying to make the world a better place for children...
SATAN: Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
KYLE'S MOTHER: And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
KYLE'S MOTHER: Oh God... What have I done...
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Hey, I'm missing the party!
SATAN: No! It can't be!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Did you miss me, buttercup? (Yelling out) All right, gang! I am your new ruler now! Everyone bow down to ME!!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Oh, it's the bratty kid from hell.
KYLE: You made a deal with Kenny that if he got ten proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores you'd grant him any wish.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: And?
SATAN: I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
KYLE: What?
SADDAM HUSSEIN: The deal's off, go away, guy.
SATAN: No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Now, let's start torturing people, shall we? We'll start with... (Looks at Cartman) THIS little fat kid first!!
CARTMAN: AY!  Don't call me fat, buttfucker-
STAN: Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
CARTMAN: How the fuck should I know!!
KYLE: Look at that!
CHEF: It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
TERRANCE: Oh boy!
CARTMAN: Yes!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Quick, Satan!  Do something!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Hey, you need to watch your mouth, brat!
CARTMAN: Try this on for size-
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Hey buddy!  No need to stress! Let me make you a deal!  How about a lifetime supply of Snacky Smores and we just forget about this whole thing?!

SATAN: Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
SATAN: If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
SATAN: I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
SATAN: Ow, you're hurting me!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.

PHILLIP: You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
TERRANCE: Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
CARTMAN: Well, I learned it all from you guys.
PHILLIP: Of course you did, cock fuck!
SATAN: He spent so much time convincing me I was weak and stupid that I believed it myself.
SATAN: Saddam didn't respect me.  All he wanted was sex.  But it took me so long to figure that out.
CHEF: Here you go Satan-
SATAN: Thank you. Give me the proofs of purchases.
SATAN: Okay Kenny, I will keep the bargain. Any wish you want is yours.
KENNY: Mph rmph rmpg rmph mm.
STAN: Are you sure, Kenny?
SATAN: What did he say?
STAN: He said that his wish is for everyone who died in the war to come back.
CHEF: Kenny, you realize this wish is the only chance for YOU not to be dead...
KENNY: M mprh. Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm. Mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm.
SATAN: Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
KENNY: Mph rm.
SATAN: I must admit, I'm kind of relieved. It's too fucking cold up here.
STAN: Aren't there cold parts of hell?
SATAN: Yeah, but it's a real dry cold. Here it's the humidity that gets me. I guess I'm destined to live in hell... alone...
SATAN: Hello... What's this?
SATAN: Hi there, little guy... Would you like to go to hell with me?
SATAN (AS MR. HAT): Sure. I bet we can be best friends!
KYLE: Thank you, Kenny.
STAN: Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
MR. GARRISON: I... I'm alive... Where's Mr. Hat?
BIG GAY AL: Wow... We were all killed and now we're fine. That's super!
KYLE: Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
STAN: Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
CARTMAN: Yeah! You're all a bunch of stupid sons a bitches!
STAN: Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
