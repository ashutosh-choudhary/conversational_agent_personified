SERIAL MOM: by John Waters Second Draft:  July 22, 1992
MOM: Who wants fruit salad?
MISTY: I do, please.
MOM: (Hesitating) That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
MISTY: (Removing it) It's sugarless.
MOM: (Gently) You know how I hate gum, Misty.  All that chomping and cheesing... (Begins serving her)
MISTY: Sorry, Mom.  Thanks. (To her brother, as she prices a record album) Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
CHIP: I wouldn't give ya a nickle.
MISTY: (Dreamily) Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
MOM: (Rolling her eyes good-naturedly) And who may I ask is Carl?
MISTY: Just a boy.  He's picking me up this morning.
CHIP: Here we go again.
MISTY: He's
MOM: (Watching the cute little birds nibbling seed from the bird-feeder in kitchen window) Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
CHIP: She sure can pick 'em!
MISTY: (Exasperated) He goes to college with me!
DAD: Leave her alone, Chip. (To MOM) I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
MOM: Cereal anybody?
DAD: Just a little, please.  Bad for the teeth.
CHIP: Always the dentist.
MOM: Chip, honey?
CHIP: Thanks, Mom.
DAD: (Reading paper) Look at this! (Reading out loud in disgust) "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
MOM: (Preoccupied, stalking fly) That's nice.
DAD: Nice?!  He should have been executed!
MISTY: He
MOM: (To herself) We all have bad nights. (Gets ready to swat, but fly buzzes off)
CHIP: (To MISTY) You'd probably date him! (Mimicking her) He's cu-uuute!  Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
DAD: I certainly did not.
MISTY: You've been working in that video shop too long.
DAD: And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
CHIP: I do great in school, Dad. (Eats toast as fly buzzes off)
DAD: Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. (Takes a big gulp as fly buzzes away)
CHIP: (Giving a pleading look to MOM as the buzzing of the fly builds in intensity on the soundtrack) Aw, Mom!  I hate Mr. Stubbins!
MOM: (Moving in for the kill, hissing the words in a rage) Don't say the word "hate", honey. "Hate" is a very serious word!
MOM: There.  All better. (Suddenly all innocence) Anybody for scrambled eggs?
DAD: (Getting up from table) Who on earth...?
DET. MOORE: Mrs. Sutphin?
MOM: (Nervously) Yes?
DET. MOORE: (Shows badge) I'm Detective Moore and this is Detective Bradford.
DAD: (Taking over) I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin.  What's the trouble, officer?
CHIP: (Excitedly) Is there a killer loose?
DET. MOORE: No son, nothing that exciting.
MOM: This is my son, Chip...and my daughter, Misty.
MISTY: (Inappropriately making eyes at the younger cop) Hi!
CHIP: (Seeing MISTY flirting) Jeeezzz!
MOM: Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. (Hands him a paper napkin)
DET. BRADFORD: (Spitting his gum into paper napkin) Sorry, ma'am. (To MOM and DAD, taking out an envelope) We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
MOM: I know Dottie!
DAD: She lives right down the street.
DET. BRADFORD: Could you take a look at this...
DET. MOORE: ...And tell us of anybody who might be responsible?
DET. BRADFORD: (As he hands note to MOM and DAD) I should warn you...this note contains LANGUAGE.
MOM: (Recoiling) Oh God, really! (Hands it back to cop) This is the limit!
CHIP: Let me see!
DAD: Sorry, son. (In disgust) This is a matter for adults.
MOM: Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
DAD: No
MOM: (Seeing cute little bird land on window feeder) Look officers!  Life doesn't have to be ugly. (In baby-talk) See the little birdie?  Listen to his call. (Imitating bird call) Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!
BIRD: Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!
MOM: Chip, your ride is here.
DAD: (Looking at his watch) Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. (Kisses MOM goodbye)
DET. MOORE: Thanks for your time, everybody.
MISTY: (Sighing) Bye, Detective Moore.
BIRDIE: (Leaping out of convertible) Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Sutphin.
DAD: (To cops, getting into his car) That's Birdie.  She's a horror nut just like my son.
MOM: (Fondly) Good morning, Birdie.  This is Detectives Moore and Bradford.
BIRDIE: (Overdramatic, feigning horror) I didn't do it!  I swear!  Don't lock me up!  I'll take a lie detector! (Kisses CHIP) (Good-naturedly to COPS) Hi ya, boys!
MOM: (Sarcastically to a sullen SCOTTY in car) Good morning Scotty!
BIRDIE: Hey Misty, look what I got! (Pulling it out of bag) A Pee Wee Herman Doll.  Can you sell it for me at the flea market?
MISTY: (Impressed) Wow!  Still in the box!  I sure can! (Looks up and sees a Trans Am speeding towards the house) Oh God, here comes Carl!
CARL: (To MOM) You must be Mrs. Sutphin. I'm Carl Padgett.
MOM: Misty's date...
CARL: More of a friend really...
MISTY: (To CARL) See what Birdie gave me to sell at the flea market?
CARL: (Sneering at Pee-Wee) That guy's a weirdo.
MOM: (Pointing to SCOTTY and calling out to COPS as they get into their car) Now there's something you should be interested in, detectives.  A grown boy who doesn't wear his seat belts!
DET. BRADFORD: (Once again chewing gum) Christ, that one was Beaver Cleaver's mother. (Imitating her) Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!
DET. MOORE: (Good-naturedly) Oh, leave her alone.  Mrs. Sutphin's about as normal and nice a lady we're ever going to find.
DOTTIE: (Angrily) Hello.
MOM: (Speaking in disguised voice) Is this the Cocksucker residence?
DOTTIE: (Rising to the bait every time) Goddamn you!  STOP CALLING HERE!
MOM: Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
DOTTIE: (Furious) You bitch!
MOM: Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
DOTTIE: The police are tracing your call right this minute.
MOM: Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
DOTTIE: (Red with rage)
FUCK YOU!: (Slams down phone)
MRS. ACKERMAN: (Calling out) Beverly?  Beverly darling? You home? (She lets herself in) I know you are...
DOTTIE: (Answering)
MOM: (Disguising her voice in prim manner) I beg your pardon?
DOTTIE: (Horrified but suspicious) Who is this?
MOM: Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company.  I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
DOTTIE: (Mortified) Yes, I am...I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson.. It's driving me crazy...I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
MOM: (Still the fake telephone company representative) What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
DOTTIE: I can't say it out loud. don't use bad language.
MOM: (Still impersonating) I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
DOTTIE: Alright, I'll try... (Primly) "Cocksucker".  That's what she calls me.
MOM: (Laughs hideously, begins speaking in her scary voice) Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
DOTTIE: (Ballistic)
MOM: (Slams down phone)
MRS. ACKERMAN: Beverly, are you alright?
MOM: Rosemary, honey.  Good morning. I'm fine. (Taking the sewing basket) Thanks for remembering.
MRS. ACKERMAN: It's the least I could do. (Suspicious) I heard shouting.
MOM: (Slamming it shut) Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
MRS. ACKERMAN: Yes, I did.  It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
MOM: Who on earth would want to harrass poor Dottie Hinkle?
MRS. TAPLOTTER: But, Mr. Stubbins, my son studies every night!  He's trying as hard as he can...
MR. STUBBINS: Some teenagers just aren't college material, Mrs, Taplotter.  It's nothing to cry over.  Now, there are other parents waiting. (Smugly) ...thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
MRS. STERNER: Hi, Beverly.
MOM: Hi, Betty.  Oh, I love your outfit.
MRS. STERNER: Thanks. (Snobbily) It's a Liz Claiborne.
MR. STERNER: Mrs. Sutphin, where's that husband of yours? (Making a bad dental joke and pointing to his teeth) Feeling "down in the mouth"?! Hohohohohoho!
MOM: (Smiling through her teeth) You're soooo funny, Ralph...
MR. STUEBINS: Mrs...Sutphin?
MOM: (Excited) Right here!
MR. STUBBINS: Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
MOM: (Shaking hands) Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins. (Handing him a tin) A little something I baked.
MR. STUBBINS: (Peeking inside) Oooohh!  A fruit cake.  Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin.  Have a seat.
MOM: Bon Appetit!
MR. STUBBINS: Chip is off to a fine start this year. (Checking his roll book) Focused...conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
MOM: (Proudly) He's a good boy.
MR. STUBBINS: (Suddenly serious) There is one big problem though.
MOM: What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
MR. STUBBINS: (Spitting out the words) His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
MOM: (Relieved) He is assistant manager of a video shop...
MR. STUBBINS: (Cutting her off) That's no excuse for a morbid imagination.  I caught him drawing this in class last week. (Unfolds lurid drawing of woman getting her tongue pulled out with the title, "Blood Feast") Is there a problem at home?
MOM: (Shocked) Certainly not!
MR. STUBBINS: Divorce?  An alcoholic relative? (Knowingly) Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
MOM: (Furious) No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
MR. STUBBINS: Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin.  I'd recommend therapy for your son. (Rising from his chair) Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
BIRDIE: It's a sheep's tongue!
SCOTTY: Man, I just ate.  Turn it off.
CHIP: Rewind it!  Let's see it again!
SCOTTY: No!  That shit is sickening! Put on pussy!
BIRDIE: (Torturing SCOTTY) Look, Dick-Head! (Gore scene replays)
BIRDIE: (Looking at screen)
CHIP: (Proudly) The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
MOM: I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
SCOTTY: (Gagging) Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
CHIP: Hi, Mom.
BIRDIE: Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
MOM: (Giggles) You kids.  Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
CHIP: But Mom, the video's not over.
MOM: No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. (Turns off video with remote)
BIRDIE: (Rolling her eyes) Oh, boy! (Getting ready to leave)
CHIP: Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
SCOTTY: Man, that one made me puke!
MOM: (Picking up SCOTTY's nudist camp magazine and handing it back to him like it's poison) You forgot something...
SCOTTY: (Looking around confused) Are we leaving?
MOM: Yes you are.
BIRDIE: Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
CHIP: (Affectionately) Bye, bird-brain,  See ya, Scotty.
MOM: Bye, Birdie. (Sitting down next to CHIP on his bed) Chip, honey...I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand.. I'm your mother and I love you.
CHIP: Oh Mom...
MOM: (Suddenly his buddy) Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart? (Giggling scarily)
MOM: (Jokingly) Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
CHIP: Looks good, Mom!
DAD: Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
MOM: Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... (Passes it to her)
MISTY: Yummy.  Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
MOM: (Appalled) Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
CHIP: Carl's a jerk!
DAD: He certainly
MISTY: (Getting upset) Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
DAD: Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
MOM: I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
CHIP: (Mockingly) I'm so happy I could shit.
MOM: CHIP!  You know how much I hate the brown word!
MOM: That's Rosemary.  Something's wrong!
MRS. ACKERMAN: Turn on the news! (To CHIP) A teacher at your school has been murdered!
MISTY: (Appalled) Murdered?
CHIP: Who?
MRS. ACKERMAN: A Mr. Stubber...or Stubbins.
CHIP: (Horrified) MR. STUBBINS?  That's my math teacher!
DAD: What channel?
MRS. ACKERMAN: It's on all of them!
CHIP: Hello.
BIRDIE: (Excited) Did you hear?
CHIP: What happened?
BIRDIE: This is a horror movie.
CHIP: It's on!  I'll call you back! (Hangs up)
ANNOUNCER: ..Police claim the driver of the hit and run vehicle ran down the teacher in cold blood and then backed up over his body to finish off the job. Mr. Paul Stubbins was thirty-eight years old...
DAD: (Mad) Whoever did it should get the death penalty!
ANNOUNCER: ...So far only one eyewitness has surfaced.
LUANN: It was a blue car...I know that much!
CHIP: That's Lu-Ann Hodges!
MISTY: She's a pothead!
LUANN: ...A blue station wagon...
MRS. ACKERMAN: That's like your car, Beverly,
MOM: (Glaring at MRS. ACKERMAN) I'm not that bad a driver. (Disapprovingly at TV screen) Look at her hair! (To CHIP) Turn it off, honey.
CHIP: (He does) (In shock) I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
MISTY: You
CHIP: Well...he but he didn't deserve to die!
DAD: (Putting down his book as MOM climbs in) I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher. (Turning out light on his side of bed) Goodnight, honey.  Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
MOM: (Picking up and leafing through "The Encyclopedia of Birds") I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
DAD: Goodnight, honey.
MOM: Don't I get a kiss?
DAD: (Moving closer) I just thought with all the sadness...you wouldn't want...
MOM: (Snuggling up) We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
DAD: (Kissing her) It's fine with me, Beverly. (Kisses her again more passionately) You want to, honey?  You think the kids are asleep?
MOM: We can be real quiet...
DAD: (Getting on top of her) I love that you're my wife.
MOM: (Getting turned on) You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
DAD: (Gently making love to her) You bring me such peace...
MOM: Oohhhh, Eugene!
DAD: Shhhh..
MOM: (Getting louder) Oooohhhh.
DAD: Don't wake the kids...
MOM: (Even louder) Ooohhhh!
MOM: Oooohhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!
DAD: (Really turned on) You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet!  Shhhh! The kids!
MOM: Yeah!  Oohhhh!  Get it!
DAD: Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now!  Now!
MOM: (In orgasm, wildly thrashing) Oohhhhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!
MOM: (Tracking a particularly cute bird) There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee!  He's here every morning for breakfast.
DAD: (Groggy) Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know.  No wonder Dede's hungry.  It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
DAD: Hello...
MR. STERNER: Eugene, it's Ralph Sterner. Got a dental emergency here! (Moans in pain) I mean this goddamn tooth is killing me!
DAD: Well, Mr. Sterner, if you call my office, I'm sure we can see you Monday.
MRS. STERNER: Eugene, this is Betty Sterner, He'll die by Monday!  The roots are infected!  He might have a heart attack!
DAD: (Wearily) All right, Mrs. Sterner... Nine o'clock.
DAD: (Hangs up) I'm sorry, honey.  But the birds will still be there next week.
MOM: (Turning to face DAD, suddenly stoic) It's Ok, Eugene.  I understand.. I'll go fix breakfast. (Exits calmly)
MOM: (In his ear, loudly)
CHIP: (Jumping up in fear from sleep) God, Mom! (Looking at her scary face) What's the matter?
MOM: (Back to normal, sweetly) Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
CHIP: You scared me.
MOM: Honey, what's the matter?
MISTY: I'm stoodup!  I'll kill that bastard!
MOM: Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. (Starts fixing breakfast)
MISTY: It's him!
MOM: No, honey, it's the police. (Opens back door) Hello, officers.
DET. BRADFORD: Good morning, Mrs. Sutphin.
MISTY: (Subtly unbuttoning her blouse one button) Hi, Detective Moore.
DET. MOORE: (Embarrassed) Morning, Misty. (All business) Mrs. Sutphin, I presume you heard of the death of Mr. Stubbins.
MOM: A fine man.  A good teacher...
DET. BRADFORD: (Reading from notes) Contrusions...fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
MOM: (In sympathy) What a mess.
MOM: (Seeing MISTY's eyes light up at hearing a car) No, honey, it's just Scotty. (To COPS) Scotty, who doesn't wear his seatbelts!
DAD: Good morning, Detectives.
BIRDIE: (Dramatically) Nightmare on Calverton Court!
SCOTTY: The Maryland Teacher Massacre!
DET. MOORE: That's not funny, son.
DET. BRADFORD: Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
MOM: (Buttering toast) Yes, I did.
DAD: (To cops, getting angry) Detectives, what is this about?
DET. MOORE: I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
DAD: Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
SCOTTY: (Hamming it up, pointing to MOM) SHE DID IT!  Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
MOM: (Quickly staring daggers at SCOTTY before patiently addressing COPS) From what I understand, the eye-witness is a drug user.
MISTY: I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
DAD: Misty, that's a terrible thing to say! (Putting his arm protectively around MOM) Detectives, it's time for you to leave.  My wife knows nothing about this terrible ...accident.
MOM: (Correcting him) Murder, honey.
SCOTTY: (Picking up a "People" magazine with Ivana Trump on the cover) Now, here's a babe!
DET. MOORE: (Suspiciously) Let's see that, young man.
MISTY: (Whispering to BIRDIE as she ogles him from behind) Nice buns!
DET. BRADFORD: "P" as in...
MOM: (Glaring at SCOTTY) ...People who don't mind their own business.
MOM: (To DAD) It's Mrs. Ackerman's magazine, honey. (To COPS) Look at the subscription label if you don't believe me. (Proudly) I recycle my magazines.
MOM: (Singing and dancing in place as soulfully as possible for her) "It's Daybreak" If you want to believe It can be Daybreak!..."
MOM: Don't forget me, boys! (Holding up blue bags) All rinsed and ready to recycle!
GUS: Morning, Mrs. Sutphin.
MOM: Morning, Gus.  Hello, Sloppy. (Sneakily handing them miniatures) Here you go.  You work hard for the environment.  A little drink never hurt anybody.
SLOPPY: Thanks, ma'am. (Takes a big swig) Damn!  Good stuff. (Looking at MRS. ACKERMAN's garbage) Do you believe that goddamn litterbugger?
MOM: (Fingering a tin can) I've told her!  It takes ninety to one hundred years for a tin can to decompose but she still won't recycle.
GUS: (Also taking a guzzle) Cost taxpayers millions of dollars last year but she don't care about the national budget!
MOM: (Deadly serious) I HATE Mrs. Ackerman.
GUS: (Drinking, encouraging her) I hate her too.
SLOPPY: (Getting tipsy, joining the bull session)
I HATE HER GUTS!: (Egging MOM on, laughing) Somebody ought to kill her!
GUS: (Joking and drinking) Yeah, hack her up and recycle her!
MOM: (Not kidding, in a trance) For the sake of this planet,
JOAN: (On TV) ...But your boyfriend was convicted of killing twelve people
HAG: I don't judge him.
JOAN: How can you love a mass-murderer?
HAG: Easy!  He's handsome.  He's famous.  AND WE GET CONJUGAL
JOAN: (To camera) SERIAL HAGS!  Woman Who Love Men Who Mutilate!  We'll be right back after this!
DOTTIE: Turn it off.
MRS. ACKERMAN: Violence is everywhere these days
MRS. ACKERMAN: (Looking up) Oh, it's just Beverly.
DOTTIE: She scared me.
MRS. ACKERMAN: (Going to door) Come in, Beverly.  Have some coffee
MOM: (Entering, back to normal, being so-o-o-o nice) Just a half-a-cup. (To DOTTIE) Hello, Dottie.  I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
DOTTIE: It's not fair!!
MOM: (To MRS. ACKERMAN, noticing her flower arrangement) Are those pussy-willows?
MRS. ACKERMAN: (Fixing the coffee) Dried ones.  Aren't they pretty?
DOTTIE: (Alarmed) What did you just say?
MOM: (Evily baiting DOTTIE under her breath) PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
MOM: Dottie!  Watch what you're doing!
DOTTIE: (Horrified to see MOM is blaming her) I didn't do it!
ROSEMARY: (Crying out, rushing to pick up pieces) My Franklin Mint Faberge Egg!
MOM: (Helping MRS. ACKERMAN) Dottie didn't mean to be a clumsy ox.  She's sorry, Aren't you, Dottie?
DOTTIE: (Pleading) Rosemary, I didn't break your egg - she did!
MRS. ACKERMAN: You could at least apologize, Dottie.  I collect Franklin Mint!
MOM: And we're going flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up. (Evily) I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
DOTTIE: (Stammering in fear to
MRS. ACKERMAN): But...but...she...Rosemary, I heard her voice!  It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
DAD: Mr. Sterner, you've lost a tiny filling.  I have to drill deeply enough to remove all the decay.
MR. STERNER: (Whimpering) Alright...go ahead...but be careful, it really hurts! (Opens mouth)
MR. STERNER: OWWWWW'! Goddamn you!  You're hurting me on purpose!
MRS. STERNER: (Running in) Are you ok, Ralph?
DAD: Mrs. Sterner, please stay in the waiting room!
MR. STERNER: Help me, Betty!  He's worse than the dentist in "The Marathon Man"!
RECEPTIONIST: (Poking her head in) Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Sutphin, but there's two police detectives here to see you...
DAD: (Entering) What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
DET. MOORE: Dr. Sutphing is your wife a big reader?
DAD: Bird books mostly...
DET. BRADFORD: Like these we found in her garbage? (Showing him the book) "Urge To Kill".  "Mass Murder in Houston"?
DAD: I'm sure those are my son, Chip's books.
DET. MOORE: No, they're your wife's.  We checked,  She bought them down at "The Browse and Learn Bookshop" along with a few other titles...
DET. BRADFORD: (Reading from notes) "Helter Skelter", "Hunting Humans", Master Card reference number 7876. Dated June 5th.
DAD: (Seeing their suspicions of MOM are serious)
DET. BRADFORD: Dr. Sutphin, is you wife mental?
MISTY: (Angrily) Always something isn't it? (To CUSTOMER) Can I help you?
CUSTOMER: Just looking. (Walks away)
MISTY: Thanks for not buying anything!
MOM: Misty, lighten up.  It's not the customer's fault Carl stood you up!
MRS. ACKERMAN: (To VENDOR) Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
VENDOR: Yes, ma'am, it is.
MRS. ACKERMAN: I'll give you fifty cents.
VENDOR: That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
MRS. ACKERMAN: Eight dollars?!  Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! (Puts it back)
MRS. ACKERMAN: I'll take this instead.
VENDOR: Nice one, huh?  Winter's coming. (Looking at price momentarily hesit'ating) Three dollars?...I guess that's what I marked it...
MOM: (Seeing MRS. ACKERMAN1s purchase, but still watching CARL and SEXPOT DATE in distance) Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
MRS. ACKERMAN: I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
MOM: (Seeing MRS. ACKERMAN's fire poker) You want me to keep that under the table for you?
MRS. ACKERMAN: If you wouldn't mind... (Gives it to her) It was on sale.
SEXPOT DATE: (In baby talk) Honey, pleeease?  For my little knick-knack shelf?
CARL: (To VENDOR) Wrap it up for the little lady.
BOY: I can't believe it!  Fuckin' Don Knotts!
GIRL: (Happily) It's beyond ugly!
MISTY: (Giving them back change) There you go...
MOM: (Calling out) Misty, honey, look! (Holding up a set of cereal bowls) I made a killing!
MRS. ACKERMAN: (Upset) I went back to get my Faberge Egg and some idiot bought it!
MOM: (Caressing fire poker back under table, threateningly) It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
MISTY: (Seeing cop cars and ambulance enter flea market as customers start running towards concession stand) Watch the booth!  I'll be back! (Runs off to join the crowd)
MRS. ACKERMAN: (Spotting a small hunk of gore stuck to bottom of MOM's shoe) Beverly, honey, you've got some... (Wrinkles up her nose) ...do-do on your shoe.
MOM: Ewwww! (Wipes it off on grass) Thank you, Rosemary.
PERVERT: There was a lady in the men's room!  I swear! A pretty little lady in the stall right next to me!
MOM: That's one-hundred fifty-eight dollars.
DEALER: Will you take a New York check?
MOM: Certainly.
MISTY: Mother!  It's Carl! He's dead!
MOM: 0h, that's horrible, honey. (Suddenly cheerful) I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
MISTY: (Appalled) Mother!  Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom!  I saw his dead body!
MOM: (Quietly, sweetly) You got your wish.
MISTY: (Stunned) But... (Backs away) I didn't wish...I didn't want him DEAD!
NEWS ANNOUNCER: ...Updating the top story of the hour, the young man brutally murdered a short time ago in the mens room of the Edmonson Flea Market has been identified as 22 year old Carl Padgett of Towson...
MISTY: Chip!  Our mother is Charles Manson!
MISTY: (Grabbing the remote and turning off the video) (To CHIP) I'm not kidding.  Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
MISTY: Yes murdered!  You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too.  I don't know...maybe Mom's nuts!
CHIP: It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom!  Better yet, a TV series!
BIRDIE: Can I borrow your mother? My aunt is coming over to dinner tonight and she's always on my nerves.
KID: My step-father is an asshole! She could kill him!
CHIP: (Baiting MISTY) How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her! (Playfully) Should she be the next victim?
MISTY: No!  Stop it!  It's not funny. Mom might do it! (Sobbing) Someone else might die.
SCOTTY: (Comforting her) I believe you, Misty. Your mother could kill - I've seen that look in her eyes! (Timidly) Is there a reward or anything?
MOM: Dinner's served!
DAD: Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
MOM: Amen to that. (Happily) It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
MRS. ACKERMAN: ...Dottie Hinkle was right - IT IS BEVERLY SUTPHIN!  I tell you I saw blood right on the bottom of her shoes!  Not exactly blood - it was GORE!  Hanging right there like a runny nose!!
DOTTIE: Nice as pie she was to me and then I hear her say it!
DET. BRADFORD: Say what, ma'am?
DOTTIE: "Are those..." (Giving up) I can't say the word out loud.
DET. BRADFORD: (Trying to comfort her) Could you tell a policewoman the exact words she used?
POLICEWOMAN: It's ok...nobody's gonna hurt you. (Whispering) Come on, let it out...
DOTTIE: (Yelling loudly, startling all the cops in the room) "PUSSY" she says to me!
MOM: (Laughs) Does he? (Smiling to CHIP) For a boy who doesn't wear seat belts, Scotty's awfully nosy. (Getting up) Excuse me a second. (Exits into kitchen)
MISTY: She's gone!
MISTY: (Blurting it out) She's gonna kill Scotty!
DAD: (No longer pretending)
CHIP: (Horrified) DAD!  YOU DON'T THINK SHE
DAD: (To CHIP) Your mother may have some problems, that's all, Chip. (To both) C'mon!  Hurry!
MOM: "...Ain't no time to grieve And it's Daybreak!!! Let it shine, shine, shine, All around the world!!"
DOTTIE: You rotten mother-fucker! You lousy cock-sucker!
MISTY: (To DAD) Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
CHIP: (Scared for the first time) If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
DAD: We hope so, son.  And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
DET. MOORE: (Following the Sutphins, into police radio mike) Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
DET. BRADFORD.: (Into police radio mike) Suspect's family is entering house.  Send backup to 2l14 Sycamore Street. I've got a feeling old Mom's inside.  I'm goin' in!
MRS. STERNER: What was that?
MR. STERNER: I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
MRS. STERNER: Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
MR. STERNER: What's he know?
MRS. STERNER: How to send a bill!!
MRS. STERNER: (Yelling downstairs) Ralph, "Wheel of Fortune"'s on!!
MRS. STERNER: (Calling out) Ralph, you're missing it!
MR. STERNER: (As chocolate oozes in his mouth) What is it, Betty?
MRS. STERNER: (Still shaking) We have mice!  I mean it, Ralph!  I saw one!
MOM: (Scarily) Always brush after every meal!
MR. STERNER: (Calling upstairs) Betty?
MR. STERNER: Betty?  Betty, answer me!
MOM: (Holding up bottle of "SHOUT" and doing mock TV-ad)
MOM: You'll pay for that, Ralph Sterner!!
MR. STERNER: Help!  POLICE!!
DAD: Home Sweet Home!  Everything's fine, kids!
MISTY: (Laughing) I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
CHIP: I'm disappointed she isn't! (In wonder) For a while there, it was like being in a movie!
MOM: (Beaming happily) Anybody for dessert? M-m-m-m-m, strawberries!
DET. BRADFORD: (Talking into police radio) ...Sutphin family proceeding west on Seminary Avenue.  Beverly ain't goin' nowhere this time.
MISTY: (Scared) Dad, I thought it was ok. Make them go away.  This is embarrassing.
DAD: Just ignore the police. It's all a terrible mistake.
CHIP: Think we'll get on "A
DET. MOORE: She's headed for church.
DET. BRADFORD: (To police dispatcher on radio) I say we nail her!
DISPATCHER: (On radio) Negative.  D.A. says no bust until lab report is back matching suspect's fingerprints on true-crime book with those on scissors and fire poker.
DET. BRADFORD: (To DET. MOORE) She may be Beaver Cleaver's mother...but Jim Jones and the entire People's Temple just fucked her!
ANNOUNCER: ...the senseless killing last night of Towson couple, Ralph and Betty Sterner, brings to a total of four murders police feel may have been committed by Baltimore's first serial killer...
DAD: Beverly!  Not the Sterners!
MOM: (Calmly) It's a shame.  But they should brush their teeth, honey.
ANNOUNCER: (On radio) This just came in.  Police Lieutenant Ronald Habbler has publicly named a suspect in the serial killer case and it's a shocker!  She, that's right, she has been identified as Beverly R. Sutphin of 2815 Calverton Court...
MISTY: Oh God! (In despair) Now I'll never get a boyfriend!
DAD: (Nervously) Beverly, I've been reading all about it...is it menopause?
MOM: Oh, honey!
CHIP: Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really!  Are you a serial killer?
MOM: Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
DAD: (Lovingly, painfully) Don't worry, Beverly.  We're going to get you good psychiatric help.
REPORTER: (To MOM) So, Mrs. Sutphin!  Tell me! Are you "Serial Mom"?
MOM: Who?
DAD: (Blocking his face from strobing flash) No comment!
CHIP: (To himself) "Serial Mom"? (He looks at his MOM who is perversely enjoying the attention)
FATHER STONE: (On altar) Blessed be God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit...
ALL: And blessed be His kingdom, now and forever.  Amen...
CAPTAIN JOHNSON: This is Captain Johnson from Homicide.  Lab reports confirm Sutphin latent print of index finger on true-crime book matches those latent prints lifted from murder weapons.  Bingo, boys! Bust the bitch!
FATHER STONE: ...Jesus said nothing to condemn capital punishment as he hung on the cross, did He?!
FATHER STONE: ...If ever there was a time to go on record against the death penalty, WASN'T IT THAT NIGHT?!...
FATHER STONE: CAPITAL PUNISHMENT is already the LAW in the State of Maryland!...
FATHER STONE: Now, let us pray and humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God.
CONGREGATION: ...Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against thee... CHIP and MISTY ...by what we have done...
BIRDIE & PARENTS: ...and by what we have left undone...
DAD: ...we are truly sorry and we humbly repent...
MOM: (Praying piously, but beginning to sniffle a sneeze) ...so that we may delight in thy will...
MOM: ...And walk in the ways to the glory... (Starts to sneeze and catches herself) ...of Thy name...
ALL: Amen!
CHIP: We'll show 'em, Mom,  We'll go on "60 Minutes"!
BIRDIE: Alright (To MOM) You're bigger than Jason or Freddie now! (In wonderment) Only you're a real person!
MOM: (Innocently) Do you think I'll need a lawyer?
CHIP: (Putting on his seat belt) You need an AGENT!
DAD: NO COMMENT!  PLEASE!  My wife is missing!  I'm worried sick about her! (Gets in car)
REPORTER: Hey, Misty!  Just a few more shots, Ok?  I'm Hank Hawkins from the Baltimore Sun.
MISTY: (Flirting boldly and posing) Hi, Hank.
DAD: (Appalled, opening passenger door from inside)
CHIP: In here, Mom...
MOM: But, Chip...
CHIP: Get in, Mom!  I have to open.
MOM: This is so silly. (Gets in)
BIRDIE: Good morning, Mrs. Jenson.
MRS. JENSON: (Scowling at video screen where "Leatherface" chases a girl to house where he "chainsaws" his way through door as the victim screams in terror) Haven't you had enough violence, Chip Sutphin? Turn that filth off!
CHIP: (Turning it off) Sorry, ma'am.
MRS. JENSON: Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
CHIP: (Rolling his eyes and getting the cassette) Sure do.  Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
MRS. JENSON: (Rooting in her purse and handing CHIP the casette) There you go.  I love Bill Cosby pictures.
CHIP: (Looking at cassette in frustration) Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
MRS. JENSON: (Belligerently) Why?
CHIP: Because it's the rules!
MRS. JENSON: (Defiantly) I don't feel like rewinding it!
CHIP: (Exasperated) You see the sign!  It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
MRS. JENSON: (Slamming money down and grabbing video) Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
BIRDIE: What a bitch!
CHIP: It's the influence of all those family films. (Turning to closet) Right, Mom? (No answer) Hey, Mom??... (Still no answer)
BIRDIE: (Nervously) Mrs. Sutphin?
CHIP: Mother? (Opens door to reveal empty closet)
BIRDIE: 0h, shit!
CHIP: You don't think....
BIRDIE: She wouldn't...
CHIP: (Panicked) What's Mrs. Jenson's address?
BIRDIE: ...Jenner...Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson.  3511 Clark Avenue!
CHIP: That's right up the street! Come on!  Just in case!
MRS. JENSON: What is it, Sylvester, a bird?  Shhhh.  Mommy's watching "Annie".
MRS. JENSON: Quiet, Sylvester.  Nobody's there.  Shhh...Lick Mommy's feet. (Wiggles toes at DOG) Come on!  Get 'em all wet! (Starts singing along with video) "The sun comes out Tomorrow..."
CHIP: (To BIRDIE) Come on!
MRS. JENSON: "The sun comes out Tomorrow And you've got to Hang on to Tomorrow Come what may..."
MRS. JENSON: "Tomorrow!  Tomorrow! I love you Tomorrow You're only a day away!"
MRS. JENSON: " I love you..."
MRS. JENSON: "....Tomorrow! You're only a day...
MOM: "Tomorrow!..Tomorrow!..Tomorrow! I love you...
BIRDIE: I saw blood!  And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
CHIP: (Terrified) Is MOM...in there?
BIRDIE: No! (Obsessed) It wasn't like gore movies at all! (Bursting into tears)
BIRDIE: Oh God, I think I'm going to be sick...
MOM: THE
BURGLAR A: What the fuck is that?
BURGLAR B: Betty Crocker gone psycho!
MOM: (Primly) Give me your fucking van before I kill you!
BURGLAR A: (Hopping out of driver's seat) Yes, ma'am.  It's all yours.
BURGLAR B: (Hopping out as MOM hops in and pulls off) Drive carefully! (To fellow BURGLAR A) White people sure are something!
SCOTTY: (To himself out loud) Dear God...I promise I'll never watch a sex film again... I promise, I promise....
SCOTTY: Oh shit! (He floors it)
DAD: Hold on, kids!
COP: All units!  SERIAL MOM headed south on York Road. Proceed with caution!
DOORMAN: (To SCOTTY)
SCOTTY: (Panicked) Can I give it to you inside?
DOORMAN: Hey, buddy.  NOBODY gets inside without I.D.
DOORMAN: (Looking at Scotty's I.D.) Birthdate?
SCOTTY: (Straining to remember information on his fake I.D.) Uh...December 14th, 1975. (Pleading) Please!
DOORHAN: Ok, go ahead,
MOM: Hi! I know your mom...
KID A: It's her!
KID B: Who?
MOM: Excuse me. (Pushing her way up in line) Age before beauty...
KID C: The murder lady!  The one on TV!
KID B: Cool!  Is she in a band?
MOM: (Butting ahead) Sorry...the police are after me...
DOORMAN: (Recognizing her) Hey, you're Serial Mom!
MOM: (Modestly) I guess I am.
DOORMAN: (Looks up and sees her family and COPS rushing towards her) Come on in lady.  Quick! (Hands her a badge) Here, take this.  A backstage VIP pass. (Proudly) Welcome to Hammerjacks, "Serial Mom"!
MOM: Thank you so much, you kind, kind creature.
MOM: Excuse me...coming through... (Snatches beer bottle out of boy's hand) Bill Flowers!  You're underage!
BILL: (Laughing) Don't kill me, Serial Mom!
MOM: (Snatching joint out of hophead girl's lips) Just say NO!  And COMB YOUR HAIR, young lady!
GIRL: (Stoned) Wow!  It's her! (Proudly)
MOM: (Hissing) Buckle up, Scotty!
PRESS A: Mr. Sutphin!  How does your wife feel?
DAD: (Grim-faced) Beverly is devastated by the charges against her.
COURT TV: ...And you, ma'am, how long have you been waiting to get in?
LADY A: (Beaming at the attention) Since 5:00am.  But it's gonna be worth it!  I know she's guilty!
HUSBAND A: (Leaning into the shot) We've been to famous trials all over the country!
WIFE A: (Getting into the act) ..Manson.. .Watergate... (To Lady A) Didn't I see you at Hinkley?
LADY A: (Proudly) I was there!  My husband thought I was crazy but... (Seeing Sutphin family getting off elevator)
LOOK!  HERE THEY COME!!: That awful family!
MOM: (Happily waving to DAD) Hi, honey!
MOM: (To CHIP, BIRDIE Kids, did you do your homework?
JUDGE: Quiet in the courtroom! Court is now in session!
MOM: (To JURY) Hello, jury people. My name's Beverly Sutphin. (To startled woman juror) I like your jacket!
JUDGE: (Losing patience) Mrs. Sutphin, I SAID QUIET! You are accused of mass murder! This is a court of law, not a coffee klatch! (Bangs gavel) Mr. Nazlerod, your opening statement.
MR. NAZLEROD: Thank you, your honor. (Approaches JURY) Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, my name is Timothy Nazlerod... (Smarmily) ...and I hope we can be friends! (JURY stares back impartially) ...I warn you, this is not a pretty case...Beverly Sutphin is a woman evil to the core... (JURY POV shot of innocent- looking MOM staring back at them) ...a rotten apple, if you will... (DAD gulps in sorrow) ...who beyond a reasonable doubt killed five innocent people!!
CHIP: (Whispering to BIRDIE, making excuses) Well...they sort of deserved it...
DAD: (To CHIP) Shhhhh!
MR. NAZLEROD: ...Beverly Sutphin is not a woman!...
HERBIE HEBDEN: ...Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm Herbie Hebden and you and I have a tough job ahead of us...
HERBIE HEBDEN: ...I have known the Sutphin family for sixteen years...
HERBIE HEBDEN: ...Dad, Eugene, is my dentist...
HERBIE HEBDEN: ...Chip and Misty played with my own children...
HERBIE HEBDEN: ...but I've found out I don't know Beverly Sutphin at all!
HERBIE HEBDEN: ... Sutphin...
HERBIE HEBDEN: ...You see... (He reads note to humor MOM) ...Beverly Sutphin is INSANE!!
MOM: (Suddenly defiant)
HERBIE HEBDEN: (Trying to make his point) Yes, she committed these terrible crimes... (Pleading) ...but that doesn't make her a bad person.
MOM: (Standing) Your honor, I have a motion. I would like to fire my attorney, and defend myself!
HERBIE HEBDEN: Beverly Sutphin is not guilty, by reason of INSANITY!
MOM: Oh shut up, Herbie! (To JUDGE) I have the right to defend myself, your honor.  I've read the lawbooks!  "Ware vs. State, 1964", and "Schutte vs. State, 1962".
JUDGE: Mrs. Sutphin, a defendant who has herself for a lawyer has a fool for a client... (To attorneys) Approach the bench!
JUDGE: (As bench conference breaks up) Mrs. Sutphin, I have no legal choice but to allow you to take over as your own attorney.
HERBIE HEBDEN: (Sulking out of courtroom, to MOM) You'll get my bill, I mean it!  A big one!
JUDGE: (To MOM) How do you plead?
MOM: (Proudly) NOT GUILTY, your honor!
MR. NAZLEROD: (Furious) I call to the stand, Dottie Hinkle!
MR. NAZLEROD: Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
DOTTIE: (Staring right at MOM) I certainly did.
MR. NAZLEROD: Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
DOTTIE: Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
MR. NAZLEROD: Who's voice was it, Dottie?
DOTTIE: (Pointing to MOM) It was her!  Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there! (Dramatically to JURY) I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
MOM: Mrs. Hinkle...do you drink?
DOTTIE: (Haughtily) No, I don't.
MOM: So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
DOTTIE: I certainly was not!
MOM: You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's...the day you claim you recognized my voice...you weren't drinking?
DOTTIE: (Flustered) One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
MOM: So you
DOTTIE: Socially...I'll have a beer.
MOM: So you admit you just lied?
MR. NAZLEROD: Objection!  Argumentative!
DOTTIE: (Rising to the bait)
JUDGE: Sustained. (To DOTTIE) Watch your mouth, Mrs. Hinkle.
DOTTIE: (Shocked, to JUDGE) Did you see her?!  She just said "Fuck you" to me!
MOM: (Innocently, to JUDGE) Let the record show I'm just standing here.
JUDGE: I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle. One more obscenity and I'll charge you with contempt of court.
MOM: (Dramatically) Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
JUDGE: (Bangs gavel) Mrs. Hinkle, I find you guilty of contempt of court and sentence you to a thousand dollar fine and five days in jail! (To MATRONS) Lock 'er up!
DOTTIE: (To MOM, being dragged out)
CHIP: (On phone) ...Well, you tell "Geraldo" to go to hell!  I don't care what Jeffrey MacDonald's people got - he's old news!  We fly first class or we don't do the show!
CHIP: (Into phone) Hold on... (To YOUNG MAN) Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
YOUNG MAN: Your mom killed my brother!
CHIP: (Getting up, rubbing his jaw) That's cool...hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
YOUNG MAN: That's right.
CHIP: I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
YOUNG MAN: (Suddenly all business) You mean for TV or print?
CHIP: TV, man!  Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
YOUNG MAN: (Impressed, eyes lighting up) Farrah Fawcett?!  Who's gonna play my brother?  Is Jason Priestly available?
MR. NAZLEROD: Miss Hodges, could you describe the car...the one you saw run over Mr. Stubbins in cold blood?
LU-ANN: (Giggling) I seen that movie!...On cable!
MR. NAZLEROD: (Annoyed at his witness) PLEASE, Miss Hodges!
LU-ANN: (Obviously stoned) 'Scuse me... (Giggles) ...Well, like I told you, it was blue.  The car, not the driver... (Laughs like a lunatic) Just blue...you know...like blue!
MISTY: Get your "Serial Mom" T-shirts while they last! $19.95 plus tax!  Master Card or Visa!
LADY D: I'll take two.  I wish they'd had something like this at the Kennedy kid trial!...
MISTY: (Processing the charge on portable printer) Thanks, ma'am.  Signature here and home phone.
MR. NAZLEROD: ...And these books... (Holding up "Urge to Kill", "Mass Murder in Houston") ...these disgusting books that so lovingly describe the sadistic acts of serial killers...Where did you find these books?
DET. BRADFORD: (Looking at MOM hatefully) In Beverly Sutphin's trash can.
MR. NAZLEROD: (Smugly to MOM) You may cross-examine, Mrs. Sutphin.
MOM: (To NAZLEROD) Thank you. (To DET. BRADFORD) Detective Bradford, if I was to look through your trash can, what reading material would I find?
MR. NAZLEROD: Objection!  Immaterial!
JUDGE: You may answer.
DET. BRADFORD: .."Time"..."Newsweek".  My wife gets "Ladies Home Journal"...
MOM: (Smiling) Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night... (Holds up porno magazine) ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
DET. BRADFORD: (Turning bright red)
MOM: Don't judge people by what they read, Detective. (Smugly) Your witness, Mr. Nazierod.
DET BRADFORD: (Sputtering, purple with rage) I'm a married man!!
DET. BRADFORD: (Yelling to MOM) I hope you get the gas chamber!
JUDGE: The jury is instructed to ignore the outburst of the witness.
MR. NAZLEROD: (Furious at MOM's cross-examination) I call to the stand Rosemary Ackerman!
MR. NAZLEROD: ...and did you ever see the fire poker again after you left it with Mrs. Sutphin?
MRS. ACKERMAN: Yes!  Thirty minutes later it was covered with blood and gore and Carl Padgett was dead!
MR. NAZLEROD: No further questions.
MOM: (Standing to cross-examine) Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
MRS. ACKERMAN: ...Browsing.
MOM: Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
MRS. ACKERMAN: I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
MOM: Carl Padgett Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
MRS. ACKERMAN: (Shocked at the suspicion being pointed at her) NO!  I could never hurt anyone!
MOM: (Not letting up) That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
MRS. ACKERMAN: Yes, but I lent it...
MOM: (Cutting her off) And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
MRS. ACKERMAN: (Stuttering, panicked) Yes...but...I didn't...
MOM: (Suddenly, dramatically) Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
HOUSEWIFE A: (To RALPH) Could you sign it: "To a future Serial Mom"?
REPORTER: (Signing) Sure.  You think she did it?
HOUSEWIFE B: I have reasonable doubt.
HOUSEWIFE C: (Buying a book) I feel like killing a couple of people myself!
MR. NAZLEROD: Detective Moore, did you then proceed to the stage area inside "Hammerjacks"?
DET. MOORE: Yes, I did.  Scotty Barnhiil was on fire and he fell to his knees in flames.
MR. NAZLEROD: Would this be what you saw?
DET. MOORE: Yes, sir.  A real barbecue.
MR. NAZLEROD: (Ignoring FARRAH FAWCETT, trying to continue) Your honor! (Impatiently) May the photo be entered in as evidence and passed to the jury?
JUDGE: Huh?...oh yeah...YES.
DET. MOORE: (Star-struck) Jeeeeze!  It really is Farrah Fawcett!
JUDGE: (Blurting out, unable to contain himself) I loved you in "The Burning Bed"!
MR. NAZLEROD: (Furious at JUDGE) No further questions! (Smugly looking at MOM) I call to the stand, Marvin Pickles.
MARVIN: Be right out.
COP: The Judge is waiting for you!
MR. NAZLEROD: State your name, please.
MARVIN: Marvin A. Pickles.
MR. NAZLEROD: Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
MARVIN: Yes, I was.
MR. NAZLEROD: Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
MARVIN: I...um... (Turned on) uh...
MR. NAZLEROD: (Getting testy) Mr. Pickle!  Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
MARVIN: I...1'm not sure... (Really turned on, starting to moan) ...I...oohhh...Excuse me...
MR. NAZLEROD: (Outraged) What do you mean, you're not sure?!
MARVIN: (Eyes popping out of head) There was nobody next to me:
MR. NAZLEROD: (Losing it) Mr. Pickles, you testified before the Grand Jury that you looked down and "saw a pair of lady's shoes" in the stall next to you.
MARVIN: (Lost in his own perverted glory) Ohhhh!  I just said what you told me to!
MARVZN: Ooohhhhhh!  I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
MR. NAZLEROD: (Absolutely furious) You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles! (Returning to seat) I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!! (Sitting down) The prosecution rests, your honor.
MOM: (Giving MARVIN her version of a sexy smile as he leaves stand) The prosecution has proven nothing, your honor. (To the JURY) The defense also rests!
FARRAH FAWCETT: ...I feel that Beverly Sutphin is an innocent woman, wrongly accused.  A normal housewife trapped in a nightmare of circumstantial evidence...
MR. NAZLEROD: (Pointing to MOM) ...That's her!  Henrietta Lee Lucas!  Joan Wayne Gacy!  A new face in the deck of serial killer trading cards... Find her guilty of all five counts of first degree murder...!
FARRAH FAWCETT: ...I only hope that I can portray "Serial Mom"'s life on the TV screen with the proper dignity that this feminist heroine deserves.
MOM: (Addressing the jury with calm believability) Look at me!  I'm a normal person just like you are!
MOM: ...But I've been framed by the police...
MOM: ...and perjured against by the very people I thought were my friends...
MOM: ...All I ask is that you have the courage to find me innocent of these terribly untrue charges...
FARRAH FAWCETT: (Hammily) ...All I ask is that you find me innocent of these terribly untrue charges...
JUDGE: Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, have you reached a verdict?
FOREMAN: Yes we have, your honor...
FOREMAN: ...We find the defendant not guilty of all charges.
MOM: I'm coming home!!
JUDGE: (Bangs gavel in disgust) Court adjourned!
DAD: (Whispering to a shocked CHIP and MISTY) ...What should I do?
CHIP: (Suddenly nervous) Bring her home...I guess.
BIRDIE: (Mumbling to herself) No more violence...No more violence...
REPORTER BOYFRIEND: Think she'll like me?
MISTY: (Worried) Just be nice to her.  And try ...just try not to get on her nerves.
MOM: (Graciously accepting flowers, signing autographs, posing for the press) I love you!  Thanks for coming! (Slows a kiss to newsteam) Hi Los Angeles! (Looking into another camera) Hello Cleveland! (And another) And you too, New York!
JUROR #8: (Proudly) We did it!  We set her free! I knew she was innocent right from the beginning!...
MOM: (Snarling scarily) You can't wear white shoes after Labor Day!
JUROR #8: (Stammering in open-mouthed terror) No...please...that's not true anymore.
MOM: Oh yes it is! (In homicidal fury) Didn't your mother ever tell you?!
MOM: Well, now you know!
JUROR #8: (Staggering in pain) But...fashion has changed...
MOM: (Enraged) No it hasn't!
DAD: (Realizing MOM is missing in the confusion) Beverly?  Beverly?
MOM: Right here, honey.
PRESS: Mrs. Sutphin, can we get a shot with you and Farrah Fawcett?
MOM: Certainly.
FARRAH: Hello, Beverly.  I'm Farrah Fawcett (Pulling MOM rudely) You stand here... (To PRESS) Ok, boys, a medium two shot...
MOM: (Trying to get on other side of FAWCETT) ...but please...if I could just...
FARRAH: (Rudely shoving MOM back in place) Stay there, Beverly. (Posing) Smile, Serial Mom!
MOM: (Hissing to FARRAH in the scariest, most threatening voice yet)
