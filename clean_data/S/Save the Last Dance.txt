WOMAN: This seat taken?
WOMAN: I love ballet. Never had the body for it. Do you dance?
SARA: Used to.
GLYNN: What's the matter?   It was good.
SARA: (checks her stance in mirror) Everybody there's going to be good, Mom. I have to be better. (then, beginning again) My knees still knock when I do my free form. Did you notice that?
GLYNN: I noticed that it was fine.
SARA: (escalating frustration) It's not supposed to be fine. It's supposed to be special.
SARA (CONT'D): And it just lays there, it doesn't do anything. I bet they notice that. That it doesn't do anything. That I don't do anything special enough to get in.
GLYNN: Sara.   You'll get in.
SARA: Don't lie because you love me.     My free form sucks.
GLYNN: (giving up that battle) I've got something for you. Come on. Sit. Mouth closed, eyes shut. No pouting. No peeking.
GLYNN: For luck tomorrow. Not that you'll need it. You dance like an angel.
SARA: I love the necklace but you're still the best luck I'll ever have.
WOMAN: Nice... the necklace.
SARA: Oh. It's a good luck charm. Doesn't always work.
WOMAN: Mine either.
LINDSAY: Wanna pray? You're leaving for Philly after first period. I won't see you. We should pray.
SARA: (stupefied) Lindsay... no. Not here.
LINDSAY: 'Awesome, Father, S.J. auditions today. She's ready for them. Please make them ready for her. Even if she screws up. Thanks. Amen.' (sure shrug; another bubble) God's gotten me outta all kinds of shit. He oughta be able to get you into Juilliard.
GLYNN: Where'd you get those, traitor?
SARA: Ellison -- Mr. Ellison. He actually told me to break a leg.
GLYNN: Roses from the principal, even droopy, out-of-season yellow ones, is beyond cool, kiddo. You're definitely movin' up in the world.
SARA: Know what would be great? If you didn't drop me off at the bus station. If we just kept going until we get to Philly.
GLYNN: Ruin everyone's Valentine's Day and not have a shop when I get back. That's your definition of great? I can see the headline now: 'Starving Artist Kills Unfit Mother.' (gently) Sweetheart, we talked about this. I'll get there as soon as I can.
SARA: Right. This is the hardest, most important day of my life and all you can do is get there as soon as you can. Thanks, Mom.
SARA: So I guess I'll see you later.
GLYNN: I won't miss your audition, Sara. I'll be there, okay? If I have to swim the Susquehanna, I'll be there.
SARA: Swim?   You can't swim, Mom.
GLYNN: I'll float then.
GLYNN: Hey... Happy Valentine's Day.
JUDGE: Is there anything you'd like to share about your free form before you begin? A motif... a theme?
SARA: Well, it's um, pretty self- explanatory. The theme.
SARA: Thank you.
ROY: Hi.
SARA: Hi.
ROY: Have a good ride?
SARA: Slept through most of it.
ROY: Guess you got stuff.    Baggage.
SARA: Two suitcases.     One big one.
ROY: Looks like they're unloading. -- You hungry? We can stop somewhere if you want.
SARA: I'm kinda tired.
ROY: I didn't like leavin' you so soon after the funeral. I wouldn't have if you hadn't asked me to go. I mean, I could've hung around. Helped you say good-bye. That's what you were doin', wasn't it?
SARA: Uh-huh.
ROY: That's what I figured you were doin'.
ROY: Look. Sara. I feel bad too. I mean, we both got hit by the same bolt of lightning. You don't have to pretend this is easy. (off nothing) Everything's upside down right now but don't worry. We'll work this bachelor-father thing out. Hell, it ain't like we're movin' in with strangers. We got a pretty good idea about each other, right?
SARA: Thought you were moving to Fells Point.
ROY: Fell through.
ROY: Not much of what you're used to. But the water's hot and the fridge is full. And I made room in the closets for you. Girl's gotta have closets, right? You even get your own bed. I'll crash on the couch.
SARA: You bought a bed?
ROY: (slight bow) Pardon me. Your own futon.     Check it out. On the other side.
SARA: Do you have a phone?
ROY: Of course I have a phone.
SARA: You didn't at the last place.    The last place I saw anyway.
ROY: Things change. You've changed. You grew up on me. Overnight.
SARA: Over the summer. You blew me off for some gig on the road, remember? (before he can respond) Can I call Lindsay? Let her know I got here alright.
ROY: Are you alright, Sara? (off the scowl in her eyes) I just wanna know how you feel.
SARA: I feel fine.     I feel like calling Lindsay.
ROY: Phone's in the kitchen.   Knock yourself out.
SARA: I can take the school bus. Tomorrow.
ROY: School bus? That's the other Oz, Dorothy. Patterson kids ride the city Metro. Or walk.
SARA: Well, I know how to do both.
ROY: Not around here you don't. Not until you get the hang of things.
ROY: I called about your transcripts. You're all set. Patterson's got a pretty good Humanities program. No ballet, but we can find a studio someplace close for after school --
SARA: -- I don't think I'll have time. I have to study, I'll be busy.
ROY: Good idea. Take a break. Not too long a break though. You're a dancer. You should dance. Stay on top of your art.
SARA: Like you stay on top of yours?
ROY: Maybe I ain't playin' no grand ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals, but I'm playing.
SARA: (unconvincingly) I didn't mean it like that.
ROY: S'alright. Hell, I wish I had half the time I wasted gettin' wasted. But those days are over. You'll see. I got my life on track.
SARA: You don't have to go in with me. Since I'm all set. I mean, I have done this before. Gone to school. I'll be fine. I am fine. Really.
ROY: -- Pick you up. Three-thirty.
SARA: (over a shoulder) Yeah.   Sure. Whatever.
ADMINISTRATOR: ... It's no fun being uprooted in the middle of your senior year. We realize that and we'll do what we can to help with the transition.
MRS. GWYNN: Any questions?     Concerns?
SARA: About school?     No.   Not really.
MRS. GWYNN: Not even about Baltimore?
SARA: I'm not gonna be here that long. Besides, it's just a city, right?
TEENAGER #1: Yo, man, check it, the muthafuckers wasn't playin', they was jackin'. Ten rides in five days. For real.
TEENAGER #2: Fools got caught for real too. Ten years in five days. Stall that shit!
CHENILLE: That's how easy it is to give to charity around here. Don't put your shit on the floor.
SARA: (cautions a smile) Thanks.
JURASINSKI: In Cold Blood    represents a turning point in our    country's literature. Take the cap    off and tell me why that is, Mr.    Ricard.
SNOOKIE: Gay rights. That Compote dude who wrote it? Sweet tooth. Straight- up fag, Mr. J.
JURASINSKI: Thank you, Mr. Ricard. Your genius grant is in the mail. Anyone else?
JURASINSKI: Ms... Johnson. You can catch up later. If this is over your head.
SARA: It's a non-fiction novel. The first of its kind. Capote mixed true events with things he couldn't know, so he made them up.
PATRICK (O.S.): White folks back then felt safe. Capote scared 'em. He took hard core crime out the ghetto and dropped it in America's back yard. That's what makes the book special.
SARA: Yeah.   That is part of it.
PATRICK: That's all of it. Capote wasn't first. Richard Wright and James Baldwin did the same thing. Wasn't nobody tryin' to read them though.
SARA: Lots of people read them.
PATRICK: Lots of people like who?      You? Hello. Didn't think so.
SNOOKIE: Mr. J.! Girl needs to bone up. Give her a pass to the lib'ary.
JURASINSKI: She can have your pass, Mr. Ricard. Since you obviously never use it.
WONK: ... I know you're new to the table, but think about it. We're the Y2K generation and nobody takes us seriously. We don't take ourselves seriously. Just look around. Half the student body is D.O.A. -- and that's from the neck up, Clara.
SARA: Sara.   It's Sara.
CHENILLE (O.S.): Yeah. It's Sara. And you're boring her from the ears down.
CHENILLE: You finished?
SARA: God!    Thank you!
CHENILLE: (laughs) Gotta watch where you sit, girl. And it's Chenille. But you're still welcome. Let's catch some air before the bell rings.
SARA: What's it called? What she's doing?
CHENILLE: A dance.
SARA: (a look; knows that) No, I mean... the step, the...
SARA: Asshole.
CHENILLE: Asshole beaucoup. In this crowd, you gotta be more specific.
SARA: (covertly indicates Patrick) He's in one of my classes. Thinks he's so... smart. So cute.
CHENILLE: I don't know about cute but he is smart. Real smart. Real trip, too.
SARA: So you know him?
CHENILLE: Patrick Reynolds? Hell yeah, I know him. He's my brother.
NIKKI: You comin' tonight?
PATRICK: Gotta work.
NIKKI: You already skipped three meetings. (as he's ignoring her) Is it because of me? Everybody on the committee thinks it's because of me. Us. (infuriated by his silence) Look, Patrick. Regardless.
NIKKI (CONT'D): You're in charge of the music. I'm in charge of the prom. So show up. Don't make me fire your ass.
PATRICK: You already fired my ass, Nikki. Once and done. Over. Out. 'Bye.
PATRICK: Hit me and shut the hell up.
SNOOKIE: I'ma shut up... after I say it been real frigid 'round here since y'all broke up. 'Specially since she broke up with you. That was harsh, way she canceled your ass like a stamp for that Howard U dude. But their shit's over. Now might be the time to forget mistakes that was made. Shoot. You been with the girl since ninth grade.
PATRICK: Why you sweatin' me, Snookie?
SNOOKIE: (pounding his heart) 'Cause I'm about you, man. I want a happy ending. Aww, shit. Tuck an' duck. Here he comes. The hood of the 'hood, up to no good.
MALAKAI: Medicine man...
SNOOKIE: (interjecting himself) Did I tell you, Malakai, man, how chill it is to have you back? We ain't been bad without cha.
MALAKAI: Shut the fuck up and step your lame ass off, Snookie. You heard me. Space.
PATRICK: What happened to you at lunch, man?
MALAKAI: Business.
PATRICK: So you're hangin' in, man? Feelin' strong about being back?
MALAKAI: Not at this motherfucker. Out a week and where am I? Fucking home sweet high school. Jail away from jail. You can have it.
PATRICK: You gonna stay though.   Right?
MALAKAI: Judge says it's school or JuVee and I sure as hell ain't goin' back there. Shit. I never knew a year could be such a long time.
PATRICK: You up for some hoops after school? Break your free-throw back in. Chump the chumps like we used to.
MALAKAI: Up for it? Hell-the-fuck yeah, man. Let's do it.
CHENILLE: That's your old man? Now he's cute.
SARA: He's embarrassing.
CHENILLE: (laughs) Yeah.   He is. For you.
ROY: How'd it go?
SARA: Fine. (as he pulls off) Tomorrow I catch the bus.
ROY (O.S.): Hey, Sara.   C'mere a minute.
SARA: What?
ROY (O.S.): Just come here.
ROY: Hungry and Healthys. I asked at the market. They're the best. So. What do you feel like? (whimsically) Lamb Chop Suey? Tropical Tuna? Primavera Paradise?
SARA: I had a big lunch.
ROY: What do you wanna do? You wanna hang out with me? Go to my gig. You can if you want.
SARA: It's a school night, Roy.
ROY: Right.   School night.    Got it.
SNOOKIE: I need a date --
CHENILLE: Why?   Your hand busy?
SNOOKIE: -- For the prom. And if it wasn't for that kinda undue attitude, you could be the lucky girl, Chenille. My personal prom queen. I can see us now.
CHENILLE: You must be lookin' in your dreams.
SNOOKIE: Help me, man.    Defend me.
PATRICK: I got my own problems, Snook.
SNOOKIE: What problems? You goin' to college. Doctor college after that. You large, man.
PATRICK: I ain't gonna be doctor nothin' if I don't get in and I'm not in 'til I get my letter.
CHENILLE: It's in the mail, Patrick.       Okay?
SNOOKIE: (wishfully thinking) I probably coulda been a doctor too. If I hadn't got left back that time.
CHENILLE: That time? What? Fifth and sixth grade don't count?
MRS. GWYNN: (as Patrick and Chenille look on) Light on your feet? Good. Be sure they dance into my office next week.
MR. HILL: We're cooking today, Ms. Johnson. This is your first lab. You'll need a partner. Mr. Reynolds -- Patrick -- will show you the ropes.
PATRICK: (very casually) That's too big.
SARA: I know it's too big.
PATRICK: I wouldn't do that if I were you.
SARA: (yanks her hand back) Who died and made you teacher?
PATRICK: Know the difference between ethyl glycol and methyl acetate? Both got three elements, two parts the same. It's that first part, C2 versus C3. C3 could blow a vial right out a person's hand.
MR. HILL: What happened?      Everybody back in your seats!
PATRICK: I misread the component.
MR. HILL: (even more angry now) You? You misread a component. Don't give me that, Patrick. You were screwin' around!
TEACHER (O.S.): Alright, Ms. Diggs. Time!
CHENILLE: Girl, how you get your legs to twist like that?
DIGGY: (wildly gesticulating) Yeah. What was all that double- jointed cheerleader shit?
CHENILLE: This is Diggy.     Thinks she's down.
DIGGY: Egg-cuse me?     I am down.
CHENILLE: So, Sara.   What's up with that?
SARA: (awkwardly) Nothing's up with it. I used to kind of dance. Ballet. Mostly.
CHENILLE: You should hit Feetz with us tomorrow night. It's a club. Sorta members only.
DIGGY: Un-der-ground.
SARA: I don't know...
CHENILLE: Come on and hang out. Snook dee's sometime. He can get you in. (yelling) Yo, Snook
CHENILLE: She needs to get hooked up for Feetz. All the way up. Sara, give Snook twenty dollars.
SARA: For what?
SNOOKIE: I.D. Eye-dee. How you think you gettin' in? On your looks? (rolling his eyes) Chenille, your girl is weak. Shit. I got my rep to watch. I can't just be gettin' any green in.
SARA: Look closer. And if I still look green, I think maybe you should wipe the crust from your eyes.
CHENILLE: You gonna pay the man or what?
SNOOKIE: She ain't got it. Look at her. Loud-talkin' me and broke as a damn promise.
SARA: I don't even know where it is.
CHENILLE: So we'll hook up at my house. Go together. I will have your I.D.
PATRICK: Feetz ain't no square dance.
SARA: That's okay. I dance in circles. Probably around you.
ROY: I'm splittin'. (as she barely looks up) Whatcha readin'?
SARA: Chemistry.
ROY: You're takin' chemistry?
SARA: Right now it's taking me.
ROY: Give yourself some time. Well. See ya in the mornin'. Maybe I'll call between sets.
SARA: I'll be asleep.
SARA: Cool outfit.
CHENILLE: Slammin'.   Slammin' outfit.
SARA: ... I look okay?
CHENILLE: Yeah.  You look okay. (then) Moma Dean. I'm leavin'.
CHENILLE: (fussing over Christopher) Grandmom, Sara. Sara, Grandmom. Also known as Momma Dean. And handsome here is Christopher.
SARA: Hi.
MOMMA DEAN: Hello. Now don't get him all riled up, Chenille. I want to get some sleep tonight.
SARA: Is that... is he... yours?
CHENILLE: He sure ain't Momma Dean's.
CHENILLE: ... He'll be one in July. Best mistake I ever made. Kenny -- Christopher's father -- he's the worst. Triflin'. Okay?
SARA: Chenille.   She's ugly.   She's fat!
CHENILLE: She's twenty-one too. I ain't got all night. Let's hop.
SARA: Wait. I have to ask you something. (hard for her) Do I really look alright?
CHENILLE: Gimme that '89 Madonna shit.    Your jacket. Give it here.
SARA: It's from the GAP.
CHENILLE: It's country. You look country in it. Take it off.
SARA: I'm not walking in there in my bra.
CHENILLE: Rope dopes.   C'mon.
DOORMAN: Chenille.    Lookin' fine.   As always.
CHENILLE: Too fine to stand in line?
BOUNCER: Changed your hair.
SARA: (an inside to Chenille) Can't get much more underground than this.
CHENILLE: Let's get our table 'fore it gets crashed and I hafta hurt somebody.
SARA: What are you, some kind of V.I.P.?
CHENILLE: Snook hooks me up whenever he dees.
SLACKER: Aw'right, aw'right. You got it.
CHENILLE: Got what?
CHENILLE (CONT'D): (as he can't think of anything but the squeeze on his balls) The right to walk past your greasy, tickle dick self without your paws on my ass? 'S'that how I got it?
CHENILLE: That's how I thought I had it. (a fly wave) See ya.
NIKKI: What is up with this place? Seems like they're lettin' anybody in.
CHENILLE: Yeah.   And they started with you.
NIKKI: I'm Nikki. Alyssa. Jasmin. Tiff'nee. You know Diggy, right, Marsha?
SARA: Sara. It's Sara. And I know you. We have a class together.
NIKKI: That don't mean you know me.
CHENILLE: Quit it, Nikki.
NIKKI: Quit what? I ain't walkin' on eggshells just 'cause you brought the Brady Bunch to the Negro Club.
SARA: (kiss-my-ass polite) Maybe you came to the wrong spot, Nikki. I'm pretty sure this one doesn't have any Negroes.
NIKKI: I'm pretty sure you came with one.
CHENILLE: Oh, no. Uh-uh, wench. You did not just call me a Negro.
DIGGY: Alright, y'all. Chill.
NIKKI: Tell her to chill. She always got somethin' to say.
CHENILLE: I can say a lot more. Keep runnin' your mouth, Nikki. I'll lay all your shit bare.
DIGGY: Why you burn her like that?
CHENILLE: 'Cause I can't stand her ass and the way she played my brother. I need a drink, Sara. Let's walk.
CHENILLE: That's him.        Comin' over.   Kenny? Don't look.
KENNY (MAN): What's up?
CHENILLE: Where's my money, Kenny?
KENNY: I'm a little short this week. Don't jump off. It's comin'.
CHENILLE: It's comin'?    No. You lyin'.
KENNY: Lemme rap to you about the situation on the dance floor.
CHENILLE: Rum and Coke.    No ice.   Hook me up.
NIKKI: Let's dance.
PATRICK: (pulling away) Let's not.
NIKKI: Oh?   It's gonna be like that.
PATRICK: How'd you think it was gonna be? That you was gonna drop me and pick me up whenever you felt like it?
NIKKI: It ain't all that serious, Patrick.
PATRICK: It ain't anymore, Nikki.     Not to me.
SARA: Rum and Coke, straight up. And a beer. I don't care. Anything.
PATRICK (O.S.): Bad choice.      'Anything.'
SARA: It's just a beer.
PATRICK: Then it should be the best beer. You'd know that if you really drank.
SARA: Whatever.
PATRICK: What's that mean? Whatever.
SARA: Whatever you want it to mean. You're the whiz kid, right? You know everything.
PATRICK: (chuckles at this, at her) Not everything. Like I don't know why we're standin' still. (closer with a teasing whisper) I'm supposed to be dizzy by now. Remember? From all those circles you danced around me.
SARA: I don't feel like dancing.
PATRICK: But you do know how...?
SARA: Would I be here if I didn't?
PATRICK: ... Let's do it then.    C'mon.
PATRICK: Now move your hips. Not so fast. (as Sara looks lost) Sara! Just like our hands. (singing, in sync with the crowd) 'Flashlight! Neon light! Stop light! Everybody got a little light under the sun.'
JASMIN: She's all up in your nut, Nikki... Oh, that's right. It ain't your nut anymore.
NIKKI: It is if I want it to be. He is if I want him to be. That bitch ain't got shit on me.
PATRICK: Man, what the hell are you doin'? Tryin' to get sent back up?
MALAKAI: They the ones tryin' shit. Comin' here. Squarin' off in my shit.
PATRICK: You couldn't let it slide?
MALAKAI: Let it slide tonight, they come back strong tomorrow. You know that.
PATRICK: Malakai, you fuck up parole, you ain't gonna back to JuVee. Eighteen and up, that's Jessup. Hardcore lockdown. You want that?
MALAKAI: (regards him coldly) I want what was mine. Feetz is my spot. I'ma do business here just like I did before. Like we did before. And if I gotta stomp some niggers in my way, so be it.
PATRICK: Well, you definitely got the stompin' part down.
MALAKAI: We fucked those fools up for sure.
PATRICK: (crossing to exit door) For damn sure, man.
DIGGY: It's about to get real out here. Cops and shit. I'm gone.
CHENILLE: ... Yeah, I'ma tell you. Tell you like I keep tellin' you, Patrick. You need to let Malakai alone. Let him handle his own shit before he drags you down in it.
PATRICK: Chenille. I heard you the first five hundred times.
CHENILLE: I'll see you Monday. (to Patrick, like an order) He'll walk you.
SARA: It's just a few blocks.   It's okay.
CHENILLE: No, it's not okay. Would you tell the girl it ain't okay?
PATRICK: It's not okay, okay? (before she can protest) Come on, Braveheart.
PATRICK: What?
SARA: (caught) What?
PATRICK: Why you keep lookin' at me?
SARA: I have to look somewhere. The streets are deserted. Might as well look at you.
PATRICK: That's not why. You wanna know somethin'. Ask somethin'.
SARA: It's not a question. It's the way you were beating that kid up. You looked so mad.
PATRICK: I was mad and he wasn't no kid. But you're from the suburb Mars, right? Folks don't fight there.
SARA: Not like that. (some kind of wonder) You were really kicking his ass.
SARA: Are you laughing at me?
PATRICK: My friend was in trouble.
SARA: Maybe he's my question. Your friend. Chenille doesn't like him.
PATRICK: She likes him. It don't stop her from trippin' off him now and then. But Malakai's good people. We go back. Way back. You know, like they say, through thick and thin. (beat) So, how'd you like Feetz?
SARA: It was great.
PATRICK: Once you got used to the music.
SARA: It wasn't the music I wasn't used to. I mean, it's not the first time I heard hip-hop, Patrick.
PATRICK: Uh-huh. Bet you listen to it all the time.
SARA: Not all the time. But a lot.
PATRICK: We gettin' any closer to your crib or should we stop for food and water?
SARA: We passed it.
PATRICK: You passed it.
SARA: Thanks for walking me.
PATRICK: No problem.
SARA: So.      I'll see ya.
PATRICK: Is that 'see ya' like gee-whiz, had a great time, can't wait to see you again?
PATRICK (CONT'D): Or is it like 'see ya,' I'll bust a cap in your ass if you ever darken my doorstep again?
SARA: I haven't said gee-whiz since I was six. But I really had a great time... okay?
PATRICK: Okay.
ROY: Figured I'd put a little marrow in your bones. Siddown, siddown. (she slumps in chair) You gettin' along at school? Makin' friends...? (as she nods robotically) ... See any of 'em last night?
ROY: I came home on my break.
SARA: Oh.
ROY: ... Oh? Jesus! You're hard! Look. You're seventeen. If you wanna go out, go out. But don't lie to me. On top of everything else, don't make me worry like that about you.
ROY (CONT'D): (after long moment) I didn't mean to yell. (sits down; trying like hell) So how are the eggs? They good?
SARA: You're right. I should've said something. I'm sorry.
ROY: What're you gonna do today? Anything special?
SARA: Nope.     Nothing special.
SNOOKIE: ... How   you   know I can't do nothin'   for   you? I'm the hardest workin'   man   in showbizness, girl. C'mon.    Let   me be the bomb in your shell.
PATRICK: You do the shit to yourself, man. The bomb in your shell?
SNOOKIE: That was black magic, Patrick. It's gonna work one of these days.
SNOOKIE: Last one on the rack. I snatched it up for you. Rang it up on my discount.
PATRICK: (what Snookie's waiting for) Thank you, Snookie.
SNOOKIE: (as Patrick pays him) You workin' or what, man?
PATRICK: On my way.   Soon as I get outta here...
PATRICK: Throwin' a party?
SARA: Just adding to my collection. I heard some stuff I didn't have last night.
PATRICK: (that twinkle in his eyes) Well, you were fly anyway. Last night. Dancin', I mean.
SARA: Not as fly as you.
PATRICK: (half-serious) Nobody's as fly as me.
SARA: (dead-serious) Not yet anyway.
PATRICK: Maybe we could hook up later. After school or somethin'. Work on some of your moves. If you want.
SARA: Okay.   Sure.
PATRICK: By the way, Hammer's pretty much played out.
SARA: (convincing lie) Not to me.
SARA: (into phone) It was so... slamming, Lindsay. The dancing! I'm going again. What? No, I haven't seen anybody get shot yet. God, I didn't move to Bosnia.
SARA: What happened?
TONY (WHITE GIRL): We freed the slaves and didn't teach them no manners. (before Sara can react) You're Sara, right? (as Sara warily nods) Toni. I was gonna introduce myself before but you're always with that crowd. You know. Chenille, her girls, that identity crisis Diggy.
TONI: (brightly) We should hang out sometime, Sara. The two of us. Whenever you decide to lose the tan?
P.A. ADDRESS (V.O.): Seniors, a reminder before you rise up and change the world. Mrs. Gwynn is holding all diplomas hostage in her office. Her only demand is the pleasure of your company for career D-Day. Be there.
ROY: I don't know what to say.    I don't.
SARA: How 'bout fuck it? Or should I say fuck her? It's a fuck-fest, Roy.
ROY: Don't talk to    me like that, Sara. (beat) I thought you    were goin' to your friend's house    after school. Obviously, you    changed your mind. So I'm sorry.     Alright?
SARA: Sorry you got caught.
ROY: Sorry I got... observed
RHONDA: Don't be mad at him. It's my fault. I'm real sorry, honey.
ROY: It's nobody's 'fault.' It's over. Let it be over. We're all adults.
RHONDA: I think he means you know about sex. That we have it and he likes it. Isn't that what you mean, Roy?
SARA: Really?   How often do you have it?
RHONDA: Things been kind of slow since you got here. Once upon a time we were real rabbits, weren't we, Roy?
ROY: Rhonda.   Shut up.   Please.
PATRICK: I got it.
MALAKAI: Medicine Man.     You know Tute.
TUTE: You call this a job, man?
PATRICK: Actually, I call it a car wash. The work I do, yeah, that's a job.
TUTE: I need some sticks.    Watch my ride, Malakai.
PATRICK: You hangin' with him now?    Think that's a good idea, 'Kai?
MALAKAI: You got a better one?
PATRICK: You could try layin' all this shit off for awhile. Give yourself a chance on the other side.
MALAKAI: What other side?
PATRICK: You know what I mean. It ain't like you don't have good sense.
MALAKAI: I got sense enough to know who I am, what I can do and where I can do it. I ain't like you. People don't just up and hand me shit.
TUTE: We ain't here for our health.     You workin', then work. (throws Patrick car keys) And don't forget the rims.
MRS. GWYNN: Maybe you think it's enough to have the grades, get a full scholarship. But it isn't, Patrick. Georgetown makes mulch of students like you every semester. You have to be ready to change. Change friends. Lifestyle. Your entire point of view. What I'm saying is, options won't matter if you don't keep a clean nose to the grindstone.
PATRICK: (looks her right in the eye) I know that, Mrs. Gwynn.
MRS. GWYNN: Knowing's easy. Doing is hard.
SNOOKIE: Me? I wanna operate on cars. Some place fly like the Kentucky Derby. -- Ah-ha! Joke on you...
SPACED-OUT STUDENT: Career?   That the same as a job...?
DIGGY: A Rock-n-Rap club in L.A. I'm gonna put a tattoo parlor on the roof. Soon as I find some investors...
SERIOUS STUDENT: I want to be a lawyer, but I believe in God so I'm not sure about it...
TONI: I'm moving to Idaho.      I hate it here.
CHENILLE: Beauty school.
CHENILLE (CONT'D): I'm a year behind 'cause of my baby, but I'm gonna work during the day, go to school at night. That's my plan anyway...
MALAKAI: Plans? Yeah. I plan not to be poor. Next question...
NIKKI: I get into U.M.B.C., financial aid, everything...
MRS. GWYNN: Do I detect a 'but'?
MRS. GWYNN: I know you're -- how do you put it? -- Large here, Nikki. You enjoy that and it's fine for now. I guess. But you can't live your life like a popularity contest.
SARA: I don't think it's realistic, what you're asking. Things happen. Things change. And the changes change you. What's the point of plans?
MRS. GWYNN: To have a sense of direction.
SARA: You can't direct destiny.
MRS. GWYNN: (fingering Sara's papers) I see here that you trained for Juilliard, that you auditioned.
SARA: That was a long time ago.
MRS. GWYNN: It was three months ago, Sara. (the brick wall) Well, if you're not going to pursue dance, what are you going to do?
SARA: (hadn't thought about it) I don't know. Take a year off. Work. Go to college later on.
MRS. GWYNN: Be careful with later on, Sara. It's a slippery slope. Sometimes you can run right on top of it and it never catches up with you.
PATRICK: Feel the groove. Don't let the music mess with you.
SARA: Did you always want to be a doctor?
PATRICK: Who said I wanna be a doctor?
SARA: Chenille.   Everybody.
PATRICK: Keep it tight.     Watch your butt.
SARA: What kind of doctor do you want to be?
PATRICK: Pediatrics. I like kids.         Come on, stay with me. You're slackin'.
SARA: Do you have any? Kids.
PATRICK: No.   Do you?
SARA: I wasn't being smart, Patrick.
PATRICK: Wouldn't be the first time.
SARA: Screw you.      I'm brilliant.
SARA: I didn't get it. That thing you just did. Show me again?
PATRICK: What was that shit you just did?
SARA: A releve.    Over ice.     With a twist.
SARA (CONT'D): (succumbs to his bewilderment) Ballet. I used to dance, Patrick.
PATRICK: You used to dance?
SARA: Uh-huh. Used to as in don't any more. And don't ask me why.
PATRICK: Why not?
SARA: Because I don't want to talk about it.
PATRICK: That's why you brought it up. Did that whole relieve thing. 'Cause you don't wanna talk about it?
SARA: Because it's not a big deal.       Can we just concentrate on this?
PATRICK: Yeah, we can concentrate. (a beat; goading her a little) But I think it is a big deal. Whatever it is you don't wanna talk about.
LINDSAY (V.O.): (over phone) I'm still gonna pray for you.
LINDSAY (V.O.) (CONT'D): Jesus, Sara, you're in the freaking ghetto. Forget the riots. How are you supposed to meet anybody?
SARA: (into phone) I have met somebody. Sort of.       I think. I mean, there's this guy...
PATRICK: (walking in) What y'all doin' to my nephew?
KENNY: Why's he do that?
CHENILLE: He's a baby.   They cry.
KENNY: He was screaming, Chenille.
CHENILLE: He don't know you, Kenny.
KENNY: I'm his father. He knows me. (meaning now) ... What should I do?
CHENILLE: Come around more often.
KENNY: See?    I can't talk to you.
CHENILLE: And I can't depend on you! Am I askin' you to do anything for him you ain't supposed to do?
KENNY: You don't ask, Chenille. You make demands. You want money, you --
CHENILLE: -- I want you to pick up some of the slack. You always have an excuse.
KENNY: It's not like that.    I get tied up.
CHENILLE: You wanna talk about tied up? Try gettin' up in the middle of the night to change diapers and give him bottles or stayin' up with him when he's sick and havin' to drag your ass to school the next day.
KENNY: Look.    I'm doin' the best I can.
CHENILLE: It ain't good enough, Kenny!
GIRL (O.S.): I don't get paid 'til next week.
MALE (O.S.): Boo the fuck hoo. You can't put my bizness up your nose on no layaway plan. C'mon now. You know what you gotta do.
SARA: What are you doing?
MALAKAI: You didn't see nothin', you don't say nothin'. Not unless you want a taste for yourself. And that can be arranged.
PATRICK: Didn't you like it when you 'used' to dance?
SARA: Yeah I liked it. I was gonna go to Juilliard. That school fucked up my entire life. It's a long story.
PATRICK: Let me guess. You don't wanna talk about it.
PATRICK: I stole a bike here once.
SARA: Why'd you do that?
PATRICK: 'Cause I didn't have one.
SARA: That's a good reason.
PATRICK: I used to do wild shit like that.
SARA: You and Malakai?
PATRICK: Yep.   Most of the time.
SARA: I don't get you guys.    You seem so... different.
PATRICK: We're not.
SARA: Maybe you weren't then but you are now. You said you changed.
PATRICK: Doesn't make me different from him. Not the way you think it does.
SARA: I think Malakai's scary.   And I know you're not.
PATRICK: (taking mild umbrage) What you mean by scary? 'Kai's tough. He has to be. He still got a good heart. I know.
SARA: Patrick.
PATRICK: Let me finish. Me and him got into some shit awhile back. Real bad shit. We held up a gas station off 95. I bailed the ride -- jumped out the car. 'Kai kept goin', got caught. (pauses) I knew what he was gonna do that night. Knew the car was hot. I woulda been guilty as him if they had caught me, if Malakai had served my name up. But he didn't.
SARA: That means you owe him something?
PATRICK: He did his time plus most of mine. I owe him that.
SARA: No matter how much he messes up?
PATRICK: We all mess up. Maybe Malakai gave up. But he's still m'boy and he still got a chance. I ain't just gonna cross him completely off and be like everybody else.
SARA: I stole a hat once. When I was twelve. My mom found it under my mattress, made me take it back.
PATRICK: Gangsta' Sara.     Stole a hat.   Call the F.B.I.
SARA: You gonna turn me in?
PATRICK: I think I'll wait for you to surrender. (pauses) Were you tight with your mom, Sara? I mean, y'all get along and shit?
SARA: (guardedly) Yeah...tight... got along and shit
PATRICK: So she meant something to you. How come you never talk about her?
SARA: There's nothing to say.
PATRICK: (studying her face) Know why there's nothing to say? Because you don't talk about her. You won't talk about her.
SARA: I'm sorry she's dead. God! What do you want me to do? Run through the streets screaming?
PATRICK: Why not?    If it helps.
SARA: (tersely) Well, it won't. So drop it.
PATRICK: And you call Malakai scary.
MOMMA DEAN: I know you're not puttin' those dirty hands inside my refrigerator.
MOMMA DEAN: This what you're lookin' for?
SARA: Are you gonna tell me where we're going? (as he grins, shakes his head) Why is the surprise for me? You're the one with something to celebrate.
PATRICK: We can celebrate together.
SARA: I wanted to get you something and I couldn't figure out what. It's not much but I hope you like it.
PATRICK: I like it.   I love it.    Thank you.
SARA: Wait.     There's more.
SARA: We have an audience.      Work with me.
PATRICK: (nonplussed) Work with you?
SARA: (sotto voce, through her teeth) Grab something.
PATRICK: Surprise... Sara?
SARA: (quietly urgent) I can't. I can't go in.
PATRICK: (doesn't understand) You have to go in. This is where I'm bringing you. The ballet.
SARA: (beside herself) I know, but --
PATRICK: (crestfallen) But what?
PATRICK: I thought you would like it.
SARA: I did.
PATRICK: You ain't actin' like you did.
SARA: I'm sorry.
SARA: I don't want you to think I didn't have a good time tonight, Patrick. I did. But ballet isn't a part of my life anymore.
PATRICK: Why not? What happened? You just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent.
SARA: (without rancor) How do you know I have talent? Because I did some stupid leg trick.
PATRICK: I saw the look on your face when you did it, Sara. The same look I saw tonight. Goofy happy. So if you're gonna tell me somethin' about not dancing, at least tell me somethin' real.
SARA: Maybe I don't want it to be real.
SARA: What I want is to wake up and see my mom. For things to go back to the way they were. When they made sense. When my life made sense. (because) And it's all my fault. She got scraped off the highway for me, for my fucking audition. She was rushing. It was raining. It was raining... (a torrent) ... But she promised to be there. I made her promise. And then I didn't wait for her. I should have but they called my name and I didn't say anything. I just went out and danced. I was mad. I needed her and she wasn't there.
SARA: (inconsolable) She was dying while I was dancing and I was mad at her and I'm sorry. I'm sorry...
PATRICK: It's not your fault it rained or she died. Or that you danced. That's what you were there for. Your mom would've expected you to do what you did.
SARA: That's what makes it so bad. She always did what was right for me. I wanted to be a prima ballerina -- had to be. Even if it took most of our money, all of her spare time. I didn't care. It was my stupid dream and it killed her. All she wanted was for it to come true.
PATRICK: You still got whatever you had when your mom was alive, Sara. She wouldn't want you to give up.
SARA: I know... but she... I just don't think I can do it without her.
PATRICK: (holding her) Do you want to do it, Sara? I mean you. Do you want Juilliard?
SARA: Yeah.   I do.
PATRICK: Then it's on you to make the dream come true.
SARA: Yeah.   For my mom.
PATRICK: For her.   For you.
SARA: See you tomorrow?
PATRICK: Lemme see that move you did.     That cute leg relieve thing. (as she shakes her head) Come on, Sara.
SARA: (hates to admit this) It hurts! I'm out of shape and it hurts. Okay? Satisfied?
PATRICK: (admiring her) That's what you call outta shape, what's it take to get you in shape?
SARA: Practice.
PATRICK: This is the perfect spot for that. You can run around and I can sit under the trees and watch you.
SARA: I don't get in shape like that. But it's still a good spot. (diffidently) I got my application for Juilliard. Just in time too. They're holding auditions in Baltimore next month.
PATRICK: That's great!
SARA: I'll never be ready in a month.
PATRICK: Sara, you puttin' the mojo on yourself.
SARA: (a smile in spite of herself) Mojo?
PATRICK: Negative shit. White folks call it karma. The bad kind.
SARA: You don't understand. Ballet takes a lot of time, a lot of preparation. I used to practice two, three hours every day. I'm so far behind...
PATRICK: Quit whinin' and catch up then.
SARA: It's not as easy as that. My free form still sucks. It's still the weakest part of my routine. That hasn't changed.
PATRICK: So I'll help you with it.
SARA: You will?
PATRICK: (surprised that she's surprised) Yeah. I'll help you. Tell me what you need to do and let's get busy.
SARA: Let's skip. (cursory, to Roy) Later.
ROY: Let's 'skip'? (mumbling to himself) Three months and she's skipping?
DEEJAY: Master P with the 'Ghetto D'. Showmesomethin', showmesomethin', give up that cruel. Eyes on you!
PATRICK: Nobody's watchin' you but me.
SNOOKIE: Go, Patrick!    Go, Patrick!
DIGGY: Go, Sara!   Go, Sara!
DEEJAY (V.O.): Everybody have funk, funk, funk!
NIKKI: Watch me squash their shit.    Hard.
MALAKAI: You ain't never gonna look as good as she does with him. That's oil. You're milk. Ain't no point in tryin' to mix.
PATRICK: Sara...?
SARA: What?
PATRICK: I'm sorry.
SARA: He's in D.C. Blues Alley.   He'll be gone all night.
SARA: Roy's demo. The only one he ever cut. Kinda grows on you.
SARA: Wanna see my room?
SARA: Sorry...
TONI: Whatever you do, don't fuck him.
SARA: Excuse me?
TONI: 'Hit it and quit it,' that's their motto.
SARA: Whose motto?
TONI: Black guys.    Everybody knows that.
SARA: Don't forget, they all have big dicks and beat their wives. Everybody knows that too.
ARVEL: You smell, boy.
PATRICK: How can a piece of shit tell?
MALAKAI: You been scarce lately, man. Where you been?
ARVEL: Somewhere dreamin' of a White Christmas...
LIP: ... And Christmas ain't even for 'nother six months.
SNOOKIE: Lip. It's a so-to-speak thang, you ignorant fuck.
SNOOKIE (CONT'D): (looks at Patrick) So.   So to speak? Whassup.
PATRICK: (snatching up one of his ribs) Back out my business, boy.
MALAKAI: (watching Patrick keenly) You tappin' that white girl, man? (half joking) That's why you ain't got time for your boyz no more, you too busy frontin'. Too busy snowflakin'.
PATRICK: How am I frontin', 'Kai? I made time for this bullshit, didn't I?
LIP: Aww, man. You busted. That's why your jaws are gettin' so tight.
SNOOKIE: You the one need his jaws tightened with your pork-ass instigatin' self.
ARVEL: (re: Patrick's roving fingers) Order somethin', Patrick. This ain't no goddamn soup line.
PATRICK: Y'all hangin' tonight or what?
MALAKAI: We thinkin' about slidin' through that new rec center opened up on the Eastside. You ridin'?
PATRICK: Eastside?   That's the wrong side.
PATRICK (CONT'D): I ain't messin' with those fools over there. You know how they are.
MALAKAI: I ain't pressed. I got my own shit.
MALAKAI: What you think? I'ma keep walkin' around waitin' for some chump to cap me? I'ma protect myself.
PATRICK: That ain't protection. It's an excuse for some unnecessary mayhem.
MALAKAI: Ain't nothin' unnecessary 'bout it. Shit. Mayhem and madness. That's a black man's life.
PATRICK: How you know? You ain't tried nothing else. Now you sittin' up here strapped for no good reason. You askin' for trouble, Malakai. (as Malakai laughs) You think this shit's funny?
MALAKAI: I think it's funny you think it ain't necessary. You act like you don't know where you are no more, Patrick, and whassup out there for anybody who ain't you. Maybe that's what happens when a white girl goes to your head.
LIP: -- Or gives you some.
PATRICK: Fuck you, Lip. (looks at Malakai) I know what's out there. I also know you can get past it. But that ain't gonna happen, 'Kai, long as you keep gettin' in your own way.
ARVEL: (peacemaker) Aw'ight. Y'all said what you had to say. We back to bein' boyz. Patrick. Chill. Have some ribs.
PATRICK: What's your favorite flower?
SARA: I don't have a favorite.
PATRICK: Yeah, but if you did...
SARA: I dunno. Maybe cymbidiums -- orchids. They're sort of show- boaty but they're pretty.
PATRICK: What's your favorite color?
SARA: Agua.
PATRICK: What's your second favorite color?
SARA: Mmm.    Mauve.
PATRICK: You're makin' this real hard, Sara. Those ain't exactly tuxedo colors.
SARA: Nut.   What are you talking about?
PATRICK: I was tryin' to get around to askin' you somethin' but since I'm some sorta nut, you probably wouldn't wanna go to prom with me...
ROY: Patrick -- it is Patrick, isn't it? (a small awkward nod) Well, I think you were just leavin'.
SARA: Why does he have to leave?   We're all adults. Right?
ROY: He either leaves or I throw his ass out. Your call, Sara.
PATRICK: Chill, man. I'm goin'. You don't have to come off with all 'at.
ROY: Who the hell are you to tell me how to come off? You're in my house alone with my daughter.
SARA: I hate being your daughter.    You ruin everything.
ROY: Siddown. (not a request; an order; as she sits) It's a free country, you can hate me. Ain't like that's exactly news. But disrespectin' me, that's where the road ends, Sara. I don't want him up here again. I mean it.
SARA: You mean it because he's black.
ROY: Don't start that bullshit!
SARA: Why's it bullshit? Because you hang with black guys and play jazz and have the hots for Angela Bassett?
ROY: Because he was in my house with his hands all over my daughter!
SARA: Keep telling yourself that. Just don't expect me to believe it. I saw how you looked at him. But you didn't see him. Well, for your information, he's a straight- A student with more heart and guts than you'll ever have!
ROY: Yeah? Well, when are you gonna have the guts to say what you really want to say to me, Sara?
SARA: (screaming at him) Want me to say it? You were a piece of shit husband and you're a piece of shit father! You were never there for Mom or for me. You took off and never looked back. So don't talk to me about guts.
ROY: Sounds like you have it all figured out.
SARA: I have you figured out. You think you can make up all the time you missed, all the things you didn't do? You can't! I'm here because I have to be and it's a goddamned nightmare.
ROY: Well, you might as well wake up and get used to it, Sara, because that's the way things are sometimes, the way life is.
SARA: How the hell would you know? You've been asleep for the past thirty-seven years!
MALAKAI: The 'Love Boat.'
NIKKI: Love shit. That bitch is tap- dancin' on my last nerve.
MALAKAI: Looks like she's tap-dancing on your last boyfriend. She got it like that? Naw. Never mind. Stall it. I ain't heard shit.
NIKKI: Stall what?   What you hear?
MALAKAI: Some trash she's talkin'.   About you.
NIKKI: About me?
MALAKAI: Yeah. How you ain't all 'at since Patrick's takin' her to the prom. (in for the kill) I am a little bit... chagrined though, Nikki. You lettin' some white ho' show you up like that.
NIKKI: Fuck you, Malakai. Fuck her too.
MALAKAI: (gaily, a she sails off) Ain't no need in fuckin' me... stuck up, bitch... I'm on your side
MALAKAI: Yo. Me and the boyz fixin' to shoot some hoops. Us against Druid Hill. If you interested.
PATRICK: Druid Hill?   Hell yeah.
MALAKAI: Gotta skip last period.
PATRICK: I got study hall. Don't matter anyway. Not with those suckers. I'll be back before the bell rings.
FEMALE VOICE: Don't start nothin', won't be nothin'! Stay down, girl!
NIKKI: (a hiss, under her breath) It ain't over, bitch.
SARA: Over? I don't even know why it started... bitch. And don't say it's about Patrick because it's not. It's not about him.
NIKKI: No. It's about you. White girls like you. Creepin' up, takin' our men. The whole world ain't enough. You gotta conquer ours too.
SARA: I like him, he likes me. And if you don't like that, screw you.
MRS. GWYNN: Girls.   I think you need to talk.
ROY: What the hell happened to you?
SARA: I got suspended. Two days.
ROY: For what? Fighting? (as she nods like "no shit Sherlock") Why were you fighting, Sara?
SARA: (sardonically) I'm not sure. I think it's some kind of black female thing.
CHENILLE: How's Arvel?
PATRICK: Pretty bad. (almost to himself) Can't even play a got-damned game of ball no more.
CHENILLE: You see Sara? She alright? (as he looks up with a question mark) You didn't hear? Nikki jumped off at her in gym. It was fierce...
PATRICK: Shit!
SARA: It's alright.    I'm okay.
SARA: Look.  It's not a good time. (gently shutting the door) I'll see you later... I'm okay.
NIKKI: Diondre, what your butt doin' here?
DIONDRE: (a taunting twist) I can go where I want. You the one on punishment.
DIONDRE: There she go.    Gimme my two dollars.
NIKKI: Whatever it is, I don't wanna hear it.
PATRICK: I thought you had somethin' to say to me.
NIKKI: You thought wrong.
PATRICK: Somethin' must be on your mind for you to get up in Sara's face, start all this drama. What you tryin' to prove, Nikki?
NIKKI: You're the one tryin' to prove something. Stuck up in her shit like she's somethin' special.
PATRICK: What if she is? What's it to you? You didn't see me trippin' off that Howard dude and I could have. I coulda tripped hard, Nikki.
NIKKI: That was different.
PATRICK: How you gonna call it different?
NIKKI: Because she's white and he ain't. And don't sit there like you don't know what I'm talkin' about, Patrick.
PATRICK: (glaring at her) You don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nikki.
NIKKI: I don't?     Y'all black men, soon as you even    think about goin' someplace    good, first thing you do is find a    white girl to take with you.
OLD WOMAN (O.S.): Uh-huh.
PATRICK: I thought I was goin' someplace good with you. You the one called me off. But you ain't tryin' to remember that. Now you mad. Why? Because she's white and I like her? I'm with her.
NIKKI: Please. You're with her because she's white. That's what sets me off.
PATRICK: (exasperated) It ain't got no business settin' you off! Me and her ain't got nothin' to do with you and what you think. So keep your hands off her and that shit to yourself.
NIKKI: I don't think it, I know it. But you go ahead, deny it. That's what y'all always do.
CHENILLE: What? I'm supposed to get excited because you decided to skate by and drop a dollar on the dresser?
KENNY: It's more than a dollar. And it's all I got. (beat) I got laid off rom B.W.I., Chenille. I been workin' part- time. Money's tight. You know how you are about money. That's way I haven't been coming around.
CHENILLE: Money ain't got nothin' to do with it, Kenny. You don't come around because you don't feel like comin' around. You don't want the responsibility of comin' around. As long as you out there and I'm in here, you know your son's being taken care of. You ain't got no worries when it comes to him.
KENNY: And you don't have no   feelings when it comes to me.    All you do is bitch and complain   about what I don't do. I get sick    of that.
CHENILLE: Be sick of it. You ain't got to see me to see your son.
KENNY: I'll be sure to keep that in mind.
SARA: Want me to take him?
CHENILLE: That wench. You gotta stand over her to make sure she puts your name on the damn list. Triflin' bitch.
SARA: I'll get 'em.
CHENILLE: So your old man flipped about the fight. (with some animus) Probably thinks it's all Patrick's fault.
SARA: No.   I explained about Nikki.
CHENILLE: Right. You put it all on her. None of it's on you.
SARA: She started it, Chenille. She wanted to start it. I told you what she said.
CHENILLE: Maybe she didn't have no business gettin' in your face. But she had a reason to say what she said.
SARA: So you agree with her? You think I don't belong with Patrick.
CHENILLE: What I think don't matter. But you and him act like it don't bother people that you're together. Like it don't hurt people to see.
SARA: (her Irish up) We like each other. What is the big fucking deal? It's him and me. Not us and other 'people.'
CHENILLE: Black people, Sara. Black women. (passionately) Patrick's about somethin'. He's smart. He's motivated. He's for real. He ain't gonna make no babies and not take care of 'em or run the streets, fuck up his life. He's gonna do somethin' with himself. Here you come, white and right, and you take one of the few decent men left after jail, drugs and drive-bys. That's what Nikki meant about you up in our world.
SARA: There's only one world, Chenille. (pauses) I thought we were friends. Guess I was wrong.
MALAKAI: So what you gonna do?
PATRICK: How many times you gonna ask me that?
MALAKAI: It's payback time. Either you down or you ain't. Either you m'boy or you not. Simple as that.
PATRICK: Even if I did ride, you ain't got nobody but Lip and Lip will get a nigger's ass killed. Quick.
MALAKAI: Eastside ain't got no firepower. I got some shit, man. AK-47. We go in, get out with one spray down.
SNOOKIE: You see us, Patrick?
MALAKAI: (a storm warning) You see us, man? We're rappin'.
SNOOKIE: Me and Sara lit it up!      Y-e-o-w!
PATRICK: That shit ain't funny.
SNOOKIE: (springing up) Damn right it ain't funny.
MALAKAI: I thought you liked it down there. That's your specialty, ain't it? Crawling?
SNOOKIE: That was a reflex action, man. And you just plain rude and wrong to bring the shit up in mixed company.
SARA: I gotta get home. Ready?
MALAKAI: No, he ain't ready. He's talkin'. To me. A-B conversation. Gotta go? C yourself the fuck home.
SARA: (a real reflex action) Fuck you.
PATRICK: Have you lost your motherfuckin' MIND, man? Huh? Have you!
SNOOKIE: Patrick, man, c'mon.
MALAKAI: You take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine?
PATRICK: 'Cause you wrong, Malakai!
MALAKAI: No! You wrong. You BEEN wrong. You ain't worth shit no more. (venomously) Get out my face, and take that ho with you.
SARA: We should keep going.
PATRICK: You messed up.
SARA: I know I messed up. I'll get it right the next time.
PATRICK: No. You gonna get it right now so you can do it perfect next time.
SARA: I can't work like this.      I can't dance like this.
PATRICK: Like what?
SARA: Like this.     You dictating to me.
PATRICK: What's wrong, Sara?
SARA: Nothing's wrong. (except) I can't figure things out.
PATRICK: What things? The audition? You ain't got nothin' to worry about. I told you. I'll be there.
SARA: Things, Patrick. Things between us. Things between us and them.
PATRICK: I didn't know there was a 'them.'
SARA: Well, open your pretty brown eyes, look the hell around.
SARA (CONT'D): (he's so nonplussed) Everything's screwed up. Nobody wants to see us together, not even Chenille. I don't know why they feel that way. How can I know? Maybe they have a point, Patrick.
PATRICK: They only got a point if you believe they got a point, Sara.
SARA: I'm just saying that we should think about this, that's all.
PATRICK: That's a fuckin' 'nough.
SARA: Why are you getting mad?
PATRICK: Because I like to think for myself, run my own life, and I thought you did too.
SARA: You're never gonna run your own life as long as you keep running back to Malakai every time he fucks up or fucks you over.
PATRICK: First of all, Malakai ain't never fucked me over. Second of all, you don't know him, Sara, what he been through. Matter of fact, you don't know shit about none of it. So don't come off to me like you do.
SARA: I know he's lost, Patrick! Everybody but you can see that. And if you keep reaching back for him, you're gonna wind up lost too.
PATRICK: Who the fuck are you to say he's lost? Malakai had my back when you were busy gee-whizzin' in the woods with your backward-ass, redneck friends.
SARA: They weren't rednecks!
PATRICK: You know what?     The hell with you.
SARA: The hell with you too!
SARA: Hi.
PATRICK: Thought you might need this on Saturday. I ain't gonna be able to make it.
TONI: Lovers' quarrel? You're better off. That menace to society would've broken your heart and spent all your money in a news flash. Trust me on that, Sara.
SARA: Toni, listen carefully. You're a simple bitch and you don't have any friends, black or white, because nobody likes a fucking asshole.
ROY: I was wondering... how long you plan on hating me? Maybe I'm an optimist but I hope there's some kind of timetable. (this raises a small smile) Well, I don't wanna bug you. I just came in to say good luck.
ROY: I saw the return address. Got curious. It was open. I read it. I know I shouldn't have but at least now I have an excuse to tell you how proud I am of you, Sara.
SARA: (quietly miserable) I was gonna tell you about the audition, Roy. I meant to.
ROY: Tomorrow's the big day?
SARA: Uh-huh.   The big day.
ROY: You bummed out about it? (as she shakes her head) You're a worse liar than I am father.
SARA: You're not so bad. (close to a confession) I didn't give you much to work with. It's not like I've been the perfect daughter.
ROY: Well, it ain't like I deserve a perfect daughter. I screwed up. Did everything in a hurry and still thought I had all the time in the world. To be in love with your mother. Be a father to you. But time flies. You look up one day and all you got to show for yourself is a pretty little girl who hates your guts and won't talk to you because too much time went by.
SARA: I don't hate you. I miss her. I miss Mom... (as Roy takes her in his arms, tries to console her) ... Patrick's pissed at me. I'm pissed at him. He's not coming tomorrow and I want him there and I don't know what to do.
ROY: You want him there. I understand that. But whatever he brings to the table, Patrick can't dance for you, Sara. You're the bottom line out there. This is your chance to be the dancer Juilliard came to see.
SARA: I wanted somebody there who loves me.
ROY: I love you.
MALAKAI: Why his mom's cryin' like that? Arvel's gonna make it, right? That what's his nurse said. She told me herself, 'Your friend's gonna make it.' Did that bitch lie to me! Talk to me, Patrick! Is he gone?
PATRICK: They just got bad news, man. They don't need to hear it again. (trying to be strong; faltering) Arvel's fightin'. He's gonna pull through. Thing is, when he does, they don't think... he ain't... shit. Arvel ain't gonna walk again.
MALAKAI: I got a good reason now, man?
MALAKAI (CONT'D): (off Patrick's silence) Aw'ight, college boy. You do what you think is the right thing. I'ma do what I know is the only thing.
PATRICK: Malakai... (a fleeting hesitation) ... When it's on, I'll be there.
CHENILLE: Why you so quiet? (off Patrick's brooding look) Patrick Reynolds ain't got nothin' to say? That's a first. (catches her son with a whee!; then) You know how I go off on folks sometimes. I mean it and then I don't mean it. Like what I said to Sara. Guess she told you.
PATRICK: (monotone) I don't care what you said, Chenille.
CHENILLE: Patrick. Your ass is on your back and your lips are on the ground. You care, baby brother. And not just about what I said. (as he looks at her) You seriously like Sara. She got a serious jones for you. Am I lyin'?
PATRICK: It's besides the point. Whatever point it is you tryin' to make.
CHENILLE: I'm sayin' you can't help who you love, Patrick. At least you found somebody who loves you back.
PATRICK: I gotta go.
CHENILLE: To where? To who? Malakai? (sucks her teeth) You ain't through with that fool yet.
PATRICK: He's not a fool, Chenille.
CHENILLE: No. You know what? You're the fool, Patrick. You think you let Malakai down and all you did was try to pull yourself up. Ain't no blame or shame in that.
PATRICK: (very low; a broken smile) I still gotta go. Check you later.
KENNY: It cut me, what you said.
CHENILLE: (means this) I shouldn't have... I was trippin'.
KENNY: You always trip. I'm used to that. Besides, you were right. You were wrong, too. So was I. I need to do better. Ain't no doubt about that.
CHENILLE: I know I come down on you hard about money, but I would rather you spend the time. Seriously.
KENNY: (jokingly) So you don't want any money?
CHENILLE: I didn't say all that.
KENNY: I love my son, Chenille.    You know that, don't you?
CHENILLE: Yeah.   I always knew that.
PINCE-NEZ: Johnson.   Sara Johnson...
PATRICK: Pull over. (as Malakai glances at him, not understanding) This ain't helpin' nobody, 'Kai. I'm out. I mean it. Stop the car.
LIP: Awww, shit.      Here we go.
MALAKAI: (furious) What you mean you out? You think I'ma let your punk ass bail on me again?
PATRICK: What you gonna do, 'Kai? You gonna shoot me? Go ahead! You'll have to!
LIP: Let him out!   We don't need him.
MALAKAI: Shut the fuck up.
STERN JUDGE: You prepared a free-form?
SARA: Yes... sir... they have... my music.
JUDGE: Does it have a theme?
SARA: Yes.  Emo... (clears her throat) Emotion.
STERN JUDGE: Cue Johnson's music.
SARA: I'm sorry. I wasn't ready.       Can you start it over again?
STERN JUDGE: Are you ready now?
PATRICK (O.S.): Yes, sir.    She's ready.
PATRICK: You can do it. (because) Ain't nobody watchin' you but me.
SARA: I'm ready.
STERN JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen, please! (to Patrick) Young man! Get off the stage.
PATRICK: All due respect, if ya'll don't let this girl in, you're crazy!
SARA: Thank you.   Very much.
STERN JUDGE: Ms. Johnson!
STERN JUDGE: I can't say this on the record -- yet. But welcome to Juilliard.
