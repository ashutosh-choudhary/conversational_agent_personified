MORRIS: You hear that?
SPUD: Yes, I hear it.
MORRIS: Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an-hour, get across the street yesterday.
SPUD: I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
MORRIS: Y'wanna fix something, you should fix the pothole.  Yessir, they should be trussed up, thrown off some high building.
DOUG: Who's that?
MORRIS: Whoever spent ten, f'teen thousand dollars, a new traffic light, you could grow old, paint your house before it lets you cross the street, and then, not fix the pothole.
SPUD: What was wrong with the old traffic light?
DOUG: I'm glad you asked... I'll tell you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now: You want to bring business into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, no...
ANN: Morning, darling.
DOUG: Morning.
CARLA: Hi, Annie.
ANN: Morning, Carla.
MORRIS: ...the damn thing...
SPUD: No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...

JACK: Waal, no, th'traffic light's Doug's thing.  That's his thing, fine.
DOUG: Thank you, Jack, and...
JACK: But we got to talk about the pothole.
DOUG: Jack...
JACK: A public office is a public trust... This is why this is America.  Question is: who owns the street.
TOWNSMAN: Doc, those pills, y'gave me for my back? I'm not sure that they work.
DOC WILSON: Well, I'm not sure either, but y'don't hear me complain... come by th'office, end of th'afternoon.
TOWNSMAN: Thanks, Doc...
BILL: This is your movie, this is small town America.

WALT: Grace...
JOE: That's a real fault, I...
WALT: Grace.  Get Mr. White a manual typewriter. (to Joe) It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow.

WALT: Joe's been having some thoughts about the Old Mill Scene, Claire.
CLAIRE: What, what's there to think about? (pause) The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
WALT: Yes, but, Joe, Joe's been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "thoughts," about...
CLAIRE: How many times in your life do you get a speech like that?
WALT: Yeah.
CLAIRE: This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...half of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
WALT: Yes, yes, but...
CLAIRE: "...but still it rises up.  It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
WALT: Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...

JOE: So young, so unlined, so full of promise. (pause) So innocent.
ANN: I beg your pardon?
JOE: I quit.
ANN: You quit.
JOE: I quit the movie.
ANN: Why did you quit?
JOE: Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar.  I never could tell the truth.
ANN: Don't be so hard on yourself.
JOE: I just got kicked off my first movie.
ANN: Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
JOE: That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
ANN: It's in your play.
JOE: You like my play.
ANN: Yes.
JOE: Why?
ANN: It's about life.
JOE: Could you tell me when's the next train?
ANN: N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
ANN (CONT'D): (off his pause) No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
JOE: (hands her the script) It's about a man who gets a second chance.
CAL: Evening, Annie.
ANN: Evening, Cal. (to Joe) Would you tell me about it?
ANN: No, of course, you want to get out of town.
JOE: It's...
ANN: It's okay...

ANN: You know your line?
OWNER: "Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
ANN: Go you Huskies.
JOE: (of the clothing on the rack) They leave it out all night?
ANN: Not worth stealing.  Only thing in town worth something.  Stained glass window.
JOE: Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
ANN: First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
JOE: But why the dalmation?
ANN: It was either that, or a sardine.
ANN (CONT'D): You get what you pay for.
JOE: That's true.  You grow up here?
ANN: Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
JOE: Nice town.
ANN: You want to talk about it?
JOE: ...that...that he prayed for a second chance.  But...do you see?
ANN: Yes.
JOE: That, he says, there are no second chances...that he's been presented what he prayed for...and: he's ruined it.
ANN: Yes...
JOE: But, but but but...
ANN: No, no, I see...
JOE: That: in an act of...
ANN: Yes...
JOE: Of mercy...off...
ANN: I understand...
JOE: ...that...he sees that...
ANN: As the Old Mill goes around...
JOE: Of course, of course that's what I'm saying.  As the Old Mill goes around, he sees...
ANN: Of course.
JOE: ...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
ANN: That's that's that's that's beautiful.
JOE: And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
ANN: Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
JOE: And likewise.
ANN: Goodbye.
JOE: Goodbye.
ANN: (pause) Next train in'nt for two hours.
ANN (CONT'D): So that the Old Mill, the Old Mill represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
JOE: No, no.  Of course, that's exactly what it represents.
ANN: That whole...
JOE: The, the, the, the sanctity of everyday things...
ANN: Everyday things...yes.
JOE: For example, he's just come back from a fire and he...um... (he shakes his head) That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
ANN: I live there.
JOE: Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
ANN: Surest thing you know.
JOE: I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
ANN: That's what the swing is there fore...
JOE: (to himself) ...that's what the swing is there fore...that its purpose, isn't it...
ANN: ...I always thought so...
JOE: ...such a pleasant sound.
ANN: Mmm.
JOE: Cause, cause, it's...it's the simple things that...

JOE: What happened in 1973?
WALT: Don't run off.  Don't run off, we need you.  You know why?  You're why we're here.  Your script is why we're here... (of bag) Gimme that.  Big deal.  We fight a little bit? You show me a family that doesn't.  But we got something special.  What is it? We're here to make a movie.  Can't use the Old Mill.  Well, that happens.  What you got to do, you find the essence - what was it, that brought us here.  It wasn't a building, Joe, it was an idea. It was an essence - what is the essence of your story?  Joe?
JOE: It's about a man who gets a second chance.
WALT: Then, you write that.  And then this is our second chance.  That's why we're here.
JOE: I want to make a good film.
WALT: I know you do.
JOE: And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
WALT: Hey, it's with the G-ds.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not. (shrugs) And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet?

ANN: What are they offering?
DOUG: Ten thousand dollars.
ANN: That's so beautiful...
DOUG: I beg your pardon?
ANN: "The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  Although it is altered..."
DOUG: Sure, but... ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they... this movie is budgeted at fifty million dol...they're coming up here, offer us a meal...

DOUG: Cal.  I want a city council meeting.
MAYOR: ...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party... City Council?  What's the trouble?
DOUG: Main Street.
MAYOR: (sighs) Doug, the traffic light...
DOUG: Fuck the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture.
JOE: Hi.

ANN: I love your script.
JOE: What?
POSTMAN: (as he delivers mail to Ann) Mornin', Annie...
ANN: See you at rehearsal tonight?
POSTMAN: "In the name of justice, sir, I bid you pause; for she is our Queen..."
JOE: In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving them a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
ANN: You'd know better'n me.
JOE: How can you say that?
ANN: It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You can go back..."
JOE: I can?
ANN: You bet your life. (refers to script) "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
JOE: But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill" when I don't have an old mill?
ANN: Well, first, you got to change the title.
WALT: (to A.D.) No, he doesn't want to work out with Waterford Huskies...Because he's Bob Barrenger...Call up his girl in Aspen, have 'em ship his weight...Yeah, well, fine, he's not gonna do the Pond scene unless he can work out.  Call up his girl in Aspen, and have her ship the weights out...
WALT (CONT'D): Who designed these costumes?  Who designed these costumes?  It looks like Edith Head puked and that puke designed these costumes.  Get Madge.
SECRETARY: (to A.D.) Your wife is on the phone.
WALT: I have no wife.
WALT (CONT'D): (calling out) We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
UBERTO: (entering with storyboards) Wally, I got to takes out the window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
COSTUME DESIGNER: ...Claire's got a problem.
UBERTO: Wally, if I hafes a moment of your time, look at these storyboards.  THIS SHOOT, I can't shoot this shot, you want.
WALT: Why?
UBERTO: Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or can I lose the shot.
WALT: No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the film is in that shot.
UBERTO: But, Wally, the window of the firehut...
WALT: I don't care.  Fix it.
WALT (CONT'D): (of sketches) You show Claire these sketches?
COSTUME DESIGNER: Yes.
WALT: Did she throw up?
COSTUME DESIGNER: That isn't very nice.
WALT: Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
COSTUME DESIGNER: I can't tell.
WALT: Why not?
COSTUME DESIGNER: She won't stop crying...
WALT: (to an A.D.) Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of Lilacs to send to the broad.
FIRST A.D.: Towns out of Lilacs.
WALT: You go in her room, take the Lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap 'em up, and get a card from Marty. (to costume designer) What's her problem?
COSTUME DESIGNER: She doesn't want to bare her breasts.
WALT: She doesn't want to bare her breasts...what, in the "nude scene?" What are we paying her three mil for?
COSTUME DESIGNER: She's got "religion."
WALT: Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
WALT (CONT'D): Claire?...Claire? (to Uberto) Just figure out how to take the shot. Claire...Claire?  It's Wally. (pause) May I come in?
WALT: (softly) What is it, Pal...?
WALT (CONT'D): What...?
CLAIRE: I can't do it, Walt.
WALT: You can't do what?
CLAIRE: It isn't right.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
WALT: Forget the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
CLAIRE: I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...what are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha... wha... I try to be good.  The only thing I care about is...
WALT: I know that...
CLAIRE: Is...is the MOVIE!
WALT: I know that, Claire.  I, we all know...
CLAIRE: Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
WALT: ...no, they don't.
CLAIRE: ...they treat me like a child.  I, I...to bare my body.
WALT: Now, look.  Claire: Listen to me. (he takes her hand in his) I want to tell you a story.
WALT (CONT'D): Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
WALT: Who are these from?
PROD. ASST.: Marty.
WALT: Well that's very thoughtful of him. Elanora Duse...
CLAIRE: ...I can't do it, Wally...
WALT: Listen to me.  Elanora Duse was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist.  I'll do four shows a week." (pause) The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
CLAIRE: (pause; softly) What?
WALT: Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
WALT: Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
WALT (CONT'D): ...I know...I know...
CLAIRE: (pause) ...and, and, and did she?  And she did the seven shows?
WALT: No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
CLAIRE: Wally...
WALT: I know, I know.
WALT (CONT'D): I know, it's the hardest thing in the world.  And it seems everybody wants...
CLAIRE: Yes...
WALT: ...wants a piece...
CLAIRE: Yes...
WALT: And you know what?
CLAIRE: We, we have to give it.
WALT: (nods) ...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
WALT: That, that's your life's blood on the st...
FIRST A.D.: I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies, she'd bare her breasts to do voice over.
WALT: Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
WALT: We're very upset with her.  Get someone to double for her, her tits, the tits scene.  Call L.A.  I want to see some pictures of the women's tits.  Of their tits.
FIRST A.D.: I'm very sorry I...
WALT: You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch!  Can we replace him?
BILL: We start shooting in three days.
COSTUME DESIGNER: You want to see the fireman's costumes? Cause I found this Moleskin for the collar, it's not black, but it looks black...  it's not brown, but...
SECRETARY: Marty Rossen's touched down.
JOE: (beat) What I need to say...
ANN: Yes...
JOE: About conflict...
ANN: That's why you didn't want to take the Mill out...you've...
JOE: ...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
ANN: The Firehouse...
ANN: But but but but but it's better without...
JOE: How...?
ANN: Wait wait wait wait wait he get's a second chance, do you see?  And you get a second chance!
JOE: No, I don't...
ANN: (as she holds the script) He doesn't go back to the mill, he gets a second chance to go back to the firehouse...
ANN (CONT'D): You don't need the Mill.  This is what (she gestures at the script) you see: this is what you are.  This is what the script is saying... (a person walks by) Hi, Emma, see you tonight?
ANN (CONT'D): This is, look: (to Emma) Go you Huskies. (to Joe) ...what I see you saying, is: you have the two elements, Fire and Water.  The Firehouse, and the Old Mill...do you know, you could...
JOE: What are you doing tonight?
ANN: Me?
JOE: Yes.
ANN: Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
JOE: ...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.

BOB: Yeah.  Come in.
BOB (CONT'D): I'm just...
CARLA: The prices are going up.
BOB: But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
BOB (CONT'D): Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
CARLA: I don't eat vegetables.
BOB: Well, I can offer you something to drink?
CARLA: Sure, what have you got?
BOB: What do you drink?
CARLA: Bourbon and milk.
BOB: How old are you?
BOB (CONT'D): Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone I gave you this.
CARLA: I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
BOB: Nice town that you've got here.
CARLA: You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
BOB: ...wouldn't that be dangerous?
CARLA: ...not if you've got something to hold on to.
UBERTO: Because if you cannot tells me what is it, how I, how does I take a pictures of it?  Wally wants me, push in through the weendow...
JOE: Yeah, no, can I...if you'd excuse me, I've just got to...

ANN: That's for sure.
JOE: What happened?
ANN: Cast stood me up.
JOE: Uh huh.

DOUG: No. (pause) No, but we're planning to.
FIRST A.D.: (pause) Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
DOUG: Yes.
MARTY: I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat. My thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now: what is this you want Eight hundred Thousand Dollars to do what you're being paid to, you already signed you'd do...? (pause) What is that?

CLAIRE: I love Jewish men.
JOE: Why?
CLAIRE: You know...where's your bathroom?
JOE: You liked the script, huh...?
DOUG: (still carrying bouquet of flowers) Where have you been?

DOUG: Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?

ANN: The other side.
JOE: Oh.
ANN: Don't you think you should put them in water.
JOE: Why?
ANN: ...because if you don't, they die.
ANN (CONT'D): Shouldn't we start?
JOE: Start?  This isn't a good time.

CLAIRE: We had a script conference.
JOE: I told her thank you very much, but it was inconvenient because, uh, because...
ANN: You can do it.
JOE: Because I'd met someone else.
ANN: (very simply) Oh, okay.
JOE: You believe that?
ANN: I do if you do.
JOE: But it's absurd.
ANN: So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
JOE: Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
ANN: I used to go out with a politician.
JOE: You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
ANN: Sure did.
JOE: Why?
ANN: Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
JOE: Yes.

MARTY: What is that?
SHERRY: The house, the 1835.  The original kitchen, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
MARTY: It's lovely.
SHERRY: A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies.
MARTY: My oh my.
SHERRY: I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...

MAYOR: ...he's the producer of the movie.
DOUG: (to Marty) I want you to hear this, pal... (consults notebook) Forget the overages, forget Ten Thousand Dollars, for three days to two weeks. You know what it would cost for them to build this set? (pause) Two Million Dollars!  Now:

DOUG: Now:  The Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
SHERRY: Don't tell me you're out of Wallpaper.
PAINTER: I told you, we could have it by Wednesday...

PAINTER: Waal, if you ordered something common...
SHERRY: Something common?  I'm going to give you something common.  I'm going to give you an injunction, is what I...Mister Mayor.
DOUG: Huh.  Well, the Waterford Merchant's Association demands, through me as their council, five percent of the profits of the movie, as figured by and... (checks his notebook) geared to the most favorable definition of profits of either A) the Producer...
DOUG (CONT'D): Why, you little sheeny...
MORRIS: "Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
SPUD: Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
MORRIS: You think so?
SPUD: Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
JOE: Cuppa coffee, and a...
JACK: With you inna moment.  I'm a little short-handed.
MORRIS: Where's Carla?

ANN: What's the scene...
JOE: It used to be the Old Mill.
ANN: What've you got?
JOE: They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
JACK (O.S.): Annie, you want something to eat?
ANN: What's the scene about...?
JOE: It's good to see you, too...
JACK: Annie?
ANN: What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling you how to wr...
JOE: Please...
ANN: How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes up to her.  "What happened to the horse?"  She looks at him.  She takes his hand...
JOE: Ah, ah, ah...
ANN: I hurt you?
MORRIS: What happened to his finger?
ANN: It was burnt.
MORRIS: Mmm.
ANN: And then it was really hurt.
JOE: Ah, ah, ah.  That's what she says, that's what she says.  He says, "Sister, I've come from a fire..."  But she, but she, she says it was not the fire which hurt you...it...
MORRIS: ...how was it hurt?
ANN: ...he stuck a fishhook in it. (Morris nods)
JOE: She realizes -- it was not the fire which hurt him...that the true hurt was her.  Was her...
ANN: ...yes.
JOE: ...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
ANN: ...yes.
JOE: Has been wounded by her heat...by her infidelities...
JACK: Anybody here seen Carla?
JOE: Because, because, because if it's about purity, it's...it's...and then, then, you don't need the nude scene.
ANN: Because it's about purity...
JOE: That's...that's exactly what it's about. Take...
ANN: That's right...
JOE: ...take any two people...
JACK: ...anybody seen my daughter...?
JOE: ...take you and me...
WALT: (on phone) ...the finest people you could ever hope to work with... (to First A.D.) You have the new Old Mill pages?

WALT: Not now.
FIRST A.D.: My wife is going to have a baby, and...
WALT: Oh, that's great.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
WALT (CONT'D): Take it off.  Take that stupid fucking shirt off right now. (into phone) Well, if I had to say one thing, I would say it's purity.
WALT (CONT'D): (to P.A.) Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
CLAIRE: What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
WALT: I, uh... (into phone) I've always thought so... (beat) Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form. (to Claire) I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting... (opens door) Bill: get a copy of that letter...! (closes door) I just wanted to tell you that I am past chagrined, I'm mortified at the way you were spoken to...
WALT: An artist of your caliber...
CLAIRE: I'm only trying to...
WALT: I know what you are, I am so sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
CLAIRE: The minute I read that script I said...
WALT: I know...
CLAIRE: ...she works with animals, she...
WALT: ...yes...
CLAIRE: ...she has a home...
WALT: ...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community respects her. (beat) Please don't go. (pause) Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, toil...when are we free of them...? (pause) When...?
CLAIRE: He treated me as if I were a child...
WALT: Claire: (pause) As an interpretive artist to a creative artist: (pause) Stay with me. (pause) I need you. (pause) We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to us.  Stay. (pause) Stay.

CLAIRE: I'm sorry, Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
WALT: (into phone) Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...any time... (hangs up the phone) What does the woman want from life?
MARTY: She wants eight-hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
WALT: Pay her off.
MARTY: We don't have the money.
WALT: Find it.
MARTY: If you do the product placement...
WALT: It's a computer company...IT'S A

JOE: She doesn't show her tits!!! She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
MARTY: The breasts symbolize motherhood...
JOE: The movie's about purity.  So we don't show her breasts.  We show them to him. She keeps her back to the camera.
WALT: ...she keeps her back to the camera?
BILL: It'll hurt the box-office.
JOE: They know what her tits look like.
WALT: Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse scene.
JOE: I'm gonna nail it.
WALT: I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
MARTY: We got the permit.

MORRIS: He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
SPUD: I read for that part.  Did pretty good, too.

WALT: She wasn't in...you were al...
MARTY: There's no witnesses.
WALT: No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
BOB: No, I just...just Joe, just Joe...
WALT: Joe, the writer?
BOB: Just him and me.
MARTY: Then she wasn't in the car.  Say it.
BOB: She wasn't in the...
MARTY: Nobody knows it but us.  Alright?  It says here... (to group) Are we together on this? (beat, each nods) Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
MARTY (CONT'D): (to First A.D. and Joe) You guys had better leave us a...

BOB: I was alone in the car.  I was driving.
CAL: Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, but...
MARTY: I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
CAL: ...I have to give you this ticket for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
MARTY: (beat) You have to what?
CAL: It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and... (apologetically he hands the ticket to Bob) They'll, uh, these things happen, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
MARTY: Well, officer, don't worry ab...

JOE: Hi.
ANN: Hi.
JOE: Where you going?
ANN: Going home.
JOE: Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
ANN: (over a clap of thunder) What?
JOE: I told them what you said about the script...
ANN: I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
JOE: ...how else can you talk?
ANN: No, that's true.
JOE: No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
ANN: Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
JOE: Is it...
ANN: Yep, n'it's for sale. (pause) One of the few things money can buy.
JOE: I told them what you said about the script...
ANN: Would you like to see it?  I've got the key back at my store...
JOE: I'd love to.
ANN: How's your star?
JOE: Gosh, you look nice.
ANN: ...what...?
JOE: What would you do with it, the printshop...
ANN: Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans.
JOE: Yes, it's a lovely idea...
ANN: Print it right here.
ANN (CONT'D): Oh, my. (pause) Life in the country.  One second.
ANN (CONT'D): Well.  There you go.
ANN (CONT'D): Press still works.
JOE: It does?
ANN: Did as of last week.
ANN (CONT'D): Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
JOE: You'd do the newspaper right here.
ANN: That's something a man could do...?
JOE: You know what else a man can do?
ANN: What?
ANN (CONT'D): One moment...
JOE: Pelting down out there.
ANN: People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
ANN: Left the keys inside, in my jacket.
JOE: Well.  'S'pose I should be getting home...look.
ANN: Cal...
CAL: Annie, got an umbrella?
ANN: Nope.
CAL: I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
ANN: Then you'll be wet.
CAL: I'm goin' off-shift.  Come on... I'll walk you home.
DOUG: Ten dollars apiece for outdated textbooks you or I could buy retail for a dollar ninety-five.
DOC WILSON: Mornin', Carla...how's the itching...?
CARLA: Okay, Doc.
DOUG: Bear with me, now -- because what're we getting for our money?  See the cat and dog?  See what I'm saying?  Nice to take this opportunity to mount an investigation of...
MAUDE: Morning, Carla, what happened to you?
DOC WILSON: She went to fetch a pail of water.
DOUG: (to merchant) You see what I'm saying, take this opportunity to mount an investigation of the price of school textbooks.  Bear with me now: both the cost, and the content of...look here...
DOUG (CONT'D): ...because what're we getting for our money?  "See the nice dog.  See the nice cat?"
WALT: So you see what I'm saying...the movie is about purity...
BOB: I've always seen that.
WALT: We don't show her breasts, we just show your reaction...
CLAIRE: I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't tell you...
WALT: Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
CARLA: And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
MARTY: (hands her a bill) Thank you.
CARLA: I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
MARTY: I think he's moved...
CARLA: I, uh... (pause) Um...
BOB: That makes a lot of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't coming to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you act.  What are you doin' this evening?
CLAIRE: I'm having dinner with W...
WALT: We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
BOB: You mind...?
CLAIRE: No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
WALT: Marty...
MARTY: Yeah?
WALT: Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can get away, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food. (to Joe) You want...
JOE: I've got a date.
WALT: He's got a date.  He's got a date, is this guy fantastic...? Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find!
FIRST A.D.: (on phone; sotto) I'm trying, honey.  I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your mom coming?  Oh. (pause) What did the midwife...?
WALT: Did you, where are we going tonight?
WALT: Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule?  Where are we booked tonight?
FIRST A.D.: My wife's having a baby.
WALT: You what...?  Is that on the call sheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that personal business?  Ah, Christ. Marty...are we paying you?
DOUG: She didn't even finish knitting me the sweater...
BARTENDER: Mornin', Doc...
DOC WILSON: You doin' here, Doug?  Thought you started out the day with that pernicious caffeine...
DOUG: Kiss my ass.
DOC WILSON: Well.
BARTENDER: He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
DOC WILSON: Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
BARTENDER: Big day last night.
DOC WILSON: Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
BARTENDER: Mornin', Carla.
CARLA: Mornin', Uncle Ron.
DOC WILSON: Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden, three times inna night.
BARTENDER: That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
DOUG: Who got their heads cut?
BARTENDER: ...some fella.  Orders a Manhattan.
DOC WILSON: What?
DOUG: Who got their heads cut?
DOC WILSON: Uh, Bob Barrenger, fella, Cameraman...
DOUG: You said three...
DOC WILSON: Did I?  I think you're mistaken.
CARLA: I wasn't in the car...
DOUG: We're going to s...
JACK: Doug, she says that she wasn't in the c...
SALESMAN: Yeah?
DOUG: (beat) I've got the wrong room.
DOUG (CONT'D): (to Cal) Arrest him.
MARTY: What is the...?
DOUG: Arrest him.
CAL: For what...?
DOUG: (beat) Conspiracy in Statutory Rape.
MARTY: Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
DOUG: This young woman.
CARLA: Nobody touched me, I was at home.
MARTY: (to Carla) Who is it raped you?
CARLA: Nobody.
MARTY: Well, what's the beef?
DOUG: She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
MARTY: You were in the car with Bob?
CARLA: No.
MARTY: Then what is the...?
MARTY: Now what is this, you sonofabitch! Because if you haven't heard about the laws of Malicious Prosecution, you're about to.  DON'T FLINCH WHILE I'M
TALKING TO YOU, YOU TWO BIT SPEEDTRAP: FRAUD: There's an old saying, two scariest things in the world, a black man with a knife and a Jew with a lawyer.  Now, I am a lawyer, and I am the Jew, and you continue ONE MOMENT with this slanderous shit here in this public place, I'm going to have your ass over my mantleplace.  THE KID WAS NOT IN
THE CAR, SHE SAYS THAT SHE WASN'T IN THE: WITH YOU HERE, YOU MOTHERFUCKER.  Look in my eyes: I made eleven million bucks last year and I don't like being trifled with.  Now I think that the better part of valor, though we've got your back up here...the better part of valor is to step away.  Or, before G-d, I will see you disbarred. (beat) Now, what do you think? (beat) We all have a movie to make.  Now, can we stay together here...? (pause) What do you say?  Have a cigar.
MARTY: It's a mistake.  It's all over. (to Carla) I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
CARLA: I wasn't in the car.
MARTY: We know that you weren't.
CLAIRE: ...because you treat me like a child...you treat me like a child... that's why I can't come...
CARLA: He took advantage of me.
MARTY: ...upset and impressionable. (to the A.D.) Get me the Mayor.
BOB: (to Carla) ...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
MARTY: ...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
BOB: (to Carla) I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
MARTY: And a fantasy object...
DOUG: (to Cal) Tell him to get dressed...
CAL: Uh, sir...
MARTY: (takes lawbooks) Wally?
WALT: Look, Carla, this is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...and we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you.
CAL: Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, but...
WALT: Here this dream world has come to you. Now, you obviously have an active, a vivid imagination.
CARLA: Her...
BOB: I swear that that woman in my room...
WALT: Be quiet, Bob.  A fertile mind.  Now we can use that kind of people in our work. Yes, we can.  Now, and this is what occurs to me... There's a part in the film...isn't that right, Marty?
MARTY: Mmm.
WALT: That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
MARTY: (of the book) Here it is: Statutory r...blah, blah, blah, blah... "statutory"... "unsupported testimony by the..." (he shows the book to Doug) Hold on, Bobby. (to Doug) You've got nothing and you know it.  By G-d, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a... even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car.  And you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film. (to Carla) Yes, we'd love to have you... Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
MARTY (CONT'D): Isn't that right?  I'm sorry that you all went to this...
JACK: I knew she wasn't in the car.
MARTY: This has been just an unfortunate.
WALT: (into phone) Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate... (he covers the phone) It's the Mayor, he's saying...
MARTY: Is he cool or angry?
MAYOR: Well, these things happen.  Purpose of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of cigarettes Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary requirements...
WALT: (hangs up phone) So we just got lucky.
BILL: Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast.  He needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
MARTY: And I need a drink.
WALT: (to Bob) If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
BOB: How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
WALT: Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
BOB: I'm ready!
WALT: Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
BOB: What'll I do for fun?
MARTY: Whyn't you learn your lines?
BOB: I know my lines...
WALT: You do...?
BOB: I just don't know what order they come in...
WALT: I tell you what, let's ditch these cockamamie locals.  I need to get outta here.  Go to some roadhouse tonight, just us.  Claire, Bob, siddown, have a bottle of wine.  Tell me where we're going, and let's go.
MAYOR: Well, you must, where did they... where...I...
DOUG: Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
FIRST A.D.: My wife just went into labor...
DOUG: Half a buck I'd close it down.  It's per...you know...it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls.
FIRST A.D.: He should be put in jail.
DOUG: Half a buck I'd put him in jail.
FIRST A.D.: You should.
DOUG: I had a witness, I would.
FIRST A.D.: A witness to what?
DOUG: You know, the rape, to...even to the accident.
FIRST A.D.: You mean with White?
DOUG: What?
FIRST A.D.: You mean you need a witness in addition to White?
DOUG: Who's White?
FIRST A.D.: The writer.
DOUG: (beat) He saw the accident...?
FIRST A.D.: Sure.
DOUG: He saw the girl in the car...
FIRST A.D.: You bet he did.
SHERRY: Don't you touch that... I want them gone.
MAYOR: I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
SHERRY: I want them thrown in jail.
MAYOR: Sherry, Sherry...
MAYOR (CONT'D): (into phone) What? (he jiggles the receiver) Get me the State Police.
JOE: Good morning.
ANN: Sleep well?
JOE: Yeah, you?
ANN: Oh yeah...
JOE: We could live up here, live up in the country.
ANN: Now you're talking...
JOE: And we could get up every morning...
ANN: ...well, we do that anyway...
JOE: And come to the printshop.  You know why?
JOE (CONT'D): To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to write.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
ANN: Not without a rolltop desk.
JOE: Well, I could get a rolltop desk.
ANN: Happen to know where there's one for sale.
JOE: Well ain't you amazing.
ANN: Lookit that, up already.
JOE: That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
TV REPORTER: Where Movie Star Bob Barrenger, fresh from his troubles with the law last year...
TV REPORTER (CONT'D): ...is once again in hot water.  Involved in a car crash last night with a young, a very young woman, Mr. Barrenger is being arrested today for...
MARTY: You better make sure you got your facts straight, pal, cause, you step off the line and I'm going to sue you personally for...
TROOPER: We're looking for a Joseph Turner White.
MARTY: Oh, good, yes.  Good morning.  Where are you taking Mr. Barrenger?
TROOPER: We are looking for a Mr. Joseph Turner White?
MARTY: What are you doing with Mr. Barrenger?
DOUG: He's under arrest.
MARTY: Oh, good.  I'm his lawyer...and you must be Perry Mason.  Guess what, you're about one-half step from a world of hurt...how diverting...the Mayor's gonna have your ass.  Can I watch?
DOUG: Well, you guess what.  The Mayor sent me.  I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
MARTY: ...a history of nothing, he was acquitted.
DOUG: Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend.  I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
MARTY: You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
DOUG: And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
MARTY: He told you that!?
DOUG: He didn't have to tell.
MARTY: I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
DOUG: Oh, you're his attorney, too?
MARTY: Later for you, pal.
DOUG: Okay.
MARTY: Bobby, don't say anything.
BOB: Nothing happened.
DOUG: We'll see about that at the inquest.
MARTY: Yeah, hi, pal.  I need to talk to you.
ANN: What is it all about?
JOE: I saw...
MARTY: How do they know that, you told them?
JOE: No.
MARTY: What did you say to them?
JOE: I didn't say anything to them.
MARTY: How do you know you saw it?
JOE: I don't know.
MARTY: Well, then, you didn't see it, right?
JOE: I don't...
MARTY: You didn't see it...
JOE: I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
MARTY: You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
JOE: (as he reads) I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
MARTY: What glasses were you wearing? (pause) Were you wearing your reading glasses?
MARTY: You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
MARTY (CONT'D): I've got to go to the jail.
ANN: ...he's going to give you a couple of minutes.
JOE: What am I gonna do?
ANN: You got to tell 'em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
JOE: I can't do that. (pause) If I tell them, they'll, if I tell them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll... it'll ruin his career...
ANN: But that's what happened.
JOE: But it'll stop the movie.
ANN: Maybe they'll be other movies.
JOE: They'll...they'll blackball me.
ANN: Carla was in the car, right?
JOE: I...I think that's right.
ANN: ...you think that's right...
JOE: What'm I gonna do?
CAL: Lotta hubbub on the street.  I'm taking you the back way.
WALT: (checks watch) Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
JOE: You want me to lie.
WALT: To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth. (pause) The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  IF you aren't sure, then they have nothing. Bob walks free.  As he should. (pause) Joe: wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart, you know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roost, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself...If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex. (pause) And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll direct the third one.  You are a part of this world.  You have to do the right thing: we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, literally is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line.  You have to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
CAL: ...Joseph Turner White...
BAILIFF: Hear ye, hear ye.  Sixth District Court. And for the county of Kadona, State of Vermont, the honorable James Addison Flynn presiding.  All those having business before this court, draw forward and you will be heard.
BAILIFF (CONT'D): All rise.

JUDGE (CONT'D): Uh huh, all we need's a simple fact or to...you're going to give your recollection of the accident last evening, at the corner, State and Main. Would you please swear him in.
BAILIFF: Do you swear to tell the truth...
TV REPORTER: (talking into camera) ...the arraignment, as we said of Bob Barrenger, The Bob Barrenger, star of "The Old Mill," about to begin shooting here, in picaresque and sleepy... (sound of shouting, and reporter looks around) we should say, formerly sleepy...Yes, yes, it's...yes, it's Claire Wellesley, and we're going to try to get a look at...
P.A.: (to Joe) They need those rewrites on the "Old Mill" scene...
SCOTT: ...about his personal life, though I can tell you a few things about...
JOE: Would you please hold all calls to my room?
SCOTT: Though I can tell you a few things about his dietary requirements.
KID ON SCOOTER: Mornin', Doc.
DOC WILSON: Mornin', Billy, where ya goin' in such a hurry?
KID ON SCOOTER: Down the corner, see the ruckus...
DOC WILSON: Watch the curbs, now...
DOC WILSON (CONT'D): (of his suitcase) Where you off to?
JOE: I, uh...I'm leaving...
DOC WILSON: Why?
JOE: I perjured myself. (pause) I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did. (shrugs) I don't suppose you could help me with that, could you?  Turn back the clock, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my purity, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you?  But what is truth? Eh?  Ain't that the thing?  What is true?
DOC WILSON: It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's s'posed to point down to accentuate the genitals, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his ears?
JOE: Aren't you supposed to set an example for people?
DOC WILSON: Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands while they die.  What'd you say your problem was?
JOE: I just swore my life away, back in that...
DOC WILSON: (as he sees an older woman off on a porch to the side) Mornin', Chessy, how's the back?
JOE: I ruined my life.  Isn't that funny, that you can actually do it in one moment just like they say.  I ruined my life back in that courthouse.
BELLHOP: What courthouse?
JOE: Courthouse back in town.
BELLHOP: Town ain't got no courthouse.
