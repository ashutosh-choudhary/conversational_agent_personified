CONSTABLE ONE: Where are you?! MAN'S VOICE (o.s.) Here!  Over here!
MAN: I need your help with this.
CONSTABLE ONE: Constable Crane?  Ichabod Crane... is that you?
ICHABOD: Yes, it is me.  But, not only me... (lifting, struggling) I found someone here...
ICHABOD: Someone quite dead.
HIGH CONSTABLE: Burn it.
CONSTABLE ONE: Yes, sir.
ICHABOD: Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
HIGH CONSTABLE: He drowned.  Anyone could see.
ICHABOD: There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
HIGH CONSTABLE: He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
ICHABOD: I could determine if he were dead before he went into the Hudson.
HIGH CONSTABLE: Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
MAGISTRATE: Yes, must we?
ICHABOD: There is nothing heretical about science, sir.  The Chinese have written on it for hundreds of years... procedural study used to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.
ICHABOD: Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
HIGH CONSTABLE: Have they nothing to fear presently?
ICHABOD: Without disrespect, look around you. (motioning to cells) We overflow.  As do our courts.
HIGH CONSTABLE: And, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
ICHABOD: But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
HIGH CONSTABLE: Very few, if any.
ICHABOD: Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
HIGH CONSTABLE: For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
ICHABOD: Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
MAGISTRATE: (to High Constable) Um, sir... might I suggest...
HIGH CONSTABLE: (to Ichabod) There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off. (holds up papers) The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
ICHABOD: Chosen me?
HIGH CONSTABLE: These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
ICHABOD: Not for lack of trying.
HIGH CONSTABLE: Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
ICHABOD: (swallowing doubt) I shall, gladly.
HIGH CONSTABLE: Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
HIGH CONSTABLE: Oh, and, Constable... (off Ichabod's look) Do make certain that you meet with success.  Otherwise... perhaps you should not come back at all.
BLINDFOLDED WOMAN: This is such a silly game.
BROM: Be a sport and stop complaining.
LITTLE GIRL: Play along.  You must.
BLINDFOLDED WOMAN: There, I have someone.  Am I finished?
LITTLE GIRL: You have to tell who it is.
LITTLE GIRL: At least make a guess.
BLINDFOLDED WOMAN: I don't know.  Is it Brom Bones?
BROM: Certainly not.
ICHABOD: Excuse me, Miss... (takes her hands) They have a laugh at your expense.
KATRINA: Forgive me, I didn't know.
ICHABOD: I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
BROM: We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
ICHABOD: Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
BROM: You need some manners.
KATRINA: Brom! MAN'S VOICE (o.s.) What is this, then... ?
BALTUS: Can I help you, sir?
ICHABOD: I have been sent from the city with a letter of introduction. I am told you offer me room and board.
ICHABOD: If we could speak alone.
BALTUS: (nods, looks to Katrina) This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
KATRINA: They're only children, father.
BALTUS: That will be all, ladies. (waits as they exit) We are joined by Doctor Thomas Lancaster, Constable.  And to his left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse, both keeping order in their own ways.
BALTUS: I myself am in charge of financial matters and the regulation of currency in our commonwealth.  And, lastly, this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook, our Notary.
ICHABOD: An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
DOCTOR LANCASTER: Excuse me?
ICHABOD: I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
DOCTOR LANCASTER: I was afraid of this.
PHILIPSE: Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
ICHABOD: The militia?
FATHER STEENWYCK: Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
ICHABOD: All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
FATHER STEENWYCK: The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
HARDENBROOK: Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
ICHABOD: Pardon me?
BALTUS: You have not been well informed of our troubles, sir.  If you would...
BALTUS: The Horseman... he was a Hessian mercenary, sent to our shores by German princes to help keep Americans under the thumb of England.  However, unlike his compatriots who came as muscle in trade for currency, he came willingly.  For love of carnage. BALTUS (v.o.) He was infamous for taking his horse, Daredevil, hard into battle... chopping off heads at full gallop. BALTUS (v.o.) Just to look on him made your blood run cold, for he had filed down his teeth to rapiers... to add to the ferocity of his appearance.
PHILIPSE: Cut off his head with his own sword. It's a legend told for twenty years.
BALTUS: But, only recently has the Headless Hessian been seen prowling the Hollow, in search of a head to suit his shoulders.
ICHABOD: Just a moment... (sits back, incredulous) Are you saying it is he?
HARDENBROOK: (aggravated, loud) When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
DOCTOR LANCASTER: No one knows why he chose to now to climb out from his grave.
FATHER STEENWYCK: It is very clear why.  Citizens here have long tried to hide sins behind closed doors.  Their failed faith has saturated the soil and called forth one of Satan's own.
ICHABOD: Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
BALTUS: Many have.
ICHABOD: Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
ICHABOD: While I will do everything I can to find your assassin, I will look for a man of flesh and blood.  Not some goblin-demon from hell.
PHILIPSE: Gather round!  Gather and quiet! The hour has come to choose for this night.  Each man's name is in this box and has been checked.
PHILIPSE: May the Lord watch over him... (unfolds paper) "Jonathan Masbath."  Are you here? JONATHAN (o.s.) I am.  I take my responsibility.
YOUNG MASBATH: No, father.  Wait... (up to Philipse) He's already been up once.  Why does he go again?
JONATHAN: It is a lottery, son.  It just as easily might have been one of them.
YOUNG MASBATH: Then... I go with you.
JONATHAN: No.  You obey my wishes. (looks to crowd) Brom.  Look after him, will you?
PHILIPSE: Someone leave him a horse.
ICHABOD: You worry for naught, little man. Nothing will harm him there. (looks up, sotto) It is problems here on the ground you people need begin to worry about.
KATRINA: Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
ICHABOD: Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
KATRINA: You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
ICHABOD: Feel free to form your own opinion. (facing his ledger) Though it appears you already have.
KATRINA: Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse. (getting up to go) I'll leave you to your business.
ICHABOD: Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
KATRINA: Other people?
ICHABOD: Small talk.
KATRINA: It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
KATRINA: Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
ICHABOD: Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
KATRINA: My suitor?
ICHABOD: The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
KATRINA: He has proposed to me twice.
ICHABOD: Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
KATRINA: I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
ICHABOD: Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
JONATHAN: Come out, devil... come....
KATRINA: Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
ICHABOD: Are you so superstitious?
KATRINA: To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
ICHABOD: There is no such thing as magic.
KATRINA: Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
ICHABOD: Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
KATRINA: (laughs) You are funny.
BALTUS: Constable, where are you going!?
BALTUS: Come back, sir... (watches him go) Madness.
ICHABOD: The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
PHILIPSE: And now Jonathan Masbath.
ICHABOD: (looks back, ponders) Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
PHILIPSE: He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
PHILIPSE: Van Ripper there...
PHILIPSE: ... found the body this morning. (pause) You do believe now, don't you?
ICHABOD: Believe?
LADY VAN TASSEL: You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
ICHABOD: It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
PHILIPSE: You need less big words, and more common sense.
ICHABOD: What is that you wear?
PHILIPSE: My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
ICHABOD: Well... so much for common sense.
BALTUS: Was this Jonathan's?
BROM: Yes.  Seems he panicked across here and broke two legs.
ICHABOD: Who took the meat?
BALTUS: Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
ICHABOD: These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
BROM: There's only one Lenape.  He eats small animals and lost children... and the occasional constable when he can get it.
ICHABOD: Why did you move the body, Doctor?
DOCTOR LANCASTER: To place it inside its coffin.
BROM: What the hell are you doing?
ICHABOD: (ignoring pause) You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
BROM: Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
ICHABOD: Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
VAN RIPPER: I can show exactly.
VAN RIPPER: Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
ICHABOD: To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
ICHABOD: There was not much blood, was there?
VAN RIPPER: I didn't see none.
ICHABOD: No bleeding.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: What is that?
ICHABOD: This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
ICHABOD: It instantly burnt the wound shut.
ICHABOD: I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
YOUNG MASBATH: Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
ICHABOD: I manage fine alone.
YOUNG MASBATH: I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
ICHABOD: (faces Masbath) Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
YOUNG MASBATH: (angry) I did not ask you to, did I?
BALTUS: Hail, Constable.  How are you?
ICHABOD: Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: (still using spyglass) We must be a curious sight to him.
ICHABOD: What are you spying on?
DOCTOR LANCASTER: (offers the spyglass) The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
ICHABOD: He is a behemoth.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: A diseased monster.
BALTUS: If you gentlemen will excuse the doctor and I... we have financial matters to discuss.
KILLIAN: Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
ICHABOD: More than enough, actually. (tired laugh) I beg you, no more, please.
KILLIAN: No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
ICHABOD: Tell me something. (pause) What becomes of Young Masbath?
KILLIAN: Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
ICHABOD: Find yourself a place in the servants' residence and wake me before dawn. Our first task will be an unsavory one.
FATHER STEENWYCK: It is sacrilege!
ICHABOD: I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
FATHER STEENWYCK: Magistrate Philipse, surely you can stop this.
FATHER STEENWYCK: I will not allow it.  I will not!
ICHABOD: Protest to my superiors if you like.
FATHER STEENWYCK: Your superiors are two days away!
ICHABOD: Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
ICHABOD: Why was I not told of this?
KILLIAN: The Widow Windsor.
ICHABOD: Is that all you say?  Look at her.
KILLIAN: It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
ICHABOD: What is the common thread between these victims?
YOUNG MASBATH: I'm sure I don't know.
ICHABOD: We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
ICHABOD: The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ? (pointing to it) Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
ICHABOD: In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
ICHABOD: You should step outside.
FATHER STEENWYCK: The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane. The Lord will not forgive your sins.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.): Ichabod!  Ichabod... come along.
ICHABOD: Sorry for disturbing you.  I thought a forgotten candle was burning.
KATRINA: You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
ICHABOD: May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
KATRINA: You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
ICHABOD: I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
KATRINA: These are strange... may I?
KATRINA: These scars.  How did you get them?
ICHABOD: I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
KATRINA: It would be interesting to find out.
ICHABOD: Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it. (spinning it) The bird seems to be in his cage.
KATRINA: Yes, he does.  May I try?
ICHABOD: He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
KATRINA: You made this, and the drawings?
ICHABOD: Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
KATRINA: Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside. (spinning it) Can't you see what is inexplicable?
KATRINA: Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
ICHABOD: If you want.  But...
KATRINA: Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
ICHABOD: Thank you.  No.  Here...
KATRINA: I insist that you have it.
ICHABOD: (resigned, leaving) Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
KATRINA: That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
PHILIPSE: Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
ICHABOD: Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
PHILIPSE: We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
ICHABOD: I know it.
YOUNG MASBATH: Um.... excuse me, sirs...
PHILIPSE: (still to Ichabod) Because of the Horseman, our migrant workers flee for their lives.  There is a danger that our crops will rot. So, if you are going to help us, you stop the Horseman.  That is your task... to kill an undead thing.
ICHABOD: Listen to what you say....
PHILIPSE: No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
ICHABOD: At times I do.
YOUNG MASBATH: Sirs... please!
PHILIPSE: What will it take for you to realize this is no laughing matter?
PHILIPSE: Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...
ICHABOD: Philipse!
LADY VAN TASSEL: (to Young Masbath) Has he not come out at all?
YOUNG ICHABOD: No... mother... no... ! FREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows.
THIRD MAN: You are certain it was she?
FREAKISH WOMAN: In the lighting, I did see her. (points) Her.  Lady Crane...
FREAKISH WOMAN: I will never forget.  The next moment, I found my infant dead... with the blood welt on his breast.
MOTHER: Don't be afraid...
KATRINA: Are you hungry?
KATRINA: You promised justice.
ICHABOD: If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
KATRINA: People have put their trust in you.
ICHABOD: They have done nothing of the sort.
KATRINA: Won't they still have that justice? (patience waning) Or, was it a vain promise?
YOUNG MASBATH: Constable Crane... something has happened.
BROM: The men who did this have been taken. We do not need you here.
ONE FILTHY MAN: You should thank us.  The killings will end.  We saved you all!
BROM: They spend two days in chains.
ICHABOD: Two days... ?  For murder?
FATHER STEENWYCK: For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
ICHABOD: Does that look like an animal hanging?
BROM: Looks like an Indian.
ICHABOD: Wait.  Give me a moment...
ICHABOD: The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
YOUNG MASBATH: How could he?
ICHABOD: His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself. (closes his journal) Someone out there cared for him.
YOUNG MASBATH: Where are we going?
ICHABOD: Up.
ICHABOD: What is it?
YOUNG MASBATH: It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
ICHABOD: (points) Out there.  What do you see?
YOUNG MASBATH: The Western Woods.
ICHABOD: Look again.
YOUNG MASBATH: Smoke.  Chimney smoke.
ICHABOD: Are you familiar with magnets?
YOUNG MASBATH: What kind of nuts?
ICHABOD: Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
YOUNG MASBATH: It's spectacular.
ICHABOD: (smiles, pause) Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
YOUNG MASBATH: No, I couldn't...
ICHABOD: I have others.  All I need is this.
YOUNG MASBATH: Thank you.
ICHABOD: (nods, almost shy) Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
ICHABOD: If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
YOUNG MASBATH: (uneasy) Father said witches live there.
ICHABOD: Witches do not exist.  However...
ICHABOD: Not long ago, I would have said the same for Headless Horseman. KATRINA (o.s.) Constable... !
KATRINA: I need to speak with you.  Alone.
KATRINA: Why would you do such a thing?
ICHABOD: No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
KATRINA: I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
ICHABOD: You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
KATRINA: What are you on about?
ICHABOD: The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
KATRINA: Must I hear this?
ICHABOD: There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
KATRINA: And this gives worth to butchery?
ICHABOD: It was not butchery.
KATRINA: What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
ICHABOD: I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
KATRINA: Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
ICHABOD: To avenge his father, and the others.
KATRINA: But, why?  Tell me why.
KATRINA: You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
ICHABOD: (fed up, growing anger) If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
ICHABOD: What is it?
YOUNG MASBATH: Listen.
ICHABOD: (listens, looks) I hear nothing.
YOUNG MASBATH: No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
ICHABOD: We have apparently arrived.
ICHABOD: Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
OLD CRONE: You are from the Hollow?
ICHABOD: In a way, yes.
ICHABOD: The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman? (uncomfortable wait) I should tell you... he has been murdered.
OLD CRONE: Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
YOUNG MASBATH: Were you a friend to the Indian? (waits) You should have this... if you were his friend.
OLD CRONE: You seek remedy against the Horseman?
OLD CRONE: (to Young Masbath) Go out and keep away, child. (to Ichabod) You stay.  Follow with me.
OLD CRONE: I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
ICHABOD: The Horseman.  Yes.
OLD CRONE: Sit.
ICHABOD: Can you help?
OLD CRONE: You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
ICHABOD: What... what are you doing?
OLD CRONE: (turns, furious) Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
OLD CRONE: He comes now.
ICHABOD: Excuse me... um...
ICHABOD: Are you alright... ?
CREATURE/OLD CRONE: You seek the warrior bathed in blood... the Headless Horseman.
CREATURE/OLD CRONE: Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  Follow to the tree of the dead.
CREATURE/OLD CRONE: Climb down to the Horseman's soulless place and let loose his silent shrieking.  Do you hear?  Do you hear?!
CREATURE/OLD CRONE: He who holds fast the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand. Catch hold of his desire.
ICHABOD: We are leaving.
YOUNG MASBATH: What happened?
YOUNG MASBATH: Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead. (looking back) Maybe we passed it by.
ICHABOD: How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
ICHABOD: We should not go much further in this murk.
YOUNG MASBATH: Should we go back?
ICHABOD: We are far from the Hollow. (dismounts, troubled) Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
YOUNG MASBATH: What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
ICHABOD: "Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out. (pause) "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
ICHABOD: (to Young Masbath) Do not move.
ICHABOD: What God-forsaken hell is this?
ICHABOD: Christ...
FATHER STEENWYCK: You all stand idle, while this man goes about with a book of secrets and a bag filled with magic.  You all stand idle, while the shadow of the Devil falls over our town.
FATHER STEENWYCK: I say, if you do nothing, you share in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane!
KILLIAN: Listen to me!  Do you want to save your crops?  Or would you rather see your farms go to ruin?
FATHER STEENWYCK: How is he saving our farms?  How? Ichabod Crane has brought into our midst the soulless, moldering corpse of a heretic!
ICHABOD: The wound is neither smooth nor cauterized, but jagged.  She bleeds like a fountain.
ICHABOD: She did not go quietly.
ANGRY MAN: Step aside, Constable.  Step aside...
ICHABOD: What are you doing?
FATHER STEENWYCK: Let her burn!  Let her burn!
KATRINA: Stop this!  Leave them alone!
BROM: Let them go (pointing) Are you going to beat an orphaned child, imbecile?
FATHER STEENWYCK: Are you Ichabod Crane's protector, Brom Bones?
BROM: Only for the moment.
FATHER STEENWYCK: You side with him in this?
BROM: No.  I agree he has only made matters worse.  But, that will change, if you listen.
BROM: Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride each day and night to watch over the Hollow.  We will stalk the border of the Western Woods and haunt the Horseman for a change, with rifles like this... and slugs like this...
BROM: Hollowed out and filled with powder.
BROM: Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
ICHABOD: I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
BROM: You must have missed your mark.
ICHABOD: I hit him square.
BROM: (to the crowd) I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
FREAKISH WOMAN: In the lightning, I did see her. (points to Mother) Her. Lady Crane... I will never forget it.  The next moment, I found my infant son was dead, with the blood welt on his breast.
THIRD MAN: You have heard it.  The blood welt is the mark of Satan's touch.
YOUNG ICHABOD: She was with me, father.
FATHER: Nothing can be done against them.
YOUNG ICHABOD: She was with me that night.
YOUNG ICHABOD: May I see her?
THIRD MAN: Go home.
YOUNG ICHABOD: May I see my mother?
THIRD MAN: You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
YOUNG ICHABOD: She did not do it... please listen...
THIRD MAN: She is guilty.
YOUNG ICHABOD: No, sir, please... she is innocent...
THIRD MAN: She has confessed.
YOUNG ICHABOD: No.
THIRD MAN: She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is? (off Ichabod's nod) All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
FATHER: We are leaving. (long pause) She has gone away.
YOUNG ICHABOD: Mother.
KATRINA: Constable Crane?
ICHABOD: Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
KATRINA: What troubles you?
KATRINA: The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
ICHABOD: No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
KATRINA: What has happened?
ICHABOD: Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
KATRINA: What?
ICHABOD: She is not your birth mother, is she?
KATRINA: No, but... why do you ask that?
ICHABOD: What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
KATRINA: She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
ICHABOD: Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now. (pause) Lord, how I hate this place.
KATRINA: If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
ICHABOD: I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
KATRINA: Why are you so afraid of that?  Is there truly such harm in uncertainty?
LADY VAN TASSEL: Returning to the Western Woods?
ICHABOD: Yes, actually.
LADY VAN TASSEL: Use caution.
ICHABOD: (nods, studies her) Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
LADY VAN TASSEL: As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo. (off Ichabod's confusion) Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
BALTUS: Constable... did you notice anything out of the ordinary during the night?
ICHABOD: Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
BALTUS: Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town. (to Lady Van Tassel) What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
ICHABOD: I should be going... good day to you.
YOUNG MASBATH: If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
ICHABOD: You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
YOUNG MASBATH: Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
ICHABOD: (laughs) True enough.
YOUNG MASBATH: Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
ICHABOD: Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
ICHABOD: Quicken pace.
ICHABOD: Ride on.
ICHABOD: Halt and turn.  I have a pistol aimed at your head.
KATRINA: It is only me.
ICHABOD: Katrina.  Why do you follow?
KATRINA: I apologize if I worried you.
ICHABOD: A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
KATRINA: But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and... (takes out WHITE ROSE) To thank you.
ICHABOD: Come along.
YOUNG MASBATH: You were right... it does draw attention to itself.
ICHABOD: Blood.
KATRINA: What did you say?
YOUNG MASBATH: What is it?
ICHABOD: Stay back.
KATRINA: What are you doing?
ICHABOD: Just... keep where you are.
KATRINA: My God... what has happened?
ICHABOD: He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
ICHABOD: Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
YOUNG MASBATH: We should go.
ICHABOD: Why this tree?
ICHABOD: (to himself) "Climb down to the Horseman's soulless place." (to Masbath) Bring the shovel.
KATRINA: Masbath, we've found it.
ICHABOD: It cannot be true.
ICHABOD: Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
KATRINA: The skull is gone.
ICHABOD: Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
ICHABOD: This is his silent shrieking... and his desire, to reclaim his head.
ICHABOD: "He who holds fast the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." (pause) Someone controls the Horseman. KATRINA (o.s.) Ichabod!
ICHABOD: His next victim is chosen! (to Masbath) Give me distance, then guide her back to the Hollow.
YOUNG MASBATH: Constable!
THOMAS: May I be excused, father?
KILLIAN: Do you deserve to be?
THIRD MAN: (shyly) I think so.
KILLIAN: (smiles) Then, go.
BETH: Don't pick teeth.  You teach Thomas bad habits.
KILLIAN: I am a bad habit.  There's nothing for it.
BETH: (kisses him) No one knows better than I.
BETH: What are you doing there?
THOMAS: Spiders.
KILLIAN: Beth...
KILLIAN: Beth... run!
BETH: Don't let him get you.
THOMAS: Mommy...
BETH: You hide now... go...
ICHABOD: For what it's worth...
BROM: We cannot win this.
BROM: There...
BROM: Go to the front and guide it.
BROM: Let's see him catch us now.
ICHABOD: Look.
BROM: We'll pass right by the son of a bitch.
BROM: My Christ...
KATRINA: Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
LADY VAN TASSEL: Doctor, he is awake.
ICHABOD: (barely a voice) What... what are you doing... ?
KATRINA: I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
ICHABOD: ... Brom Bones...
DOCTOR LANCASTER: He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
ICHABOD: Bring Young Masbath here.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: You need to sleep.
ICHABOD: Bring him.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: You need rest.
YOUNG MASBATH: Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
ICHABOD: Man or woman?
YOUNG MASBATH: All I saw was their lantern.
ICHABOD: Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
YOUNG MASBATH: If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
ICHABOD: Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul. (pause) We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
ICHABOD: Damn it.
YOUNG MASBATH: I'll get it.
ICHABOD: Wait...
YOUNG MASBATH: (whispers) Who did this?
ICHABOD: Panic has set in.
ICHABOD: Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope.
ICHABOD: Do you have these persons' wills?
HARDENBROOK: I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
ICHABOD: Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
HARDENBROOK: Certainly... certainly.
ICHABOD: May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
HARDENBROOK: Hmm?  See them?
ICHABOD: May we look at them now?
HARDENBROOK: Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
ICHABOD: Maybe you should take this.
HARDENBROOK: A fine idea.
YOUNG MASBATH: What good is this?
ICHABOD: To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
HARDENBROOK: Damn... damn... damn...
ICHABOD: Master Hardenbrook...
ICHABOD: Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
HARDENBROOK: Well... that might be... helpful.
YOUNG MASBATH: My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
ICHABOD: (still reading) And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
YOUNG MASBATH: Yes.
ICHABOD: Then look here at your father's will, and tell me why you are not listed.
ICHABOD: Van Garrett had denoted his elder son in his last wishes; the same son murdered along with him.  But Van Garrett's wife and two infant children are not written... and they were spared. (picks up another will) Do you see?  Philipse had no family to bestow his farm to.  But, here... (picks up another) The Widow Windsor was listed on her late husband's will.  After her inheritance, she amended the document to include her bastard child.  This is why the Horseman made absolutely certain to impale the unborn descendant.
ICHABOD: Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
YOUNG MASBATH: But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
ICHABOD: No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
YOUNG MASBATH: In test... what?
ICHABOD: Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
YOUNG MASBATH: What does it mean?
ICHABOD: Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
YOUNG MASBATH: (realization) Baltus Van Tassel.
ICHABOD: Did your father take a loan?
YOUNG MASBATH: Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
ICHABOD: Tonight, we answer questions.  And, to discover who moves about the Van Tassel house after dark... all we need is a candle.
ICHABOD: Midnight seems an appropriate time.
ICHABOD: (whispering) They are alphabetical.
YOUNG MASBATH: There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
ICHABOD: (regarding his documents) There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
ICHABOD: Keep looking.  Then, hide in my room and bolt the door till I return.
YOUNG MASBATH: I was getting worried.  Who was it?
ICHABOD: Lady Van Tassel.
YOUNG MASBATH: What was she doing?
ICHABOD: Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
YOUNG MASBATH: No.  They are all missing.
YOUNG MASBATH: There is more, though.  While you were gone, I could hear someone else walking through the house.
ICHABOD: (whispers, to himself) Katrina.
YOUNG MASBATH: Here.
YOUNG MASBATH: There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
ICHABOD: It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her. (to convince himself) It is absolutely nothing.
YOUNG MASBATH: What books?
ICHABOD: Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
YOUNG MASBATH: But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
YOUNG MASBATH: If there is a secret place for books... it could be just as good for the missing loan agreements.
YOUNG MASBATH: Constable.
YOUNG MASBATH: Fie!  Here they are.
ICHABOD: Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
LADY VAN TASSEL: No.  She has gone out.
ICHABOD: Where?
LADY VAN TASSEL: She has taken the last of our grain to be milled. (crossing to him) You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
ICHABOD: Very little.  I must be going...
LADY VAN TASSEL: Will you look at this?  I cut my hand this morning: I sewed it myself, but I am afraid it will go bad.
ICHABOD: It appears well.  It has already clotted.
LADY VAN TASSEL: Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
ICHABOD: It is fine.  Now, I must...
LADY VAN TASSEL: (whispering, close) I know you saw me.
ICHABOD: What... ?
LADY VAN TASSEL: I know you followed last night.  You must promise not to tell Baltus...
LADY VAN TASSEL: Have mercy on me.  Please... have mercy.
BALTUS: Constable, it is urgent that we speak.
BALTUS: Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
ICHABOD: How did you hear this?
BALTUS: He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection. (troubled pause) I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
BALTUS: That is the meeting bell already calling.  With the murder of Killian and Brom, no one sees any good from you.  If... if you were to leave... you might be saving your own life.
ICHABOD: I appreciate your concern.  I thank you, sir.
YOUNG MASBATH: (mounting his horse) What now?  Where is she?
ICHABOD: Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
FATHER STEENWYCK: You are astonishing, Constable.  Do you truly think your ridiculous accusations frighten me?
ICHABOD: Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must... (points to doors) Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
FATHER STEENWYCK: No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
ICHABOD: Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
FATHER STEENWYCK: Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
ICHABOD: It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
FATHER STEENWYCK: I am the Lord's voice in this town.
ICHABOD: Wallowing in sin and lust...
FATHER STEENWYCK: They need guidance.
ICHABOD: Wallowing quite literally in blood.
FATHER STEENWYCK: (snapping, quaking) Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
ICHABOD: He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
ICHABOD: You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
FATHER STEENWYCK: You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
ICHABOD: Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
FATHER STEENWYCK: My friends... dear friends.  Those of you still on your farms, I thank you for coming.
FATHER STEENWYCK: I... I address unfortunate business. (pause) I am forced to take my leave from Sleepy Hollow.  I will be moving on to do the Lord's work elsewhere.
BALTUS: Hurry along.  The meeting has most certainly already begun.  We do not want Steenwyck as our enemy.
KATRINA: What is so urgent?
ICHABOD: Come with me.
KATRINA: Why have I not seen your face for so long?  You look much better.
ICHABOD: Explain these.  I found them secreted away in the sewing room.
ICHABOD: Why... why have I scrambled and run and clawed in all directions, only to find you against me?
KATRINA: I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist. (pause, ashamed) I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
ICHABOD: It was you there?
KATRINA: When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
ICHABOD: And, what did he say?
KATRINA: He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
ICHABOD: What did he say, Katrina?
KATRINA: I have not been able to face him yet.
ICHABOD: The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
KATRINA: Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
ICHABOD: What would you have me believe?
KATRINA: (tiring, angry) If you think I am behind this, say it.
ICHABOD: The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
KATRINA: Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
ICHABOD: Katrina...
KATRINA: Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
KATRINA: Oh, no.  No.  Please... don't dare stand looking as if you still care for me, after all that you have said.  If I were to confess, would that ease your suffering?  Would that make it easier for you to hate me?!
BALTUS: The Horseman is coming!
BALTUS: Save me...
KATRINA: Father?
BALTUS: He killed her...
BALTUS: The Horseman has killed her.
KATRINA: Father!
BALTUS: Steenwyck!
KATRINA: Father!
BALTUS: Damn you, Steenwyck!  Help me! Let me in!
HUGE FARMER: You'll kill us all!
HUGE FARMER: You're the one the Horseman wants. Why should we die for you!?
HUGE FARMER: Get out!
ICHABOD: Stop this!
ICHABOD: The Horseman cannot enter!  It does not matter who he wants, he cannot cross the gate!
ONE RIFLEMAN: He's coming back!
HUGE FARMER: We have to save ourselves!
BALTUS: No!  Get away from me!
BALTUS: The next person to lay hands on me will have a bullet.  Stand off!
KATRINA: Father...
BALTUS: No!  We're safe here. (points at Ichabod) You said it.  The Horseman will not have me.
ICHABOD: (shouting back) Here!  I have found her... (looking at corpse, quiet and miserable) Here she is.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
ICHABOD: You will stay at her side?
YOUNG MASBATH: She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? (no answer)
ICHABOD: I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
YOUNG MASBATH: Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
ICHABOD: Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
YOUNG MASBATH: Why... why are you like this?
ICHABOD: (pause, softening) You do not know all that has happened. (pause) You cannot understand.
ICHABOD: Half now.  Half when we reach the city.
ICHABOD: This is farewell.
YOUNG MASBATH: Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
ICHABOD: I cannot. (bends to Masbath) You should not worry. (pause, sorrow) Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
ICHABOD: I am sorry. (quietly) Forgive me.  I failed you.
YOUNG MASBATH: Do not go, Constable.  How can you leave?
VAN RIPPER: Sir... this is yours. (offering something) The Van Tassel girl said to give it to you after you were gone.
ICHABOD: Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
VAN RIPPER: What did you say?
ICHABOD: Turn around.  Now!
YOUNG MASBATH: Hello?  Katrina?
ICHABOD: Pardon the intrusion...
ICHABOD: I never examined these bodies.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: ... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
ICHABOD: Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
ICHABOD: Stains of blood.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: What of it?
ICHABOD: Jagged flesh. (pause) The Horseman did not do this.
ICHABOD: Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so...
ICHABOD: No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: What?
ICHABOD: When this cut was made, this person was already dead. (stands straight) This is not Lady Van Tassel.
YOUNG MASBATH: Katrina. (steps forward) Is anyone here?
ICHABOD: Open the door.  Open up, damn it! (pounds, shouting) Lady van Tassel is alive.  The Horseman is her puppet.  Please...
HUGE FARMER: Aren't we rid of you?
ICHABOD: Listen to me.  Lady Van Tassel has faked her death.  I need able men...
HUGE FARMER: She's dead, and you have gone mad.
ICHABOD: No...
HUGE FARMER: (steps forward) Get out!  Isn't it enough that you have ruined this town?  Go!
ICHABOD: Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
VAN RIPPER: Yes.  Here...
ICHABOD: May I see it?
ICHABOD: Get down.  Hurry!
ICHABOD: Sorry.
KATRINA: You... you are alive.
LADY VAN TASSEL: Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
YOUNG MASBATH: She commands the Horseman.
LADY VAN TASSEL: And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't you say?  It is almost over.
LADY VAN TASSEL: (of the wind) He rides tonight.
KATRINA: Father saw you die.
LADY VAN TASSEL: He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
YOUNG MASBATH: Then, whose body was it... ?
LADY VAN TASSEL: The precious servant girl Sarah.  I killed her and kept her body hidden, till I needed it.  And, when I return to the Hollow tomorrow, my version of the truth will come to pass. (faking meekness) I mean, there I was that fateful day, following Baltus into the woods.  I did not know what he was up to... where he was going.  I worried for his safety.
LADY VAN TASSEL: Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
KATRINA: No one will believe your lies, whore.
LADY VAN TASSEL: This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
LADY VAN TASSEL: He will have that honor.
LADY VAN TASSEL: (mock sorrow) Woe is me... that spying on my husband in his filthy indiscretion, I saw he and Sarah attacked by the Horseman. Oh pity me... so overcome was I that I wandered in the Western Woods... dazed... nearly blind from terror.
LADY VAN TASSEL: And, tomorrow is my grand performance, having barely survived the elements... (more emoting) By sheer luck I found my way back to the Hollow.  But... what do I find here... ?  My dear, sweet step-daughter Katrina is dead.  Why has God forsaken her?
LADY VAN TASSEL: (of herself, pleased) No one will suspect this sad woman who has been through such an ordeal.  With only the empty solace of her money and land to comfort her.
ICHABOD: Katrina!
KATRINA: Murderer!
LADY VAN TASSEL: You've been a naughty girl.
KATRINA: Ichabod!
LADY VAN TASSEL: Little bitch.
KATRINA: Ichabod!
YOUNG MASBATH: Here we are!
LADY VAN TASSEL: Run, Katrina!  Fast as your pretty legs will carry you.  It makes no difference.
LADY VAN TASSEL: Nothing will stop him now!
ICHABOD: Climb up!
YOUNG MASBATH: Lady Van Tassel...
ICHABOD: I know.  Hold on.
LADY VAN TASSEL: Olly-olly oxen-free!
ICHABOD: Christ.
KATRINA: Where are we going?
ICHABOD: I do not know.  Away.
YOUNG MASBATH: Here he comes!
ICHABOD: We might make it to the church.
KATRINA: Masbath... !
ICHABOD: Damn it, boy, get back here!
YOUNG MASBATH: What can we do?
ICHABOD: Take the reins.
ICHABOD: Masbath is right.  We must do something.
KATRINA: Ichabod!
ICHABOD: Keep him off!  Block him!
ICHABOD: Take it!
ICHABOD: Move forward!
ICHABOD: Go!
ICHABOD: Help her.
YOUNG MASBATH: What now?
ICHABOD: I doubt that's the end.
KATRINA: The church.
ICHABOD: He moves too fast.
KATRINA: What was that?
ICHABOD: His horse.
ICHABOD: There...
ICHABOD: He's coming!
ICHABOD: Hurry!
YOUNG MASBATH: It won't hold.
ICHABOD: Get up those stairs.  Open the door to the roof and wait.
KATRINA: Ichabod...
ICHABOD: Keep climbing.  I will follow...
ICHABOD: (under his breath) Hopefully.
YOUNG MASBATH: Look out!
KATRINA: Quickly, close it.
ICHABOD: No. (takes lantern, points) Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
YOUNG MASBATH: Jump?  Jump where?
ICHABOD: The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
KATRINA: I... I can't do this.
ICHABOD: We have no choice.
ICHABOD: Be ready...
ICHABOD: Now!
ICHABOD: Okay... come on...
ICHABOD: (as this registers) Oh, no...
LADY VAN TASSEL: Should have stayed away, Constable.
LADY VAN TASSEL: Keep back, or I kill her.
LADY VAN TASSEL: See him...
LADY VAN TASSEL: You cannot kill what is already dead.
ICHABOD: Let her go!
LADY VAN TASSEL: Yes... yes.  I think I will...
ICHABOD: No!
LADY VAN TASSEL: Say goodbye to her.
ICHABOD: Horseman!
ICHABOD: How are you?
YOUNG MASBATH: Tired.
