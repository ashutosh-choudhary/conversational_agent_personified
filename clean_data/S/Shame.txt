BRANDON: What?
MARIANNE: ...averse to the whole idea.

BRANDON: It doesn't seem realistic.
MARIANNE: Are you serious? I mean..
BRANDON: Yeah, I am, really.

BRANDON: Well..
MARIANNE: Why are you here?
BRANDON: The food's supposed to be really great here. (LAUGHS)
BRANDON (CONT'D): No, no, no, no. I'm not.. I'm not saying it like that. I mean, I just mean, you know.. One person for the rest of your life? I mean, it's.. I mean, you know, you come to restaurants, you see couples sitting together and they don't even speak to one another. They don't have anything to say, they don't have anything.
