THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL: Written by Peter Morgan Based on the novel by Philippa Gregory
SIR THOMAS: I received a formal request for marriage today for Anne. (a beat) From the Carey family. ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired.
LADY ELIZABETH: But that's wonderful.
SIR THOMAS: I turned it down.
SIR THOMAS: And offered them Mary instead. MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired.
SIR THOMAS: Fnne's too good for William Carey. She can do (better than a merchant's son.
LADY ELIZABETH: You underestimate Mary.
SIR THOMAS: Not true. I think she's..the kinder of the two. Quite possibly the fairer.
SIR THOMAS: But to get ahead in this world, you need more than fair looks and a kind heart.
SIR THOMAS: (applauding his favourite) Bravo! Anne!
ANNE: May we come in..?
ANNE: Look at you..! Younger than me. More beautiful than me. Married before me. (a beat) I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other Boleyn Girl.'
MARY: Hardly.
GEORGE: No, is this it? This is the end of the unholy trinity?
MARY: No, George. Never. I'll be married, that's all.. (a beat) Apart from that - it won't change a thing.
PRIEST: Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in nobis..
WILLIAM: Are you happy?
MARY: Very.
WILLIAM: You don't secretly wish you'd married someone grander? With a title?
MARY: No. I want a husband who loves me. And who thinks it first thing every morning. And last thing at night.
WILLIAM: Then you've found the right man.
ANNE: Who is that? He was staring at me in church?
GEORGE: That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of Northumberland. Richest landowner in England.
GEORGE: But don't get your hopes up. He is already betrothed.
ANNE: Betrothed is not married, brother George. A lot can happen before you reach the altar.
SIR THOMAS: Thomas..
NORFOLK: I think I have managed to persuade the King to come and stay with you on progress. A week-end's hunting in late summer.
SIR THOMAS: But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank you so much.. (he turns to ELIZABETH) Did you hear that, Elizabeth?
LADY ELIZABETH: (hates the idea) Yes.
SIR THOMAS: Finally we can present George, and with luck, get him a position at court.
NORFOLK: These are difficult times. I have it on good authority that the Queen no longer bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir is still not resolved. a beat) It cannot be long before the King is forced to look outside the marriage.
SIR THOMAS: What? And make a bastard King of England?
NORFOLK: A legitimized bastard. What choice does he have? (a beat) Obviously, I've given it thought, and wondered which Howard girl I could put under his nose. Imagine the influence that would give us. To be blood family of the next King of England. Equally, imagine if another family were to achieve the same?
SIR THOMAS: What about Anne?
SIR THOMAS: I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not officially a `Howard', but as your sister's daughter..
NORFOLK: But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't you prefer her to have a nice, uncomplicated, respectable marriage? Like Mary?
SIR THOMAS: If Anne were an uncomplicated, respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say `yes'. But she's not.
SIR THOMAS: She's anything but.
ADY ELIZABETH: don't like it. It would cost a fortune to make our house fit for a royal visit. Money we don't have.
SIR THOMAS: And what if you were to look on the bright side? Just once?
SIR THOMAS: Risk nothing, you gain nothing.
LADY ELIZABETH: hen was it that people stopped thinking of ambition as a sin, and started thinking of it as a virtue?
SIR THOMAS: Easy for you to say. You've had power and wealth all your life.
LADY ELIZABETH: Until I married you, Thomas. And I was happy to give it up.
ANNE: You asked to see me father?
SIR THOMAS: Yes. Come in.
MARY: o - the King himself is coming to Hever. I'm so happy for George.
ANNE: Yes. But Father took me aside. It seems he has ambitions for me, too. (a beat)
MARY: What? What are you saying..?
ANNE: It's known the King has a wandering eye. Imagine...if he were to like me?
MARY: But...you could never be more than his mistress. And that's no substitute for a husband.
ANNE: But as the King's mistress the least I'd get after he finished with me would be an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And gave him what his wife has failed to? a beat) Quite apart from the money, it'd be a Duke at least.
MARY: But what about your happiness? Your future?
ANNE: I could be a happy Duchess.
ANNE: Are you nervous?
MARY: A little.
ANNE: You'll tell me everything in the morning?
MARY: I promise.
ANNE: No details spared?
MARY: MARY (cont'd) MARY (cont'd)
WILLIAM: WILLIAM (cont'd) WILLIAM (cont'd) WILLIAM (cont'd) WILLIAM (cont'd)
ANNE: There he is!
ANNE: You think he will like me?
MARY: Of course, sister. How could he not?
SIR THOMAS: Your Majesty, you are most welcome.
HENRY: Sir Thomas. kisses hand) Lady Elizabeth..
SIR THOMAS: May I present my son, George.
HENRY: (while staring at MARY) Your Uncle tells me I should have you at court. Should I?
GEORGE: It would be a great honour, Sir.
SIR THOMAS: And our daughter, Anne.
ENRY: No one said anything of a daughter.
HENRY: Had we known, we might have come sooner.
ANNE: Your Majesty..
SIR THOMAS: Perhaps you'll allow Anne to show you around our modest house?
HENRY: A pleasure.
ANNE: Here is the library.
HENRY: Charming.
ANNE: And through here, the observatory..
HENRY: Lovely..
HENRY: What's that?
ANNE: falcon, your Grace.
HENRY: I can see that. But what's it doing there? More to the point.. (turns 360) ..not just there, but in every corner in the house?
ANNE: I have no idea. Ask my father. a beat) Perhaps because falcons are vaguely associative with field sports - field sports with aristocracy - and in the absence of a genuine coat of arms.. (shrugs) ...a man with ambition will do the strangest things.
ENRY: That's a sharp tongue you have. a beat) I wonder what it might say about me behind my back?
ANNE: Oh, his Majesty has nothing to fear from me. Unless he fears an excess of compliments.
HENRY: Really? And what would they be..?
SIR THOMAS: Bravo, Anne! The King was quite smitten! Told me so himself. And has requested you sit beside him at dinner.
SIR THOMAS: My girl. My dear, remarkable girl. I knew you would up to the task.
HENRY: Well played! And, may I say.. (a modest smile) ..an excellent choice of music too!
HENRY: Sir Thomas, Lady Elizabeth, dear Anne. Your health.
HENRY: ..I had it from the lips of the Spanish ambassador himself. That our musicians are the envy of all Europe.
BRANDON: ..then he was flattering you, your Grace.
HENRY: Our Universities and philosophers, too.
HENRY: (turns to ANNE)
ANNE: clears throat)
SIR THOMAS: You did well tonight. Very well. Quite enough to be invited to court, I am sure of it.
SIR THOMAS: Now go to bed. Get a good night's sleep. Because there's still the hunt tomorrow. a beat) You must excel at that.
HENRY: Good morning, Anne.
ANNE: Good morning, your Grace.
HENRY: ho will you be riding with?
ANNE: On my own your Grace.
HENRY: Your own..?
ANNE: They have invented a new saddle which allows ladies to ride on their own.
HENRY: ut with no man to hold onto? How will you stay on the horse?
ANNE: Why? The same way you hold onto yours, your Grace.
HENRY: We'll see.
HENRY: Let's away!
HENRY: (kicking his horse) Hah!
HENRY: (kicking his horse) Hah..!
IDER: We've lost him. He's in the forest.
HENRY: Then we must follow.
ANNE: Hah!
ENRY: he King of England defeated by a humble fawn.
ANNE: (suddenly kicking horse) Hah!
COURTIER: Please, your Majesty. It's not safe.
PHYSICIAN: It's a miracle, Majesty, you have no broken bones..
SIR THOMAS: My daughter Anne is here. Would like to apologise.
ENRY: (recoils, his pride hurt) No! Get her away from me!
HENRY: a ENRY (cont'd)
HENRY: Everything I would have wished for myself. But then my brother died. a beat) And duty called.
HENRY: You don't think he'll miss court? a beat) A young, ambitious man?
MARY: He says not, your Majesty.
MARY: But, if he ever changed his mind, I would always support him.
HENRY: Well said.
HENRY: Thank you again, Lady Elizabeth. We'll take good care of your boy.. (kissing her hand) And Thomas..
HENRY: You'll take care of that matter?
SIR THOMAS: Consider it done, your Majesty.
STAFFORD: Your Father wishes to see you.
STAFFORD: Just Mary.
NORFOLK: Mary, I don't know what you said or did - but you obviously made a deep impression on the King. exchanges a look with SIR
THOMAS): And he has requested you come to court with immediate effect.
ANNE: What?!?
NORFOLK: ou're to pack and leave first thing in the morning.
SIR THOMAS: ell her.
NORFOLK: (a beat)
MARY: What about Anne? Couldn't she go instead?
SIR THOMAS: The way that girl behaved this week-end, she can count herself lucky she still has a home.
MARY: How could he DO this to me? My own father. a beat) What if we just refused?
WILLIAM: We would be cut off. He made that clear.
MARY: But would that be so bad?
MARY: Position means nothing to me. Nor wealth. We could find somewhere. A small farm. Away from everything.
WILLIAM: You say that now - but when you're older? And our children are grown up? (comforting her) This won't last long. A year. Maybe two. And at the end of that - we'll we have everything we want. (a beat) It's for our FUTURE.
MARY: ut can't you see? Do this, and we might not HAVE a future.
MARY: I'm so sorry..
ANNE: What for? You think I want the King? Or to be used and abused by him? (puts on brave smile) No! You're welcome to him. I have my own plans, which don't involve becoming a rag that will one day be discarded.
SERVANT: Mary Carey, Ma'am.
QUEEN KATHERINE: Who?
SERVANT: The new Lady in Waiting.
QUEEN KATHERINE: with icy contempt)
QUEEN KATHERINE: turns to a MUSICIAN)
QUEEN KATHERINE: (barks, suddenly terrifying) I command you to SING!!!
QUEEN KATHERINE: Bravo! A nightingale! (the cruel satisfaction of victory) Welcome at court!
WOMAN'S VOICE: ait! Mary! Stop!
JANE: I know that must have been agony, but put yourself in her shoes. She knows the only reason the King has asked you here is because he desires you. For a wife that must be very difficult. a beat) She's a good woman. Trust me.
J: ANE (cont'd) Jane Parker.
MARY: Mary Carey.
JANE: You have a brother, don't you? George?
MARY: Yes.
JANE: I've seen him a few times at court. And like him...very well. (a beat) But I don't think he has noticed me.
MARY: I can't imagine. (a beat) Should I mention you to him?
JANE: Would you?
MARY: Of course. Happily.
GEORGE: Not noticed her? Jane Parker? Of course I have. How could I not? She looks like a goat.
MARY: Well, she likes you, and asked me to give you this..to remember her by.
GEORGE: Ugh. Well say you haven't seen me. Or that you forgot. GEORGE (cont'd) There is something about that woman that makes me feel... (he shudders)
MARY: And our sister? Any word?
GEORGE: ANNE? You know she took being upstaged by you very badly.
MARY: Yes, I know.
GEORGE: And no amount of interventions on my behalf would make her believe you hadn't done it intentionally.
MARY: But you KNOW I would never do anything like that.
GEORGE: I know. GEORGE (cont'd) Just give her time. She'll come round.
HENRY (O.S.): Please, don't be alarmed.
ENRY: I wanted to find somewhere we could be alone so I might say a few words to you in person.
HENRY: I hope your accommodation is comfortable. I realise it's no substitute for the life you had in mind in the country.. (a beat) But please, give me the opportunity to try to make you happy here..
HE: The moment I met you, I realised I..
HENRY: (tailing off) What are you..?
HENRY: I am sorry. (delicately putting her clothes back on MARY) You obviously misunderstand me.
NORFOLK: What? If all the King wanted was coition, he could fetch in a woman from the bath house. a beat) What he wants is YOU. a beat) To woo you. And be wooed in return. (a beat) And could'nt you look just a little happier? There isn't a girl in the Kingdom that wouldn't wish to be in your shoes.
MARY: Your opinion, Uncle.
MARY: Mine is that it's the greatest insult of all.
ORFOLK: What?
MARY: Asking a whore to have feelings, too.
PRIEST: Are you there?
PRIEST: No one saw you?
ANNE: No.
PRIEST: You brought the money.
PRIEST: And the groom? Is he here?
RIEST: Good. Then let us begin.
MARY: George? It's the middle of the night.
MARY: (horrified)
GEORGE: tailing off)
SIR THOMAS: What were you thinking? The marriage of a senior noble is a matter of state. Something only the King can decide..
NORFOLK: Who knows about this?
ANNE: No one.
NORFOLK: Then that is how it shall remain. Forever.
ANNE: But you cannot undo what has been done before God. (defiant stare) And consummated too.
SIR THOMAS: (struggling to contain his anger) There have been improper intimacies, too?
ANNE: I have lain with my husband. There is nothing improper about it..
NORFOLK: SILENCE! My God, if you were my daughter I'd thrash you within an inch of your life..
SIR THOMAS: The boy will return to Northumberland - where he will marry the Talbot girl. As arranged.
ORFOLK: As for you. You will go to France and stay there until you have learned your lesson.
MARY: What?
ORFOLK: How could you do this to your sister? You know full well her friendship with the King is at an extremely delicate stage. Any scandal or black mark against Mary's name now could be fatal.
NORFOLK: You will join the court of the French Queen. And stay there until your father has forgiven you.
ANNE: ou told them, didn't you? a beat) How COULD you?
MARY: Because you would never have got away with it. And it would have ruined your prospects forever. (a beat) Believe me. I did it for your good.
ANNE: Really? For MY good? I'll try to remind myself of that. While I'm in exile. And you're here, in the King's bed, and unchallenged for our father's affection. a beat) That it was for MY good. Not yours.
MARY: ANNE, wait..!
MASKED MAN: Why look so glum, Mary?
MARY: What reason have I to be happy?
MASKED MAN: ou have two men, the King of England and I, both fighting for your love.
MARY: Do I know you?
MASKED MAN: You know me, Mary - but not half as well as I know you. I know you better than anyone here. And love you better than anyone here, too. And if God had made ME your husband instead of William Carey, one thing I know.. (a beat) I would never have let you go.
MARY: Wait! Who ARE you?
MASKED MAN #2: wonder, will you be kind to me?
MARY: Your Majesty..!
HENRY: he faints! Quick! Take her to my rooms! Call my physicians..!
ENRY: Go! Leave us! Go!
MARY: Thank you, your Grace.
HENRY: `Henry', please. The first rule of this room, is to leave `Your Grace's' and `Your Majesty's' outside.
HENRY: Is there anything I can bring you?
MARY: No.
HENRY: Nothing to increase your comfort or well- being?
MARY: You might ask your servants to bring me some water.
HENRY: (gestures) HENRY (cont'd)
HENRY: a beat)
MARY: (can't believe she's saying this)
HENRY: Do you not know what it is to be lonely in a marriage?
MARY: Yes. I do now.
ENRY: married my brother's widow because my father ordered it. As a duty. To keep the alliance with Spain. And she is a remarkable woman. And wife.
HENRY: But I never looked at her or longed for her the way I do you.
HENRY: Imagine how different it might have been. For both of us..had we been able to chose for ourselves..
TAFFORD: Good morning.
STAFFORD: I have orders to bring you to your father.
MARY: My father..? a beat) Well, we'd better not keep him waiting.
NORFOLK: Well..?
NORFOLK: Did he have you?
MARY: Yes.
NORFOLK: More than once?
NORFOLK: You'd better get used to talking about it. Once you sleep with the king, it's not a private matter any more.
MARY: Yes. More than once.
NORFOLK: So he was satisfied?
MARY: I believe so, Uncle.
NORFOLK: ood. This is where our work begins. It's one thing to catch the king. Quite another to keep him.
NORFOLK: I want you to keep her spotless, hair washed every day. She must read all the latest books and be able to venture and defend an interesting opinion. She must know her music, must be energetic and entertaining - in company and in bed. That's how he likes his women. And if ever she's in any doubt as to how to conduct herself, or what to do next - she should simply watch the Queen. That woman kept him from straying for eleven years. And the effort almost killed her.
HENRY: The biggest warship in the fleet. Thirty- two guns and two hundred feet long, and with your permission Thomas.. (We notice SIR THOMAS's clothes have become more expensive, grander) ..I'd like to name her after your daughter. The "Mary Boleyn".
SIR THOMAS: Majesty! I'm...I'm speechless..
HENRY: (gestures)
GEORGE (O.S.): Jane Parker..?
EORGE: I beg you, Father. No.
SIR THOMAS: She's well connected, her father is cousin to the King. And there's money, too.
GEORGE: But must I actually...marry her?
SIR THOMAS: thought you had ambitions for this family.      G
EORGE: I do.
SIR THOMAS: And that you wish to make a contribution yourself. Not just stand back and watch your sisters.
SIR THOMAS: Then my advice would be to start behaving like a man. A real man. Do I make myself clear?
GEORGE: (quiet) Yes, Sir.
WILLIAM: You're in love with him, aren't you?
MARY: illiam, you're drunk.
WILLIAM: How is it? With him?
MARY: He pleases me. Is that what you want to hear?
WILLIAM: What does he do to you? Tell me. I want to know..
WILLIAM: I know you look at me with contempt. But I had no choice. Your father insisted I stand aside. What was I expected to do?
MARY: Say `no', husband. (a beat) That was all you had to do.
SIR THOMAS: Are you certain?
MARY: Yes.
SIR THOMAS: n that case...I suppose...someone should tell the King.
SIR THOMAS (O.S.): Keep them shut...still shut..
SIR THOMAS: Now open!
SIR THOMAS: There's more. Thanks to you, I am to become an Earl. Your brother a Viscount. SIR THOMAS (cont'd) In addition, we have received a number of new grants and estates. pointedly, to LADY
ELIZABETH): So our debts are paid off.
LADY ELIZABETH: Just be aware. These `gifts', this `favour' can go as swiftly as it comes. These rooms belonged to the Duke of Buckingham. Once the King's closest friend. Now his head rots on a spike..
SIR THOMAS: Because he committed treason.
ADY ELIZABETH: But what is `treason'? It's anything the King or his lawyers decide it to be. Anything that offends him, or causes him displeasure. a beat) And can you assure me we'll never do that?
SIR THOMAS: Pay her no heed..
PHYSICIAN: Happily, the baby lives. She's not miscarried.
PHYSICIAN: But the placenta is weak. For the sake of the child..
PHYSICIAN: She must begin her lying-in immediately.
MARY: (horrified) What?
MARY: But I'm only three months..
HENRY: ou poor girl. All alone in here. But the time will fly by.
MARY: Will it? It's six months?
HENRY: I know. But the most important thing is a healthy child. HENRY (cont'd) I'll come and see you as often as I can. I promise.
NORFOLK: For the moment he's still visiting Mary. But for how long? The Queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty little Spanish things. Not to mention the Seymours with that girl of theirs.
NORFOLK: What we need is someone from OUR family who will keep the King focused on Mary, reminding him of her while she is absent.
NORFOLK: What? Speak..
SIR THOMAS: It's just...I was going to suggest Anne.
NORFOLK: You couldn't control that girl last time. What makes you think it would be any different now?
SIR THOMAS: I've had favourable reports from the Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is quite changed.
MARY: Why?
GEORGE: I suppose they felt three years of exile was punishment enough.
MARY: But the King visits me every day. There's no need for her. Or anyone else.
GEORGE: They just want to protect you. Leave nothing to chance.
MARY: But in who's interests do they imagine Anne will act? Certainly not mine. GEORGE (cont'd) Why DO they make this room such a dungeon? Does it really need to be this dark?
GEORGE: Don't worry. She's had three years to forgive you. And she's not going to risk being sent away again. She'll do as she's told, I'm sure. (a beat) Besides, the most important thing is..
GEORGE: The three of us will be together again.
HENRY: What's the noise? I can hardly hear myself think!
BRANDON: It's Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her stories about life at the French court. They are particularly amusing.
HENRY: I'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and she is lying-in with a certain child in her belly!
HENRY: (a beat)
SIR THOMAS: You should have seen the Seymours! Their faces!
SIR THOMAS: They must have thought that with you out of the way, they had a real opportunity with that pale-faced thing of theirs, Jane... SIR THOMAS (cont'd) But Anne put pay to that. Last night, the King only had eyes for us Boleyns.
MARY: Or HER, you mean.
SIR THOMAS: What?
MARY: 'm wary of any suggestion that Anne would serve anyone but herself. France can't have changed her THAT much.
SIR THOMAS: n this occasion I am quite satisfied she was being loyal to you.
MARY: Really? MARY (cont'd) Then ask yourself this. If she is really so concerned for my well-being... (a beat)
HENRY: You're a fortunate man, George. To be blessed with G two such sisters.
EORGE: Yes, my Lord.
ENRY: Tell me. Are they as different in temper as they are in looks?
GEORGE: Oh, yes. Each has her own, quite distinct virtues. Mary for example..
HENRY: I'm familiar with Mary's. Tell me about Anne's.
GEORGE: Anne? Well, she's strong. Some might say `difficult'.
ENRY: Headstrong. With a fiery temper.
GEORGE: But with it comes great passion, too. It's both the best and the worst thing about her. a beat) There are no half measures with Anne.
HENRY: Careful, you'll make me think I chose the wrong Boleyn girl.
GEORGE: Oh, no. I'm certain Mary is the   right choice. You will have a serene,   happy, life with her. The risk is with   Anne, it might be like being caught in a   wild summer storm.
HENRY: Is that so..?
HENRY: storm, you say..?
ERVANT: From the King, madam.
ANNE: Open it.
ANNE: I said `open it.'
ANNE: Now close it again. And send it back. ANNE (cont'd) You heard me.
HENRY: She did what?
SERVANT: Sent it back, your Grace.
HENRY: Sent it back?
HENRY: What? Again?
LADY ELIZABETH: Your Majesty.
HENRY: Your daughter. Where is she?
LADY ELIZABETH: Mary..?
HENRY: Anne!
HENRY: Anne..       A
ANNE: (hurriedly dressing) Your Grace?
HENRY: You received my gifts?
ANNE: Yes.
HENRY: And? They did not please you?
ANNE: On the contrary, my Lord. They pleased me greatly.
HENRY: Then why did you return them?
ANNE: ecause my sister lies in bed with your child. If you wish to please me, Sir, then send her the gifts you send me.
HENRY: I have shown Mary enough kindness and generosity. It's you I want, Anne.
ANNE: beg you, my Lord, do not do this. What has changed so?
HENRY: YOU. Don't you see? YOU have changed.
ANNE: But Mary is still the mother of your child. And even if she weren't..
ENRY: What?
ANNE: How could I forget that you chose her above me when we first met? You liked her better.
HENRY: Not true..
ANNE: Either way, I could never betray my own sister..
AN: Now I beg you, leave me. This is too difficult to bear.
HENRY: You see! The same pain as mine! It proves you feel the same way!
ANNE: Perhaps. But since it can never come to anything..
HENRY: Let me decide that. For now, you have given me hope.
STAFFORD: Sir Thomas! It's Mary..!
SIR THOMAS: Does the King know?
M: (a dagger in her heart) MARY (cont'd)
NORFOLK: Damn you! Three years we've been working on this! Not a single detail was left to chance! And now, in the moment of our greatest glory..
NORFOLK: All I can say is you'd better have a plan. And it had better work.
ANNE: Or what...Uncle?
LADY ELIZABETH: Stop it! Both of you. What shall we do about Mary? And the child? Or have we forgotten them already?
ANNE: Mary should go back to her husband.
ANNE: She has been inconvenienced long enough by this family.
ADY ELIZABETH: Fine. Then you can be the one to tell her.
LADY ELIZABETH: I think you've earned that privilege.
MARY: How can you show your face in here?
ANNE: I understand you're angry - but be assured. I did nothing, except remind him of you.
MARY: Oh, spare me. You did this deliberately. As revenge. (a beat) And now you have what you wanted you probably think justice has been done.
ANNE: Well, hasn't it?
MARY: Be careful, that's my advice. Learn from my experience. Because he'll only do to you what he has done to me.
ANNE: Never. I'll make sure he understands I'm a greater thing by far. That he can never have me until he makes me a far greater offer.
MARY: You'll never get Henry Percy back, if that's what you mean.
ANNE: That's not what I mean.
ANNE: And don't you ever mention his name to me again. I'll never forget how you betrayed me.
MARY: If that's what you think, fine. Tell yourself that.
ANNE: I did, sister. Every day for three years.
W: Have you christened the child?
MARY: Henry.
WILLIAM: I see.
WILLIAM: And is he to take my name? Or is he to be a Fitzroy or some other sign that he is a royal bast...
MARY: He is to be Henry Carey.
WILLIAM: I see.
WILLIAM: Well, then, here we are.
WILLIAM: I could pretend none of this ever happened. Start again. (a beat) If you could.
HENRY: Well, I have done what you asked. Will you give yourself to me, now?
ANNE: As what?
HENRY: My one true mistress. To whom I am loyal above all others?
ANNE: But it's not true. You are loyal to the QUEEN above all others.
HENRY: My wife? I barely see her.
ANNE: But she sits on a throne beside you. Accompanies you to every state function.
ENRY: For appearance sakes only. In every other regard, our marriage is a sham.
ANNE: Still, she is your WIFE. And ever present. And I feel her eyes on me. And those of her spies.
ANNE: And look at us. Forever reduced to meeting in secret like this. Speaking in whispers. a beat) Hardly conducive to passion?
HENRY: Well, what would you have me do?
HENRY: Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for the Queen to be sent to a nunnery.
HENRY: She will protest, of course. She won't go quietly, but she knows she has failed to give me a son, and deserves her exile. HENRY kisses ANNE) Which leaves you all alone at court..
HENRY: ...queen in all but name. Mother to any future heir.
HENRY: So, is this assurance enough? Will you give yourself to me now?
ANNE: I'd like to. But I'm afraid I find the insult too much to bear.
HENRY: What insult?
ANNE: Because as long as we remain unmarried, any child I gave you would forever be daubed `bastard' and I a `whore'.
ENRY: ut what alternative is there? throws hands up in exasperation) My love for the Queen may have died, but even you must concede, she is still very much alive. A
ANNE: Katherine of Aragon is alive. That woman is not worthy of the title `Queen'.
ENRY: Oh, Anne.
ANNE: I really do not know why we waste time talking of convents when you could annul the marriage.
HENRY: Annul it?
ANNE: That woman married two brothers and therefore sinned against God.
HENRY: But she never consummated the marriage with my brother.
ANNE: They were married six months.
HENRY: Arthur was a sick man.
ANNE: And Katherine is a shrewd woman who knew that her position as Queen would never be safe until she bedded your brother. (a beat) Talk to your advisers. They will tell you as much.
HENRY: Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen?
ANNE: But that's wonderful.
ANNE: Why do you look sad?
HENRY: Because she will contest it. Which means putting her on trial. And hearing these delicate matters in public.
ANNE: es. But any court made up of YOUR Bishops will surely find in YOUR favour. And declare the marriage invalid.
ANNE: hen you, my sweet Lord, will be free to remarry. (sensing his arousal) Then I can give myself to you fully. kissing him lower, lower..) And give you everything you.. (a beat) ..desire.
TAFFORD: She's beautiful.
MARY: Thank you.
STAFFORD: I brought gifts from your family. A night-dress from your mother. (to YOUNG HENRY) This from your Uncle George.
MARY: Please be sure to thank them - though one wonders what's kept them so busy that not a single one of them found time to visit the new baby.
STAFFORD: It's Anne. She's turning this country on its head. She has persuaded the king to test the validity of his marriage, and put the QueenM on trial.
MARY: What?
STAFFORD: She continues to hold out. Expertly witholding her favours until...
MARY: ..until what?
STAFFORD: Until he makes her the ultimate offer.
MARY: High stakes indeed.
MARY: And my brother George?
TAFFORD: Continues to be promoted. As does your Father. I lost track of their latest titles.
STAFFORD: ow is your husband? I heard he was unwell.
MARY: He is.
STAFFORD: I'm sorry.
WILLIAM (O.S.): Mary..!
STAFFORD: (pulling horse up) Whoa..
HENRY: The Queen has insisted a Papal representative be present at the trial. But Wolsey has assured me the trial will proceed for appearance sake only. We have our verdict.
ANNE: Then what troubles you?
HENRY: One or two friends have refused to lend their support. Among them, Thomas More. (a beat) And then there's the small matter of my conscience.
ANNE: Why? You have justice on your side.
HENRY: Do I?
SIR THOMAS: `Mary Talbot'.
ANNE: Who?
SIR THOMAS: Mary Talbot!! The girl that married Henry Percy. It seems she has petitioned the King, demanding a divorce from her husband( on the grounds.. he can hardly bring himself to say the words) ...that his prior betrothal to you was actually.. (his knuckles whiten) ..consummated.
SIR THOMAS: I knew this would come back to haunt us!
ANNE: I must go to the King.
SIR THOMAS: No! He doesn't want to see you! Or hear a word from your lips! He's far too angry. a beat) It seems the only Boleyn he will speak to, the only person who's testimony he will trust in this matter.. (a beat) ...is Mary.
ANNE: Mary?
SIR THOMAS: Mary.
SIR THOMAS: We're so sorry. clears throat) About your husband..
ANNE: uch beautiful hair.
ANNE: Thank you for coming.
ANNE: I hate how this matter has come between us. I wanted to come to see you after your daughter was born, and again when your husband died, but..
MARY: It's fine.
MARY: Leave me. Please..?
ANNE: I'm frightened, Mary. What have I done?
HENRY: Ah! Mary! Come in.
HENRY: Closer.. (beckons) Into the light.
HENRY: The Other Boleyn Girl. I'd forgotten how beautiful you were.
MARY: ou asked to see me, your Grace?
ANNE: And..?
OUNG HENRY: Mama? What's the matter?
MARY: (putting brave face on) Nothing.
ANNE: (with difficulty) I am forever in your debt.
MARY: You owe me nothing, sister. I did it that we may finally draw a line beneath everything that has happened between us.
ANNE: hen let it be exactly that. A new start between us. Here at court.
MARY: Thank you. But I'd rather go back to our home in the country.
ANNE: What? That damp old ruin? With no food? Or warmth? a beat) Why don't you let your family look after you? Your children would have the best of everything here. They would grow up safe and secure.
MARY: ho's that?
SIR THOMAS: The Papal Legate. Sent by the Pope to preside over the Queen's trial.
MARY: So, it's true. It's really happening?
ANNE: Yes, it is. Stay with me, please? I need my sister by me side.
ANNE: a beat) ANNE (cont'd)
UEEN KATHERINE: (a beat)
CRIER: (calling out)
KATHERINE: ATHERINE (cont'd)
HENRY: (defiant)
WOLSEY: Since it has pleased the Queen to absent herself from the court, the trial will simply proceed without her.
ANNE: Wolsey promised the King his verdict. Instead he has humiliated him.
SIR THOMAS: But they are continuing with the trial. And the Bishops will still find in the King's favour.
ANNE: Yes. But without the Pope's blessing, the result will seem hollow. a frustrated gesture) If only the King would take matters into his own hands.
ADY ELIZABETH: And do what? His only option would be to reject the Catholic Church? And his faith would never allow it.
SIR THOMAS: Nor his good sense. Breaking with Rome would isolate England politically. Leave us at the mercy of the Protestants.
ANNE: But the alternative is leaving this country without an heir. Failing in his duty as a King. And risking civil war. ANNE (cont'd)
S: omehow I need to make him understand that it is a fair price for a legitimate heir.
MARY: (becoming suspicious) What?
HENRY: Who's this?
A: Go, on..
YOUNG HENRY: My name is Henry.
HENRY: Is it, now? A fine name. (raises eyebrow) And how old are you?
YOUNG HENRY: Four, Sir. YOUNG HENRY (cont'd) Is that sword real?
HENRY: I think so. Would you like to see it?
HENRY: Now, `on guard'.
KATHERINE: How dare you! (struggling) Take your hands off me..
HENRY: Now you will give yourself to me.
ANNE: I thought I had made myself clear. Until we are married, there is no questi..
HENRY: Silence! Enough of your GAMES! (tearing at her dress) I have torn apart this country for you, gone against every principle in my heart, I've endured the doubts and counsel of good men and silenced them with the axe...just to be with you..
HENRY: Now prove to me it was worth the sacrifice.
ANNE: Stop, you are hurting me..!
ANNE: How was he with you? As a lover?
MARY: Tender. a beat) Surprisingly so. a beat) Why?
ANNE: No reason.
ARCHIBISHOP: (in LATIN, we see sub-titles) Do you, Henry Tudor, take Anne Boleyn as your lawful wedded wife..?
HENRY: I do.
ANNE: (haunted, hollow)
ANNE: indicates an OLD courtier, in his 60's)
STAFFORD: Wait! Mary..
STAFFORD: I couldn't help overhearing. And before you agree to any of your sister's matches, let me just say..
STAFFORD: ..I have saved money...not a lot...but enough. I've my eye on a place in the West...Tatton...near where I grew up..
MARY: hat? (surely this is a joke) Stafford?
STAFFORD: Mary...I love you. There..I've said it. From the moment I joined your family..
MARY: Wait..
M: It was you, wasn't it? At the masked ball?
STAFFORD: Yes.
MARY: Oh, Stafford..
STAFFORD: Mary..I have watched how your family has treated you.
MARY: But it's impossible. You know that. Now Anne's Queen, my family would never allow it.
STAFFORD: And you would CARE? What THEY think? After everything they have done to you?
ANNE: God, I look hideous.
EORGE: Does it hurt?
ANNE: Little nips and stabs.
GEORGE: Just imagine. It it's a boy. The unholy trinity will be mother, uncle and aunt to the next King of England.
ANNE: But if it isn't? The King will take that as evidence of God's displeasure. And will turn further against me. He's already become so cold.
ANNE: They say you can tell by the shape of the stomach. Mary, what do you say? Boy or girl?
ANNE: What's the matter with her?
ANNE: You've been like this for days.
MARY: What?
ANNE: Mooning. You're not in love, are you?
MARY: What? (blushing) Certainly not..
MARY: (flustered) In love!
MIDWIFE: And again, one more..
MIDWIFE: It's done, your Majesty..!
MARY: Well done...
ANNE: And..?
MARY: It's a girl!
MARY: A beautiful, healthy girl.
ANNE: A girl?
SIR THOMAS: She has named her Elizabeth. After your mother.
HENRY: Is the child healthy?
SIR THOMAS: Perfectly, Sir.
ENRY: Well, if we can have a healthy daughter, we can have a healthy son.
A: Who is it?
MARY: Lady Somerset, I believe.
ANNE: Yesterday it was the wife of the French Ambassador. The day before with the Countess of Salisbury. (a frustrated gesture) How could he DO that to me? So SOON?
ANNE: Now I know how it must have been for you.
ANNE (O.S.): You can't ignore me like this. I am your wife! Why don't you just admit it!
HENRY (O.S.): ecause it's not true!
ANNE (O.S.): Liar! I can smell the whore on you! Get away from me! You disgust me!
ANNE: I struck him today. What am I doing? I am destroying this all on my own..
ANNE: I can't sleep at night! And without sleep I cannot think!
MARY: Oh, Anne..
ANNE: nd it's getting more and more difficult to arouse him. Some nights he cannot do it...at all. I have to resort to ever more disgusting...then he hates himself in the morning...hates me even more for what I made him do...
ANNE: It's slipping away, Mary. I can feel it.
SIR THOMAS: And..?
EORGE: GEORGE (cont'd)
GEORGE: (a beat)
MARY: (under her breath) ..Tatton.
GEORGE: Where he grew up, apparently. Did you know he came from a better stable than all of us? His grandmother was a Beaufort, cousin to the King. And he never mentioned it. (shrugs) Who'd have guessed?
ANNE: I'm fine, thank you. (visibly paranoid) Just a bad dream.
ANNE: (flinches as she speaks) But fetch my brother and sister, will you?
MARY: (heart cracks)
ANNE: a beat)
ANNE: rolling eyes)
GEORGE: horrified)
ANNE: (a beat)
MARY: (feeling nauseous)
MARY: Come, George..
ANNE: George is staying. He understands this involves the whole family..
MARY: No. Come, George..
ANNE: George, is STAYING!
MARY: (her heart cracking) I pray for you both.
ANNE: Mary! Come back!
MARY: Come on, darling wake up.
YOUNG HENRY: Where are we going?
MARY: Away from here. Far, far away.
YOUNG HENRY: Who lives here, Mother?
MARY: Someone. (clears throat) A friend.
MARY: William?
OUNG HENRY: Mama, I'm hungry.
CATHERINE: Me, too.
MARY: I'm sorry. a beat) I just didn't know where else to go.
RIEST: Do you, Mary, take William as your lawful wedded husband?
MARY: I do.
STAFFORD: News from court.
MARY: hat? It's Anne. Tell me.. (fearing the worst) She miscarried the child?
STAFFORD: They say it was deformed...monstrous. She is charged with incest and of summoning the devil. Your brother, too. He has already been sentenced. Anne is in the Tower, awaiting trial.
MARY: I must go.
STAFFORD: And do what? George is doomed. For Anne it's only a matter of time.
MARY: I can petition the King..
STAFFORD: ou think he will listen? It's his own neck he's saving by getting rid of them, can't you see?
STAFFORD: Fine, go. But if you do, you might as well kiss your children goodbye. You are Anne's sister. That alone makes you her accomplice and co-conspirator.
MARY: I have no choice. Anne and George are my family. I cannot desert them.
STAFFORD: And what of your new family? Your
MARY: Henry and Catherine have you. Anne and George have no one. (a beat) I'm sorry..
ANNE: It is a sad day for England when the nobles do not rise for their Queen.
NORFOLK: And even sadder when that same Queen is charged with adultery and incest.
ANNE: Charged is different to convicted, Uncle. Or is it not? In this court?
NORFOLK: Master Cromwell, read out the indictment..
CROMWELL: The charge is that in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of our Sovereign Henry, King of England, his wife, the Queen, being seduced by the Devil, did knowingly commit adultery, high treason and offences against God.
NORFOLK: How do you plead?
ANNE: Not guilty, my Lord.
ANNE: My noble Lords..the love I have for my brother is the love any sister would have for someone with whom she has grown up in the same house, nursed when sick, played games as children, shared life's celebrations.
ANNE: That is the love I have for him. Not what you suggest.
ANNE (V/O): Judge me, my Lords, as you see fit. But never forget that your verdicts will be judged again by God, in the greatest court of all..
NORFOLK (V/O): My Lords, the time has come to cast your vote.
NORFOLK: (unflinching) Guilty.
NORFOLK: In which case, the burden falls on me to pass sentence.
MARY: ho was it?
HENRY: Mary..?
ENRY: Leave us.
HENRY: ALL of you!
MARY: Your Majesty.. (falling into a deep curtsey as HENRY closes the door ensuring their privacy) I understand my family has offended you. But having taken my brother today, I beg you to spare my sister.
HENRY: Oh, Mary...
MARY: (a beat)
MARY: (a beat)
HENRY: o. I will reflect on the matter.
MARY: Oh, Anne..
ANNE: How has it come to this?
MARY: Ssshhhhh.
ANNE: They're letting the crowds in.
MARY: It's all right. You will be spared. The King as good as gave me his word.
ANNE: The King saw you?
MARY: Yes.
ANNE: We all made a mess of that, didn't we? We all underestimated little Mary.
ANNE: I don't think he ever stopped loving you.
MARY: That's not true.
ANNE: It is. He never loved me in the same way. And deep down you know it.
ANNE: You should have been Queen. You even gave him a son. But instead all this has happened because.. (a beat) Because I couldn't bear to be the Other Boleyn Girl.
ANNE: And now look?
ANNE: Hold me..
ANNE: You'll look after Elizabeth?
MARY: It will be all right. Trust me.
ANNE: he couldn't ask for a better moth... (breaks down, composes herself)
MARY: e will spare you. I am sure of it.
ANNE: I...I come here to die...a loyal subject..
MARY: Come on..
ANNE: ..I..I do not blame the King. Never was there a more just or goodly Lord..
ANNE: ..I beg God's forgiveness and his mercy..
CROMWELL (V.O.): "Madam..."
CROMWELL (V.O.): ..the King has spared you because of his respect and affection for you and because you are the mother of his son."
CROMWELL (V.O.): "But you risked your life coming to court and you are advised you not to do so again. You will not be shown the same clemency a second time. Your sister Anne was tried and found guilty, her crimes were high treason and she deserves to die. Cromwell."
MARY: No!
