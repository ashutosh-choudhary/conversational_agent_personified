<b>	AN AMERICAN FLAG
</b>
	Oddly still, posted in gray dusty sand.

<b>	WIDEN TO REVEAL:
</b>
<b>	EXT. LUNAR SURFACE - THE MOON
</b>
	One small step for man, one large pile of garbage for moon-
	kind.  Untouched for years, the flag stands next to the
	castoff remains of the Apollo mission.  Slowly the discarded
	equipment begins to RATTLE and SHAKE.

	AN ENORMOUS SHADOW creeps towards us blotting out the horizon,
	a loud RUMBLE is heard.

	Suddenly we are covered in DARKNESS as the SHADOW engulfs us.
	Only the lonely image of our EARTH hangs in the air, until a
	huge silhouetted OBJECT suddenly blocks our view.

	A field of large satellite dishes scan the skies.

	Super up: <u>S.E.T.I. INSTITUTE, NEW MEXICO</u>

<b>	INT. INSTITUTE - MONITORING CONTROL CENTER - SAME
</b>
	A lone TECHNICIAN works on his putting skills.  Behind him,
	wall to wall technical equipment quietly sifts through data.
	A RED LIGHT begins to flash.

	The Technician turns and slowly walks towards the source.  One
	by one a series of LIGHTS turn on.  The Technician (TECH ONE)
	grabs a pair of headphones.  His eyes widen.

<b>	INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - SAME

	Sleepily a SUPERVISOR picks up the phone.

<b>				SUPERVISOR
</b>		If this isn't an insanely
		beautiful woman, I'm hanging up.

<b>	INT. CONTROL CENTER - SAME
</b>
<b>				TECH ONE
</b>		Shut up and listen.

	He holds the phone up to a speaker, increases the volume.  A
	strange FLUCTUATING TONE plays out in sequential patterns.

<b>	INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - SAME
</b>
	HEARING it, the Supervisor BOLTS UP, banging his head on the
	bunk above him.

<b>	INT. CONTROL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
	A pajama party on acid.  Five other technicians, in various
	states of undress, hover anxiously around the main console.
	The Supervisor enters, tying his robe.

<b>				SUPERVISOR
</b>		God, I hope it's not just another
		damned Russian spy job.

<b>				TECH THREE

		Negative.  Computer affirms the 
		signal is unidentified.

<b>				TECH TWO
</b>			(hanging up the phone)
		The boy from Air Res Traffic say the 
		skies are clear.  No terrestrial
		launches.

<b>				TECH ONE
</b>		It's the real thing.  A radio
		signal from another world.

	The room becomes quiet as they realize that after years of
	searching the heavens, they might have finally found
	something.

<b>				SUPERVISOR
</b>		Let's not jump the gun.  Run a
		trajectory source computation.

	Tech Three slides over to another computer.

				SUPERVISOR (cont'd)
		I want to know exactly where it's
		coming from.

<b>				TECH THREE
</b>		This can't be right.

	Tech Three just stares at his screen in disbelief.

<b>				SUPERVISOR
</b>		What's wrong?

<b>				TECH THREE
</b>		Calculated distance from source is
		at three hundred and eight five
		thousand kilometers.
			(turning to Supervisor)
		It's coming from the moon.

	The Supervisor reaches over and turns up the volume on the
	speaker.  As they listen to the strange TONES we...

	Commander in Chief U.S. Space Command.  Understandably
	nervous, the COMMANDING OFFICER escorts him down the hall.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		Who else knows about this?

<b>				COMMANDING OFFICER
</b>		S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a
		signal but they're even more
		confused than we are.

	The General shoots him a disapproving glance.

<b>				COMMANDING OFFICER
</b>		Excuse me, Sir.

	He slides his security card through the lock and the doors fly
	open.

	feverishly through the night.  The Officers cross the room.

	Super: <u>SPACE COMMAND - THE PENTAGON</u>

<b>				COMMANDING OFFICER
</b>		Satellite reception has been
		impaired but we were able to get
		these.

	They arrive at a glass table.  The surrounding officers snap
	to attention as a SECOND OFFICER quickly brings over a large
	transparency.  We SEE a grainy image of a large vague OBJECT.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		Looks like a big turd.

	The two Officers exchange a glance.

<b>				COMMANDING OFFICER
</b>		We estimate it has a diameter of
		over five hundred and fifty
		kilometers and a mass roughly one
		fourth the size of our moon.

	The General turns to the Second Officer, concerned.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		A meteor?

<b>				SECOND OFFICER
</b>		No Sir.  Definitely not.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		How do you know?

<b>				SECOND OFFICER
</b>		Well, er... it's slowing down.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		It's doing what?

<b>				SECOND OFFICER
</b>		It's... slowing down, Sir.

	The General walks over to a phone, picks it up.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		Get me the Secretary of Defense.

		Then wake him up.

	Laying in bed THOMAS J. WHITMORE reads a stack of papers.  The
	phone RINGS.

<b>				WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>			(filtering through phone)
		Hi. It's me.

	The warm look on Whitmore's face tells us everything about how
	he feels about the woman on the other end.

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>		Hi honey.  What time is it there?

<b>	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Dressed in a night gown, MRS. MARGARET WHITMORE unpacks her
	briefing papers lays them out on a small desk as she talks.
	Through the window we SEE Los Angeles at night.

<b>				MARGARET
</b>		Two in the morning.  I <u>know</u> I
		didn't wake you?

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>			(filtered)
		As a matter of fact you did.

<b>				MARGARET
</b>			(smiles)
		Liar.

<b>	INT. WHITMORE BEDROOM - SAME
</b>
	Whitmore sits up.

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>		I have a confession to make.
		There's a beautiful young blonde
		sleeping next to me.

	Sleeping next to him, his six-year-old daughter, PATRICIA.

<b>				MARGARET
</b>			(filtered)
		You didn't let her stay up
		watching T.V. all night?

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>		Of course not.

	The little girl stirs awake, looks up.

<b>				PATRICIA
</b>		Mommy?

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>		You're flying back right after the
		luncheon?  Okay, here she is.

	Whitmore hands her the phone and gets out of bed.  Habitably
	he turns on the television.

<b>	T.V. - NEWS PROGRAM
</b>
	Several "Pundits" sit around a MaLaughlin-type news discussion
	program.  The picture quality is snowy, static ridden.

<b>				PUNDIT #1
</b>		... the inexperience in public
		office was inevitably going to
		catch up with him.  He's
		scarified his ideals for
		"politics as usual."

	Whitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality.

<b>				PUNDIT #2
</b>		...I said this during the
		campaign.  Leadership as a pilot
		in the Gulf War has no
		relationship to political
		leadership.  It's a different
		animal...

	Suddenly the channel changes.  A cartoon comes on.  Whitmore
	turns to his daughter who holds he remote.

<b>				PATRICIA
</b>			(into phone)
		Daddy let me watch Letterman.

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>			Traitor.

	Whitmore exits the room.

<b>	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	As Whitmore steps out of his bedroom, a Security guard snaps
	to attention.  Someone hidden behind a newspaper, sits on a
	bench.

<b>				SECURITY GUARD
</b>		Good morning, Mr. President.

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>		Good morning, George.

	The paper is dropped revealing CONSTANCE HALBROOK, mid-
	thirties, aggressive, sharp, the President's communications
	director.  Quickly she gathers her things and follows
	Whitmore.

<b>	INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Two servants are preparing breakfast as Whitmore and Constance
	enter.  Whitmore sits down, grabs a coffee.

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>		You're up early this morning,
		Connie.

	She tosses him one of the many newspapers in her hands.

<b>				CONSTANCE
</b>		They're not attacking your
		policies, they're attacking your
		age.
			(another paper; reading)
		"...addressing Congress, Whitmore
		seems less like the President and
		more like the orphan child Oliver
		asking, 'please sir, I'd like some
		more.'"

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>		Clever.

<b>				CONSTANCE
</b>		Age was never an issue when you
		stuck to your gun.  You were
		thought of as young and
		idealistic.  But the message has
		gotten lost.  There's too much
		compromise, too much politics.

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>			(pointedly)
		Isn't it amazing how fast everyone
		can turn against you.

	Realizing she may be pushing him too far, she hands him
	another paper.

<b>				CONSTANCE
</b>		Well, the Orange County Register
		has named you one of the ten
		sexiest men of the year.

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>		You see, substance at last.

	An AIDE appears at the doorway.

<b>				CONSTANCE
</b>		Excuse me, Mr. President.  It's
		the Secretary of Defense.

	Whitmore goes to the phone, picks it up.

<b>				WHITMORE
</b>		Yes?  Say that again?

	Drifting away from us the old Russian satellite becomes
	smaller and smaller.  We PAN with it as we SEE it's on a
	collision course with something huge.

	Suddenly the satellite EXPLODES on IMPACT with the much larger
	object that dwarfs the puny piece of hardware.  As huge as it
	is, we get the feeling we've only seen a portion of the total.

	A slow crane down from the Manhattan skyline, revealing...

	With the New York skyline across the Hudson behind them, old
	men sit in this small park playing chess.  Unlike the others,
	DAVID MARTIN is in his early thirties, sixties hippie meets
	nineties yuppie nerd.

	He concentrates intensely on his next move.  MOISHE. sixties.
	smokes a cigar impatiently.

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		What are you waiting?  My social
		security will expire, you'll still
		be sitting there.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		I'm thinking.

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		So think already.

	David makes a move.  Instantly Moishe counters his move.
	David furls his brow in thought.

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		Again he's thinking.

	Moishe reaches into a paper bag and retrieves a coffee in a
	Styrofoam cup.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		You have any idea how long it
		takes for those things to
		decompose?

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		You don't move soon.  I'll begin to
		decompose.

	Just as David finally makes his move, Moishe counters again.
	David shoots him a look and stares back down to the board.

				MOISHE (cont'd)
		David, I've been meaning to talk
		with you.  It's nice you've been
		spending so much time with me,
		but...

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Dad, don't start.

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		I'm only saying, it's been what?
		Four years, you still haven't
		signed your divorce papers.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Three years.

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		Three, four.  Move on.  It's not
		healthy.

	Moishe takes a big puff on the cigar and coughs.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Look who's talking healthy.

	Suddenly David's beeper goes off.

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		How many times is that now?  You
		<u>trying</u> to get fired?

	David moves his queen.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Checkmate.  See you tomorrow, Dad.

	He gives his father a quick kiss and hurries away.

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		That's <u>not</u> checkmate I can

	His bike hoisted on his shoulder, David squeezes through the
	revolving doors. MARTY GILBERT, short, nervous and harried,
	comes rushing over.

<b>				MARTY
</b>		What the hell is the point of
		having a beeper if you don't turn
		it on?

<b>				DAVID
</b>		It was <u>turned</u> on.  I was ignoring
		you.  What's the big emergency?

<b>				MARTY
</b>		Started this morning.  Every
		channel is making like it's
		nineteen fifty.  Snow, static, all
		kinds of distortions.  No one
		knows what the hell is going on.

	David deposits his bike in the kitchenette as Marty tosses his
	coke bottle in the trash.  David retrieves it.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Damn it, Marty.  There's a reason
		we have bins labeled "recycle."

	Finding more bottles in the trash, David turns to Marty
	accusingly.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		What the hell is this?

<b>				MARTY
</b>		So sue me.

	Before David can say anything, Marty ushers him out of the
	room.

<b>	INT. TRANSMISSION FEED - CONTINUOUS

	Technicians are working feverishly.  Clearly every monitor is
	experiencing varying degrees of signal disruption.  David
	moves over to the main console.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Did you try to switch to
		transponder channels?

<b>				MARTY
</b>		Please, would I be this panicked
		if it was that simple?

	David examines the readouts, puzzled.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Let's retrofit the dish to another
		satellite.

<b>				MARTY
</b>		We've tried.  It's not working.
		It's almost as though they

</b>		Stop it.

<b>				TROY
</b>		It's all fuzzy.

<b>				MIGUEL
</b>		You're gonna break it.  Just leave

	Miguel sits a small bottle of medicine and a spoon down in

<b>				TROY
</b>		I don't need it.

<b>				MIGUEL

		Just take it, dick head.

		Alicia!  Make sure he takes his

	His sister, ALICIA, fourteen, hormones kicking in, testing

	the television again.

<b>	EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME - MORNING

	A beat up pick-up truck comes down a dirt road and skids to a

	out, slamming his door.

<b>	INT. BRENNON MOBILE HOME - SAME

	Alicia opens the front door and smiles flirtatiously at the
	angry farmers, LUCAS, who marches over.  Miguel edges her out
	of the doorway, wanting to handle this himself.

<b>				MIGUEL
</b>		Morning, Lucas.

	Lucas holds a bowl full of rotted vegetables.

<b>				LUCAS
</b>		You like these!  I've got a whole
		goddamned crop full!

	Unceremoniously, he dumps them at Miguel's feet.

				LUCAS (cont'd)
		Where the hell is your father?
		You know what time it is?

<b>				MIGUEL
</b>		He had to re-fuel.  There musta
		been a problem.

<b>				LUCAS
</b>		We both know what the problem is.
		He's a damned nut case, is what he

	Troy SMACKS the television again.

<b>				MIGUEL
</b>		Troy, stop it!  I swear to God!

<b>				LUCAS
</b>		Miguel, if he's not in the air in
		twenty minutes, that's it.  I'm

	Lucas storms away.  Again, Troy whacks at the television.

<b>				COMMANDING OFFICER
</b>		Our intelligence tells us the

</b>		Well that's good news.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		With your permission, Mr.

		satellite communication, tracking
		and mapping.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		Have NORAD relay intelligence to
		our on board computers?

	The Technician nods and exits.  Defeated, the President slumps
	sullenly.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		We've moved as many of our forces
		away from the bases as possible
		but we've already sustained heavy
		losses.

	The President nods his approval absently.  Coming out of the
	bathroom, David overhears.

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		I spoke with the Joint Chief when
		they arrived at NORAD.  They
		agree, we must launch a counter
		offensive with a full nuclear
		strike.  Hit 'em with everything
		we've got.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		Above American soil?

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		If we don't strike soon, there may
		not be much of an America left to
		defend.

	The Technician returns, his face is white with fear.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		What's the latest from NORAD?

<b>				OFFICER
</b>		It's gone, sir.  They've taken out
<b>		NORAD.
</b>
<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		That's impossible...

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		My God, the Vice President and the 
		Joint Chiefs...

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		Mr. President, we must launch.  A
		delay now would be more costly
		than when you waited to evacuate
		the cities!

	That stings the President.  He considers the option.  David is
	shocked.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		You can't be seriously considering
		firing nuclear weapons?

<b>				CONSTANCE
</b>		David, don't...

	David pushes past her.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		If you fire nukes, so will the
		rest of the world.  Do you know
		what that kind of fall out will
		do?  How many innocent people...

	The General gets up running interference.  Constance tries to
	pull David back.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>			(stern)
		Sir, i remind you that you are
		just a guest here...

<b>				CONSTANCE
</b>			(overlapping)
		David, please...

<b>				DAVID
</b>		This is insanity!  You'll kill us
		and them at the same time.
		There'll be nothing left!

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>			(interrupting)
		Sit down and shut up!

	Suddenly Moishe is on his feet, interrupting.

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		Don't tell him to shut up!  You'd
		all be dead, were it not for my
		David.  You didn't do anything to
		prevent this!

	As everyone is about to besiege Moishe, the President tries to
	calm him down.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		Sir, there wasn't much more we
		could have done.  We were totally
		unprepared for this.

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		Don't give me unprepared!  Since
		nineteen fifty whatever you guys
		have had that space ship, the
		thing you found in New Mexico.

<b>				DAVID
</b>			(embarrassed)
		Dad, please...

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		What was it, Roswell?  You had the
		space ship, the bodies, everything
		locked up in a bunker, the what is
		it, <u>Area fifty one</u>.  That's it!
		Area fifty one.  You knew and you
		didn't do nothing!

	For the first time in along time, President Whitmore smiles.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		Regardless of what the tabloids
		have said, there were never any
		space crafts recovered by the
		government.  Take my word for it,
		there is no Area 51 and no
		recovered space ship.

	Chief of Staff Nimziki suddenly clears his throat.

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		Uh, excuse me, Mr. President, but
		that's not entirely accurate.

	The President and General Grey turn to Nimziki, shocked.

<b>	SMASHED AND BURNED OUT CARS
</b>
	laying across the roadway.  Suddenly SMASH, Jasmine's
	maintenance truck BLASTS through.

<b>	EXT. HIGHWAY - CITY LIMITS - SAME
</b>
	With the massive devastation in the b.g., Jasmine drives the
	maintenance truck down the highway.  In the back, the few
	survivors she's found.

	In the back, four INJURED PASSENGERS lay across the flatbed as
	a thin, older man, TEDDY tends to them.

<b>	INT. MAINTENANCE TRUCK - SAME
</b>
	Jasmine spots a TALL MAN, his closes in tatters RUNNING down
	the highway, his arms in the air.

<b>				TALL MAN
</b>		The end has come!  He speaketh
		his word and the end hast come!

	Jasmine pulls up along side him.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		Hop on.  We're heading out to El
		Toro.

<b>				TALL MAN
</b>		You cannot defy what has come, it
		is the end!

	The tall man moves off, screaming to the heavens.  As Jasmine
	watches him drift away she SEES...

<b>	OVERTURNED MILITARY HELICOPTER
</b>
	Still smoldering from the crash.  A woman can be seen inside,
	still alive.  Jasmine jumps out.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		Give me a hand.

	Teddy joins Jasmine as they pry open the door.  Inside, the
	pilots have been killed, but Mrs. Whitmore, <u>THE FIRST LADY</u>,
	lays there in great pain, blood across her blouse.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		Let's get her out of here.

	They erase her from the wreckage, laying her on the
	ground.  Dylan comes over, standing next to his mother.

<b>				TEDDY
</b>		She's bleeding pretty bad.

	Suddenly we <u>HEAR</u> the CLICKING of a rifle COCKING.

<b>				MALE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		Who's got the key?

	Jasmine turns and see a REDNECK leveling his rifle at her.
	Behind him a small damaged sports car pulls up, packed to the
	gills with stolen, looted appliances.

<b>				REDNECK
</b>			(yelling to pals)
		Looks like I've solved our
		transportation problem.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		Hey, you're welcome to come with
		us.  We're leaving here anyway...

<b>				REDNECK
</b>		We're not.  Give me the key.
			(yelling back)
		Get 'em off.

	Two GUYS rush from their vehicle over to the maintenance
	truck, pulling the injured off the tailback.

<b>				TALL MAN (O.S.)
</b>		Repent!  Sinners!  Repent!  The
		end hast come!

	Running up from behind, the Tall Man comes over screaming.
	The Redneck turns his gun on him.

<b>				REDNECK
</b>		Back off.  This ain't your
		business.

	As the Redneck is distracted, Jasmine spots the bag of
	fireworks protruding out of Dylan's back pocket.

<b>				TALL MAN
</b>		You cannot go against the word,
		brother.

<b>				REDNECK
</b>		Sure I can.

	The Redneck SHOOTS the Tall Man.  His buddies laugh.

				REDNECK (cont'd)
		Now give me that key, bitch.

	As he turns back to Jasmine, Boomer starts BARKING wildly.
	Just as he turns to shoot the dog, Jasmine lights a key ROCKET
	from the fireworks bag.  The rocket BLASTS into the Redneck,
	his shirt IGNITING ON FIRE.

	The Redneck drops the rifle, attempting to put out the flames,
	his cronies rush to his aid.  Jasmine picks up the gun, moves
	in on them.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		This "bitch" was born in  Alabama
		with a Daddy who loved to hunt.
			(cocking the weapon)
		So don't think for one second that
		I don't know how to use this.

	She FIRES the rifle.  Quickly the rednecks scamper away.

<b>	EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - LATER
</b>
	Dragging a heavy bundle wrapped in his parachute, Steve
	marches across the desert floor.  The alien ARM/TENTACLE
	dangles out of the parachute.

	Exhausted, Steve stops to wipe his brow.  He hears something,
	turns around.

<b>	STEVE'S POV - THE TRAILER ARMADA
</b>
	Several hundred of the trailers from the refugee camp are
	headed en mass towards him.  Smiling, Steve signals them.

	The trailers pull up on either side, surrounding him.  Miguel
	leans out of his trailer.

<b>				MIGUEL
</b>			(sarcastic)
		Need a lift?

<b>				STEVE
</b>		When I flew overhead, I saw some
		kind of base, not far.

	Confused, Miguel checks his map.

<b>				MIGUEL
</b>		It's not on the map.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		Trust me, it's there.

<b>	EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - LATER
</b>
	Flying over the desert, Air Force One sails over an immense
	valley, Area 51 below - hangars, a few buildings, a small air
	strip, not much.

	Super: <u>N.I.A. Base - "Area 51", Nevada</u>

<b>	EXT. RUNWAY - LATER
</b>
	Air Force One lands.  Wheels touch down, skid.

<b>	INT. HANGAR - LATER
</b>
	The large hangar doors open and Air Force One is rolled
	inside.  The President and his entourage are met by a
	contingent of base personnel led by field operative, LT.
	MITCHELL.  He escorts them to a side hallway.

<b>	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Lt. Mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the President
	and his entourage wait in the center of the hall.  With a loud
	hydraulic HUM, the entire hallway begins to SINK DOWN, an
	enormous ELEVATOR.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		Why the hell wasn't I told about
		this place?

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		Two words, Mr. President.
		Plausible deniability.

	General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look.  When the
	elevator stops, a door SLIDES open.

<b>	INT. RESEARCH FACILITIES - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Stepping out of the elevator, they walk into a large state of
	the art, sterile clean research facility.  It is amazingly
	well staffed and organized.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		I don't understand.  Where did all
		this come from?  How did this get
		funded?

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		You didn't think they actually
		spent ten thousand dollars for a
		hammer and thirty thousand for a
		toilet seat, did you?

	The President shoots him a look.  They are greeted by a group
	of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.

<b>				MITCHELL
</b>		Mr. President, I'd like to
		introduce you to Dr. Okun.  He's
		been heading up our research here
		for the last fifteen years.

	Dr. Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much
	time in isolation.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		Mr. President, a real pleasure.
		They don't let us out much, you
		you.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(uncomfortable)
		Yes.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		Well, I guess you'd like to see
		the big tamale?  Follow me.

	They walk up a ramp at the end of the room.  Large heavily
	enforced doors SLIDE open.

<b>	INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	The group steps inside and nearly gasps at...

<b>	THE ALIEN ATTACKER
</b>
	Just like the one that chased Steve.  The entourage stares in
	horror and wonder.  We can SEE the patch-work repairs they've
	made on the ship over the years.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		She's a beaut, ain't she?

	Moishe leans close to David and Constance.

<b>				MOISHE
</b>			(smug)
		Never any space ships recovered by
		the government, huh?

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		We've had this for forty years and
		you don't know anything about
		them?

<b>				OKUN
</b>		Hell no, we know tons about them.
		The nearest stuff has only
		happened in the last few days.

	The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks.
	David, mouth agape, just stares at it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		See, we can't duplicate their type
		of power so we've never been able
		to experiment.  But since these
		guys started showing up, all the
		gizmos inside turned on.  The last
		twenty four hours have been really
		exciting!

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(exploding)
		People are dying out there.  I
		don't think "exciting" is the word
		I'd choose to describe it!

	The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(calming)
		What can you tell us about the
		enemy we're facing?

<b>				OKUN
</b>		Not all too dissimilar to us.
		Breathes oxygen, comparable
		tolerances to heat,
		cold...probably why they're
		interested in our planet.
			(suddenly excited)
		Hey, you wanna see them?

<b>	INT. MEDICAL RESEARCH VAULT - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
	The lights slowly TURN ON, illuminated the vault.  Okun leads
	the group to a sealed partition.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		This is vault, or as some of us
		have come to call it, the "freak
		show."

	Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing...

<b>	FORMALDEHYDE TANKS - ALIENS
</b>
	Three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks.  The
	murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view.  What we do
	see is not pretty.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		When we found them they were
		wearing bio-mechanical suits.
		Once we got them off, we were able
		to learn a great deal about their
		anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar
		digestive system... no vocal cords
		though.  We're assuming they
		communicate with each other
		through other means.

	David cannot contain his fascination.  He steps forward.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		What kind of other means?  Hand
		signals, body language?

<b>				OKUN
</b>		Some kind of extra sensory
		perception.  Telepathy.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		Can they be killed?

<b>				OKUN
</b>		These three died in the crash.
		Their bodies are as frail as our
		own.  You just have to get past
		their technology, which is, I'm
		sorry to say, far more advanced.

	The President turns to David.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		You unlocked a part of that
		technology.  You cracked their
		code.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		All I did was stumble onto their
		signal.  I don't know how helpful
		I can be...

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		Show them what you've discovered.
		Work together.  We've got to find
		a way to beat them.

<b>	EXT. SECURITY GATE - SAME
</b>
	Four armed GUARDS watch the gate.  An armada of trucks and
	trailers heads right for them.  They move into position to
	block their entrance as a blue pick-up skids to a halt before
	them.  Steve stands up from the back of the pick up.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can't open
		the gates without clearance.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		You want to see my clearance?

	Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him
	over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the
	bundled parachute in the flatbed.  Steve rips the fabric aside
	revealing...

<b>	THE ALIEN CREATURE
</b>
	Still unconscious, the alien stirs.  The Guard JUMPS BACK,
	shitting in his pants.  Quickly he signals for the other to
	open the gate.

	The armada quickly drives past.

<b>	BLACKNESS
</b>
	Total darkness.  Suddenly light pours in as a  door is open.
	We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all
	peering at us with inquisitive expressions.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		See the gizmos flashing?

<b>	REVERSE - INSIDE ALIEN CRAFT
</b>
	Sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing.  High tech
	meets organic organisms.  This alien ship looks familiar to
	our own technology and completely different at the same time.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		We've been working around the
		clock trying to get a fix on all
		this crap.  Some stuff we figured
		out right away.

	David climbs in, fascinated.  He touches everything.  Okun
	points to everything as he describes it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		This thing we're pretty sure is
		the life support for the cabin,
		this do-hickey over here is
		connected with the engines, this
		crap...we have no idea what that
		stuff is for.

	David is transfixed by it.  He stares at the small screens
	with flashing light patterns on them.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		But this over here is clearly what
		they use to navigate and guide the
		craft.

	But David still stares at the small screens.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Someone grab my laptop for me?

	One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		Find something interesting?

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Maybe.

	The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he
	quickly flips open and turns on.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		These patterns here, they're
		repeating sequentially, just
		like...

	David turns his laptop around for Okun to see.  The pattern on
	David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		...their countdown signal.  Their
		using this frequency for computer
		communications.  It's how they co-
		ordinate their ships.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		You know, you're really starting
		to make us look bad.

	The two men exchange a smile.  Another TECHY pops his head
	inside.

<b>				TECHY
</b>			(out of breath)
		They got one!  They got one,
		alive!

<b>	INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME
</b>
	The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly
	into the hall.  Okun and his staff surround it.  Trailing
	behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		How long has it been unconscious?

<b>				RUSSELL
</b>		Excuse me Doctor...

<b>				STEVE
</b>		Three hours.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		Get him into containment, stat.

<b>				RUSSELL
</b>		My boy is very sick, he needs
		immediate attention.

	Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall,
	the room begins its hydraulic HUM.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		He's dying out.  I want him
		sprayed down with saline.

	Russell SLAMS his fist against the switch, the room stops.  He
	GRABS a doctor nearby, gets in his face.

<b>				RUSSELL
</b>		My boys is slipping into a diabetic
		coma.  If you don't do something
		about it right now he will die.

	Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds DOCTOR
	ISAACS, meaning business.

</b>		O'Haver, Miller, come with me.
			(to Russell)
		Take us to him.

	Headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls
	to a stop.  Jasmine climbs down out of the truck, her face

	General Grey and Nimziki are in a heated argument.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		You were the head of the National

		about this.  When were you
		planning on informing the rest of
		us!?

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		It had been deemed classified.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		Christ, why didn't you say

		hundreds of American pilots!

	Just then the President enters along with Constance and some
	other ADVISORS.  He examines a paper map of the United States,
	tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia,
		destroyed?

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>			(composing himself)
		And there are scattered reports of
		sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth,
		And Memphis.

	The President and his team take seats at the large conference
	table.

				GENERAL GREY (cont'd)
		We've learned that NATO and
		western allied installations were
		the firs to be taken out.  We
		were next.  They knew exactly where
		and how to hit us.

	Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		And our forces?

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		We're down to approximately
		fifteen percent, Sir.
			(beat)
		If you calculate the time it takes
		them to destroy a city and move
		on, we're looking at world wide
		destruction of every major city

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		We're being exterminated.

	The room is quiet.  Constance runs her fingers through her
	hair.  The door to the room opens and Lt. Mitchell enters with

<b>				MITCHELL
</b>		Mr. President, this is Lt.
		Colonel Steven Hill.

	The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking
	Steve's hand.

<b>				PRESIDENT

<b>				MITCHELL
</b>		Yes, sir.

	The General is concerned but the President is determined.
	They head for the door.

	As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain.  Jasmine rushes
	to her aid.  The color from her face drained, Margaret looks
	like she's taking a turn for the worse.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		Don't move.  Stay still.

	Jasmine adjusts the bandages as Margaret turns and see Dylan

	Okun and two Medical assistants examine the alien creature.
	His arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining
	table.

	For the first time we get a good look at the head of this
	creature, long tentacled-type cords interlocked, covering the
	face.  The doctors attach clamps to each of the cords.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		Everyone ready?

	The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other.  At
	the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the
	interlocked cords.  As the cords unravel, we SEE that this is
	in fact a bio-mechanical SUIT as we REVEAL...

<b>	THE ALIEN
</b>
	Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his
	skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue,
	alien's skin.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		Do we have life support monitors
		recording?

<b>				MED ASSIST #2
</b>		Yes.  If we fuck up it'll all be
		on tape.

<b>				OKUN
</b>		Can we get some ventilation in
		here?  I can't take this smell.

<b>				MED ASSIST #2
</b>		They've conquered space travel but
		not b.o.

	As Okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly
	grabs his forehead.

<b>				MED ASSIST #1
</b>		You all right?

<b>				OKUN
</b>		Yeah.  It's just that stink gives
		me a headache.

<b>				MED ASSIST #2
</b>		He's moving!

	Instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the
	alien as it moves beneath the sheet.  Unseen by the others the
	alien creature's <u>EYES OPEN</u>.

	Another SHARP PAIN hits Okun who SCREAMS, stumbling backwards
	grabbing his head.  The others turn in surprise.

<b>	THE ALIEN
</b>
	Suddenly SPRINGS up, the restraining straps SNAPPING.  Before
	Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles SMASHES her
	across the face.  She is sent sprawling backwards.

<b>	LOW ANGLE - THE ALIEN
</b>
	Standing before her.  In a wink of an eye, he ATTACKS, leaping
	on her.

	Together they TUMBLE back into a formaldehyde tank.  Hoses
	are ripped from their sides and STEAM pours out.  We get quick
	glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them.

	The group slows as they enter the room.  They see the
	containment room through the glass is covered with white
	steam.  Nothing can be seen.  It's eerily quiet.

	Cautiously they approach.  Suddenly Okun is SLAMMED AGAINST
	the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around
	him.  Pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his
	expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry.

<b>				OKUN/ALIEN
</b>		Release...me.

</b>		Open the door.  Get him out of

	Suspicious, General Grey stops him.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		Wait.
			(to Okun)
		Can you hear me?

<b>				OKUN/ALIEN
</b>		Will kill...release me.  Now!

	They follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling
	of the containment tank.  Suddenly the alien LEAPS DOWN,
	startling them, landing before them behind the glass.

	We see he's holding Okun against the glass, speaking THROUGH
	HIM.  This is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre

	When the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks
	on the hatch door on the alien attacker.  The door swings open
	and David climbs down.

	Grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, David places
	the empty can on top of the alien attacker.  David turns and
	faces the gathering.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Could anyone please step back
		away from the craft?

	They do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft.  The
	Technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him.  A

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Lt. Mitchell, would you mind
		drawing your pistol?

<b>				MITCHELL
</b>		What?

<b>				DAVID
</b>		From where you're standing, do you
		think you could shoot that can off

	Mitchell shrugs affirmatively.  David gestures for him to try.
	Taking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS.

	The bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield.
	Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the
	errant bullet.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Sorry 'bout that.  You see, it's
		protected by the craft's shields.
		We can't penetrate their defenses.

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		We know that already.  What's your

	David walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the
	craft by cables and starts typing furiously.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		My point is if we can't beat their

		them.

	David stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently
	counting down.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Lt. Mitchell, would you please try

	Reluctantly Mitchell obliges.  This time the can is BLOWN OFF

	re-opens the craft's door and the loud HUM disappears.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		How did you do that?

<b>				DAVID
</b>		I gave it a cold.

	The President is fascinated, he steps closer.  Moishe beams
	proudly at his smart son.  Constance is amazed.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		More accurately, I gave it a
		virus.  A computer virus.

	David turns his laptop around for the President to see.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		Are you telling us you can send
		out a signal that will disable all
		their shields?

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Just as they used our satellites
		against us, we can use their own
		signal against them.

	David walks over to a diagram he's made showing the
	relationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the
	smaller alien attackers.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		If we plant the virus directly
		into the mother ship, it would
		then filter down into all the
		corresponding ships below.

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		And just how do we infect the
		"Mother Ship" with a virus?

	David gestures to the alien attacker behind him.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		We'll have to fly their craft out
		of our atmosphere and dock with
		the mother ship.

	Intrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker,
	sizing it up.  David points to a satellite photo of the
	underbelly of the Mother Ship.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		We can enter here, upload the
		virus and set off an explosion
		that could disable it.  This would
		disorient the smaller ship below
		and buy you some time to take them
		out.

	Constance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan.

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		This is ridiculous.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		How long would their shields be
		down?

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Once they discover the virus it
		could be a matter of minutes.

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		You want us to co-ordinate a
		massive world wide counter strike
		with a window of only a few
		minutes?

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		With their shields down it might
		be possible.

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		Please, you're not buying into any
		of this nonsense, are you?  We
		don't have the manpower or the
		resources to launch that kind of a
		campaign.
			(gesturing to the alien
			 ship)
		Not to mention that this whole
		cockamamie plan is dependent on a
		machine that no one in the world
		is qualified to operate.

<b>				STEVE (O.S.)
</b>		I wouldn't say that, sir.

	Everyone turns to Steve who steps through the crowd.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		I've seen them in action.  I've
		watched their maneuvers.  With
		your permission, sir, I'd like the
		opportunity to try.

<b>				NIMZIKI
</b>		That thing's a wreck.  It crash
		landed back in the fifties!  We
		don't even know if it's <u>capable</u> of
		flying.

	David turns to the Technicians.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Remove the clamps!

	Technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of

	For a moment the hulking craft TEETERS unevenly, but quickly

		Only the nuke won't detonate on
		impact.  You'll have another

<b>				DAVID
</b>		I'll see how they're doing with

<b>				STEVE
</b>			(checking his watch)
		Oh shit, we're late.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		We'll meet you there.

	Steve dashes off as David moves toward the attacker.
	Constance has been eavesdropping.  She walks to David.

<b>				CONSTANCE
</b>		Thirty seconds?  Isn't that
		cutting it a little too close?

<b>				DAVID
</b>		We'll be well on our way out of
		there before we shoot that thing
		off.

	David leans under the attacker where a TECHNICIAN is attaching
	another device.

<b>				TECHNICIAN
</b>		It's the strongest SHF transmitter
		we could get.  It'll tell us when
		you've uploaded the virus.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Then cross your fingers the
		shields go down.

	David turns and walks away, Constance following.

<b>				CONSTANCE
</b>		With you?  I don't understand why
		you can't just show someone how to
		plant the virus, somebody trained
		for this kind of mission?

<b>				DAVID
</b>		If anything goes wrong I'll have
		to think quickly, adjust the
		signal, who knows?

	David stops, picking up a small trash can labelled "recycle."

<b>				DAVID
</b>			(smiling)
		You know how I'm always trying to
		save the planet.  This is my
		chance.

	David rushes off.  Constance watches him leave.

<b>				CONSTANCE

		Now he gets ambitious.

	Jasmine is kneeling as Dylan tries to zip up the back of her

<b>				DYLAN
</b>		It's too tight.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		I had to borrow it.  I guess

	Jasmine stands, turns to Dylan.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		How do I look?

	She looks great.  But Dylan only gives her the "so-so" hand
	gesture.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		You're a lot of help.

	The door behind her flies open and Steve marches in.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		You're late.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		You know me...

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		I know, you like to make a big
		entrance.

	Steve moves next to Jasmine, takes her hand.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		Before we do this, I want you to
		know I'm sorry.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		Sorry for what?

<b>				STEVE
</b>			(serious)
		I should have done this a long
		long time ago.

<b>				MALE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		Do you have the ring?

	As we REVERSE ANGLE we see that we are in a military CHAPEL, a
	large crucifix on the wall.  A CHAPLAIN stands by the altar.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		You bet.

	Steve pulls out the famous "dolphin" ring.

<b>				CHAPLAIN
</b>		Witnesses?

	Just then the doors open and David and Constance enter taking
	seats on opposing sides of the aisle.

<b>				CHAPLAIN
</b>		Then let's get this show on the
		road.

	Steve and Jasmine take their places at the altar.  Jasmine is
	radiant.  Dylan rushes up and joins them.

	As the ceremony begins, David and Constance share a pregnant
	glance.  Slowly they reach across the aisle and hold hands as
	Steve and Jasmine exchange their vows.

</b>		Beggars can't be choosers, sir.

	Nodding in agreement, the President walks among the rank and

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		Good morning.  In less than one

		Mankind.  The word has new meaning

	Constance, David and Moishe join the group, listening.  Even
	David is moved.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		Perhaps it's fate that today, July
		the Fourth, we will once again
		fight for our freedom.  Not from
		tyranny, persecution or
		oppression.  But from
		annihilation.  We're fighting for

		as an American holiday but as the
		day that all of mankind declared
		we will not go quietly into the

		a fight.  We will live on.  We
		will survive.

	The crowd erupts into applause and cheers.  The President
	turns and walks over to an Officer holding a bundle of
	clothes.  General Grey confronts the President as he begins to
	disrobe.

<b>				GENERAL GREY
</b>		Mr. President, just what do you

	David looks down at the "barf bags" in Moishe's hand.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Thanks, Pops.

	That means more to David than Moishe could have known.

	Constance hugs David as Steve suddenly freaks out.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		Damn it.  We can't go yet.  I
		gotta find some cigars.

	Steve is about to bolt when Moishe grabs him, retrieving two
	cigars from his coat pocket.

<b>				MOISHE
</b>		My last two.  With my blessings.

	him one of the cigars.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		Hang on to this.  For our victory

	Reluctantly David takes it.  As he does Steve notices the
	"barf bag" on David's lap.  Off Steve's look...

<b>				DAVID
</b>		I have a confession to make.  I'm
		not real big on flying.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		Great.

	Constance and Jasmine join the others behind the observation

	Embarrassed, Steve adjusts the throttle.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		Oops.

	Like a stick shift diagram of a car, a small hand written
	"post it" card is pasted onto the dash.  Steve reaches over
	and turns it upside down, righting the problem.

<b>				STEVE

	This time he pushes the throttle forward and the Attacker
	JERKS ahead.

	David nods sheepishly.  Steve's eyes go wide with wonder as
	the ship climbs to the edge of our atmosphere.

<b>				STEVE
</b>			(to himself)
		I've waited a long time for this.

	The ship begins to SHAKE, rattling harshly as it climbs.
	Through the window we SEE the blue sky EVAPORATE.  Slowly a
	field of STARS take its place.

	This is the moment Steve had wished for all his life.  He's
	not disappointed.  David, however, is not so thrilled.

	In the center of the Landing are large BAY WINDOWS, inside is
	a kind of control tower.  We can SEE several ALIEN WORKERS

	This one goes past the point of the previous explosion.  It

	another.

<b>	ANGLE - ELEVATOR HALLWAY - BACK OF HANGAR

	A Yarmulke is unfolded.  As it is lifted we realize Moishe is

	Taking the advice, the President DIVES.  He's met by two
	flanking Fighters (EAGLES 9 &amp; 2) as they cruise the underbelly
	of the City Destroyer.  Sure enough, the SCHISM is opening,
	preparing to fire the WALL OF DESTRUCTION.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		Let's take 'em out before they
		take us out.

	The President locks the SCHISM hatchway into the center of his
	HUD (heads up display).  Just as he FIRES, Eagle 9 is BLOWN
	OUT OF THE SKY.  It rocks the President, sending his missile
	off target.

	Off balance, the missile hits just wide of the hatchway and
	EXPLODES, rocking the entire ship.

	Russell turns off his radio as he banks UPWARD towards the
	open SCHISM.  The climb is steep, and the bi-wing nearly
	stalls out.

	Suddenly the bright lights VANISH and the beam begins to form.

	Russell's bi-wing just makes it INSIDE THE OPEN SCHISM and
	disappears from view.

	The President and remaining fighters BANK AWAY, clearing.

	Suddenly, A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION, RIPS THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE

</b>		Ready?

<b>	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME
</b>
	Popping up from behind the dash, cigars in their mouths, Steve
	and David start waving "good-bye" like idiots.

	The Aliens in the tower don't know how to react.  The
	attackers move in for the kill.

<b>	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME
</b>
<b>				STEVE
</b>		Think they know what's coming?

	He reaches down to the black box we saw before and enters the
	launch code.

<b>				DAVID
</b>			(still waving)
		Not a chance in hell.

<b>	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME
</b>
	Suddenly the missile ERUPTS from behind the manifold and
	BLASTS into the control tower, SHATTERING THE GLASS WINDOW.

<b>	INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	The missile SMASHES through the glass.  The atmosphere
	impeached, the aliens quickly succumb to the elements, chocking
	and dying.

	The missile BLASTS by WRECKING equipment until it LODGES into
	the back wall of the Landing tower.

	A small counter on the missile begins to count down 30:00,
<b>	29:00, 28:00...
</b>
<b>	EXT. DOCKING CLAMPS - SAME
</b>
	Rocked from the explosions, the docking clamps RELEASES and the
	ships jostles free.

<b>	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME
</b>
	Steve grabs the controls.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		We're loose!

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Doesn't matter.  Game's over.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		I don't hear no fat lady.

	Steve THROTTLES IT.  The craft JOLTS AWAY.

<b>	EXT. DOCKING STATION - SAME
</b>
	Steve and David's attacker BLAST away, the other alien
	attackers follow in hot pursuit.

	The attackers FIRE.  Steve SWERVES avoiding the blasts as they
	race for the exit.

<b>	INT. LANDING - CONTROL TOWER - SAME
</b>
	Grasping for breath, a dying Alien looks up at the wedged in
	nuclear missile.  The counter reads: 00:04, 00:03, 00:02.

	We get the feeling the Alien knows what's coming.

<b>	INT. DOCKING BAY - SAME
</b>
	Steve and David's attacker just reaches the doorway as the
	center of the landing EXPLODES behind them.

	The enormous impact, rocks some of the lagging attackers off
	track.

<b>	EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME
</b>
	Steve DARTS his attacker out from underneath the Mother Ship's
	belly.  A group of attackers FOLLOW.

	Just as the last of them exit the docking bay, a HUGE FIREBALL
	erupts behind them ripping through the Mother Ship.

<b>	ANGLE - FARTHER AWAY
</b>
	ZOOMING towards us, Steve guides his ship away.  The Alien
	attackers in hot pursuit.  Behind them we SEE the ENTIRE
<b>	MOTHER SHIP EXPLODE.
</b>
	The immense EXPLOSION GROWS OUTWARDS coming right at us.  The
	ATTACKERS are GOBBLED UP as the EXPLOSION WIDENS.  Quickly the
	explosion gains ground on Steve and David.

<b>	ANGLE - STEVE AND DAVID'S SHIP
</b>
	Like a loose board caught in the surf, Steve and David's ship
	rides the edge of the explosion, getting knocked END OVER END.

<b>	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER
</b>
	Tumbling ass over tea kettle, David and Steve are ROCKED in
	their seats.  Steve battles to regain control of the ship.

<b>	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S SHIP
</b>
	The mammoth fireball reaches the outer edge of its zenith.
	Steve and David's ship is SPIT OUT, tumbling down towards
<b>	EARTH.
</b>
<b>	EXT. AREA 51 - TARMAC - SAME
</b>
	The fighters are returning home.  Crowd RACE out of the ruins
	of the smoldering compound to greet them, cheering their
	arrival.

<b>	THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE
</b>
	The President is climbing out as General Grey rushes to his
	aid.  Behind him, Jasmine leads Dylan and Patricia, who breaks
	free and RUSHES to her father.  The President sweeps her up in
	his arms as Jasmine approaches.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>			(to General Grey)
		Any word from Steve?

	Behind her, Constance rushes over, the same thing on her mind.
	Before he can answer they HEAR a ROAR above.  They all become
	silent as they turn and look to the skies.

<b>	ANGLE - BLUE SKIES - FIREBALL
</b>
	The FIREBALL COMET is rapidly shooting down towards us.
	Suddenly BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Steve and David's ship
<b>	DARTS DOWN.
</b>
	Just over the heads of the cheering crowds, Steve and David's
	ship ZOOMS overhead, disappearing out of sight.

<b>	EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - MINUTES LATER
</b>
	Several army JEEPS race across the arid desert floor.  As they
	WHIP past we see they are headed towards a gigantic BLACK
	PLUME OF SMOKE in the distance.
<b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE PLUME OF SMOKE
</b>
	The Jeeps SKID to a halt.  Jasmine and Constance are the first
	to leap off the Jeeps.

	Steve and David walk towards us, cigars in their mouths.
	Jasmine races over to him.

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		You scared the hell out of me.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		Yeah, but what an entrance!

<b>				JASMINE
</b>		Dick-weed.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		Butt-munch.

	Constance comes running up to David, hugs him tightly.

<b>				CONSTANCE
</b>		Are you all right?

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Did it work?

<b>				CONSTANCE
</b>		You bet it did.

	She hugs him.  They kiss.

<b>	ANGLE - STEVE AND JASMINE
</b>
	Behind them Dylan, Patricia, the President and General Grey
	come walking over.  The President and General Grey approach.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>		We're getting reports from all
		over.  Their ships are going down!

	As they begin to celebrate, they look up to the sky.

<b>	GROUP POV - BRILLIANT LIGHTS IN THE SKIES
</b>
	The debris from the Mother Ship explosion enters the
	atmosphere like thousands of SHOOTING STARS.  It's an
	incredible sight.

	The group stares happily at the show in the sky.  Steve takes
	Dylan by the hand.

<b>				STEVE
</b>		Didn't I promise you fireworks?

	Everyone stares in wonder at the beautiful lights.
