</b>
               Series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town 
               of Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State. The streets 
               are deserted, and snow is falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over 
               the above scenes we hear voices praying:

<b>                                     GOWER'S VOICE
</b>                         I owe everything to George Bailey. 
                         Help him, dear Father.

</b>                         Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend 
                         Mr. Bailey.

</b>                         He never thinks about himself, God; 
                         that's why he's in trouble.

<b>                                     ERNIE'S VOICE
</b>                         George is a good guy. Give him a 
                         break, God.

<b>                                     MARY'S VOICE
</b>                         I love him, dear Lord. Watch over 
                         him tonight.

<b>                                     JANIE'S VOICE
</b>                         Please, God. Something's the matter 
                         with Daddy.

               CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through 
               the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly 
               toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we 
               hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice 
               is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly:

</b>                         Looks like we'll have to send someone 
                         down  a lot of people are asking 
                         for help for a man named George 
                         Bailey.

                         have to send someone down immediately.

                         It's that clock-maker's turn again.

                         yet, has he? We've passed him up 
                         right along.

<b>                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
</b>                         Because, you know, sir, he's got the 
                         I.Q. of a rabbit.

<b>                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
</b>                         Yes, but he's got the faith of a 
                         child  simple. Joseph, send for 
                         Clarence.

               A small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It 
               twinkles as Clarence speaks:

</b>                         Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth 
                         needs our help.

</b>                         No, worse. He's discouraged. At 
                         exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, 
                         Earth time, that man will be thinking 
                         seriously of throwing away God's 
                         greatest gift.

<b>                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE

                         only got an hour to dress. What are 
                         they wearing now?

<b>                                     FRANKLIN'S VOICE
</b>                         You will spend that hour getting 
                         acquainted with George Bailey.

</b>                         Sir... If I should accomplish this 
                         mission  I mean  might I perhaps 
                         win my wings?  I've been waiting for 
                         over two hundred years now, sir  
                         and people are beginning to talk.

</b>                         Clarence, you do a good job with 
                         George Bailey, and you'll get your 
                         wings.

                         want to know something about him, 
                         don't you?

</b>                         Well, keep your eyes open. See the 
                         town?

               The stars fade out from the screen, and a light, 
               indistinguishable blur is seen.

<b>                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
</b>                         Where? I don't see a thing.

<b>                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
</b>                         Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your 
                         wings yet. Now look, I'll help you 
                         out.  Concentrate. Begin to see 
                         something?

               The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a 
               group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill.

<b>                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
</b>                         Why, yes. This is amazing.

<b>                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
</b>                         If you ever get your wings, you'll 
                         see all by yourself.

<b>                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE

<b>               EXT. FROZEN RIVER AND HILL  DAY  CLOSE SHOT
</b>
               Group of boys. They are preparing to slide down the hill on 
               large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out 
               onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill.

<b>                                     BOY
</b>                              (as he slides)

</b>                         Hey, who's that?

<b>                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
</b>                         That's your problem, George Bailey.

<b>                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
</b>                         A boy?

<b>                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
</b>                         That's him when he was twelve, back 
                         in 1919. Something happens here you'll 
                         have to remember later on.

               Series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the 
               hill and out onto the ice. As each boy comes down the others 
               applaud.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT
</b>
               George Bailey at bottom of slide.

</b>                              (through megaphone)
                         And here comes the scare-baby, my 
                         kid brother, Harry Bailey.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  HARRY
</b>
               On top of hill, preparing to make his slide.

<b>                                     HARRY
</b>                         I'm not scared.

                         Come on, Harry! Attaboy, Harry!

<b>               MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
               Harry makes his slide very fast. He passes the marks made by 
               the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice 
               at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears 
               into the water.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE

<b>                                     GEORGE

<b>               MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
               George jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to 
               pull him out he yells:

<b>                                     GEORGE
</b>                         Make a chain, gang! A chain!

<b>               WIDER ANGLE
</b>
               The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain. 
               When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they 
               pull them both to safety.

<b>                                     JOSEPH'S VOICE
</b>                         George saved his brother's life that 
                         day.  But he caught a bad cold which 
                         infected his left ear. Cost him his 
                         hearing in that ear. It was weeks 
                         before he could return to his after-
                         school job at old man Gower's 
                         drugstore.

<b>               EXT. MAIN STREET  BEDFORD FALLS  SPRING AFTERNOON

</b>
               Five or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm, 
               whistling.  Their attention is drawn to an elaborate 
               horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the 
               street.

                         and meanest man in the county.

               The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore. The 
               drugstore is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored 
               water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop:

</b>
               George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter 
               on the counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish:

<b>                                     GEORGE
</b>                         Wish I had a million dollars.

               He clicks the lighter and the flame springs up.

<b>                                     GEORGE

</b>
               George crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch,

               George pulls the little box out of his pocket. Gower savagely 
               rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy 
               venomously.

                         poison!  I know you feel bad... and...

               George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower 
               looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced 
               on the shelf. He tears open the package, shakes the powder 
               out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then 
               abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to 
               look at George again. The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened. 
               Gower steps toward him.

               But this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and, 
               sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace. George is 
               crying too.

               It is late afternoon. A young man is looking over an

               She is standing talking to one of the boys, Freddie, a glass 
               of punch in her hand. For the first time, she is wearing an 
               evening gown and she has gained assurance from the admiration 
               of the boy with her. She turns around and for the first time 
               she sees George.  For a second she loses her poise, staring 
               at him.

                         Did you know there's a swimming pool 
                         under this floor? And did you know 
                         that button behind you causes this 
                         floor to open up?  And did you further 
                         know that George Bailey is dancing 
                         right over that crack?  And I've got 
                         the key?

               Freddie needs no more. He takes the key from Mickey and turns 
               the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each 
               half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. 
               Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so 
               engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers 
               and elders start to scurry off. As the floor opens, it reveals 
               an attractive, lighted swimming pool.  George and Mary are 
               so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening. 
               Spotlights concentrate on them. They mistake the screams for 
               cheers.

</b>                         Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits 
                         you.  Yes, sir, you look a little 
                         older without your clothes on.

               Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly 
               on:

<b>                                     GEORGE
</b>                         I mean, without a dress. You look 
                         older...  I mean, younger. You look 
                         just...

               In his confusion George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's 
               bath robe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers 
               the robe around her.

<b>                                     GEORGE

               He picks up the belt and throws it over her arm.

               Holding her hand, George moves in closer to Mary.

               Mary turns away from him, singing "Buffalo Gals":

               George looks after her; then picks up a rock from the street.

               It is a weather-beaten, old-fashioned two-storied house that

                         college and see what they know... 
                         and then I'm going to build things. 
                         I'm gonna build air fields.  I'm

               As he talks, Mary has been listening intently. She finally 
               stoops down and picks up a rock, weighting it in her hand.

               Mary looks at him provocatively, then turns and shuffles off 
               down the street, singing as she goes. George hurries after 
               her.

</b>
               There are about twelve directors seated around a long table. 
               They are the substantial citizens of Bedford Falls: Dr. 
               Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate 
               salesman, etc.  Prominently seated among them is Henry F. 
               Potter, his goon beside his wheelchair. Uncle Billy and George 
               are seated among the directors. The Chairman of the Board is 
               Dr. Campbell. They have folders and papers before them, on 
               which they have been reporting.  Before each of the directors 
               there are individual reports for them to study.

                         for, George. I know you're anxious

                         sits around all day on his brains in

                         him a house worth five thousand 
                         dollars. Why?

               George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and

                         money. What does that get us? A

                         a thrifty working class. And all 
                         because a few starry-eyed dreamers

                         fill their heads with a lot of 
                         impossible ideas. Now, I say...

               George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, 
               incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.

                         hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right 
                         when you say my father was no business 
                         man. I know that. Why he ever started 
                         this cheap, penny-ante Building and 
                         Loan, I'll never know. But neither 
                         you nor anybody else can say anything 
                         against his character, because his 
                         whole life was... Why, in the twenty-
                         five years since he and Uncle Billy 
                         started this thing, he never once 
                         thought of himself. Isn't that right, 
                         Uncle Billy?  He didn't save enough 
                         money to send Harry to school, let 
                         alone me. But he did help a few people 
                         get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. 
                         And what's wrong with that? Why...  
                         Here, you're all businessmen here. 
                         Doesn't it make them better citizens? 
                         Doesn't it make them better customers? 
                         You... you said... What'd you say 
                         just a minute ago?... They had to 
                         wait and save their money before 
                         they even ought to think of a decent 
                         home. Wait! Wait for what? Until 
                         their children grow up and leave 
                         them?  Until they're so old and broken-
                         down that they... Do you know how 
                         long it takes a working man to save 
                         five thousand dollars?  Just remember 
                         this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble 
                         you're talking about... they do most 
                         of the working and paying and living 
                         and dying in this community. Well, 
                         is it too much to have them work and 
                         pay and live and die in a couple of 
                         decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my 
                         father didn't think so. People were 
                         human beings to him, but to you, a 
                         warped, frustrated old man, they're 
                         cattle. Well, in my book he died a

                         with this thing. Just one thing more, 
                         though. This town needs this measly 
                         one-horse institution if only to

               George leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy.  
               Potter's face is grim with hatred. The "frustrated old man"

               Cousin Eustace is taking a photograph of the family group 
               assembled on the porch. Flash bulbs go off, and the group 
               breaks up. The crowd enters the front door of the house, 
               leaving George and Uncle Billy on the porch.

                         Oh, maybe I'd better go home.

               He looks around for his hat, which is on his head.

               He staggers out of the scene, and as George turns away, we 
               hear Uncle Billy singing "My Wild Irish Rose." There is a 
               CRASH of cans and bottles, then:

               George is standing at the garden gate. He takes some travel 
               folders from his pocket, looks at them and throws them away. 
               He is obviously disturbed about the latest turn of events. 
               His mother comes out of the house and kisses him.

               She nods toward the house, where Harry and Ruth, among a

               George is walking slowly past the Hatch home. He stares 
               meditatively at the simple dwelling, then he starts walking 
               ahead.  But after a few steps he turns around and starts 
               back. He walks past the house a few yards, turns, and starts 
               back again.

               It is a caricature of George throwing a lasso around the

               waiting around the grill. They are simply-dressed people, to

               him silently, half shamefaced, but grimly determined on their 
               rights. In their hearts there is panic and fear.

</b>                         Better to get half than nothing.

               A few other people start for the door.  CAMERA PANS WITH 
               George as he vaults over the counter quickly, speaking to 
               the people.

</b>                         Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait... now 
                         listen... now listen to me. I beg of 
                         you not to do this thing. If Potter 
                         gets hold of this Building and Loan 
                         there'll never be another decent 
                         house built in this town. He's already 
                         got charge of the bank.  He's got 
                         the bus line. He's got the department 
                         stores. And now he's after us.  Why? 
                         Well, it's very simple. Because we're 
                         cutting in on his business, that's 
                         why.  And because he wants to keep 
                         you living in his slums and paying 
                         the kind of rent he decides.

               The people are still trying to get out, but some of them 
               have stood still, listening to him. George has begun to make 
               an impression on them.

</b>                         Joe, you lived in one of his houses, 
                         didn't you? Well, have you forgotten? 
                         Have you forgotten what he charged 
                         you for that broken-down shack?
                              (to Ed)
                         Here, Ed. You know, you remember 
                         last year when things weren't going 
                         so well, and you couldn't make your 
                         payments. You didn't lose your house, 
                         did you? Do you think Potter would 
                         have let you keep it?
                              (turns to address the

                         Can't you understand what's happening 
                         here? Don't you see what's happening?  
                         Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying!  
                         And why? Because we're panicky and 
                         he's not.  That's why. He's picking 
                         up some bargains.  Now, we can get 
                         through this thing all right. We've 
                         got to stick together, though. We've 
                         got to have faith in each other.

                         dollars.

               George starts rapidly to count out the money. Tom throws his 
               passbook on the counter.

               years.  This is the house that George and Mary will live in

               shines out from bottom windows. George hurries into scene. 
               He stops to make sure it is the right number before going up

               The house is carpetless, empty  the rain and wind cause 
               funny noises upstairs. A huge fire is burning in the 
               fireplace. Near the fireplace a collection of packing boxes 
               are heaped together in the shape of a small table and covered 
               with a checkered oil cloth. It is set for two. A bucket with 
               ice and a champagne bottle sit on the table as well as a 
               bowl of caviar. Two small chickens are impaled on a spit 
               over the fire. A phonograph is playing on a box, and a string 
               from the phonograph is turning the chickens on the spit. The

               over the back of which is a pair of pajamas and a nightie.

               pointing to maps spread out on the desk.

                         George, I'm an old man, and most 
                         people hate me. But I don't like 
                         them either, so that makes it all 
                         even. You know just as well as I do 
                         that I run practically everything in 
                         this town but the Bailey Building 
                         and Loan. You know, also, that for a 
                         number of years I've been trying to 
                         get control of it... or kill it. But 
                         I haven't been able to do it. You 
                         have been stopping me. In fact, you 
                         have beaten me, George, and as anyone 
                         in this county can tell you, that 
                         takes some doing. Take during the 
                         depression, for instance. You and I 
                         were the only ones that kept our 
                         heads. You saved the Building and 
                         Loan, and I saved all the rest.

</b>                         Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, 
                         after supporting your mother, and 
                         paying your bills, you're able to 
                         keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child 
                         or two comes along, and you won't 
                         even be able to save the ten. Now, 
                         if this young man of twenty-eight 
                         was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd 
                         say he was doing fine. But George 
                         Bailey is not a common, ordinary 
                         yokel. He's an intelligent, smart, 
                         ambitious young man  who hates his 
                         job  who hates the Building and 
                         Loan almost as much as I do. A young 
                         man who's been dying to get out on 
                         his own ever since he was born. A 
                         young man... the smartest one of the 
                         crowd, mind you, a young man who has 
                         to sit by and watch his friends go 
                         places, because he's trapped.  Yes, 
                         sir, trapped into frittering his 
                         life away playing nursemaid to a lot 
                         of garlic-eaters.  Do I paint a 
                         correct picture, or do I exaggerate?

                         of success? I'm offering you a three 
                         year contract at twenty thousand 
                         dollars a year, starting today. Is

                         be possible for you to give me twenty-

                         Okay, Mr. Potter.

               As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion. 
               Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him. In that 
               moment of physical contact he knows he could never be 
               associated with this man.  George drops his hand with a 
               shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face.

                         to anybody!  I know right now, and 
                         the answer is no! NO!  Doggone it!

                         were nothing but a scurvy little 
                         spider. You...

               He turns and shouts at the goon, impassive as ever beside 
               Potter's wheelchair.

<b>               INT. BEDROOM  GEORGE AND MARY'S HOUSE  NIGHT
</b>
<b>               CLOSE SHOT  GEORGE ENTERS THE BEDROOM
</b>
               The room is modestly furnished with just a cheap bed, a chair 
               or two, and a dresser. Mary is asleep in the bed. As George 
               comes in, his head is filled with many confusing thoughts, 
               relating to incidents in his past life.

<b>                                     POTTER'S VOICE
</b>                         You wouldn't mind living in the nicest 
                         house in town. Buying your wife a 
                         lot of fine clothes, going to New 
                         York on a business trip a couple of 
                         times a year.  Maybe to Europe once 
                         in a while.

               George takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser 
               and stares at his reflection in the mirror.

<b>                                     GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>                         I know what I'm going to do tomorrow 
                         and the next day and next year and 
                         the year after that. I'm shaking the 
                         dust of this crummy little town off 
                         my feet, and I'm going to see the 
                         world... And I'm going to build 
                         things. I'm going to build air fields.  
                         I'm going to build skyscrapers a 
                         hundred stories high. I'm going to 
                         build a bridge a mile long.

               While the above thoughts are passing through George's head, 
               his attention is caught by a picture on the wall near the 
               dresser:

<b>               INSERT: PICTURE ON THE WALL
</b>
               It is the sketch of George lassoing the moon that we first 
               saw in Mary's living room. The lettering reads: "George Lassos 
               The Moon."

<b>                                     GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>                         What is it you want, Mary? You want 
                         the moon? If you do, just say the 
                         word; I'll throw a lasso around it 
                         and pull it down for you.

               Mary is now awake, and starts singing their theme song:

<b>                                     MARY

                         won't you come out tonight.

               George crosses over and sits on the edge of the bed.

               The front page of the paper, the Bedford Falls Sentinel. The 
               headline reads: "PRESIDENT DECORATES HARRY BAILEY  LOCAL 
               BOY WINS CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR". The subhead tells of 
               a plan for a giant jubilee and parade, to be followed by a 
               banquet, in honor of Commander Harry Bailey, U.S.N. on his 
               way home from Washington after receiving the Congressional 
               Medal of Honor. There's a large picture of President Truman 
               pinning the coveted medal on Harry's bosom, in the midst of 
               dignitaries; a picture of the transport which Harry saved. 
               Practically the whole front page is devoted to the story.

               Potter is being wheeled in by his goon. Various bank officials 
               run over to greet him  he is reading a newspaper. Uncle

               In a cold rage, Potter grabs his paper and wheels off toward

               stands before him like a frisked criminal, all his pockets 
               hanging out, empty. George's eyes and manner are almost

               sobbing at the table, his head in his arms.

               The knob on the banister comes off in his hand, and for a

               The SOUND of Janie at the piano can be heard, the same 
               monotonous rhythm over and over. Zuzu (aged six) is sitting 
               up in her bed, the lamp burning beside her. She is holding 
               her prize flower.  George tiptoes in. Then, as he sees she's 
               awake, he comes over, sitting on the edge of her bed.

</b>                         Wait now. Where do you think you're

                         Daddy the flower. I'll give it a 
                         drink.

               She shakes her head and presses the flower to her. A few 
               petals fall off. She picks them up.

                         this together.

               She hands him the fallen petals and the flower. He turns his 
               back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower. He 
               sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the 
               flower, and then turns back to Zuzu.

               She closes her eyes and relaxes on the bed. George pulls the 
               covers over her. He bends down and his lips touch a tendril 
               of the child's hair. Then he gets up and tiptoes out of the 
               room.

               The room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only SOUND 
               being George's labored breathing. George goes over to a corner 
               of the room where his workshop is set up  a drawing table, 
               several models of modern buildings, bridges, etc. Savagely 
               he kicks over the models, picks up some books and hurls them 
               into the corner.  Mary and the children watch, horrified. 
               George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he 
               were some unknown wild animal.  The three children are crying.

               Mary and the children stare at him, stunned by his furious

               The place is an Italian restaurant with bar. The bottles 
               sparkle.  There are Christmas greens and holly decorating 
               the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini 
               himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. The booths and the 
               checkered-cloth-covered tables are full. There is an air of 
               festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a

               During this, CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to George. Nick, the 
               bartender, is watching him solicitously. Seated on the other 
               side of George is a burly individual, drinking a glass of 
               beer. George is mumbling:

<b>               MEDIUM SHOT  GEORGE, CLARENCE, AND THE TOLLKEEPER

               George is seated before a wood-burning stove before which 
               his clothes are drying on a line. He is in his long winter 
               underwear.  He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at 
               the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the 
               tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved 
               problems.  Clarence is standing on the other side of the 
               stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous 
               seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night 
               shirt  with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at 
               the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees.  The 
               tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them 
               suspiciously. Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but 
               each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or 
               says.  Clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing

                         my last birthday. I passed away in

               The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of 
               it by this remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get George's 
               attention, now picks up a copy of "Tom Sawyer" which is 
               hanging on the line, drying. He shakes the book.

               statement.

                         you'd try to save me. And you see, 
                         you did, and that's how I saved you.

               The tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. George casually 
               looks at the strange smiling little man a second time.

               The tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash. 
               He has been leaning against the wall on it, tipped back on 
               two legs.  Tollkeeper rises and makes his way warily out the 
               door. From his expression he looks like he'll call the nearest 
               cop.

               As Clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outside 
               the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open the 
               door to the shack. Clarence runs to close the door.

               As Clarence speaks, George cocks his head curiously, favoring 
               his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in what 
               Clarence has said.

               straightens up and smells George's breath. He backs away.

               It is Martini's place, but almost unrecognizable. The cheerful 
               Italian feeling is gone. It is now more of a hard-drinking 
               joint, a honky-tonk. Same bar, tables have no covers. People 
               are lower down and tougher. Nick the bartender is behind the 
               bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice the 
               difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming. They go up 
               to the bar.

                         wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light

               As he says this, Nick leans over the counter and puts his

               Nick is listening suspiciously to this conversation.

               A cash register bell rings off stage. Clarence reacts to the 
               SOUND of the bell.

               George and Clarence lying in the snow. George has a strange, 
               puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they 
               landed, looking at each other.

               George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with 
               the neon sign over the door. It now reads "NICK'S PLACE" 
               instead of "MARTINI'S."

               George and Clarence get to their feet.

                         Martini's place.

               He points to the sign, and looks at Clarence. Clarence sort 
               of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested 
               look.

               George, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his 
               arm.  It's flesh.

</b>
               The sign bearing the name of the town reads: "Pottersville." 
               George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street 
               toward the main part of town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH 
               him. The character of the place has completely changed. Where 
               before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become 
               in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS 
               of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and 
               the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority 
               of them. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque 
               house. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, 
               and so on.

               George stops before what used to be the offices of the 
               Building and Loan.  There is a garish electric sign over the 
               entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs." A crowd of people 
               are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and 
               dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw 
               into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops:

               The interior of the house is lit up here and there, ghostlike, 
               by Ernie's spotlight. No furniture, cobwebs, wallpaper hanging 
               and swinging  stairs are broken and collapsed. In a voice

               Bert tries to lead George away by the arm, but George 
               struggles with him, trying to explain.

               Bert raises his gun to hit George on the head. As he does

               George dashes out of the house and down the street, as Bert 
               grapples with Clarence, and they fall to the ground, 
               wrestling. We see Bert kneeling, trying to put handcuffs on

               Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it. We see 
               George watching her from the sidewalk. Mary is very different 
                no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love 
               of life.  Glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close 
               to body. She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self-
               satisfied and efficient.

               covered with snow, and carrying a clothes basket filled with

               table stands in front of George. George picks up Zuzu to 
               protect her from the mob. Uncle Billy dumps the basketful of

               The rest of the crowd all greet George with greetings and 
               smiles.  Each one comes forward with money. In their pockets, 
               in shoe boxes, in coffee pots. Money pours onto the table  
               pennies, dimes, quarters, dollar bills  small money, but 
               lots of it. Mrs. Bailey and Mrs. Hatch push toward George. 
               More people come in. The place becomes a bedlam. Shouts of 
               "Gangway  gangway" as a new bunch comes in and pours out 
               its money. Mary stands next to George, watching him. George 
               stands there overcome and speechless as he holds Zuzu. As he 
               sees the familiar faces, he gives them sick grins.  Tears 
               course down his face. His lips frame their names as he greets 
               them.

                         ask any questions  just said: "If

               accompanied by Bert, the cop.

                         Mary  looks like I got here too 
                         late.

                         as quickly as I could. The fool flew 
                         all the way up here in a blizzard.

               Mrs. Bailey enters scene.

                         York?

                         as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

               Ernie hands Harry a glass of wine.

                         big brother, George. The richest man 
                         in town!

               Once more the crowd breaks into cheering and applause. Janie 
               at the piano and Bert on his accordion start playing "Auld 
               Lang syne," and everyone joins in.

               George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the 
               pile of money on the table. His eye catches something on top 
               of the pile, and he reaches down for it. It is Clarence's 
               copy of "Tom Sawyer." George opens it and finds an inscription 
               written in it: "Dear George, remember no man is a failure 
               who has friends. Thanks for the wings, Love Clarence."

                         What's that?

                         very dear friend of mine.

               At this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of 
               the people on the other side of the tree, a little silver 
               bell on the Christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery 
               tinkle. Zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points to the 
               bell.

                         wings.

                         That's right, that's right.

               He looks up toward the ceiling and winks.
