<b>                                            SHOOTING SCRIPT
</b><b>  FADE IN:
</b>
<b>  DAWN. CRASHING SURF.
</b>
  The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there.

  A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE
  BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat
  a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded
  Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He
<b>  COLLAPSES.
</b>
  The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A
  JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the
  beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a
  cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.

<b>  INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER
</b>
  The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY
  JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.

<b>                     ATTENDANT
</b>               (in Japanese)
           He was delirious. But he asked for
           you by name. And...
               (to the Security Guard)
           Show him.

<b>                     SECURITY GUARD
</b>               (in Japanese)
           He was carrying nothing but this...

  He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.

<b>                     SECURITY GUARD
</b>           ...and this.

  The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the
  gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.

<b>                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
</b>               (in Japanese)
           Bring him here. And some food.

<b>  INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
  The Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food.
  He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.

<b>                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
</b>               (in English)
           Are you here to kill me?

  The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.
<b>                                                          2.
</b>
  The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and
  forefinger.

<b>                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
</b>          I know what this is.

  He SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the
  polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.

<b>                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
</b>          I've seen one before. Many, many
          years ago...

  The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized.

<b>                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
</b>          It belonged to a man I met in a
          half-remembered dream...

  MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP...

<b>                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
</b>          A man possessed of some radical
          notions...

The Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering...

<b>                    COBB (V.O.)
</b>          What's the most resilient parasite?

<b>                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)
</b>
The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young
Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          A bacteria? A virus?

Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-

<b>                    COBB
</b>          An intestinal worm?

Saito's fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at
the table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch-

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-

<b>                     COBB
</b>          An idea.

Saito looks at Cobb, curious.
<b>                                                3.
</b>
<b>                    COBB
</b>          Resilient, highly contagious. Once
          an idea's taken hold in the brain
          it's almost impossible to
          eradicate. A person can cover it
          up, ignore it- but it stays there.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          But surely-to forget...?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Information, yes. But an idea?
          Fully formed, understood? That
          sticks...
              (taps forehead)
          In there, somewhere.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          For someone like you to steal?

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          Yes. In the dream state, conscious
          defenses are lowered and your
          thoughts become vulnerable to
          theft. It's called extraction.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          But, Mr. Saito, we can train your
          subconscious to defend itself from
          even the most skilled extractor.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          How can you do that?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Because I am the most skilled
          extractor. I know how to search
          your mind and find your secrets. I
          know the tricks, and I can teach
          them to your subconscious so that
          even when you're asleep, your guard
          is never down.

Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito's gaze.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          But if I'm going to help you, you
          have to be completely open to me.
          I'll need to know my way around
          your thoughts better than your
          wife, your analyst, anyone.
              (gestures around)
          If this is a dream and you've got a
          safe full of secrets, I need to
          know what's in that safe. For this
          to work, you have to let me in.
<b>                                                            4.
</b>
Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD
opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I
          consider your proposal.

They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-

<b>                      ARTHUR
</b>          He knows.

Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their
glasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS
<b>FROZEN.
</b>
<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          What's going on up there?

And we-

<b>                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)
</b>
Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING
BATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs
level with the rim of the tub.

A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A
distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the
window, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD
CITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.

Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds
TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch-
<b>THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.
</b>
Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's
feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the
briefcase to Arthur's wrist.

Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where
they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of
the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to
his wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-

<b>                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)
</b>
Nash, ASLEEP. Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the train
<b>BUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK.
</b><b>                                                           5.
</b>
A Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously. He
checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE
<b>OTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.
</b>
Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME.
Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY
WHUMP- Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping face-

NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-

<b>                                                     CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Another EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we-

<b>                                                     CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT
</b>
A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur
steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and
pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other
GUESTS wander the massive terraces.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          Saito knows. He's playing with us.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          I can get it here. The
          information's in the safe- he
          looked right at it when I mentioned
          secrets.

Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          What's she doing here, Cobb?

Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed,
staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          You just get to your room. I'll
          take care of the rest.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          See that you do. We're here to
          work.

Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb.
Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-

<b>                    MAL
</b>          If I jumped, would I survive?
<b>                                                           6.
</b>
<b>                    COBB
</b>          With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,
          why are you here?

She turns to look at him. Amused.

<b>                    MAL
</b>          I thought you might be missing
          me...

She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          I am. But I can't trust you
          anymore.

She stares up at him, inviting.

<b>                       MAL
</b>          So what?

<b>INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis
Bacon.

<b>                    MAL
</b>          Looks like Arthur's taste.

Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS
patrolling the castle at ground level.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to
          postwar British painters.

He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Would you sit down?

Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair.
Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels
at Mal's feet. She looks down at him.

<b>                       MAL
</b>          Tell me...

Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.

<b>                    MAL
</b>          Do the children miss me?

Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's
ankle. He looks up at her.
<b>                                                            7.
</b>
<b>                    COBB
</b>          You can't imagine.

Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting
out the rope as he moves back to the window.

<b>                    MAL
</b>          What're you doing?

Cobb tosses the rope out-

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Getting some air.

He tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with
Mal on it, holds.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Stay seated. Please.

And with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window.

<b>EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Cobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at
a particular one. Gets out a glass cutter-

Suddenly he starts DROPPING-

<b>INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the
window-

<b>EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Cobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom
window. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back.

<b>INT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Cobb drops silently from the window into the darkened
kitchen. He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER
onto the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.

<b>INT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUS
</b>
Cobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at
the head of a GRAND STAIRCASE...

The Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows...

Cobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING-
<b>                                                          8.
</b>
PHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is
already there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering
the Guard SILENTLY to the floor.

<b>INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Cobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it
from the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls
it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his
waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE.

LIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes.

<b>                    SAITO (O.S.)
</b>          Turn around.

Cobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is
Mal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb.

<b>                    MAL
</b>          The gun, Dom.

Cobb doesn't move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag
Arthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head.

<b>                    MAL
</b>          Please.

Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then
SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY
down the length or the table.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the
envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands
raised.

<b>                     COBB
</b>          Did she tell you, or have you known
          all along?

<b>                     SAITO
</b>          That you're here to steal from me?
              (beat)
          Or that we're actually asleep?

Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          I want to know who your employer
          is.

Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple.
<b>                                                           9.
</b>
<b>                    COBB
</b>          No point threatening him in a
          dream.

<b>                    MAL
</b>          That depends on what you're
          threatening. Killing him would just
          wake him up... but pain? Pain is in
          the mind...

Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur
drops, SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold.

<b>                    MAL
</b>          And, judging by the decor, we're in
          your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

Cobb watches Arthur's PAIN. Mal aims at Arthur's other leg...

Cobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished
surface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYES-

Arthur DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE
EARTHQUAKE- Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur's eyes stare at
the ceiling, DEAD, and we-

<b>                                                  CUT TO:

<b>INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
Arthur's EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at
the tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free-

<b>                    NASH
</b>          What're you doing?! It's too soon-

FLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the
SILVER CASE on the bathroom floor.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          I know! We have to reconnect the
          loop before they wake up!

Arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the
bedroom- following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist-
SAITO LIES ON THE BED ASLEEP. Saito STIRS and we-

<b>                                                  CUT TO:

<b>INT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
Cobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the
building BUCKS and HEAVES-
<b>                                                           10.

<b>INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Saito and the Guards PANIC. Mal walks calmly through the
destruction, picks up the envelope and turns to Saito.

<b>                    MAL
</b>          He was close. Very close.

<b>EXT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Cobb runs up the stairs, pulling out the SECOND ENVELOPE-

<b>INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Saito RIPS open the envelope, pulls out sheets of paper. He
looks at Mal, PANICKED. He turns to the Guards-

<b>                      SAITO
</b>          Stop him!

Mal, confused, looks at the sheets of paper: THEY ARE BLANK.
Mal smiles, amused.

<b>INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
As Cobb runs up the stairs he reads the TYPEWRITTEN SHEETS
from his envelope, and we-

<b>                                                     CUT TO:

<b>INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
Arthur OPENS the silver case: a COMPLEX MECHANISM of TUBES,
SYRINGES, DOSAGE CONTROLLERS. Arthur's hands fly across the
machine's controls as he glances at Saito's STIRRING face-

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          I'm not going to make it! Wake
          Cobb!

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Buenos Aires. I can lie low there.
          Maybe sniff out a job when things

Arthur looks at Cobb. Nods. Sympathetic.

<b>EXT. ROOFTOP HELIPAD - NIGHT

The HELICOPTER sits, ROTORS SPINNING. As Cobb and Arthur
reach the door, it SLIDES OPEN. Cobb steps up into the
leather-padded interior. He freezes.

Nash, BEATEN BLOODY, sits on the far side, slumped against
the wine. Beside him: SAITO. He nods politely at Cobb.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          He sold you out. Thought to come to
          me and bargain for his life...

Saito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          So I offer you the satisfaction.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          That's not how I deal with things.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          Would you work with him again?

Cobb shakes his head. Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the
chopper. Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit. The chopper
RISES. Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          What will you do to him?

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          Nothing. But I can't speak for your

Saito looks out at the city slipping by.

<b>                    COBB

Arthur raises his eyebrows. Cobb is poker-faced.

</b>          The subject's mind can always trace
          the genesis of the idea. True
          inspiration is impossible to fake.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          No, it isn't.

<b>                    SAITO

</b>          I won't do it.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          In exchange, I'll give you the
          information you were paid to steal.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Are you giving me a choice? Because

Saito indicates the plane.

          How would you like to go home? To

Cobb turns back to Saito.

</b>          You can't fix that. Nobody could.

<b>                    SAITO

Cobb considers this. Arthur touches his arm.

</b>          Simple enough.

Cobb looks at Saito. Barely nods.

Arthur is taken aback. Cobb turns to the window.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          Did it work?

          Yes.

Cobb looks at Arthur. Closed. Arthur shrugs.

Cobb, carrying a shopping bag, looks into a lecture hall: no
students, just a RUMPLED PROFESSOR hunched over paperwork.

<b>                    MILES
</b>          No space to think in that broom

Miles looks at Cobb.

<b>                    MILES

Cobb shifts slightly.

          a whole new way of creating and

drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings.

Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the pen,
starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods.

<b>EXT. NARROW STREET, PARIS - DAY

Arthur stops at a warehouse door. Consults a piece of paper.

<b>INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
</b>
A large, dusty warehouse. The SLIDING DOOR cracks open.
Arthur enters. Looks around, approvingly.

<b>INT. SAME - LATER
</b>
Arthur DRAGS LAWN CHAIRS into the middle of the room. He
erects a table. Lays out several SILVER CASES, unpacking
them, laying out lines of tubing, MECHANISMS...

<b>EXT. PARISIAN CAFE - DAY
</b>
Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          They say we only use a fraction of
          the true potential of our brains...
          but they're talking about when
          we're awake. While we dream, the
          mind performs wonders.

<b>                     ARIADNE
</b>          Such as?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          How do you imagine a building? You
          consciously create each aspect,
          puzzling over it in stages... But
          sometimes, when your imagination
          flies-

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          I'm discovering it.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Exactly. Genuine inspiration.

Cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          In a dream your mind continuously
          does that...

Cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows.
<b>                                                     31.
</b>
<b>                    COBB
</b>          It creates and perceives a world
          simultaneously. So well that you
          don't feel your brain doing the
          creating. That's why we can short-
          circuit the process...

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          How?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          By taking over the creating part.

Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          This is where you come in. You
          build the world of the dream. We
          take the subject into that dream,
          and let him £111 it with his
          subconscious

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          But are you trying to fool him that
          the dream is actually real life?

<b>                     COBB
</b>              (nods)
          While we're in there, We don't want
          him to realize he's dreaming.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          How could I ever get enough detail
          to Convince him that it's real?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Our dreams reel real while we're in
          them. It's only when we wake up we
          realize things were strange,

Ariadne gestures around them-

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          But all the textures of real life-
          the stone, the fabric. cars...
          people... your mind can't create
          all this.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          It does. Every time you dream. Let
          me ask you a question: You never
          remember the beginning of your
          dreams, do you? You just turn up in
          the middle of what's going on.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          How did we get here? Where are we?

Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember. A FAINT RUMBLE begins.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          Oh my God. We're dreaming.

Cobb nods. The RUMBLE is BUILDING.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Stay calm. We're actually asleep in
          the workshop. This is your first
          lesson in shared dreaming,

Ariadne looks around, mind REELING. Cobb BRACES-

The restaurant VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTS, EXPLODING AND IMPLODING
PARTICLES OF FURNITURE, WALLS, PEOPLE FLYING AROUND- Ariadne
WONDERS at the MAYHEM WHIRLING around them- Cobb SHIELDS his

Ariadne turns to Cobb's voice. They are both sitting in the
lawn chairs. Arthur watches over them.

<b>EXT. SAME PARISIAN STREET - DAY
</b>
Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb. Cobb looks
around at the street, the cafe, approving.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          It's good. You've got the cafe, the
          layout... you forgot the book shop
          but pretty much everything else is
          here.

Ariadne looks at the passers-by.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          Who are the people?
<b>                                                        34.
</b>
<b>                    COBB
</b>          They're projections of my
          subconscious.

<b>                     ARIADNE
</b>          Yours?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the
          subject. My subconscious populates
          your world. That's one way we get
          at a subject's thoughts-his mind
          creates the people, so we can
          literally talk to his subconscious.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          How else do you do it?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Architecture. Build a bank vault or
          a jail, something secure, and the
          subject's mind will fill it with
          information he's trying to protect.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          Then you break in and steal it.

<b>                     COBB
</b>          Exactly.

Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.

<b>                     ARIADNE
</b>          I love the concrete sense of things-
              (stamps foot)
          Real weight, you know? I thought a
          dream space would be all about the
          visual, but it's the feel of
          things. Question is, what happens
          as you start to mess with
          physics...

She CONCENTRATES on the street. The street starts to BEND IN
HALF- the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they form
the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING
INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE. Ariadne looks up (or down) at
the people on the opposite city surface. Cobb watches her
excitement.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          It's something, isn't it?

<b>                    COBB
</b>              (quiet)
          Yes. It is.
<b>                                                        35.
</b>
As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the
projections STARING at her.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          Why are they looking at me?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Because you're changing things. My
          subconscious feels that someone
          else is creating the world. The
          more you change things, the quicker
          the projections converge on you.

<b>                      ARIADNE
</b>          Converge?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          They feel the foreign nature of the
          dreamer, and attack-like white
          blood cells fighting an infection.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          They're going to attack us?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Just you, actually.

They walk along the street to where it joins the next
gravitational plane. They step up onto the different plane
and walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadne
approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads
Cobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pillars
emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty.
They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          It's beautiful... but if you keep
          on changing things...

People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne. Several of them
BUMP her shoulder as they pass.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          Mind telling your subconscious to
          take it easy?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          That's why it's called subconscious.
          I don't control it.

The bridge now spans the Seine. Cobb marvels at it.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Arched stone, iron pillars...
          it's...

</b>
Cobb pauses, thinking. Remembering.

INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling,
laughing. He smiles back. They are on the same bridge.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          I know this bridge. This place is
          real-

          remembered it...

</b>              (nods)
          I cross it every day on my way to
          the college.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Never recreate places from your
          memory. Always imagine new places.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          You have to draw from what you know-

          Use pieces-a streetlamp,

          whole areas.

Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude...

<b>                     ARIADNE
</b>          Why not?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Because building dreams out of your
          own memories is the surest way to

Cobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Ariadne.
PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile.

</b>          Look, this isn't about me-

Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him-

A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder-

More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her

Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd

even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy.

Ariadne thinks this over.

</b>          That's not an issue for me.

</b>          Arthur, maybe you can't see what's
          going on, maybe you don't want to.
          But Cobb's got problems he's tried
          to bury down there. I'm not going
          to open my mind to someone like

Ariadne gets to her feet. Walks away.

Crowded, bustling, smoke-filled. a westerner (40's), shabby

FIDDLES with his last two chips.

Eames looks up to see Cobb.

Eames loses.

Cobb follows Eames. Eames mysteriously produces two stacks of
chips and puts them down in front of the cashier. Cobb pulls
one off the top, squints at the embossed name.

<b>          EAMES
</b>See, right there you've got various

forth. But all that stuff's at the

              (Cobb reacts)
          Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in

The Businessman looks up, awkward.

Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING HARD into
the midst of the crowd on the street below.

<b>                    EAMES

          Oh. No, it isn't.

<b>EXT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

moves, trying to blend- TURNS- a SECOND BUSINESS MAN is
there.

Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him-

The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake,
DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight
passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals...

He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables...
the First Businessman enters, spots him. An AFRICAN MAN gets
in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers
his options... the First Businessman DRAWS A GUN- Cobb bolts,
steps up on a table and out an open window, SCRAMBLING into
the alley outside...

Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED
alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END. Faces in the CROWD
start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks
back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS
<b>DRAWN-
</b>
Cobb sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow end-
he THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY...

The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to
SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as
his pursuers gain YARDS... the Crowd is upon him... he BURSTS
FREE. TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight.

Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square. TWO MORE
BUSINESSMEN move towards him. Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS UP,
BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

<b>                    COBB

<b>EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Eames stands on the pavement. The car pulls up. Cobb beckons
from the rear window. Eames looks at Saito. Back to Cobb.

<b>                    EAMES

Arthur sits at the table, working on a mechanism. A small
COUGH prompts him to look up: Ariadne is there.

<b>                    ARTHUR

Arthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass
and steel ATRIUM in an office complex.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          You're going to have to master a
          few tricks if you're going to build
          three complete dream levels.

A SECRETARY DROPS some papers as they pass...

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          What sort of tricks?

They take a tight turn and continue down the next flight.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          In a dream, you can cheat

</b><b>                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)
</b>          That lets you create closed loops,
          like the Penrose Steps. The
          infinite staircase.

Ariadne FREEZES- THEY ARE IN THE EXACT SPOT THEY STARTED
DESCENDING FROM, next to the Secretary gathering her papers.

Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          See...

Arthur stops her gently- they are on the highest step, with a
LARGE DROP to the next step. Arthur gestures at the drop.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          Paradox. A closed loop like this

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          How big do the levels have to be?

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          Anything from the floor of a
          building, to an entire city. But it
          has to be complicated enough for us
          to hide from the projections.

<b>                    ARIADNE

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          The longer we have before the

<b>EXT. DECREPIT BUILDING, MOMBASA - LATER

Eames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a doorway.

<b>INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Peeling paint, buzzing flies. They ascend to a dusty,
wire-reinforced glass door which Eames pushes open-



<b>INT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty
glass bottles of all shapes and colors. At the far end, a
portly 40-year-old man rises from behind his desk, beckoning.
This is YUSUF.

<b>                    YUSUF
</b>          Come, come.

Eames shakes Yusuf's hand. Yusuf stops at Cobb.

<b>                    YUSUF
</b>          Ah, yes. Mr. Cobb. I've heard so
          very much about you.

Yusuf chases a CAT off Saito's chair.

<b>                    YUSUF
</b>          Bloody cats.

Yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass
bottles. None of them has a label.

<b>                    YUSUF

</b>          You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf.

Yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb.

          Yusuf's Somnacin.

Yusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's nose.

</b>          As good as the real thing?

Yusuf WHIPS the bottle away from Cobb, offended.

</b>          Better.

Yusuf holds the bottle to the light, marveling.

Cobb looks at him, uneasy. Yusuf pulls out another bottle.

<b>                    YUSUF
</b>          Of course. I use it every day.

Yusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid
inside.

<b>                      COBB
</b>          For what?

Yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL

</b>          Perhaps... you will not want to

The sleeper does not even stir.

Cobb SPLASHES water on his face, breathing hard- INSERT CUT:

tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink, but it
FALLS to the floor and rolls towards the door- Saito is
there. WATCHING Cobb. He looks down at the spinning top.

Close on a small BRASS CHESS PIECE. Ariadne tips it over.
Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on
the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base. Tests
the TIPPING POINT again. A NOISE makes her look up.

unpacking one of the MECHANISMS. Cobb.

Ariadne indicates three large ARCHITECTURAL MODELS.

          there-

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Don't tell me. Remember, you only

          layout.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          Why's that so important?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          In case one of us brings in part of
          our subconscious. You wouldn't want
          any projections knowing the layout.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          In case you bring Mal in.

Cobb says nothing.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          You won't build yourself because if
          you know the maze, then she knows
          it. And she'd sabotage the

Cobb says nothing.

Ariadne, Arthur, Yusuf, Eames and Saito sit around the room,

</b>          The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to
          the Australian energy conglomerate,

</b>
<b>                    COBB
</b>          An idea Robert Fischer's conscious
          mind would never accept. We have to
          plant it deep in his subconscious.

<b>                      ARTHUR
</b>          How deep?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Three levels down.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          A dream within a dream within a
          dream? Is that even possible?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Yes. It is.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Now, the subconscious motivates
          through emotion, not reason, so we
          have to translate the idea into an
          emotional concept.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          How do you translate a business
          strategy into an emotion?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          That's what we have to figure out.
          Robert and his father have a tense
          relationship. Worse, even, than the
          gossip columns have suggested...

<b>                    EAMES
</b>          Do you play on that? Suggest
          breaking up his father's company as
          a 'screw you' to the old man?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          No. Positive emotion trumps
          negative emotion every time. We
          yearn for people to be reconciled,
          for catharsis. We need positive
          emotional logic.

Eames thinks. Paces. Looking back at the board.

<b>                    EAMES
</b>          Try this... "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT
<b>          I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT
</b><b>          FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."
</b>
<b>                    COBB
</b>          That might work.

<b>                    ARTHUR

<b>                    EAMES
</b>          Thanks for the contribution,

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>          Forgive me for wanting a little
          specificity, Eames.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Inception's not about specificity.
          When we get inside his head, we're

looking through a doorway into another room...

RISES. Through the GRILL Ariadne can see a BEACH stretching
off into the distance. The elevator stops. Mal sits on the
sand. Beside her, the two children are crouched, away from

</b>          No. These are moments I regret.
          Moments I turned into dreams so I

Ariadne's fingers move across the buttons- stop at the "B."

<b>                    ARIADNE

          to understand about me...

<b>INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne follows Cobb into the kitchen. A THIN MAN is there,
standing by the table. He holds a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          This is your house?

The Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper. A CHILD'S SHOUT-
Cobb TURNS. Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden. A small
blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to
look at something on the ground.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          It's James. My boy. He's found
          something. Maybe a worm.

A slightly older girl RUNS into view.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          And there's Philippa.

She crouches beside the boy. Their FACES ARE AWAY FROM US.
They point and discuss whatever is on the ground.

The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.

<b>                    THIN MAN

Cobb nods, turns from the window-

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Then I panic that I'll always wish
          I'd seen them turn, that I can't
          waste this chance...

Cobb TURNS BACK to call out- but the children RACE OFF...

<b>                    COBB
</b>          But the moment's passed. And
          whatever I do, the dream's always
          the same... When I'm about to

Cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, FACES UNSEEN.

Ariadne hits the BASEMENT button. The elevator starts to

slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wall of
freight train... The elevator STOPS. Through the grill
Ariadne sees a HOTEL SUITE. She pulls open the grill, steps
cautiously out into-

Mal glides around Ariadne, looking her over.

Ariadne watches Cobb sleeping. His eyes gradually flicker
open. He sees her watching him.

The LIGHTS COME ON: Saito and Arthur stand in the doorway.

Cobb gets up. Ariadne comes over to him.

Cobb looks at Ariadne. Turns to Saito.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          We need one more seat on the plane.

<b>INT. DEPARTURE GATE, SYDNEY - DAY

Saito stands looking out the window at a 747. Cobb arrives
beside him. They watch a COFFIN being loaded.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          If I get on this plane and you

<b>INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The luxurious cabin has only ten seats. Cobb finds his- sees
Ariadne in the seat behind his. They do not acknowledge each
other. Behind her is Arthur, looking out the window. Eames
enters, STUFFS his bag into the overhead bin, BLOCKING the
passenger behind: ROBERT FISCHER, standing there, patient,
bag in hand, wearing black.

<b>                       EAMES
</b>          Oh, sorry.

Eames SQUEEZES up against his seat to let Fischer BRUSH PAST.
Fischer moves to his seat, directly in front of Cobb. Eames
TOSSES Cobb a PASSPORT. Cobb flips it open: Fischer's.
Pockets it. Yusuf and Saito enter, take their seats.

<b>EXT. RUNWAY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
The 747 HURTLES down the runway.

<b>INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Cobb looks down at his hand: a TINY VIAL taped to the center
of his palm. He removes the cap. The seatbelt sign goes dark.
Cobb unbuckles, stands.

<b>                       COBB
</b>          Excuse me?

Fischer looks up.

<b>                       FISCHER
</b>          Yes?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          I think this is yours...

Cobb holds up the open passport, comparing the picture to
Fischer. Fischer's hand goes to his pocket. Cobb hands
Fischer the passport.

<b>                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>          Would you gentlemen care for a
          drink?

</b>          Water.

<b>                       COBB
</b>          Same.

Fischer gives Cobb a thin smile. Holds up his passport.

<b>                    FISCHER
</b>          Well, thank you.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          No problem. Look, I couldn't help
          noticing your name. You're not
          related to Maurice Fischer?

Fischer takes a beat. But Cobb seems harmless.

<b>                    FISCHER
</b>          Actually, he was my father.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          I'm very sorry for your loss. He

The Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Thanks.

As he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand ... a CLEAR
LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          To Maurice Fischer.
              (they drink)

Fischer grants him a smile.

<b>EXT. 747 - LATER

The great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape.

<b>INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall
onto Fischer's head- Fischer doesn't flinch. ASLEEP. Cobb
SIGNALS the others. The First Flight Attendant unlocks a
CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain.
Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHANISM CASE.

Cobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed
them around the window side of each of the seats. Arthur
rolls up Fischer's cuff- PUSHES the needle cap into Fischer's
wrist. Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes
behind the armrest of Fischer's seat.

Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne. Cobb puts the case on
Yusuf's lap. Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the syringes.
The others recline their seats. Yusuf HITS A BUTTON- closes
the case- places it at his feet. He settles back, and we-

several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Brace yourselves.

Cobb hits the gas- REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH. The
CABDRIVER gets out, fuming. Heads to Cobb's window-

</b>          Hey, asshole! Why don't you try
          driving without your thumb up-

He sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly.

<b>                       COBB

The Cabdriver backs off. Arthur climbs into the cab. Both
cars pull away.

<b>INT./EXT. CAB ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Arthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the
pedes pedestrians. He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign.
Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing
rain from his shoulders.

Saito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun.

<b>                       FISCHER

Arthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it
at Eames.

<b>                    FISCHER

          the wallet's worth more than that.

Eames smiles at this.

A SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY MEN

</b>We were blocked by a freight train.

Why would you put a train crossing

</b>I didn't.

Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?!
Those weren't regular projections-
they'd been trained!

<b>          ARIADNE
</b>How could they be trained?

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>Fischer's had an extractor teach
his mind to defend itself. His

should've shown on the research-

</b>So why the hell didn't it?!

</b>Calm down.

</b>Don't tell me to calm down-you were
meant to check Fischer's background
thoroughly. You can't make this

</b>Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security

He's dying!

Saito.

Eames looks at Yusuf, then to Cobb.

Eames moves to Cobb. Looks him in the eye.

Cobb says nothing. Saito groans more loudly.

Arthur turns to Cobb.

Arthur turns to Cobb.

Cobb grabs Arthur.

          Fischer's security is surrounding
          this place as we speak. The ten
          hours of the flight is a week at
          this level-you'll never make it
          without getting killed. Downwards
          is the only way forwards. We have

Saito groans. Cobb looks at him-

Yusuf holds up a SNAPSHOT: the photo from Maurice Fischer's

enters. Eames hands him the snapshot.

Cobb studies the snapshot. Eames examines himself in the
hinged mirror from multiple angles: ONE BY ONE the myriad
Eames reflections BECOME BROWNINGS. Cobb pockets the photo.

Eames turns from the mirror AS BROWNING. He glances at his

Cobb pushes Browning (Eames), bloody and bruised, into the

Browning's wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink.

          that's when I blow the floor out
          from underneath us and we get a
          nice synchronized kick. Too soon,

waiting in the corridor.

Fischer starts looking at room numbers. Stops at 528. Cobb
draws his gun, steps back from the door and KICKS it open.

Cobb JUMPS into the room, gun up. The room is empty. Arthur
and Ariadne search the room. Saito and Eames arrive. Eames
shuts the door. Arthur FINDS something-

Arthur holds up a MECHANISM CASE. Cobb shows it to Fischer.

Fischer's eyes roam over the dials and plungers.

Arthur is at the door. Someone is there. A key goes into the
lock- the door starts to open- Arthur REACHES OVER and GRABS
the person entering, THROWS THEM TO THE FLOOR- puts his gun
in their face. IT IS BROWNING.

Fischer stares, disbelieving, at his own godfather.

Cobb pulls the key from Browning's hand: ROOM 528.

Fischer shakes his head. Looks at Browning. Thinking.

</b>          The kidnappers are working for you.

<b>                    BROWNING

<b>                    FISCHER
</b>          You're trying to get that safe

Browning looks up at Fischer.

<b>                    BROWNING
</b>          Fischer Morrow's been my entire
          life. I can't let you destroy it.

<b>                    FISCHER
</b>          I'm not going to throw away my
          inheritance. Why would I?

<b>                    BROWNING
</b>          I couldn't take the chance of you

</b>          That will. I'm sorry, Robert, but
          it's his final insult. A challenge
          to build something for yourself.
          He's telling you that you aren't
          worthy of his achievements.

Fischer takes this in. Devastated.

Fischer turns to Cobb.

<b>                     COBB
</b>          It's what I do. He's hiding

Cobb looks at Browning.

</b>          Let's find out what.

Cobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mechanism.
Browning watches. Silent.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Let's do to him what he was going
          to do to you.

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Nods at Fischer to do the same.

</b>          We'll penetrate his subconscious
          and find out what he doesn't want

Fischer looks Cobb in the eye. Decides- rolls up his sleeve,
offering his bare arm. The team run tubes to each other-
Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps.

<b>                      ARTHUR
</b>          He's out.

<b>                    ARIADNE

          subconscious are we going into?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Fischer's. I told him it was
          Browning's so he'd come with us as
          part of our team.

<b>                    ARTHUR
</b>              (impressed)

<b>                    COBB
</b>          That's the idea. He'll think that
          his security is Browning's and
          fight them to learn the truth about
          his father.

Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism. The team goes out one
by one. Cobb is last.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Fischer's subconscious is going to

Cobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains,
BILLOWING like those in Mal's suite- a GLIMPSE of someone
(Mal?) As the screen goes WHITE, and we are-

Ariadne is beside him. They stand on a cliff, dressed in
white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like WWII
commandos. Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their
objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a mile below.

<b>                    ARIADNE

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          I meant what's down there for you?

Cobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING
down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer's
earshot.

<b>                    COBB

<b>                    COBB
</b>          If I know the route... we could be
          compromised.

Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over.

<b>                    ARIADNE
</b>          I designed the place.

<b>                    COBB

<b>                    SAITO (O.S.)

They turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames smiles.

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Eames, brief Saito on the route
          into the complex. What we're
          looking for is going to be in the
          most heavily fortified section.
          That north tower.

Cobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames sees BLOOD
on the snow. Looks at Saito.

over the bodies of Fischer and Mal.

Eames listens for a pulse. Looks up at Cobb.

Eames looks at her, then to Cobb.

Eames pulls the mechanism from his pack. Offers it to
Ariadne. Cobb watches. Silent. Ariadne pulls out the tubes-

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Ariadne rolls up her own sleeve.
Eames NODS. Cobb and Ariadne lie down. Eames hits the button-
WATER. BUBBLES. DROWNING. And we are-

<b>EXT. COAST (LIMBO) - DAY
</b>
Ariadne lies in the SURF, STARING up at a CLOUDLESS SKY. A
tremendous BOOM prompts her to look around her- URBAN
BUILDINGS PILED right down to the water. The buildings are
DECAYING, falling into the ocean like a GLACIER calving. Cobb
WADES towards her through the shallow water. Ariadne looks up
at the crumbling city around them.

Arthur floats on top of the elevator, planting small charges
on the EMERGENCY BRAKES and CABLE. He sets them, GRABS the
other explosives, then PUSHES AWAY, shooting up the shaft. As
he hits the DETONATOR, BLASTING the braking and safety

Eames RACES around, full speed- getting the defibrillator
paddles- laying them by Fischer's body- he runs into the duct-
pulls Saito up to a seated position and hands him a handgun.

<b>                    EAMES
</b>          Come on, Saito. I need you to cover
          Fischer while I plant the charges.

Saito nods weakly, tries to hold the gun. Eames moves to the
window- pulls his machine gun off- checks its load. Ready. He
watches the security patrols climb up the outer walls...
Eames lays down a HAIL of covering fire- then heads outside-

</b>
Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed. They
move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings. The
streets are eerily DESERTED. As they move further in, the
buildings become NEWER, different. Ariadne marvels at the
extraordinary collection of buildings- every architectural
style imaginable in waves of FAILED UTOPIAS.

<b>                    ARIADNE

          got stale, we started in on the
          memories.

A child's SHOUT echoes through the deserted canyons,
prompting Cobb to look down a side street: a LITTLE BLONDE
BOY crouched, his back to us. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the
boy, and, as Cobb turns down the street, they run off.

Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar SQUARE lined with an
eclectic mix of buildings, from APARTMENT BLOCKS to HOUSES.

<b>                    COBB

Cobb pauses in front of a French country house. Staring.

Cobb COCKS his weapon, and the ELEVATOR STOPS. The doors
open. Ariadne moves to exit, Cobb stops her.

</b>          There's something you have to

Cobb leads her out of the lift...

Cobb and Ariadne step off the lift and into the incongruous
interior of a craftsman house. They cautiously move down the
corridor towards the back of the house...

Cobb is staring into the kitchen. Mal is sitting at the
table, back to them, staring out at the porch- the TOWERS of
Limbo stretching off behind it.

TOPPLE. Saito looks at the top. Then back to Cobb.

<b>                    SAITO
</b>          You came to convince me to honor
          our arrangement?

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Yes. And to take a leap of faith.

As Saito-san listens to Cobb, he looks at the GUN on the
table between them...

<b>                    COBB
</b>          Come back and we'll be young men
          together again.

The elderly Saito looks at Cobb. Nods. And we-

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - DAY
</b>
Ariadne watches Cobb. His eyes are closed.

<b>                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
</b>          Hot towel, sir?

His EYES FLICKER OPEN. He takes the towel with a nod. Ariadne
smiles. Relieved.

<b>                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>          We'll be landing in Los Angeles in
          about twenty minutes. Do you need
          immigration forms?

Cobb nods. Takes a landing card. Looks around the cabin.

Saito is WATCHING him. Serious. Haunted. Holding Cobb's gaze,
SAITO PICKS UP THE PHONE AND DIALS. Cobb nods thanks...

<b>INT. ARRIVALS, LAX - LATER
</b>
Cobb steps forwards to the IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Hands him
his passport. Nervous. The Official takes a beat, looks Cobb
up and down, then WHUMP!- the passport is stamped. As Cobb
takes it back, he spots Ariadne at the next counter. She nods
at him. He nods back. Then moves off...

As Cobb passes through baggage claim, he exchanges subtle
greetings with Eames and Yusuf.

Arthur smiles broadly at Cobb. Cobb brushes past Fischer, who
glances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know him,
then moves on...
<b>                                                          146.
</b>
As Cobb emerges into the crowded arrivals hall, he spots
Professor Miles, waving at him...

<b>INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Cobb enters with Miles. Drops his bags. Moves to the table,
looking out at the overgrown garden. He reaches into his
pocket, takes out his pewter spinning top, lowers it to the
table and SPINS IT- a CHILD'S SHOUT makes him look up-

Through the window, James and Philippa have run into view,
playing, THEIR FACES TURNED AWAY... Cobb STARES at the back
of his children's heads... Miles moves to the window and
KNOCKS on the glass-

James and Philippa TURN- see their Dad. He steps to the
window, watching their BRIGHT FACES SHINING as they run
towards him...

Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING.
And we-

<b>FADE OUT.
