<b>     EXT.  STREET IN GEORGETOWN -- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
</b>
     Fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps.  Apartment
     buildings line the curb, it is very quiet.  In one building, six floors
     up, a bedroom light is on.  WE SEE the silhouette of Norman's WIFE
     looking out the window.

<b>                         WIFE (O.S.)
</b>               What kind of a crash was it?

<b>                         NORMAN (O.S.)
</b>               You seen my suitcase?

<b>                         WIFE (O.S.)
</b>               There's nothing on the news about a
               crash.  Did he say what airline?

<b>                         NORMAN (O.S.)
</b>               He didn't say much at all.  Honey --

<b>                         WIFE (O.S.)
</b>               In the closet.  I don't understand,
               Norman -- why would they call you?

<b>                         NORMAN (O.S.)
</b>               Don't be so supportive, honey.

<b>                         WIFE (O.S.)
</b>               Well, I can't imagine five years of
               unemployment --

<b>                         NORMAN (O.S.)
</b>               Four.  Four years --

<b>                         WIFE (O.S.)
</b>               Four years of unemployment would
               look too good on a resume.

<b>                         NORMAN (O.S.)
</b>               Keep watching the news.  Are you
               watching the news?

<b>                         WIFE (O.S.)
</b>               How are you getting to the airport?
               You need money for the bus?

     A tinted-window black SEDAN travels down the street, pulls up in front
     of the apartment building.  A U.S.  NAVY decal is on the door.

<b>                         WIFE (O.S.)
</b>               There's a U.S.  Navy car outside,
               Norman.

<b>                         NORMAN (O.S.)
</b>               What?

<b>                         WIFE (O.S.)
</b>               Was it a military crash?

<b>                         NORMAN (O.S.)
</b>               I don't know.

<b>                         WIFE (O.S.)
</b>               They never used to send a Navy car.

<b>                                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>     THE LOUD, HARD CHOPPING OF A HELICOPTER PROPELLER
</b>
<b>     EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY
</b>
     Blinding sunlight, as the helicopter WHIPS by, speeding above the
     Pacific Ocean.

<b>     INT.  HELICOPTER -- DAY
</b>
     Norman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back.  He studies a
     pamphlet in his hand: "AIRCRASH SURVIVAL: HOW TO COPE".  The PILOT, in
     the cockpit, turns to him.

<b>                         PILOT
</b>               What kinda work you in, Dr. Johnson?

     Norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am
               really, just been a while.
                    (beat)
               I treat aircrash survivors.

<b>                         PILOT
</b>               Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               You've heard of me?

<b>                         PILOT
</b>               Well, everybody's been talking about
               that report you wrote.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               What report?

<b>                         PILOT
</b>               Huh?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               What report?

<b>                         PILOT
</b>               You mean you don't know?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Know what?

     The pilot glances back at him again.

<b>                         PILOT
</b>               Must be another Johnson then.  Been
               flying so many scientists out here
               -- can't keep everyone straight.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Who's everyone?

<b>                         PILOT
</b>               Physicists, mathematicians,
               geologists, you name it.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Geologists?  At a plane crash?

<b>                         PILOT
</b>               Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of
               the ocean no less.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               What the hell would a geologist be
               doing at a plane crash?

     Norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the
     water.

<b>     EXT.  SHIP DECK -- DAY
</b>
     The helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about.  A
     young, female OFFICER -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to
     greet Norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter.

     She looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag.

<b>                         OFFICER
</b>               Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.

     She lugs it over her shoulder, no problem.

<b>                         OFFICER
</b>               No other equipment?  Scientific
               instruments?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               No, they didn't say --

<b>                         OFFICER
</b>               This way, sir.

     Norman follows the officer away from the helipad.

<b>     INT.  SHIP
</b>
     She leads Norman down a flight of stairs.

<b>                         OFFICER
</b>               Captain Barnes wants to see you
               right away, sir.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Captain who?

<b>                         OFFICER
</b>               Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you.
               Been calling us every half hour to
               see if you're arrived.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Really?

     As they march down a hallway, Norman looks down at his wrinkled suit,
     tries to smooth it out.

<b>                         OFFICER
</b>               By the way sir, I've read your
               report.  I think it's brilliant.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               What report?

<b>                         OFFICER
</b>               You mean they haven't told you yet?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Told me what?

     She staightens up, like she might have said too much.

<b>                         OFFICER
</b>               This way, sir.

<b>     INT.  BARNES' OFFICE
</b>
     CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES, 60s, immaculate, proud of who he is, talks on
     the phone.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               How's he look?...  Well, we can't all
               be officers, can we?
                    (laughs)
               They tell me he's brilliant.

<b>     EXT.  BARNES' OFFICE
</b>
     Norman stands in front of the door.  The doorplate reads: PROJECT
     COMMANDER -- CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES.  Norman straightens his big-knotted
     tie.  Deep breath.

<b>     INT.  BARNES' OFFICE
</b>
     As the door opens, Barnes is putting down the phone, rises from his
     desk, as Norman steps inside.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Dr. Norman Johnson.  Welcome aboard.

     They shake hands.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Thank you, Colonel.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Captain.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Captain.  Right, forgive me.

     Barnes looks at Norman, sizing him up.  An akward silence.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Well, thanks for the opportuninty
               here -- my wife appreciates it.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You
               weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made
               me take you.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>                    (smiling)
               The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had
               friends in Washington.

     Norman tries to laugh as Barnes ushers him to the door...

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Come with me.  The team's already
               waiting.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               What team?

<b>     INT.  HALLWAY
</b>
     Barnes leads Norman down the corridor, lined with OFFICERS and GUARDS.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               What have you been told so far?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers
               unknown.  Routine stuff really.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Anything else?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Nothing else.

     A GUARD unlocks a large, steel door.

<b>                         GUARD
</b>               Captain Barnes.  Dr. Johnson.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Hello.

     Norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway,
     wondering how the guard knows his name.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               You talk to any reporters?  Any
               press?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Press?  No, I haven't.

     The steel door shuts loudly behind them.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Good.  Security's been our biggest
               worry.  Now that you're here we can
               shut this thing down tight.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               From what?  What's with all the
               security?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Well, we don't have all the facts
               yet.

     Another GUARD opens up another large steel door...

<b>     INT.  TECH ROOM
</b>
     Barnes leads Norman through the room, crammed with video monitors,
     screens, and grids.  Officers talk into radios.  Technicians work on
     computers.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               We're moving fast considering the
               storm.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Storm?  What storm?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               A cyclone's on it's way in.  I
               thought they would have told you on
               the phone.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               They didn't tell me anything.

     Norman tries to keep pace...

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               We've had divers working around the
               clock.  Take a look at this...

     ANGLE ON a large VIDEO SCREEN -- shows a diver walking on the ocean
     floor, holding a bright artificial flashlight.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               How deep is he?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               A thousand feet.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               A thousand?  An airplane crashes into
               a thousand feet of water -- I don't
               want to sound pessimistic here, but
               I assume there are no survivors.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Then why am I here?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               What?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               What do you need me for?

     ON THE VIDEO SCREEN -- the diver shines his light on a large, metallic
<b>     OBJECT.
</b>
<b>                         BARNES
</b>               What crashed wasn't an airplane, Dr.
               Johnson.  It's a bit larger than
               that.

     Barnes walks toward a TECHNICIAN, sitting at a keyboard.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>                    (to technician)
               Bring up the grid, would you?

     ANGLE ON THE MONITOR as an IMAGE OF THE CRAFT begins to form.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               What is it?  A military spacecraft?
               Like a shuttle or satellite?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Something like that.
                    (beat)
               That doesn't surprise you?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Not really, no.  Something of the
               military crashes in the ocean -- it
               explains why there was nothing on
               the news, why you've kept everything
               a secret...  When did it crash?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               As best we can estimate, it crashed
               four hundred years ago.

     A beat.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Four hundred?  You're kidding, right?

     ANGLE ON THE MONITOR -- showing a grid depicting an image of the craft
     and a small layer of ROCK above it.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured
               the coral growth on top of the craft
               to be over five meters thick.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Geologists?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Coral grows at a rate of two and a
               half centimeters a year --

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               -- Wait a second --

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               -- dating the crash at least that
               old.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Hold on --

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Maybe older --

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               -- there's got to be some mistake
               here -- a four hundred year old
               military spacecraft?  There's no such
               thing... our space program isn't even
               forty years old.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Extraordinary, isn't it?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               It's impossible.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson...
               because it's sitting on the bottom
               of our ocean floor.

<b>     INT.  STAIRWELL
</b>
     Barnes and Norman shuffle down the stairs.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Off the record, I don't mind telling
               you, this thing scares the shit out
               of me.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               It doesn't make any sense.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               We think it might.  That's why we
               brought you here.  We've assembled
               your team -- they're waiting for us
               now.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               What team?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               The one you recommended.  In the ULF
               report you wrote for the Bush
               administration.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that
               in years.  You mean someone actually
               read it?

     As they head down a hallway, Barnes pulls the ULF REPORT out from
     under his arm, hands it to Norman.

     Norman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Your report's become our bible down
               here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been
               carrying out each of your
               recommendations -- one by one -- to
               the smallest detail.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               But sir, I don't understand.  This
               report -- these recommendations...
               they're for an encounter with extra-
               terrestrial life.

<b>     INT.  BRIEFING ROOM

<b>                         BETH (O.S.)
</b>               How big is this spacecraft?

<b>                         BARNES (O.S.)
</b>               Of what we're able to measure,
               roughly twenty-six hundred feet.

<b>                         TED (O.S.)

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               The wing dimension alone is larger
               that any aircraft we've seen.

     The team members sit around the conference table:

     TED FIELDING, 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here.  BETH
     HALPERIN, 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron.
     ARTHUR LEVINE, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet.  HARRY ADAMS, 32,
     mathamatician, African-American, wire-glasses, no bullshit.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               How much damage?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Right.  So you're saying it survived
               a high speed impact with water
               without a scratch?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm
               just stating the facts.
                    (continuing)
               The outer metal is made of a
               titanium alloy, built into an epoxy-
               resin honeycomb.  The necessary
               technology to bond this type of
               metal has never been invented.

<b>                         TED
</b>               Never invented?

     ON NORMAN, watching the team...

<b>                         BETH
</b>               In basic English, what does all this
               mean?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Basic English?  There's no way this
               spacecraft was constructed on our
               planet.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               I love secrets.

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         BETH
</b>               I've read it twice, Norman.  It's
               brilliant.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.

<b>                         BETH
</b>                    (beat)
               That's quite a secret.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I spent a week reading Sagan and
               watching re-runs of the Twilight

               to pay the mortgage on my house -- I
               had no idea --

     ANGLE ON TWO NAVY CORPSMEN, standing behind glass in the next room,
     monitoring Beth and Norman.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you
               listening?  Don't tell anyone what
               you just told me.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               C'mon, Beth -- that report's like
               the blind leading the blind.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Because when we get down there --

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Wait -- down where?

<b>                         BETH
</b>               To the spacecraft.  To investigate.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Underwater?

<b>                         BETH
</b>               What do you expect?  For them to
               bring it up here?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               We can't go down there.  We're not
               prepared.  That deep?  That takes
               years of training, Beth.  We're just
               scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear
               ties and lab coats to work -- not
               oxygen tanks.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Well, you must have realized the
               chances an encounter like this would
               happen here.  In the ocean.
                    (off his look)
               70 percent of the earth's surface is
               water, Norman.  That's first grade
               geography.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               It never occurred to me.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Well, let's pray that's the only
               mistake you made.  Have you said
               anything to Barnes about this?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               The timing has never seemed quite
               right.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Just keep your mouth shut, alright?
               This could mean everything to our
               careers, you know that?  Don't

<b>     EXT.  SHIP -- LATE AT NIGHT
</b>
     THE SKY -- clouds looming on the horizon.

     ANGLE ON ARTHUR LEVINE, leaning against the railing, looking out at
     the water.

     ON NORMAN, approaching him.  Arthur never looks at Norman, he just
     stares out at the water.

<b>                         ARTHUR
</b>               I don't know you, but I'll be honest
               with you.  I don't like this.  I don't
               like any of this.  Especially, the
               water.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Seasick?  A marine biologist?

<b>                         ARTHUR
</b>               I don't belong here.  None of us
               belong here.  Look at that.

     ANGLE ON THE WATER, an ocean of seemingly endless, choppy waves.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Makes you feel pretty small, doesn't
               it?

<b>                         ARTHUR

     CLOSE ON NORMAN, lying on a cot.  It is dark.  His eyes are open.  He
     stares at the ceiling.

<b>     INT.  DESCENT PLATFORM
</b>
     A porthole hatch to the DESCENT SUB unlatches loudly.  A SUB-OFFICER
     help Norman lower himself through the hatch.

<b>     INT.  DESCENT SUB
</b>
     Norman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment.  Seated in a
     circle area: Ted, Beth, Harry, and Arthur.  Ahead of them, Captain
     Barnes sits with the pilot in the sub's cockpit, separated by a wall
     of plexiglass.

     Norman takes a seat between Beth and Ted.

<b>                         BARNES (O.S.)
</b>                    (through the intercom)

               Descending at a speed of 80 feet per
               minute.

     Across from Norman, Harry is WHISPERING something quietly into
     Arthur's ear.

<b>                         BARNES (O.S.)
</b>               Pressure adjustments will cause the
               sub to lurch at times, but don't be
               alarmed.  It's perfectly normal...

     Arthur's face drips with sweat, as Harry continues to whisper into his
     ear.

<b>                         BARNES (O.S.)
</b>               The sub's interior atmosphere will
               experience moisture as we descend,
               and the temperature will drop
               rapidly.  Just relax and remain
               seated during the descent.

     Norman watches Arthur, dripping with sweat.

<b>                         BARNES (O.S.)
</b>               We have clearing from the base.

     Red interior lights flicker on in the compartment, and WE HEAR the sub
     make a HISSING sound.  The sub lurches, and begins to lower in the
     water.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Arthur?

     Harry has gotten to Arthur.  Arthur is on the verge of panic.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Arthur?  You alright?

<b>                         ARTHUR
</b>               Open the hatch door, please.

     Harry continues to whisper in his ear.

<b>                         ARTHUR
</b>               Captain, open the hatch door, please

     wall.

     Arthur VOMITS, violently, heaving, splattering the plexiglass wall.

<b>                         ARTHUR
</b>               Open the fucking door!

     The sub LURCHES again, coming to a stop.  The compartment is totally
     silent, as they begin ascending to the surface.

     ON HARRY smiling a sly, evil grin directed right at Norman.

     The sub lurches again, and WE HEAR clanking metal.  The hatch door
     opens.

     And Arthur, wiping the vomit from his mouth, climbs up the ladder and
     out the hatch door.

<b>                         BARNES (O.S.)

<b>     EXT.  OCEAN

     WE SEE the sub descending into darker waters.

<b>     EXT.  DH-8 HABITAT -- ARRIVING DOCK

     The SUB descends into the AIRLOCK, metal clanks against metal.  Around
     it, the DH-8: interwoven cylinders lit up with lights.

     CLOSE ON THE HATCH DOOR closing tightly, locking.

<b>                         OFFICER (O.S.)
</b>               One moment for pressurizing.

<b>     A SOFT WHIRR.
</b>
     ANGLE ON -- Barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the
     small, claustrophobic pressurizing room.  Like sardines.  Nobody says
     anything.  A long beat.

<b>     THE DOOR
</b>
     in front of them, opens.  TEENY FLETCHER, 30s, a big-boned female
     officer, stands before them.  She wears a black plastic PAD, a
     "talker", around her neck.

     She hands each member their own "talker".  Norman takes his.

<b>     INT.  DH-8 HALLWAY
</b>
     Fletcher leads Barnes and the team members down the hallway.  Each of
     them wears the "talkers" around their necks.

<b>                         BARNES

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               What's wrong with oxygen?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it
               makes a half-eaten apple turn brown
               and puts the ugly, iron rust on an
               Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low,
               oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it

               mounted at the door.  The robot is
               now in position to enter the

               necessary for all of us to go... out
               there?

     The other team members take their suits out of their lockers.

<b>                         BARNES

     nuclear.

<b>                         TED

<b>     INT.  AIRLOCK ROOM -- (A CYLINDER)
</b>
     Dressed in jumpsuits and helmets -- Barnes jumps into a POOL of ocean
     water, cut out from the floor, leading to the ocean.  It looks like a
     tiny swimming pool.  Ted jumps in next.  Beth, Harry, and Norman are
     left...

<b>                         NORMAN

     Harry nudges him forward.

<b>                         HARRY

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         NORMAN

     And Harry just pushes him in.  Norman slips and falls awkwardly... into
     the ocean depths.

<b>                                                            CUT TO:

<b>     BLACK.

     Quiet.  Only THE SOUND OF NORMAN -- BREATHING.

     For a couple beats.

     Now... NORMAN'S POV -- from inside his helmet -- a light SHINES from
     behind him -- casting his SHADOW onto the murky ocean floor.

     Norman's head turns, and he's BLINDED by a light -- it's Harry, the
     light SHINING from the top of Harry's helmet.

     WE HEAR Harry's voice, static, through Norman's helmet.

<b>                         HARRY (O.S.)
</b>               The switch is on your waist.

     ON NORMAN -- his GLOVE -- fumbling at his waist.

     HIS HELMET LIGHT -- FLICKERS on.

     ON NORMAN -- slowly, beginning to walk on the ocean floor.

     HIS FEET -- squashing gently, lightly into the muddy ground.

     NORMAN'S POV -- can barely make out the others in front of him, their
     helmet lights STROBING the dark water, crossing each other, like
     searchlights on a foggy night.

     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE -- eyes cold, BREATHING.  Couple beats.  And
<b>     HEARS:

<b>                         TED (O.S.)
</b>               Look at that thing.

     Norman's eyes look up... WE PULL BACK...

     LONG, HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the team -- their little helmet lights tiny
     and insignificant almost as...

     IN FRONT OF THEM -- the SPACECRAFT.  Dwarfing them in size, looming
     large, majestic, like nothing we've ever seen.  The enormous tail fin,
     in the distance, extends high out of the coral.

     In the huge MOUND OF CORAL covering the spacecraft, WE SEE a tunnel --
     cut out like a cave -- lined with tiny, dim lightbulbs.

<b>     INT.  TUNNEL
</b>
     About 60 feet deep.  Narrower than they'd like.  Norman descends,
     clumsily, awkwardly -- pushing off the bulky, iron handles fastened to
     the coral walls.

     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE as he watches the water recede, down past his
     faceplate.

<b>     THE LOUD BANGING OF METAL

     Ted has wedged a crowbar into the door and BANGS at it with a
     sledgehammer.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.

</b>               Gimme some room here, will you?  Back
               off.  Gimme some space.

     They all back away, cramming into the far corner of the airlock as Ted
     keeps swinging.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Looks alot like an airplane door,

     Ted stops and looks at the door.

<b>                         TED
</b>               Alot like.  You know, I noticed it
               before, but I didn't...

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit.
               Keep hammering.

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Give him the hammer, Ted.

     Norman takes the hammer.  Walks up to the wedge.  Gets his bearings.
     Rears back... then stops.

<b>                         TED
</b>               What is it, your back give out?

     Something has caught Norman's eye.  He looks down at the wedge.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               What is it, Norman?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Take a look.

     Barnes comes toward him.  The others follow.  Barnes bends down, looks
     closely down at the wedge in the door.

<b>                         BARNES

<b>                         BARNES

<b>                         HARRY

<b>     THE DOOR STARTS TO RUMBLE

     THE DOOR begins to slide open.

     THE DOOR, sliding, is revealing COMPLETE BLACKNESS inside.  The door
     stops, it's open, it's quiet.  They all stand there, looking at
     BLACKNESS.  A long beat.

     ON NORMAN -- cautiously stepping inside.  His helmet light SHINES on the
     others ahead of him, walking along a 5 foot wide CATWALK, suspended
     high in the air.

     Metallic BEAMS and RAFTERS criss-cross above them.

     Norman looks over the railing -- his light STROBES through 40 feet of
     darkness, dimly lighting the LOWER HULL, a dense network of STRUTS and

     ON BARNES -- leading them through a small hall.  It seems to be opening
     up into some sort of room -- when Barnes stops.  Dead in his tracks.

<b>                         TED

               What do you make of this?

     SIGN that reads: "Trash."

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               That's right.

     Norman looks up and SEES more of the room as his light SHINES
     throughout it: TABLES, COUCHES and CHAIRS -- made of leather, very
     comfortable looking.

     They begin to slowly wander about... 

<b>                         BETH
</b>               I don't get it.

<b>                         TED

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               You don't think it does?  I think
               it's rather obvious.

<b>                         TED

<b>                         HARRY

<b>                         HARRY

<b>                         TED
</b>               Unless, this alien spacecraft was --

               itself to Americans in a way that
               would make us feel comfortable.

<b>                         TED
</b>               If it is an alien spacecraft --

               spacecraft.

<b>                         BETH

<b>                         HARRY
</b>                    (beat)
               It's an American spacecraft.

<b>                         TED
</b>               An American spacecraft?  Half a mile
               long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah,
               good theory, Harry.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               It's been obvious from the start,
               hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all
               the secrecy, why no one was told
               about it?

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               We had considered it.

<b>                         TED
</b>               Considered what?  That it's American?

<b>                         HARRY

     ON NORMAN -- glancing up at Harry... 

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               We take a weeny little wedge, bang
               on it a couple of times, and bust
               off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any
               spacecraft -- even at a low
               velocity, say 200 miles an hour --
               crashes into the water -- it's gonna
               be like hitting concrete, it would
               crumple like paper.  But there isn't
               a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even
               a scratch.

<b>                         TED
</b>               Meaning?

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Meaning it didn't land in the water.

<b>                         TED

<b>                         HARRY

<b>                         TED

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From
               our future.

     A quiet moment as they take this in.

</b>               Time travel.  I always thought it was

<b>                         HARRY

               door -- the craft runs on some sort
               of power.

     ON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS.

<b>                         BETH

     They LISTEN to a GIRGLING NOISE.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Sounds a little like water --

     SUDDENLY -- the chair Norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him
     inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him
     -- sucking him inside...

<b>                         BETH
</b>               I think the chair thinks you want to
               fly this thing.

     across...

     "ASSIMILATING DATABASE" as a series of numbers race upwards in
     count...

     life.

     Harry punches some keys on the control panel.

     Harry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys... 

     ON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving... 
     WE SEE a galaxy of stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN, into the
     room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the
     illusion of depth.

     The IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rapidly, like
     we're flying through it.

     The stars and other space matter streaking by.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               What's that cluster of stars there?
               In the center?

     Harry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3-D image... 

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Our answer.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               To what?

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Time travel.  A black hole.

     The CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer
     and closer, brightening.

     The FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become BLINDING as
     WE ENTER the cluster, the black hole.

     ON NORMAN -- his face, bright, FRIGHTENED as he HEARS:

<b>                         HARRY (O.S.)
</b>               Ted?  Captain?

<b>                         BARNES (O.S.)
</b>               Yes, Harry.

<b>                         HARRY (O.S.)
</b>               We know how this craft got here.
               Where it's been.

<b>                         BARNES (O.S.)
</b>               So do we.  And it seems to have
               picked up something on it's travels.

     STILL ON NORMAN -- frightened... 

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Picked up something?  What is it?

<b>                         BARNES (O.S.)

     ANGLE ON our six team members' BOOTS, in the distance.  AS WE PAN UP
     and AROUND WE SEE a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly
     swirling green and blue fluids.  Like mercury.  Mesmerizlng.

     AS WE COME AROUND, the team stands looking at the SPHERE, 30 feet in
     dlameter, held by a GIANT CLAW gripping it from the top.

     They walk around it, circling it, looking up at it.

<b>                         HARRY	
</b>               This answers one of our questions.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Which one?  Let me get the list out.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               This spacecraft was designed to pick
               things up.  They see things they want
               -- these claws go out and bring it
               in.  They come across this.  This... 
               <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting,
               curious.  They draw it inside to take
               back home.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               But on the way home, they miss their
               turn, go too far, into the past.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Our present.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               But what does it do?  This... sphere.

<b>                         TED
</b>               Maybe it's a message of some sort,
               you know?  See this red here.

     ANGLE ON THE SPHERE -- some dark red MARKINGS on it's surface... 

<b>                         TED
</b>                    (continuing)
               Looks like a design, some writing,
               maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the
               spacecraft with a message.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Look closely.  That isn't writing.
               Those are grooves.

     ON THE RED GROOVES -- engraved into the surface.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               No.  They don't represent a message.
               They aren't decorative at all.  They
               have another purpose entirely.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               What?

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               To conceal a small break in the
               surface of the sphere.

<b>                         BARNES

<b>                         HARRY

     ON THE MONITOR -- Ted pushing on the SPHERE door.  Banging into it with
     his shoulder.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Maybe we shouldn't.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               What?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't
               try to open it at all.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>                    (nodding to Norman)
               Man is man, all he knows is man, and
               all he can think of is what he
               knows.  The anthropomorphic problem.
               Good, Norman.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               The what?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't

</b>               Everything ever written about extra-
               terrestial life imagines that life
               is essentially human.  If it doesn't
               look human, it's a reptile or a big
               insect or something, having human
               values, human understanding.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               So?  What's the problem?

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               It's nonsense.  There's enough
               difference between our own species
               to prove that.

<b>                         BETH

               think we're gonna open it up and

</b>               And we're just talking about three-
               dimensional creatures.  What if it's

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               It could.  But the odds of it being
               any use to us are against it.

<b>                         BARNES

               a thousand years ahead of us, just
               like we are to, say, medieval
               Europe.  Suppose you went back to

</b>               You realize, Norman, that we are all

     Norman is lying in his own bunk, below Harry.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Don't be so optomistic, Harry.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               I'm completely serious.  There is
               something very important missing
               from that spacecraft.  You know what
               that is?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Not a clue.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               A sign that the builders knew time
               travel through a black hole was
               possible.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I don't follow you.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               On that flight recorder, they called
               the black hole an "Unknown Entry
               Event." They didn't know what a
               black hole was.  Fifty years from
               now, men are going to build that
               ship in a very tentative,
               experimental way, with no knowledge
               that time travel through a black
               hole is possible.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               So what?

     Harry leans his head over his bunk.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               So, <u>we know</u>.
                    (beat)
               We know it went through a black
               hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd
               get to the surface, we'd tell
               someone about the black hole,
               wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report
               like some big discovery.  So in fifty
               years when they build that ship,
               they'd make precautions for a black
               hole.
                    (beat)
               <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an
               Unknown Entry Event.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Meaning we're never gonna get the
               chance to tell anyone.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Meaning we're never gonna get to the
               surface alive... to tell anyone.

     Norman gets out of his bed.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I can't believe that, Harry.

<b>                         HARRY

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I can't.  If I had a minute to think,
               maybe, but I know you're wrong.

<b>                         HARRY

                    (sits on the table)
               Harry, what happened in the

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze
               me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like
               you hate jellyfish.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               You said something to me, before --
               about how we were all going to die.

<b>                         HARRY

<b>                         NORMAN

               memory is on the tip of my tongue --
               but I can't taste any of it.  Funny,
               my senses are much keener though.
               Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling.
               Like, I can smell your sheets,
               Norman.  You tried to wash it out
               earlier, But I can still smell the
               urine.

               Don't worry, I'm not going to tell
               the others.  It's normal, really,

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.

     Walking toward her... 

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               ... when I was six, my younger
               brother and I -- we went swimming in
               the Pacific.  At my mother's beach
               house.  We both felt stinging, and
               when we came out of the water, he
               was wearing jellyfish head to toe.
               Killed him.

</b>               My gosh, Norman.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Yeah, it was awful.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               What about you?  What happened to

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed.
               It itched for a while, but I
               survived.
                    (beat)
               Beth, do you find it... curious that
               we're seeing all this life down
               here.  Nothing, and then these
               enormous flocks of squid.  Then
               jellyfish?

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's
               quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no
               electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's
               curious is -- these aren't normal
               jellyfish.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               What do you mean -- not normal?

<b>                         BETH
</b>               They have six tentacles.  A new
               species.  And the squid too.  They had
               no stomach.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Wait a minute.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               What?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               You knew about the squid not being
               normal.  Before Fletcher went out
               there?

<b>                         BETH

     She backs away from Norman, knocking off a speciman jar, it SHATTERS
     on the floor.  She starts breaking down.

     Norman watching her, falling to the ground, picking up the glass,
     hurriedly... 

<b>                         BETH

     away.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               A while back, Beth and I -- we
               worked at the same university.  She
               was assisting a chemist there -- I
               forget his name -- doing research,
               experiments.  She was also living

                    (off Barnes' look)
               Yeah, I know.  And when she finished
               her work, he kicked her out, broke
               off the relationship, and published
               five papers -- all her work --
               without any thank you or

     Harry sitting at the monitor, shows Ted, Barnes, Norman, and Edmunds a
     PRINTOUT of the screan -- indicating a pattern.

<b>                         HARRY

<b>                         TED
</b>               It's not a discharge.  Right,
               Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So
               it's gotta be a message.

<b>                         BARNES

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               If it is a message, it's probably a

<b>                         TED

</b>               He's manic, Norman.  You know that?
               This reliance on Harry is misplaced.
               You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's
               overlooking things.  Obvious things.

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         TED
</b>               Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the
               vertical torso, three legs, two
               arms.  There's no head, so I'm
               guessing the creature's head is
               located within the torso itself, you
               know?

<b>                         NORMAN

     CLOSE ON MONITOR -- spirals now.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               ... I asked myself, why would the
               sphere be using a code?  If you're
               trying to communicate, why use a
               code?

<b>                         TED
</b>                    (to Norman)
               See?  No code.  What'd I say?

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So
               it's making a mistake.  It's making a
               code without intending to.  I figured
               it's probably substituting numbers
               for letters...  Then I began to wonder
               what an alien intelligence would
               make of our keyboard.  And since
               we're getting spirals, I imagined
               the keyboard as a spiral.  So I
               translated it... 

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               That's brilliant.

     Ted grimaces at Norman.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               ... spiralling out of the center, you
               see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is
               three, and so on... when I got the
               message.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               What's the message?

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               I have to tell you.  It's strange.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               How do you mean, strange?

     Harry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads:

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               "Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What
               is your name?  My name is Jerry."

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               He translated it wrong.  "My name is
               Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               The message doesn't show a lack of
               intelligence.  It's smart.  It's
               approaching us in a simple way.  Like
               you would a dog.  Holding out your
               hand, letting it sniff, get used to

     An empty chair.  Edmunds is not here.  WE HEAR a repeating THUMP.  THUMP.

     ON A MONITOR -- WE SEE her body, wedged in a light stand bracket,
     floating in the water, lifeless.  Her helmet THUMPING against the wall
     of the habitat.

<b>     INT.  UNDERWATER -- OUTSIDE THE HABITAT
</b>
     Norman and Beth, in jumpsuits and helmets, walk out from under the
     habitat.  Still HEARING the THUMPING.  They pause, looking around.

</b>               Coast is clear.

     They go to the south end of the habitat.  The THUMPING louder.

     Norman climbs up the grid-like STANCHION, the support beam holding up
     the habitat.  The BODY above him -- flapping in the current.  THUMPING
     against the wall.

     He climbs, reaching the body.  A BOOT swings, catches the LOOP in his
     air hose.  BUBBLES shoot out.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Norman, your suit -- it's leaking.

     The BOOT comes off in Norman's hand -- and the NAKED FOOT, gray flesh,
     purple toenails, KICKS his faceplate.  Startles him.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Norman.  Look at this.

     ON EDMUNDS' SUIT -- a long TEAR in the fabric, revealing red, mangled
     FLESH.  Droplets of BLOOD float past Norman's faceplate.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Her flesh has been macerated.
               Chewed.  I've never seen a bite like
               this before.

     Norman pulls her body out.

     Edmunds' FACEPLATE whips around -- and Norman SEES her staring eyes,
     mouth open in horror.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I can't feel her bones.  She's like a

<b>                         BETH
</b>               She was crushed.  Feel her skin --

     Barnes, Norman, Beth, and Ted are gathered around the monitors.  Barnes
     addresses Norman... 

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               I don't want you talking to Jerry.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               But sir, I think it's imperative.  I
               think the messages, the animals
               we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the
               reading you got earlier -- I think
               they're all related.

<b>                         TED
</b>               Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said
               earlier -- we were his friends --

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Of course he did.  He's been isloated
               for 400 years.  He wants someone to
               talk to.  Look, you put a human being
               in isolation for four days, they can
               become neurotic, sometimes
               psychotic.  We're talking about 400
               years here.  An alien that shows
               emotional responses.  I think we need
               to address him, before he reacts
               further.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               You think he killed Edmunds?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I
               think is his response to us refusing
               to talk to him earlier.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               Bullshit.  What's out there isn't
               alien.  It's an animal.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask
               Jerry about it.

<b>                         BARNES
</b>               No.  I think we should shut down the
               communication lines inside the
               habitat.  He might be listening now.

<b>                         BETH

               it.

<b>                         NAVY SEAMAN
</b>               It's over, sir, The storm has
               cleared.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               The ships?

<b>                         NAVY SEAMAN (O.S.)
</b>               They're topside.  We're ready to take
               you home, sir.

     The Navy Seaman helps Norman to his feet.  Norman is smiling, it's
     over.

<b>     INT.  HALLWAY
</b>
     Norman and the Navy Seaman walk down the hall.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               How are the others?

<b>                         NAVY SEAMAN
</b>               The others, sir?

<b>                         NAVY SEAMAN
</b>               They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.

     Norman sighs, smiling.  The relief, the jubilation.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               That whole time -- I couldn't stop
               thinking of what Harry was saying
               earlier... 

<b>                         NAVY SEAMAN
</b>               What was that, sir?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               About the time paradox.
                    (the Seaman nodding)
               How we were all going to die --
               that there was no way we would make
               it out of here alive --

     As Norman looks up, the Navy Seaman, still walking and nodding, begins
     to slowly DISAPPEAR.  Disintigrating.  VANISHING before his eyes.

     Norman stops, looks around him.  He's gone.

<b>     INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM
</b>
     Norman watches on a monitor -- the VIDEO of him walking down the hall,
     the Navy Seaman walking next to him.

<b>                         NORMAN (O.S.)
</b>               ... how we were all going to die --
               that there was no way we would make
               it out of here alive --

     ON THE MONITOR -- the Seaman disappers.

     Norman stops tape.  Looks over at the MONITOR showing the SPHERE.  It is
     closed.

     THE SCREEN goes BLACK.  Flashes up: "Hello Norman"

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Jerry?

     "Yes Norman"

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Jerry, did you create that man?

     "The entity Navy Seaman was a Manifestation.  Did you have a Happy
     talk?"

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Jerry, are you manifesting what's
               destroying our habitat?

     "Did you have a Happy talk?"

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Jerry, answer me.

     "No."

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Jerry?

     A beat.

     "Stop calling me Jerry"

     The MONITOR shuts off.

     Norman looks over at ANOTHER MONITOR labled "AIRLOCK FEED".

     ON THE SCREEN -- Beth is putting on her jumpsuit.

<b>     INT.  AIRLOCK

     REFLECTED IN THE POOL OF WATER -- WE SEE Beth, slipping on her boots.

     Norman stands in the doorway... 

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Forget the sub.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Don't bother me, Norman.

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         BETH
</b>               It's also our only way out of here!

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         BETH
</b>               We can't.  The storm.  The waves would
               toss us around worse than we got
               down here.  And we have four days of
               decompression when we get up top.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Four days?

     She begins to put on her helmet, when she stops.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Maybe you should go.  To the sub.

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         BETH
</b>               You should know how it works.  Just

<b>                         BETH
</b>               I don't trust Harry to do it.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I would.  But my suit --

<b>                         BETH
</b>               I fixed your suit.

     She goes to it.  Brings it to him.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>                    (watching her closely)
               You fixed my suit?

<b>                         BETH
</b>               You press a button, Norman.  It's not
               brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You
               only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go
               on, Norman... 

     She hands him a BRIEFCASE, the tapes inside.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               ... I'll watch the sensors for you.

<b>     EXT.  UNDERWATER
</b>
     Norman drops to the bottom with the BRIEFCASE.  Lands on the ground.
     BREATHING.  Checks his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.  She must've fixed it.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               You're clear, Norman.

     He walks along, out from under the habitat.  Carefully, looking around.

<b>                         BETH (O.S.)
</b>               The sub's a 100 feet in front of

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I can't see anything.  How does it
               look?  Still clear?

<b>                         BETH (O.S.)
</b>               Still clear.

     Norman, hesitantly, ventures out.  The DARK WATER.  Looking around.
     Anything could be out here.  Walking.  WE HEAR him BREATHING.  His
     BREATHING gets shorter.  He looks at his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.

<b>                         BETH (O.S.)
</b>               What's the matter?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               You fixed this suit?
                    (no reply)
               Beth?

<b>                         BETH (O.S.)
</b>               Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just
               nervous.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               My air isn't... I'm coming back.

<b>                         BETH (O.S.)
</b>               You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes.
               You don't have time.

     His BREATHING is short, but managable.  He continues on.

     AHEAD OF HIM -- the DOME HANGER attached to a large, gray cylinder,
     forty feet high.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Still clear?

<b>                         BETH (O.S.)
</b>               Still clear.

     UNDERNEATH THE DOME HANGER -- Norman climbs up to the hatch DOOR.  Looks
     below him.  Nothing around him.  He SPINS the wheel, and pushes the
     HATCH OPEN.  Lifts himself up, awkwardly.  Grabs HANDHOLDS, and PULLS
     himself up into the POCKET OF AIR trapped inside the dome.

     THE SUB -- in front of him.  He finds the hatch, opens it, climbs inside
     the sub.

<b>     INT.  SUB
</b>
     Norman sits in the small seat.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I'm in.
                    (beat)
               Hello?

     No answer.  He bangs at his helmet... 

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Beth?

     He searches the sub's CONTROL PANEL.  Gadgets, switches, buttons.  Up
     top -- a flashing red-lit BUTTON: "TIMER HOLD".  Punches it.  It stops
     flashing, and a small screen glows: "TIMER RESET -- COUNT: 12:00:00".
     It begins counting backwards.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Beth?  Hello?

     No answer.  He looks at the Control Panel:

     A VIDEO SCREEN with the choices: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE,
<b>     SHUTDOWN... "
</b>
<b>     THUMP!
</b>
     The sub slightly SWAYS.

     Norman sits still, nervous.

     THUMP!  Harder this time.

     Norman looks through the GLASS WINDSHIELD.  Sweating.  Can't see
     anything in here.

     BANG!  It SWAYS faster, harder, back and forth.  He grips the seat.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Beth!  Beth!  There's something -- !

     THUMP!  BANG!  He's thrown around in the sub.  He can't see anything,
     tosses around.  He reaches for the doorhandle.

     BANG!  He looses grip, his legs fly up in the air.  The Sub almost turns
     over on it's side.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Beth!  Shit!

     His HELMET BANGS into the glass, WE SEE his look of terror.  Water
     SPLASHING up from below.

     Then, EVERYTHING stops.

     The sub SWAYS to a still.  He sits quietly.  Waiting.  Listening.

     Reaches for the doorhandle, cautiously climbs out.

     Stands on top of the sub.  Keeping balance.  He looks around, finds a
     DOOR inside the dome.  Tries to open it.  Locked.

     Looks around.  Nothing else.  Looks down at the water.  Can he risk it?
     His BREATHING short.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Beth?  Can you hear me?

     No reply.  He dips his leg slowly, quietly into the water.  Grimacing.
     Then, cautiously slips down into the water... 

<b>     EXT.  UNDERWATER
</b>
     CLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified.  Looking everywhere.  Searching.  Doesn't
     see anything.  Lands on the bottom.

     His LIFE SUPPORT BADGE beeping.  Shortness of BREATH.

     He walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger.  The DARK
     WATER.  Can't see anything.  Scared to death.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Beth?  Beth?  Shit.

     THE HABITAT -- ahead of him.

     Norman goes to a STANCHION.  Grips onto it.  Twists around.  Looking.
     Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  LIFE SUPPORT BADGE bleeping faster.
     Barely BREATHING.

<b>                         HARRY (O.S.)
</b>               ... you there?  Norman?

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         HARRY (O.S.)
</b>               Norman, where are you?

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         HARRY (O.S.)
</b>               You're clear.  You see the airlock?

     Norman, twists around, and as he does... 

<b>     A SEA SNAKE
</b>
     HISSES at his faceplate.  Norman SCREAMS.

     ON HIS HAND -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go.

<b>                         HARRY (O.S.)
</b>               Norman!

     Norman falls... looking up: The SNAKE wrapped around the STANCHION,
     slithering between the grid-like posts.

     THE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom.
     Backpeddaling on his arms and feet.  THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him.
     It's long TONGUE flicking at him, inches from his faceplate.  Norman
     backpeddaling, can't BREATHE, the SNAKE coming down on him, Norman
     falls on his back, the TONGUE WHIPPING across his faceplate, when... 

     NORMAN is whisked up.

     HARRY has him by the collar of his suit.  Taking him up.

<b>     INT.  AIRLOCK

     They burst out of the water.  Harry throws Norman onto the floor.
     Unhooks his helmet -- Norman BREATHES, fast and furious.

</b>               It's a pretty common place to look
               for food when you don't think you

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Did you look?  It was on the top
               shelf.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this

</b>               Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a

<b>                         BETH

               you get it?  There is something
               seriously fucked up going on here --
               and he's causing it.  Why can't you
               believe me?

     Norman now looks at the CUPBOARDS.  Goes to them.

     She comes to him.  He stands there, bewildered, scared, mind racing.

<b>                         BETH

     Norman paces, frantic almost, running his hands through his hair,
     trying to think.  Stops.  Turns to Beth.

     Harry is walking towards the Living Quarters... 

<b>                         NORMAN (O.S.)
</b>               Remember when we first spoke to
               Jerry, Barnes kept asking for
               Jerry's real name?  But Harry never
               would?  He didn't because he was
               afraid the screen would say "Harry",
               instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking
               to an alien intelligence when we
               talked to Jerry, we were talking to
               Harry... or a part of Harry.

<b>                         BETH (O.S.)
</b>               What do you mean, a part of Harry?

<b>     BACK IN -- CONTROL ROOM

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               When did the messages start?  The
               animals outside start showing up?
               After Harry came out of the sphere.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               You think, in the sphere --

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               He acquired some sort of power.  A
               power to manifest things.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               But how?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I don't know.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               How can the sphere do that?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the
               fucking alien that built the thing.
               But it can.  When Harry came out of
               the sphere, he mumbled something
               about page 87.  How he would never
               read that far -- he was too scared
               to.  Then you found the book,
               remember in your lab.  Then in the
               cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about
               a giant squid... 

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Which I told Barnes was attacking --

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               It's his fear.  The squid.  He's
               manifesting his fears.  Making them
               real.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               But why is he doing it?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               He must not realize he is.  Like the
               Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping
               then.  He must've manifested his
               dream.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               His dream?  You can't control your

</b>                    (shaking his head)
               No.  I mean, we've always believed we
               can think anything we want without
               consequences.  You ever read the
               Bible?
                    (off her look)
               It talks about our sinful nature,
               you know?  I mean, we can think, and
               believe, and desire whatever we
               want, but there's a part of us -- a
               shadow side, as Jung called it --
               that can't be controlled.  It's evil.
               It's inside us.  It's what we are.

     A FLASHING LIGHT on the Sensor Board.  Norman still doesn't know what

     Norman looks at the monitors:

     ON AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- a bright LIGHT blinds the SCREEN.  It's
     Beth in the sub, moving along the habitat.

     The Sub's CLAW ARMS carry large RED BOXES.  The lettering on the boxes

     It stops again, and releases another box.

     Norman BANGS on the headset.

     Norman WHIPS off his headset, bursts out of his seat, OPENS a CABINET.
     Searching for tapes.  Another cabinet.  Then another.

     A shelf labled: "SPHERE" -- all the tapes are gone.

     Norman stops.  Turns off the main lights.  The room goes dark.  The
     florescent LIGHT above the sinks stay on.

     Norman wheels Harry inside, places him by a wall.  Checks the IV.

     Norman goes to a STALL.  Steps inside.  Keeps the stall door open.  Can
     still see Harry about 10 feet away.

     Norman looks at the GUN.  COCKS it.  Pinches his finger.

<b>                         NORMAN

     He waits.  Listening.

<b>     A FAINT HIGH-PITCHED HISSING SOUND
</b>
     Norman looks over at the sinks.

     A FAUCET is on.  Water HISSING faintly from it.

     Norman ignores it.  Waiting in the dark.  Listening.

     ON THE FAUCET -- the water running.

     ON NORMAN -- looking at it.  Can't ignore it.  Tries.  But can't.

     Norman walks quietly through the inch of water on the floor.

<b>     OVER TO THE SINKS
</b>
     The light above them on.  Norman turns the faucet off.  The water stops.

     But the HISSING SOUND remains.

     Norman looks at the faucet, queerly.  Turns it back on.  Then off.

     The HISSING SOUND still there.  It isn't the water.

     Norman looks down at his feet... 

     THE FLOOR -- seems to be moving.  Something swimming in the water.

     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S PANTLEG -- a long, tubular SEA SNAKE slithers up
     inside his pantleg, HISSING.  His pants BULGING as the SNAKE slowly
     slides up past his knee.

<b>     HISSING LOUDER
</b>
     As more SNAKES comes through the crack in the wall.

     NORMAN watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the SNAKE
     slithers up to his groin, and across the inside of his shirt.

     Another SNAKE begins WRAPPING itself around the outside of Norman,
     sliding up around his neck.

<b>     WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COME FROM DOWN THE HALL
</b>
     NORMAN, standing still, watches as more SNAKES crawl up his sides,
     slithering around his arms, his shoulders, his neck, under his chin,
     over his face.  Their forked tongues FLICKING and HISSING.

<b>                         BETH (O.S.)
</b>               What time is it, Norman?

     NORMAN looking in the MIRROR -- as Beth comes up behind him in her
     jumpsuit.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Do you know the time?

     Norman GLARES at her in the mirror.  His body STIFF.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               I have to know the time of day,
               Norman.  Do you know?

     SNAKES covering his eyes, SLITHERING across his mouth.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>                    (through his teeth)
               Your watch.

     A SNAKE flicking it's tongue at Norman's lips.  Trying to get inside
     his mouth.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               What was that?  I couldn't hear you.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Your watch.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.

     She looks at her watch.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Splendid.

     She begins grabbing the SNAKES off of him, carefully dropping them to
     the ground.  SNAKES writhing in her hands, twisted around her wrists.
     Shakes them off.  Some drop in the sink.  She bends out of view -- and
     the SNAKE inside Norman's shirt, MOVES back down the way it came.

     Past his stomach, his groin.

     Norman HEAVES from his chest, VOMITS on the mirror... 

<b>                                                            CUT TO:

<b>     INT.  CAFETERIA
</b>
     CLOSE ON A POT -- pouring a white, milkish DRINK into a cup.

     Beth walks it over to Norman, sitting at a table, looking ill.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Isotonic glucose supplement.

     Norman looks at the cup.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Go ahead, drink it.

     Norman places the cup down.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               What's wrong, Norman?

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Are you?

     Beth takes a seat.  Stares at him.  A long beat.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               It's getting cold.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               You think I'd really drink that?

<b>                         BETH
</b>               You don't think I put something in

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               You put explosives around the

               put in a drink.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               I did do that, didn't I?

     A beat.  She picks up the drink, and begins sipping it.  Norman watches
     her.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               How do you feel about snakes?

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               You know what I mean.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Am I afraid of them?  Not during the
               day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When
               the sun's out, they don't bite.
               Fortunately for you, I had on my
               watch.
                    (off cup)
               This is quite good.

<b>                         NORMAN

               the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               You tell me.

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         NORMAN

</b>
<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Same reason I put explosives around
               the habitat.  For defense.  For the
               power.  To protect myself.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Against what?  Harry's unconscious.
               He's not a threat.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               No, he isn't.

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         BETH
</b>               No, he can't.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put
               out explosives?  Why manifest the
               snakes?

<b>                         BETH
</b>               You think I manifested the snakes?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Someone did.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me,
               Norman.
                    (beat)
               It was you.  You manifested the
               snakes.

     A long beat between them.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               C'mon -- what?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               You're lying --

</b>               Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you
               absolutely sure I'm lying?
                    (off his look)
               Then explain to me about the
               jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see
               jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear
               jellyfish.  You do.  They're your
               fear, aren't they?

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         BETH
</b>               And the snakes?  You want to know
               about the snakes?  You saw one
               outside earlier, didn't you?  When
               you thought I had deserted you --
               you were terrified.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>                    (realizing)
               That's when you went in the sphere.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               One lonely, terrifying sea snake.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               You manifested that, Beth.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Did I?  Or was that you?
                    (beat)
               When you were hiding in the bathroom
               -- all conspiratorially like you were
               -- you became frightened, didn't
               you?  Terrified.  Like you were with
               the snake earlier -- and suddenly
               you have snakes slithering all over
               the floor.  You did that, Norman.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               You're insane.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Am I?  Or am I making so much sense
               that you're going insane?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I never went in that sphere.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               You don't remember you did.  But I'm
               sure you remember running like some
               fucking hero to get Harry, don't
               you?  You remember that.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Yes.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               You remember before you picked him
               up -- when you looked up at the
               sphere, you remember that -- when
               the sphere opened?
                    (off his look)
               That's right.  But you can't remember
               going inside, can you?  No, of course
               not.  Harry couldn't either, could
               he?  "Like everything's on the tip of
               my tongue", he said.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               That's bullshit.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Is it?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Beth, the message said Harry.  "My
               name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman.
               But your younger brother -- what was
               his name?  The one who was stung when
               you were younger.  The one that died.
               The one you couldn't save.  What was
               his name?
                    (imitating)
               "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean
               -- to go swimming." "But I don't
               want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm
               scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be
               fine, it'll be fun."
                    (resuming)
               You heartless fuck.  That's why
               you're so scared of the water, isn't
               it?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Shut up, Beth --

<b>                         BETH
</b>               When you were in that sub -- and
               that squid was attacking you -- are
               you sure it was the squid that was
               attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get
               Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny
               sub on the bottom of the fucking
               ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all
               this water." Was it really the squid
               that was attacking you, Norman -- or
               was it something else -- one of your
               fears?  You never really saw what it
               was, did you?

     Norman stares up at her, frightened.  Is she right?

<b>                         BETH
</b>               I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I
               hope I'm not frightening you.  The
               last thing I want to do is frighten
               you.  You feel okay, don't you?

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't
               be.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               "It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It
               can't be.  I'm not doing anything."
               Just like Harry said before I
               stabbed him with the needle.

     Norman looks at her palm -- SEES the NEEDLE in her hand.  Norman backs
     up, away.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Don't, Beth.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               But I have to, Norman.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I promise --

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Beth --

<b>                         BETH
</b>               You think I'd belive you?  Believe
               anything you might say now?  After
               you lied to me about telling Barnes
               about my past.  About my problems.  My
               problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Don't, Beth.  Please.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               It's either this... or I kill you.

     The GUN in her other hand.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Beth --

     She comes at him, needle in hand... 

<b>                         BETH
</b>               It's your choice.  Because it's not
               safe for you to be awake.  To be
               walking around.  To be thinking about
               things.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               It's not safe for you to be either.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               You think I care?  You think I care
               if I die?
                    (almost laughing)
               Would I put explosives around the
               habitat -- set on vibration sensors
               -- that can trigger automatically,
               if I cared about myself?  Would I?
               I've tried twice before, Norman, why
               wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not
               thinking about myself -- No, Norman,
               I'm thinking about you.  Your safety.
               Protecting you from your own self.

     She lunges at him with the needle, missing.  He RUNS for the SPIRAL
     STAIRCASE leading to the lab.  Norman grabs the handrail, begins
     climbing the stairs.

     Beth's at his feet, grabbing for his ankles.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Norman!  I'm doing this for you,
               Norman.

     He frantically crawls up the stairs, her grasping at his heels.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Norman.

     Climbing, climbing -- round and round -- the STAIRS never seem to end.
     He looks up:

     THE STAIRS -- expanding in front of him, strangely increasing in
     number.  He climbs, racing, PANTING.  Beth, right behind him, laughing
     almost.

<b>                         BETH
</b>               Come here, Norman.

     She GRABS his ANKLE.  She raises the NEEDLE.  Norman turns, KICKS her in
     the FACE.

     She WAILS, blood SPITTING from her nose.

     Climbing, climbing.  The STAIRS increasing above.  He LUNGES for the top
     step, GRABS it.  Pulls himself up... 

<b>     INTO THE LAB
</b>
     Scrambling.  He stares down at Beth -- the GUN pointing at him.

     holds the DOOR closed.  Trying to regain his breath.

     level.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Turn off the water, Beth.

     Norman frantically checking for a crack, a leak.

               You're doing it.

     It's up to his waist.  He climbs on top a lab bench.  Puts his hands to
     his temples, straining.  WE HEAR Beth laughing.

     A SPECIMEN BOTTLE -- EXPLODES right next to him.

<b>                         BETH (O.S.)

     Another BOTTLE SHATTERS, shooting fragments of glass across the room.

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>     SHATTER!  CRACK!

     Bottles floating in the water POP!  The water too high -- Norman
     swimming in it now, keeping afloat.  His FACE strains from the
     pressure.  He looks at the CAMERA in the corner... 

<b>                         BETH (O.S.)

     Next to the CAMERA, he SEES the HATCH DOOR in the ceiling.

</b>               Don't even think it.  You don't have

     He reaches up at the door.  Can't get it.  The water rising.  He DIVES
     down in the water... 

<b>     UNDERWATER
</b>
     He swims to a cabinet near the floor, OPENS it, searches, THINGS
     floating out -- AN OXYGEN CYLINDER and MASK -- he GRABS it.

               Don't you get it?  It's over.

     He BREATHES a last breath, reaches up to the ceiling HATCH DOOR, SPINS
     it.

     His body upside down, his hand holding onto the frame.  He grabs a PIPE
     next to it, pulls himself hand over hand, along the pipe.

     HIS FACE -- straining from the freezing chill.

     MOVING along the pipe, hand over hand.  He loses grip.  His body thrusts
     upwards.

     CLOSE ON HIS RIGHT HAND -- purple, frozen, holding onto the pipe.
     Barely gripping.

     HIS FACE -- his eyes fluttering.  He blows air from his mouth, BUBBLES
     burst from his lips.

     HIS BODY slightly descending.

     HIS LEFT HAND -- grips the pipe.  He continues on.

     HAND OVER HAND.  Pulling himself... 

<b>     UNDER THE HABITAT
</b>
     He SEES the airlock in front of him.

     He SCOOTS along, but slower, now.  He stops.  Can't continue.  He clasps
     his hand to his CHEST, it's burning.  He SEES the airlock.  His eyes
     fluttering, he's losing consciousness.  He can't do it.  And he lets go
     of the pipe.

     FLOATING UPWARDS -- is he gone?

     HIS HEAD -- BANGS into the habitat floor.  His body flat underneath it.
     Being sucked upwards against it.

     He pushes forward... trying to grab the floor with his hands.  He's
     inches from the airlock.

     Plants his feet against the wall -- and pushes forward.  His body
     SUCKED UP and away...

     are like ice.  Can't hold it.  He slips.

     Flailing in the water.

     He HEAVES his chest over the METAL RIM.  Twists his legs around, out of
     the water, and flops his body onto the deck.

     Shivering.

     Tries to get up.  Falls over.  His body shaking.  His lips purple.  His
     eyes barely open, looking at... 

     HIS JUMPSUIT -- hanging on the wall.

     Norman crawls toward the suit, his body shaking violently.  He reaches
     out for his boots on the floor.  Can't grip them.  Inches his HEAD
     toward his suit, tries to BITE at his suit, but his TEETH chattering.

     Goes to the outside of a WALL.  Looking for a CRACK, a LEAK, a way in.

     TO HIS LEFT -- Barnes' body, floating, hooked to the wall.

     Climbing inside.  Struggling through the CRACK, careful not to rip his

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               I could hit her a little harder.
               More toward the cranium.

     Norman stares at the NUMBERS on the SCREEN above him.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               If she's still conscious, you can't
               fight her.  You can't stop the

               would've found great pleasure in
               bashing your head in.

     Norman RIPS off a piece of her t-shirt, ties it to the wound around
     her head.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Fine.

     Harry does.

     Harry, in his suit now, helps Norman slip on Beth's boots and

               Harry!  I'm gonna have to lift her up
               to you.

     Harry leans down from the Sub's airlock... 

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Alright.  Hurry.

     Norman pushes her up to him, but she bends at the waist.

     Norman flops her up in the air, but she bends again at the waist.

     Norman flops her up once more, and Harry grabs her AIR HOSE.

<b>                         HARRY

     Harry pulls her toward the airlock, Norman climbs up after.

<b>     INT.  SUB AIRLOCK

     The pocket of air around the sub.  The three of them crammed inside.
     Norman opens the door on top of the sub.

</b>               Alright, here, I'll... wait, you --
               just give her to me.

     Norman takes Beth and pushes her on top the sub.  The sub sways back
     and forth.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Norman, what are you --

     They lose balance, Beth almost falls, Norman catches her.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Shit.  Alright, Harry, get in there.

     Harry jumps on top of the sub.  Slides inside it.  Reaches his arms out,
     catching Beth's legs.

     Harry pulls Beth down inside, as Norman steps on top of the sub, helps
     push Beth's head inside.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Get her out of the seat, I need room

     Norman drops inside.

     Norman in the seat.  Beth's leg hangs over his right shoulder.  Harry
     looks at Norman who assesses the flight controls.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               You know how to work this thing?

<b>                         NORMAN

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Shut up.  Let me think.

     Norman presses a button.

     THE SCREEN -- blinks: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE, SHUTDOWN... "

     Norman hits "ASCEND".  The Sub WHIRRS, RUMBLES and drops down below.

     Norman works the steering wheel, gliding it upwards.

<b>     EXT.  UNDERWATER

     The SUB comes out from under the dome.  Rising above the habitat...

</b>               It's not fast enough, Norman.
               There's a helluva lot of explosive
               down there.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Maybe.  Brace yourself.

     Harry just stares at Norman.  Norman grabs Beth, trying to stablilize
     her.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>                    (off Norman's suit)

<b>                         NORMAN

               Why are you laughing?  You don't even

<b>                         HARRY

               laughing.

     Harry laughs.

     Ascending... waiting... and then... 

     A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION below them... 

     Rocking the sub, spinning it up and around, surging it upwards to the
     surface.

     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- RACING toward the surface, toward the
     SUNLIGHT -- it's BLINDING -- and the screen GOES WHITE.

<b>                         BETH

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Won't make any difference.  The tapes

     A long beat.

<b>                         NORMAN

               anybody knew time travel through a

               all knew -- then we would all have
               to die before we could tell anyone.
               Death was the only logical
               explanation.  But sitting here, we
               still know.  So how is that possible?

<b>                         ADMIRAL

<b>                         BETH
</b>               A squid?  I don't remember anything
