          MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of
          any physically intimidating attributes masks a very
          complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye
          contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you
          or to himself.

          ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door face
          that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the
          conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there
          and her politeness is about to be tested.

          The scene is stark and simple.

          personal uniform that we'll come to understand. And while it
          may take us a while to notice it, MARK's a different person in
          these flash-forward scenes. Still tortured and complicated,
          but comfortable now with his own power.
          His lawyer is SY, who's accompanied by some junior associates,
          one of whom--a pleasant, pretty and professional young
          contemporary of Mark's named MARYLIN, we'll get to know.
           On the other side are EDUARDO and his lawyer, GRETCHEN, also
          a. â¢ mpanied by some associates. A STENOGRAPHER is typing the
          recor..
          The room is glass on two sides and through the windows we can
          see the behemoths of Silicon valley--Oracle, SunMicrosystems,
          Google, etc.
          GRETCHEN is taking MARK's deposition.

          People are stretching and getting coffee and talking quietly.

          MARX is in his Operating Systems class. This is considered the
          hardest class at Harvard and MARK is one of the 50 students
          with their laptops open as the professor takes them through an
          impossibly difficult lesson,

<b>                         PROFESSOR
</b>          So let's look at a sample problem:
          Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-
          bit virtual address and a page size of
          256 bytes.
          A GIRL scribbles something on a piece of paper. Then hands it
          to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed
          over to MARK. While that's happening--

<b>                         PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
</b>          The system uses one-level page tables,
          which start at address 0x0400. Maybe you
          want to have DMA. on your 16-bit system,
          who knows? The first few pages are
          reserved for hardware flags, etc.
          MARK opens the note., It reads "Asshole".
          He looks over and sees a couple of GIRLS looking at him with
          contempt.

<b>                         PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
</b>          Assume page table entries have eight
          status bits.
          MARK closes his laptop, gets up and starts to head out of the
          hall.

<b>                         PROFESSOR (CONT'D)

          SEAN steps over to AMY's pink laptop and hits a key to wake it
          out of sleep mode.
          The shower starts running in the bathroom.
          The laptop springs to life and is open to something SEAN's
          never seen before--a Facebook page.;
          He sees AMY's picture and a short profile: Her major at
          Stanford, courses she's taking, books she likes, clubs she's a.

          The President's office is in one of the two oldest university

          She looks at them and the boys give her a polite smile and a
          small nod before she goes back to her work.

          MARK is standing on the roof of this small, campus-area house
          as LOUD MUSIC plays. A ziï¿½'line is tied from the chimney and
          runs down over a small swimming pool where it's attached to a
          telephone pole on the other side.
          MARK grabs onto the handle that's connected to the zip line
          and flies out over the pool, jumping in with a splash and
          cheers from DUSTIN and the INTERNS who are waiting their turns
          on the roof.
          DUSTIN pulls the handle back up with_a rope that's been
          rigged, grabs the handle, takes off and jumps into the pool-to
          similar cheers.
          The handle gets pulled back on a rope, an INTERN grabs it,

</b>
          we're looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight
          stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of
          Henley, England--founded in 1179.
          And after a moment of placid quiet--

<b>                         ---BOOSHI
</b>          Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for
          the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and
          prestigious Henley Royal Regatta.
          The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The
          port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the
          Ilollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a
          pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the "H" of
          Harvard.
          We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing
          section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot
          -- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n
          blazers and brightly colored floral ties.
          But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just
          their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural.
          straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half
          torture test against the best competition they've ever faced.
          And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the
          Dutch.
          The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of
          them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late.
          Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving
          the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of
          Americans.

          we'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next
          to him is their mother, who can barely watch.
          Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice
          through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and
          there's still no daylight between them.
          We see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON's left hand begin
          to stream down his arm.
          25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy--
          even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups
          the closest race in the history of the competition. The 'ATH_PT'ï¿½
          is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed--
          the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.
          The blood that's covering CAMERON's left arm is being diluted
          by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig,
          and pull, and pull, and pull, and---

<b>          POP!
</b>          --the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of
          the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.
          CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch
          group holding a giant flag and.jumping up and down. The
          Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.
          The two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug
          as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.
          The MOTHER drops her head-and looks down. The FATHER refuses
          to look away.

          there's more money in being your lawyer.
          What happened to Sean?

<b>                         MAIM
</b>          He cashed out most of his stock. Hey
          listen, all you had all day was that
          salad. You want to get something to eat?

<b>                         MARYLIN
</b>          I can't.

</b>          Sy and the rest of them are at the Palm
          having a steak. Then they'll come back, up
          to the office and start working on a
          settlement agreement to present to you.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          They're gonna want to settle?

<b>                         MARYLIN
</b>          Oh yeah. And you're gonna have to pay
          some bonus money too.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Why?

<b>                         MARYLIN
</b>          'Cause you're gonna need these guys to
          sign a non-disclosure agreement and
          you're gonna need to be indemnified. They
          say one unflattering word about you in
          public and you own their house, wife and
          kids.

</b>          I'm talking about what a jury'll see.
          .That's what I do, that's what I'm doing
          here. I'm trying to specialize in voir
          dire--jury selection. Clothes, hair,
          wedding ring, speaking style, likability--

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Likability?

<b>                         MARYLIN
</b>          I've been licensed to practice law for
          all of-20 months and I could get a jury
          to believe you planted the story about
          Eduardo. You know how? Just by asking the
          question. Watch. Why weren't you at the
          sorority party that night?

<b>                         MARK
</b>          You think I'm the one who called the
          police?

<b>                         MARYLIN -
</b>          Doesn't matter, I asked the question and
          now everybody's thinking about it. You
          lost the jury in the first 10 minutes.

          the computer for a minute?

</b>          No. There's a night guy downstairs. Stay
          as long as you want.

          and exits.

          MARK sits down at the computer. He logs on to Facebook.
          He -types a name in the-search box: "Erica Albright".
          Erica's name and picture come up, along with Boston
          University, '07. Mark smiles. She's on Facebook.

          He moves the mouse back and forth between two boxes: "Send a
          Message." and "Add as a Friend".

          He clicks on "Add as a Friend".

          A box comes up that reads: "Your request to add Erica Albright
          as a friend has been sent."

          Then MARK clicks to his homepage and waits for the response.
          And waits...
