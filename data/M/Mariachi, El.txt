<b>EXT. A JAIL IN MEXICO - DAY
</b>
It's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an
unpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder
blocks. The camera pans with the OFFICER as he exits his car
and walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue JAIL HOUSE.
He is carrying a greasy bag of fast food.

<b>INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY
</b>
The Officer enters the lobby, tosses the bag of food to his
PARTNER who is sitting at a desk. He grabs a tin cup and
walks over to barred entrance to Block A. Twenty or so
CRIMINALS, from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping
peacefully in their cell on Block A. The Officer rattles the
tin cup between the entrance bar.

<b>INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY
</b>
The inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit
up. The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the
block which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, and
one bigger cell that faces the block entrance. The sound of
scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the
cell. It is AZUL jottin ginto a business ledger while
chatting on his cellular phone. His cell is equipped with a
small desk and a refridgerator. He hangs up the phone and
continues writing.

<b>INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY
</b>
The Officer with the tin cup sits in a couch across from his
partner, who is now eating, and reads a magazine.

<b>INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY
</b>
Azul picks up his phone and makes another call. He talks
business. In the other cell, prisoners are getting up and
looking around. Azul hangs up the phone and writes.

<b>EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY
</b>
A gorgeous, bikini-clad BABE struts slowly into a tighly
framed glamour shot. She pauses, takes a deep breath, then
dives a 'perfect ten' dive into a house-side moat. She swims
long, slow motion strokes around the moat as the camera
tracks alonside her, lovingly admiring her tan lines and
hydrodynamic build. She slides out of the water and walks up
a cobble stone walk, dripping as she passes a seated
GENTLEMAN in a white suit. His face is unrevealed. As she
enters the house, he sets his drink down by a phone. He lifts
up the receiver and dials.

</b>


<b>INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY
</b>
Azul's phone rings. He looks up at it, startled, as if no one
has ever called him before. He glances at his watch, and then
back at the phone, hesitating to answer it. He looks around
the cell block as if someone might be playing a trick on him.
Finally he answers it, pausing before saying hello. It is El
Moco.

<b>                    MOCO (V.O.)
</b>          Good morning, Azul. Do you know who this
          is?

<b>                    AZUL
</b>              (into phone)
          Moco... What the hell do you want after
          all these years?

<b>EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY
</b>
MOCO is sitting on his porch drinking tequila.

<b>                    MOCO
</b>              (into phone)
          We've got a lot to talk about. I'm just a
          few town away with a whole new gang. I
          heard you were nearby so I thought I'd
          give you a call, amigo.

<b>                    AZUL (V.O)
</b>          That's sweet of you, asshole. I don't
          suppose you could get me out of there,
          and then maybe hand me over my share of
          money.

<b>                    MOCO
</b>              (into phone)
          Yes, I figured you'd want your money, my
          friend. That is why I have called you. I
          heard you were getting out soon, and
          figured I should deal with our situation.
          But do you really need me to help you get
          out? From what I hear, you're running
          quite a business out of your cell with a
          phone and some loyal men. It keeps you
          well protected I hear. Not a bad idea. I
          may try that myself sometime.

<b>                    AZUL (V.O.)
</b>          I could stay in here and earn peanuts
          compared to what you owe me if I were to
          get out. So, yes, I want you to help
          me... my friend.

          Soon my friend, soon. I'm sending you
          some people in a few days to get you.

<b>                    AZUL (V.O.)
</b>          Really? Well, that's more like it. Just
          like the Moco I used to know.

Azul is walking towards his window at the sound of a truck
racing in.

<b>                    MOCO
</b>              (into phone)
          Just hang in there my friend. I won't
          forget that you have been a big part of
          our success. What's wrong.

<b>EXT. JAIL - DAY
</b>
A large truck drives up to the jail, parking beside the
police car. Two tall, well-dressed MEN step out. They reach
into the cab and pull out machine guns. They walk briskly
towards the jail.

<b>INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY
</b>
Azul walks to his toilet and stands on it to see out his
barred window.

<b>                    AZUL
</b>              (into phone)
          There's something going on outside. Is
          this a double surprise? Are you getting
          me out today, Moco?

There is no response from Moco.

<b>INT. JAIL - DAY
</b>
The Guard reading the magazine stands when he sees someone
approaching the door.

<b>EXT. JAIL - DAY
</b>
Close tracking shot of guns as Tall Men open the door and
enter the jail.

<b>INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY
</b>
Azul looks out of the jail cell suspiciously. Peering down
the hall, he sees the guys with the guns. He hides behind the
wall, peering out to see what happens next.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              4.
</b>


<b>INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY
</b>
The Tall Men walk right up to the guard, and hand him a huge
wad of money. The Guard tosses the money to his partner
(still eating), then turns to unlock the block entrance bars.

<b>INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY
</b>
Azul puts the receiver back up to his mouth.

<b>                     AZUL
</b>              (into phone)
          There are two men here with guns. Did you
          send them?

<b>EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY
</b>
Moco, glancing at his watch, hangs up.

<b>INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY
</b>
Azul hangs up the phone and kicks his Bodyguard awake. The
Bodyguard gets up and peers out the bars as Azul hides in a
corner.

<b>INT. TALL MEN IN HALL - DAY
</b>
The Tall Men walk steady and alert, ready to kill. They enter
Azul's block and scope out the cells.

The Bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun
from under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the
sink. He stands ready to fight.

The Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat
cautious. They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he
sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them
before they can react. The shot one stumbles back into his
buddy's arms. Azul's Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his
cell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet them.
The Tall Men hear the sound of the other cells opening, so
they turn around. The other prisoners on the block begin
exiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov cocktails. The
Tall Man drops his gun. Finally, Azul exits his cell carrying
his phone. The Bodyguard forces the Tall Men into an empty
cell, closing and locking the door.

Azul presses the #-button on his phone. Moco's phone number
is automatically redialed.

Moco answers.

          I'm still here, Moco. And so are your
          little friends. But not for long. They
          have something they want to scream to
          you. Listen close, because you're going
          to repeat it to me when I come to visit
          you.

<b>INT. TALL MEN IN CELL - DAY
</b>
The cellmates throw their Molotov cocktails into the cell.
Moco hears the men screaming as they burn to death. Azul is
holding the phone at arm's length into the cell.

<b>INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY
</b>
The Guards exchange glances when they hear the screaming,
they smile and shrug, then go back to what they were doing.
As Azul and his Bodyguards exit the block, the Guard with the
magazine stands up as if to stop them, but Azul tosses him a
wad of money and the guard sits back down to count it.

<b>EXT. JAIL - DAY
</b>
A blue truck races towards the jail.

Azul exits the jail carrying a shotgun. His Bodyguards get
inside the Tall Men's truck and start it. Azul waits
patiently for his blue truck.

As the blue truck pulls up, two little rat-like VATOS exit
the blue truck, one handing Azul a guitar case. Azul tosses
it onto the hood. The Bodyguards wave as they drive away.
Azul waves back. He opens the case, revealing an arsenal of
weaponry. Azul notices one piece is missing. One Rat quickly
pulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in
the case. Azul is unamused. He grabs his MAC-10 machine gun
from the guitar case and aims it at the thieving Rat's head.

Suddenly, the Guard bolts out the jail waving the wad of
money, as if complaining.

Azul turns his MAC-10 onto the Guard instead. A few blasts
later Azul and his rats pack up and go as the Guard twitches
helplessly on the ground, still clutching the money in his
bloody hand.

<b>CREDIT SEQUENCE EXT. AZUL / MARIACHI ON HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
The blue truck barels down the highway and the camera pans
with the truck as it passes a hitchhiker, MARIACHI, standing
in the sun with a thumb in the air.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>
The truck    passes him up so he continues walking. Mariachi is
carrying    a guitar case in one hand and a black jacket in the
other. He    is wearing a white T-shirt, black pants. The camera
pans to a    sign that reads "ACUÑA 18 miles".

<b>EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
</b>
Mariachi is walking around downtown Acuña. He notices a bar
across the street and, liking the way it looks, he puts on
his jacket and crosses over to it. He stops to read a sign on
the building that says "MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS ONLY". He
prays silently to himself before confidently walking inside.

<b>INT. CORONA CLUB - DAY
</b>
Mariachi enters the club, greeting the PATRONS    as ge makes
his way to the bar. No one seems to greet him    back. He sits
on a barstool near some OTHER DRINKERS, laying    his guitar
case down lovingly beneath his stool. He looks    around the
place, as if sizing it up.

<b>                       BARTENDER
</b>             What do you want to drink?

<b>                          MARIACHI
</b>             Refresco.

The other drinkers stare at him.

Glancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table-
shaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room.

Sitting directly behind him are four mean-looking dudes.
Mariachi is served his drink.

<b>                       MARIACHI (CONT'D)

             Why?

<b>                       MARIACHI
</b>             I'm a mariachi. A good one. I play
             beautiful ballads, old classic ballads,
             on an old-fashioned guitar.

<b>                          BARTENDER

<b>                    MARIACHI
</b>          I could add a little class to this place.
          I work for fairly cheap, I live mostly
          off tips. But I need steady work, and I
          can guarantee bringing in more customers.

<b>                     BARTENDER
</b>              (nodding)
          Tell me, why would I need one little
          guitar player when I've already got a
          full band?

Mariachi gives him a silent "what" look.

The BARTENDER motions to a YOUNG MAN sitting near the small
draped table.

The Young Man removes the drape revealing a keyboard. Puts on
his mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and
rubs his fingers together (as if warming up for the big
show). He hits a few switches in EXTREME CLOSEUP as...

... Mariachi adjusts himself to the seat.

The Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds
like an accordion, pulsing out a beat. He then presses
another switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and
waltzes the familiar riffs. He adds the string and horns
accents by banging on the keys. He sounds awful.

Mariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the Bartender
who seems to enjoy it.

The Keyboard Mariachi finishes his song, sits back down.

<b>                    BARTENDER (CONT'D)
</b>              (nodding with satisfaction)
          There you see? Either I can pay one guy
          to sound like a full mariachi band...

Mariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his
full drink. He looks disappointed.

<b>                    BARTENDER (CONT'D)
</b>          ... or I could spend the same money only
          get one little guitar player...
          Understand?

<b>                    MARIACHI
</b>              (walking away)
          Thank you, sir.

<b>                    BARTENDER

          musical instrument.

The Bartender picks up the bottle of soda pop Mariachis left
behind and offers it to the other men on the table. They say
no, pay, and leave. The Bartender offers it to the MEAN DUDES
at the table.

They all shake their heads no.

The Bartender shrugs and dumps it.

<b>EXT. CORONA CLUB - DAY
</b>
Mariachi walks out and looks up and down the street. He
decides to walk south.

As he walks down the sidewalk, the camera pans into a CLOSEUP
of another guitar case that is moving towards the Corona
Club. The camera falls back a little revealing the backside
of Azul, dressed also in black. Azul walks into the bar.

<b>INT. CORONA CLUB - DAY
</b>
Azul enters the bar, notices to his left the table with the
four mean-looking Dudes, drinking and eating chips and salsa.

The oldest one, with his back to Azul, takes a sip from his
mixed drink, then stands and excuses himself to the restroom.

<b>INT. BATHROOM - OLD MEAN DUDE - DAY
</b>
The Old Mean Dude walks into the first stall and sits down.

<b>INT. CORONA CLUB - AZUL - DAY
</b>
The three remaining Dudes notice Azul's guitar case. So does
the Bartender. They all look at each other and laugh.

<b>                    BARTENDER
</b>              (laughing and rolling his eyes)
          What the hell is this, mariachi day?
          There is no work for you here!

Azul walks the mean Dude's table. Their laughing quiets down
a bit as Azul stands before them. The Bartender stops
smiling.

<b>                    AZUL

fill up at the tap.

          In a bottle, wey.

Bartender stops filling the beer, stares at the half-full
glass for a moment, then drinks the beer.

Azul is staring at the three Mean Dudes. They stare back.

The Bartender slaps the unopened bottle down at the counter.

<b>                    BARTENDER
</b>          Ready.

Azul doesn't pay attention to him.

<b>                    AZUL
</b>          I'm looking for an old friend of mine.
          His name is... Moco. Do you know where I

<b>MAIN MEAN DUDE
</b>
You can sometimes find him here. He owns this place.

<b>                    AZUL

<b>MAIN MEAN DUDE
</b>
We work for him.

<b>                    AZUL
</b>          That's too bad.

Azul turns to the mean Dude sitting to his left, and places
the guitar in his hands. The Mean Dude is confused.

<b>                    AZUL (CONT'D)
</b>          Hold it please.

Azul opens the case and pulls out the MAC-10. The other two
Mean Dudes are already reaching for their pistols.

The Bartender ducks beneath the counter.

Azul fires a million bullets into two of the Mean Dudes, (the
other is holding the case in shock). Their chests explode,
causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly
everywhere.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>
The Mean Dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear. He
manages to look up at Azul, who is watching the Mean Dudes
die a slow, bloody death. The barrel of the MAC-10 is
smoking. Azul turns slowly to the Mean Dude holding the case.
Azul aims his MAC-10 in the Dude's face. Still frozen holding
the case, he spends his last moments looking down the gun's
barrel.

<b>INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
The shots caused Old Mean Dude to peer out from his stall as
the toilet paper fell to the ground and started to roll
across the floor. He now watches it roll as more shots ring
out. He pulls up his pants and and walks toward the door
slowly. He is sweating profusely. He slowly picks up the
toilet paper, plotting his next move. It grows silent... He
takes a deep breath and rushes out the door.

<b>INT. CORONA CLUB MAIN ROOM - DAY
</b>
The Old Dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper
in his hand, and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face.

The Bartender rises up from behind the counter.

The camera dollies slowly by the dead Dudes. Their blood-
bathed faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions. The
camera continues to dolly to the one dead Dude still holding
the guitar case. His face is a bloody pulp. The camera stops
dollying to the old Dude's mixed drink. A hand is stirring it
with a straw. The camera pans up the arm to reveal Azul,
standing expressionless with his gun sling over his shoulder.

Shot at 16fps the Old Dude quickly drops the toilet paper and
runs back inside the bathroom.

Azul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another
weapon. He grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm
like a waiter, then casually follows the Old Dude into the
bathroom.

The Bartenders glance at each other. One pours a shot glass
full of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it. Shots
ring out and the Bartender spills the drink over himself.

Without warning Azul bursts from the bathroom and walks
calmly to his case. He replaces the weapon, picks up the case
and leaves.

A few seconds pass before the bartender grabs the phone and
furiously dials.

The door bursts open as Azul reenters, storming to the bar.

The Bartender is so petrified he doesn't think to drop the
phone.

Azul walks right up to the Bartender.

The Bartender shuts his eyes. The sound of the beer bottle
popping open canbe heard, along with the sound of thirsty
guzzling. The Bartender opens his eyes to Azul.

CLOSEUP of the empty bottle slamming to the counter.

The Bartender glances down at the bottle.

CLOSEUP of Azul tossing a few coins near the bottle as
payment. Azul leaves.

A few seconds pass as the Bartender is standing there. You
hear Moco yelling into the receiver asking what's going on.

Moco is on the porch trying to get the Bartender to answer
him.

bull on the floor beside him.

glances down at the PIT BULL lying on the floor.

Pit bull?

</b>            Yeah, pit bull.

The line is picked up and Mean Dude talks into the phone. He
pulls out a piece of paper from his coat pocket and places it
on the counter. He begins jotting down four names. He then
slowly crosses their names out.

laugh as they ready to shoot him. Mariachi, though, already

          have to die on your porch?

Mariachi shakes her hand.

<b>                    MARIACHI
</b>          Thank you. I'll never forget this.

He tries to kiss her hand. She slides it away and
effortlessly slaps him.

<b>                       DOMINO
</b>          This way.

He follows her to a doorway revealing an unlit staircase.
When he enters, the darkness swallows him as she shuts the
door behind him.

There is a free-standing porcelain tub in the center of the
room. Mariachi places his guitar halfway between the entrance
and the tub. The camera is tracking backwards with him as he
walks, making th room look endless. He removes his jacket as
he makes his way to the tub. He drops his jacket onto the
floor and gently climbs into the tub. The camera faces him as
he settles back. The camera slowly dollies into him as he
lays back, crosses his fingers, and gives a relaxed smile.

<b>INT. AMADEUS - DAY
</b>
Domino is washing a glass. She the then remembers she has the
gun in her waist belt, so she removes it and sticks it back
under the counter. Wounded Mean Dude #5 comes in limping. She
takes out a towel and drops it on the counter.

<b>                    MEAN DUDE #5
</b>          Good morning, Domino.

She brings up the phone and sets it down where the cloth was.
He picks up the cloth and wraps his arm with it.

Domino smiles and pours him half a beer mug with tequila. He
laughs and drinks. As he's dialing, the camera is on Domino
as she cleans up a few things, every once in a while glancing
upstairs.

          Moco, he got away. Shot me in the arm.
          Killed La Palma. Pepino, Sunday. This guy
          is one slick maricon. Yeah. Also, I
          didn't get a look at him. So, unless he's
          still carrying that guitar around and
          hasn't changed clothes, I won't even spot
          him, and I don't think he'll be that

          it's that he'll always wear black and
          he'll always carry that guitar with him.
          It's his signature. Besides, that's not a
          guitar he's carrying. It's a guitar case
          full of weapons. Find him.

Mean Dude hangs up and puts his head in his hands.

<b>                    DOMINO
</b>          Maybe he loves his guitar. It's probably
          an antique.

He is about to walk off with the bloody towel and he turns
back pointing at it. She waves her hand at him, as if
granting him permission to take it. She cleans his glass, and
when he is gone she slams the glass down and runs for the
stairs. A few seconds later she comes back into the bar,
grabs the gun from under the counter and calls her assistant
to watch the bar. He sees the gun and wonders what she's up
to. She storms upstairs.

<b>INT. DOMINO'S LOFT - DAY
</b>
Domino opens the door abruptly and finds Mariachi taking a
bath. He bolts upright, pulls a towel up from the floor and
sits frozen waiting for Domino's next move. She laughs and
walks to the counter.

<b>                    DOMINO
</b>              (friendly)
          I thought I told you not to touch

<b>                    MARIACHI
</b>              (laying back, closed eyes)
          Yes, please.

Domino turns to a counter and her smile fades. She looks like
she wants to rip Mariachi's throat out with her teeth. She
puts the gun down on the counter. She finds an omnious-
looking knife and then grabs a bottle of shampoo. She walks
over to him, then pulls the knife up to his throat with one
hand while grabbing his hair with the other. He opens his
eyes wide. The shampoo hits the floor and begins to roll.

<b>                    DOMINO

The shampoo bottle rolls into the guitar case and stops.
Domino sees this, and with her foot reaches out and pulls the
case toward her.

<b>                    DOMINO
</b>          What do you have in here? GUNS? KNIVES?

Mariachi tries to catch his breath, pausing before answering
her as if wondering if all this is really happening.

<b>                    MARIACHI
</b>          No! My guitar!

Domino slides her foot out of her shoe, and unsnaps one of
the latches with her toe.

<b>                    DOMINO
</b>          We'll see...

She unsnaps another. The latches snap loud and echo in the
quiet room. Mariachi gasps as she tightens her grip.

<b>                    DOMINO (CONT'D)
</b>          You're very modest, Mariachi...

She squeezes his hair and unsnaps another latch.

<b>                    DOMINO (CONT'D)
</b>              (through gritted teeth)
          You told me you killed four men, when you
          really killed seven. Or were they still
          breathing even after you shot out their
          hearts?

Another latch snaps.

<b>                    MARIACHI

She lifts the lid with her foot. It seems an eternity before
the case is fully open. Domino is looking into the case, but
Mariachi is not. He knows what's in there.

Slow dolly into the case, which contains a white, well-kept
classical guitar. Domino is seeing it, and for a moment she
almost believes he is telling the truth.

She rushes to it, grabs the guitar and tosses it to Mariachi.
He catches it, choking after she releases the blade. She is
on the other side of the tub, now. She jams the knife down
between Mariachi's legs. Mariachi's eyes bug.

<b>                     DOMINO

<b>                    MARIACHI

          W...w...what?

Domino shoves the knife in deeper and Mariachi grimaces
horribly.

<b>                    DOMINO
</b>          Play it, damnit, play something sweet!!!

Mariachi is sweating and his face is extremely red. He pauses
for a long time before plucking an odd note. She squints as
if she's caught him. But he eventually starts picking out a
sweet little melody.

<b>                    DOMINO (CONT'D)
</b>              (growing impatient)

<b>SING!
</b>
Mariachi starts to sing but chokes on the words. He starts
over, playing a "Rancho Grande" sounding song with his own
made up words.

<b>                    MARIACHI
</b>              (in a high sweet voice)
          What is this place? That treats me like a

          their butts... Even this beautiful girl,
          With a knife to my balls, Should I kiss
          her or hit her... Or both?

He finishes his song, bowing and thanking his imaginary
audience. Domino is smiling. She pulls the knife slowly out
of the water and wipes it off on her apron.

She gets up slowly, and turns to leave. Mariachi settles
back, smiling triumphantly. Suddenly she darts around and
slams the knife between his legs again with a furious look on
her face. He bolts up out of this triumphant daze with a look
of complete shock. She loosens up and laughs.

She flings her knife aside. It sticks into a wall. She
shrugs, smiles a beautiful smile, turns, and goes downstairs.
Mariachi settles back down, closing his eyes. The knife slips
out of the wall and clangs to the ground. Mariachi jumps
again, rolls his eyes, and sinks underwater as the picture
fades.

camera continues to track past a small table where Azul's
guitar case lies open. Weapons adorn it, with each knife,
each gun in its pocket, in its own place. The camera
continues tracking to a dresser on which sits Azul's cellular
phone. A delicate female hand lifts the receiver. The camera

takes the phone and passes it to a third GIRL as Girl #2
tries to wake Azul (he is sleeping between Girls #2 and #3.).

Girl #3 has the phone to her ear as if listening for
background conversation.

The two Rats playing pool are staring longingly at the three
Girls in Azul's bed. They look hungry and deprived. One hits
the other, signaling it's his shot. While one shoots, the
other watches.

Azul awakens and grabs the phone.

are about to follow, but one Rat walks over to get one look
at the girls. The girls tease him, and when he tries to
advance them, they pull guns and laugh as the Rat runs away.

Domino walks by with a trash can. Mariachi is sitting on a

The Clerk is reading a paper. He hears a noise and pulls it
aside. Mariachi is standing at the counter smiling. The Clerk
jumps in his seat, then after a few frozen seconds he sets
down his paper and reaches for Mariachi's old room key.

Mariachi shakes his head "no", points to the register, and
makes the money sign with his hand. The Clerk slowly moves
over to the register. He depresses a few keys to open it. It
won't open. He makes a gesture like it's stuck or something
(he is not very convincing). He tries again and again; each
time pretending to get more impatient.Mariachi glances down
at the Pit Bull. The Pit Bull is eyeing Mariachi.

Mariachi points to the Clerk as if he has an inside joke with
the dog ("this guy..."). Mariachi climbs over the counter and
stands next to the Clerk. The Clerk things Mariachi is a
lunatic. Mariachi holds up a finger as if cueing the Clerk
for a demonstration. Mariachi then leaps over the counter
landing firmly back on the other side of the counter.

CLOSEUP of his feet landing hard, just as before.

The register opens. Mariachi shrugs, smiles, and reaches into
the register, taking his money out himself. He counts it.
After a brief consideration, he decides to leave the old man
a tip. Mariachi waves a "good-bye" wave and dances out. The
old man, still standing there with his arms outstretched as
if he was robbed, dashes to the phone and calls Moco's men.

The bar Assistant is cleaning the bar. He walks over to grab
a few glasses and when he returns, Azul is sitting at the
barstool Mariachi was on earlier. The Assistant looks around,
wondering where Azul appeared from.

<b>                    ASSISTANT
</b>          Can I get something to drink or eat?

<b>                      AZUL

The Assistant grabs a mug and starts to fill it at the tap.
He fills it halfway when...

He grabs a bottle and hands it to Azul, then lifts the mug,
toasts and drinks it straight down.

Azul drinks his straight down, too.

He points the gun deep into Azul's face and cocks it. Azul
closes his eyes. Mean Dude #5 lifts the lid. Azul hears a
faint strumming sound, followed by the sound of the Mean Dude
slamming the case shut. Azul opens his eyes. The Mean Dude
resnaps the latches. SNAP... SNAP... SNAP-SNAP-SNAP!!!

it.

The Mean Dudes are rounding the corner, but Mean Dude #5, who
is last, snaps his fingers and motions to the others to keep
quiet and to watch Azul

<b>INT. AMADEUS - DAY

Mariachi shakes the case, and puts it on the counter as if to
open it... but he doesn't need to check it. He knows it's not
his guitar.

<b>                    DOMINO
</b>          What's wrong?

Mariachi looks at her startled, then runs out of the bar with
the case.

The Mean Dudes start walking towards Azul as the camera
tracks back with them. Azul slams the case shut, wondering
what the hell is going on. He looks up and notices the Mean
Dudes walking towards him. He stands up and slowly walks in
the other direction.

<b>EXT. A BLOCK AWAY - DAY
</b>
Mariachi is running through the streets and onto the
sidewalk.

<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
The bad guys are pulling out their weapons.

Mariachi bolts around the corner. Now everyone is on the same
sidewalk. Mariachi and Azul are on each end of the street
with the Mean Dudes in between them.

Azul turns and sees Mariachi with his guitar case. Mean Dude
#5 turns and sees Mariachi, too.

<b>                    MEAN DUDE #5
</b>          That's him...

The two other Mean Dudes exchange glances. Mean Dude #5
stalks after Mariachi, so the other two follow. Mariachi
looks to Azul for help. Azul tips the imaginary hat to
Mariachi and walks away.

<b>EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY
</b>
Mariachi runs through the street almost getting hit. Bullets
are flying as the Mean Dudes are firing at him as they run.

<b>EXT. DEAD END - DAY
</b>
Mariachi leaps up over a few cars and ends up in a dead end.
He turns around, drops the case on the ground and opens it. A
million weapons seem to stare back at him when he opens it.
He is frantic. He grabs a small gun, shakes it in his hand,
doesn't like the feel. He tosses it back in.

<b>EXT. STREET - DAY

The Mean Dudes are barreling down the street. One turns
towards the dead end.

Mariachi pulls out the MAC-10 and blasts the first Mean Dude
he sees. He grabs the case and runs out into the street,
jumping onto a truck and blasting the other Mean Dude from up
there. He sees Mean Dude #5 run away.

Mariachi comes off the truck and walks through the streets in
slow motion. Peolple are staring at him as if he was Azul the
killer. Mariachi walks straight to the bar. A BOY is bouncing
a ball on one of the sidewalks.

<b>INT. AZUL'S HIDEOUT - DAY

The camera dollies past the vacant pool table, and over to a
Rat sitting in a chair, drinking a beer. The other Rat is
pacing back and forth in front of the sitting Rat. Azul
enters the room. Throwing his guitar case onto the pool table
as a grand entrance gesture. The sitting Rat stands beside
the pacing Rat.

floor. Azul turns to Rat #2.

The phone rings. Domino gets up to answer it. Mariachi
reaches under his blanket for a small mirror and combs his
hair, putting spit in his hair to slick it down. He quickly
stashes the mirror.

Domino hands Mariachi a wad of money.

Mariachi sees the money and looks up at her bewildered.

<b>                    DOMINO
</b>          Here's a little bit I've saved. I want
          you to go get a new guitar.

Mariachi starts to put up his hand as if to refuse it.

</b>          Take it, stupid. I'm not saying go by the

Mariachi stops and thinks... He looks up at her
questioningly, then he shrugs an "OK" and grabs the money and
jogs out excitedly. Domino is smiling.

<b>EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
Mariachi walks down the sidewalk, passing curioso shops. The
camera is low and zoomed in all the way. Mariachi stops by
one of the window that has a guitar in the glass. He pulls
his money and counts it. He stops after he notices someone's
reflection in the window. He turns around and sees it is Mean
Dude #5 right across the street. He meets up with another
Mean Dude. They are standing right behind Mariachi. Mariachi
is pretending to still look at the window. The Mean Dudes
walk past Mariachi so Mariachi walks in the opposite
direction. Mean Dude #5 stops and then turns around slowly.

<b>IN A TRUCK DOWN THE STREET
</b>
LOCO starts the truck and starts driving slowly across the
street. As he turns on the corner, Mariachi sees the truck
and casually climbs inside and hides in the back. Mean Dude
#5 turns the corner when whispers into walkie-talkie.

          Take him around the block.

Mean Dude #5 taps his buddy and they start running down the
block.

Mariachi is in back the truck searching for a weapon. The
truck stops. Mariachi rolls to the side and gently lifts his
head.

POV Mariachi sees the two Mean Dudes walking at him. Mariachi
turns and Loco is there to knock him in the face with the
rifle butt. Mariachi falls into truck, blood trickling from
his dizzying head. He tries to get up a bit, but Loco is in
the truck now, and slams the rifle down into his face hard...
Blackout.

<b>DUSTY ROAD TO MOCO'S

Mariachi is unconcious in the back of Loco's truck. Mean Dude
#5 and other Mean Dudes are riding in back with Mariachi.

<b>EXT. ROAD TO MOCO'S - DAY
</b>
The above scene intercuts back and forth with the arrival of
Loco. Loco arrives at the gate, Mean Dude #5 opens the gate,
they drive through. The truck is facing Moco so he can't see
Mariachi yet. Mean Dude #5 closes the gate and walks over to
the truck, opens the back door, and calls Moco over. Moco
walks over to the truck and looks inside.

cigarette and a match.

Domino is waiting on customers. She glances at her watch. A
few seconds later she glances at it again. She looks very
worried.

<b>INT. AZUL'S HIDEOUT - DAY
</b>
Azul's Rats burst into the hideout. FOUR GIRLS pop up over
the partition with guns. The Rats stop in their tracks. The
girls sigh a "oh, it's them" sigh and slink back to bed. Top
shot of them trying to wake Azul. Azul wakes up and looks
over the partition.

Azul thinks a moment. He stands up.

He grabs the guard's assault rifle and turns a corner. Two
men grab him. He slams the butt of the rifle, knocking the
wind and teeth out of BAD GUY #1, then he kicks down and
breaks the shin bone of BAD GUY #2 who screams out in agony.
Mariachi silences him by karate punching his throat. The Bad
Guy gurgles and hits the ground.

Angle from the ground as Mariachi smashes the guy with is
gun.

He crawls up a wall, trying to escape as quietly as he can.
He sees TWO MORE MEN running towards him since they heard
some noise. Mariachi aims his assault rifle at the blue Chevy
parked behind him. He fires and it explodes.

Mariachi jumps Loco, gets him to drive him to the saloon. He
also takes Loco's money.

Azul walks into frame, looks around then proceeds into the
bar.

He eyes her admirably and then pops the top with one hand.

He guzzles the drink, slamming it down empty.

They drive out to Moco's ranch in Azul's truck. Little do

the passenger seat. He gets up after the truck passes.
Mariachi didn't know it was Domino in Azul's truck or he
could have turned around and kept her from going to Moco's

limp in Azul's arms. Azul tries hold her up, but she's dead.
Azul rests her on the ground, looking down at her, wondering
why it's all come to this.

Moco shoots Azul in the heart. Azul had his hands to his
side, and now he falls to his knees. Moco shoots him again,

He has the gun in the back of his pants. You can see it while
his back is to the camera and men are approaching him. Moco
comes for the show.

</b>              (good shot)
          So you're the little mariachi that came
          to town, killed my men, and stole my
          girl...

Mariachi slowly lifts his eyes to Moco.

<b>                    MOCO (CONT'D)
</b>          You are very talented.

Mariachi stands, hands up.

<b>                    MOCO (CONT'D)
</b>          I bet you play the guitarra real well,
          huh?

Mariachi says nothing.

<b>                    MOCO (CONT'D)
</b>              (raising gun)
          Not anymore.

Moco fires into Mariachi's left hand. Mariachi grimaces,
crumbling to the floor. He keeps a tight grip on his hand.
When he opens his hand to see the damage, the camera can see
right through his hand for a reverse shot of his face through
the hole.

<b>                    MOCO (CONT'D)
</b>          Now get the hell off my property and take
          your hand with you!!!

Moco is laughing and looking at his men for support, but no
one else laughs. Mariachi tries to stand, but he falls back.
When he rises again he has the gun in his hand. He shoots
Moco in the chest. Moco falls back and hits the ground hard.
He gasps for air...

Moco's men gather around him. Mean Dude #5 crouches down to
check Moco's throat pulse. Moco's dead. Mean Dude #5 strikes
a match across Moco's face and lights up a cigarette. He
turns and walks away. The others follow.

Mariachi wraps a tourniquet on his arm, kisses Domino, opens
Azul's case, sees the weapons, and rides off with it.

<b>MARIACHI ON THE ROAD
</b>
He looks back at the town behind him, then places his hand on
the motorcycle to drive off. We notice the metal brace on his
hand.

Mariachi rides into the sunset road. He speeds pas a sign:
"ACUÑA 18 miles"

"Coming soon
