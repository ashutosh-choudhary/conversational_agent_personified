                         No one would have believed in the early 
                         years of the21st century, that our world 
                         was being watched by intelligences greater 
                         than our own. That as men busied themselves 
                         about their various concerns, they observed 
                         and studied. Like the way a man with 
                         a microscope might scrutinize the creatures 
                         that swarm and multiply in a drop of 
                         water. With infinite complacency men 
                         went to and fro about the globe, confident 
                         of our empire over this world. Yet, 
                         across the gulf of space, intellects, 
                         vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded 
                         our plant with envious eyes. And slowly 
                         and surely, drew their plans against 
                         us.

               Ray (in his 30s, short hair, rough groomed, almost always wears 
               his New York baseball cap, raggedly dressed, looks like he hasn't 
               slept in days) is moving cargo boxes from the ship to ground 
               loading brackets. Shots show him inside the control room operating 
               the levers. As the last car is loaded, he is seen walking down 
               the stairs.

<b> 
</b>               Robbie gets out of the car, carelessly banging the door on the

               Rachel gives him a hug and goes back to the car to retrieve her

               heads straight upstairs to his room. Mary Ann sees a car engine 
               next to the kitchen table and looks at Ray in disgust.

               Ray begins singing as... BAM!! The LIGHTNING gets even louder 
               and scares the both of them enough to hightail it for the house. 
               BAM!!! Half the car alarms go off in a 10 block radius. BAM!! 
               Another few car alarms go off. BAM!!! Louder and louder the LIGHTNING 
               continues.

               They both get under the table for safety as the LIGHTING continues. 
               They both begin panicking. BAM!! BAM!! BAM!! The LIGHTNING goes

</b>               Ray walks around to various parts of the kitchen to see if everything 
               is okay. The power is off. After saying "just wait here" he then 
               walks into the living room. Nothing in the living room has power. 
               He checks his phone which doesn't work. He tries his cell phone

                         Well, there's something down there and 
                         it's moving.

<b> 
</b>               The pavement starts to crack into a wider circle. People start 
               running away from the crack as it gets bigger and bigger. Windows 
               start to crack under pressure as the pavement separates even 
               more. Entire sheets of road split into pieces causing everyone 
               on the road to loose their balance. Shots of more shattering 
               windows. Busting pipes. The church starts cracking apart and 
               moving with a GIANT CIRCLE of pavement that moves. The pavement 
               lurches up and then caves down. A few cars go tumbling in. Something 
               throws the last car that tumbled in back out flying through the 
               air as a leg of the robot makes a lurch out of the hole. The 
               police continue trying to move people away. The engines of the 
               ship start coming out as they power up. The entire ship comes 
               out and begins dusting it's self off. Ray and his friends hide 
               behind a building.

               The machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to 
               other robots. It arms it's disintegrator beams and opens fire. 
               People can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the 
               beam. The beams, when fired make a zap sound. People start exploding 
               into dust and their clothes are blown away. Ray misses numerous 
               beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store. Again 
               Ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches. 
               He runs his ass off trying to escape the robot. Disintegrator 
               beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path. Ray hides 
               behind a building as the machine walks by.

               Ray walks into the house where he is met by Rachel's gawking 
               eyes out the window. Robbie stands in the background looking 
               at the doorway. Ray walks past Rachel then Robbie toward the 
               kitchen. Rachel and Robbie follow him into the kitchen. With 
               anxious eyes, Robbie begins to say...

                         What happened?


               Ray sits down against the wall of the island countertop in the 
               kitchen, not responding.

               Robbie squats down next to Ray as Rachel rests her elbows on 
               the stool at the island.

                         Rachel reaches through a leg of the 
                         island to pull at Ray's hood on his 
                         shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his 
                         head toward Rachel fast enough to make 
                         some of the white powder poof off as 
                         if jerked back into reality. Robbie 
                         jumps as well in fright.

               Ray looks at his arms which are coated in the white powder. He 
               gets up and begins heading for the bathroom. Still unresponsive 
               to the questions he was just asked. He looks in the mirror to 
               see that he is covered in the whit powder (human ash). He quickly 
               does his best to wash it off realizing what it is. After washing 
               it off, he begins mentally planning what to do.

               Ray, Rachel, and Robbie are walking at a very fast pace down

               flies all over behind the van.

               Rachel and Robbie are shouting for "mom" and "Tim" as Ray walks 
               through the door. Rachel and Robbie meet Ray in the entry from 
               different parts of the house in their search.

               Bushes are heard rattling against the window. They become louder 
               and louder against the window. Eventually they become just shy 
               of loud enough to wake Ray up. FLASH! A strike of lighting gets 
               Ray's eyes to roll back around and open. BAM! The second flash 
               is loud enough to get Robbie (who is now in the seat next to 
               Ray) to jump up next to him. A few more flashes and the lightening 
               starts like the first time. BAM! BAM! Every strike of lighting 
               lights up the entire downstairs. Rachel gets up and looks thought

               Robbie and Ray wince at the pain in their ears. Rachel runs up

               on to the metal wire conduit. Seeing hardly anything, he judges 
               it to be safe to go outside the furnace room.

<b>                         THAT'S LOOKING!!

               Rachel is about 200 feet away entering a patch of bushes. Robbie 
               has already found a spot about 10' away next to the stream under 
               the road.

                         Listen. Every time you don't listen 
                         to me, I'm telling your mother, okay? 
                         I'm making a list. (reinforcing) I'm 
                         making a list!

<b> 
</b>               Rachel is entering the wooded area next to the stream looking 
               for a half way decent spot. She sees the river and looks at it 
               in beauty just as she sees a body floating down it. MORE BODIES 
               start coming at a huge rate. 20,30,40,50 bodies floating down 
               the river. Rachel begins to hyperventilate again as Ray comes 
               up from behind her and throws his hands over her eyes and grabs 
               her.

               Ray grabs her into his arms and begins walking back to the van.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Army trucks can be heard crossing by the van. Robbie, who's only 
               interest is killing one of the robots sees this as an opportunity 
               to do so. Robbie runs toward the trucks and begins shouting....

</b>               Rachel's last line almost brings Robbie to tears as he picks 
               her up and starts walking over to the van. Ray stands next to 
               the still rolling army vehicles and begins to realize how this 
               brother and sister have come to rely on each other during the 
               divorce of their parents.

               worried and gets Ray to drive.

               Ray then screams to the rioting crowd who are now pulling him 
               out of the driver's side window.

               A man from the crowd runs up to Rachel's window, breaks it, and 
               tries to grab Rachel. Ray pulls the man out and throws him back 
               into the crowd.

               Ray wrestles another man trying to grab Rachel. The man gets 
               tossed to the ground. Just as Ray stands up... WHAM!!! Ray is 
               hit in the back of the head by a man with a baseball bat. The 
               blow was not severe enough to cause life threatening damage to 
               Ray.

               yell to "stop them" but nobody does so. The man who is strangling 
               Ray yells to "get in the car". Robbie fought off the men who 
               pulled him out of the car, comes over to Ray's side, and begins 
               choking the man who is choking Ray. Robbie hit's the man's head 
               against the car. The man releases his grip on Ray, the man and 
               Robbie are drug into the rioting crowd beyond frame view.

               Rachel tries to get out, but there is an overflow of people barreling 
               into the car through the windows. She is surrounded by people 
               in the car. Robbie and Ray are getting beat in the crowd.

               Robbie, who has managed to get to his feet, hunched over, walks 
               over to Ray. Ray, with Rachel in his arms, and Robbie walk to 
               the diner on the street. The man backs up the car just as the 
               camera pans down to see a man who sees the gun on the street. 
               The man picks up Ray's gun and looks at the man in the van.

               The three of them are walking to a booth in the diner. Ray, with 
               Rachel in his arms, is beginning to bleed from his head wound. 
               He walks with a slight limp. Rachel is panic stricken. Robbie 
               lets go of his bloody nose and, with both hands, clenches his 
               chest in pain. He is still fighting to catch his breath. They 
               are all soaked from the rain. 

<b> 
</b>               They all sit down at the booth. The power is flickering on and 
               off. As they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had, gunshots 
               are heard. BAM!! BAM!! Ray jumps and catches his head in his 
               hands as it throbs. Robbie jumps and flails his arms in pain 
               as the jump tightened muscles in his stomach. Robbie turns around 
               to see the man with Ray's gun firing at Riot Man 3. BAM! One 
               more gunshot is heard. Rachel scurries over to Robbie who, despite 
               his pain, grabs Rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort. 
               The van drives away.

<b> 
</b>               Rachel sobs as Ray also starts crying because nobody knows what 
               to do from here. Robbie looks at Ray for some comfort. He has 
               none.

               They are walking in a crowd of about 300. Some men share their 
               stories of assumption. One man says... "Europe's got it the worst...." 
               while another man says "We've got it the worst......" while some 
               people "don't give a shit who it is....."

               far are withstanding. 

<b> 
</b>               Ray, now in the front next to a soldier, tries to get them to 
               let him and his family through. They say there is no more room.

               The harbor master hit's the switch to start the ramp motor to 
               begin folding up the ramp. Soldiers shove empty cars off the 
               ramp. 

<b> 
</b>               Sheryl is knocked around by a few people and looses grip of Ray's 
               jacket.

               They run faster and Sheryl falls farther behind. Robbie makes 
               a grab for her hand but a soldier stops Sheryl just short.

               Robbie, panting hard, looks at the inclining ramp and sees there 
               are still people hanging on to the back side of the ramp. He 
               starts running to the stern of the ship.

<b> 
</b>               The captain pushes the throttle all the way full. The propellers 
               start so fast they spray water all over the people still at the 
               dock. Pulling away at it's ties to the dock, the ship begins 
               pulling away.

               Robbie ignores them as he jumps onto the grate of the folded

               hanging on the back side of the ramp.

<b>               INT. CAPTAIN'S CONTROL ROOM - DUSK
</b>

               The captain sees some sort of whirlpool sucking water down into 
               a hole. The ship begins to slowly turn toward the hole, being 
               sucked in.

                         Oh, my god!


               Passengers rush over to the starboard railing where a robot emerges 
               from the whirlpool. WOOSH!!! Hundreds of gallons of water are 
               tossed up with the robot. The water in the air turns to snow 
               as it falls on the ship. The robot's engines howl in the air.

<b> 
</b><b>                         
</b>               The robot's claws begin pushing the ship making it lean to one 
               side and finally tip over on it's side. Robbie is already running 
               towards Ray. At the turn of the ship, the three go into the water. 
               Cars start coming towards them. WOOSH!!! A car comes right for 
               them. SPLASH!!! The car hit's the water where they are, instantly 
               pinning Robbie and Ray to the front of it. Rachel is holding 
               on to Robbie's back, also going down.

<b> 
</b>               The people in the car are screaming as the car fills with water. 
<b>               
</b>
<b> 
</b>               As the ship completely capsizes, people are thrown or washed 
               into the water. Cars sink down, people float and the ship bobs 
               in the water. Ray is able to un-pin himself and pulls Robbie 
               out. They all begin swimming to the surface. Rachel lags behind 
               and Robbie grabs her and helps her up.  At the surface, they 
               meet. A ship propeller at full power. They begin to swim away 
               from it. Claws from the ship over head are grabbing people and 
               pulling them into the robot's holds.

               Ray is heaving Rachel up to shore. Robbie is not far behind. 
               They are all fighting to get their breath after swimming for 
               so long. Ray can no longer haul Rachel up the beach.

               Robbie almost slips as he gags, still fighting for breath.

                         Don't stop. Don't stop.


               Alert sirens can be heard coming from the city.


               Ray pulls the two of them.

                         (yells in pain) AHHH.


               They all lay on the hillside, gasping for air. In the distance 
               they look... Two robots are still picking people up out of the 
               water. Two more robots have joined and are picking up people 
               off the streets. Many people scream. 

<b> 
</b>               With jaws clattering, Rachel looks toward the other hillside 
               on the other side of the river. Shivering Ray and Robbie look 
               there with her. 

<b> 
</b>               THREE MORE robots are on the opposite hillside blasting people 
               with their disintegrator beams. Many more people scream. Rachel, 
               in fright, runs towards the bushes behind Ray. Ray sees her, 
               and runs with her. Robbie runs with them. They stop and squat 
               down as they see the top of another robot coming over the hill 
               to join the three. 

<b> 
</b>               Robbie, running, with clenched teeth, stops. His jaw drops as 
               we are able to see hundreds of thousands of articles of clothing 
               falling from the sky. They continue running through the woods 
               where clothes fall like snow. 

<b> 
</b>               Pasture Fence Line - Dark


               Robbie is walking 5' ahead of Ray and Rachel along a fence line 
               of a pasture. Gunfire is seen and heard over the hill about 500 
               yards away. Robbie, who always wanted to help in the fight, begins 
               walking faster toward the gunfire.

               Robbie follows the fence line and walks a little faster.

                         Robbie, slow down!!!


               Robbie, who is coming closer to the hill, sees army trucks rolling 
               down the road and up the hill. Seeing this, Robbie walks into 
               a slow run along the fence line. Ray and Rachel try to keep up.

               Ray and Rachel duck as a missile comes EXTREMELY CLOSE to their 
               heads. Jets speed by them overhead. Rachel screams.

               Robbie, in a full scale run, runs with the army trucks that have

               Robbie is held back by two soldiers. Robbie gets thrown back 
               by them where Ray grabs him and pins him to the ground. Robbie 
               fights to get back up.

               Soldiers are blasting everything they have to something over

               the hill.

               him over on to his back. Robbie looks at Ray in fright that he

               a second, Ray doesn't know what to do.

                         go.

<b> 
</b>               Ray and Robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever. 
               Ray looks to Rachel who is being carried away by the couple. 
               Robbie manages to turn back over to his stomach. After enough 
               trying, Robbie is able to squirm out of Ray's grasp on his shoulders. 
<b>               
</b>
<b> 
</b>               Robbie crawls out of Ray's grasp and stands up. They stare at 
               each other for a while and Robbie begins running over the hill. 
               Ray runs over to Rachel to get her back from the couple.

</b>               She doesn't finish as she scurries away. Ray looks at the hill 
               where the soldiers were firing at... A FLAMING army truck rolls 
               over the hill.

                         Robbie?!?!


               Two more trucks come over the hill ablaze. Suddenly... BOOM!!! 
               A ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill. The explosion 
               blast is almost big enough to knock Ray off of his feet.

               By now, Robbie has run over the hill and is long out of site. 
               A robot that appears to be on fire comes slowly rising over the 
               hill. Ray makes a run for it down the hill. We can see three 
               robots now rising over the hill. Missiles and bullets are being 
               fired at them as their shields block all the fired artillery.

</b><b>               EXT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - CELLAR DOOR - NIGHT

               Harland lives in the basement of his house about 300 feet away 
               from the hill that the robots came over. He is holding a rifle 
               as a signal for anybody who can see him.

               Ray and Rachel run towards him.

</b>
                         Hurry!!


               The three of them scurry into the basement. Ray and Rachel run 
               into the main room while Harland proceeds to close the cellar 
               doors. Gunfire can be heard alongside the screams from people. 
               Lights flash through the cracks in the walls and door.

</b>

               Harland walks up to the lantern hanging on the wall and looks 
               at Ray and Rachel. His face, half lit looks medieval with the 
               clothes he wears. 

<b> 
</b>               Harland grabs the lantern and carries it over to where Ray and 
               Rachel are huddled shivering in their damp clothes.

</b>
                         (to Rachel) You all right?


               Rachel does not respond most likely due to shock.

</b>
                         (to Ray) And what about you?


               Ray looks up at him and looks at the lantern. He is still heard 
               muttering "Robbie" very quietly.

<b> 
</b>               Harland moves a wheel barrel as rats are seen scurrying about 
               on the floor. The army platoon has gone far enough over the hill 
               that gunfire can no longer be seen or heard.

                         I need you to close your eyes now, okay? 
                         You need some sleep.

               He begins sharpening a shovel with a file.

<b> 
</b>               Rachel is crying because she misses Robbie and her mom. Ray sees 
               the first place ribbon she keeps carrying around and begins to 
               investigate what it is.

<b> 
</b>               Rachel turns over (her back to Ray) because she realizes that 
               it is a lost hope to get a song out of him. Ray thinks for a

                         We're not going to be exterminated.

</b>               The ground starts shaking from robots walking around outside. 
               Ray gets back up just as BOOM!! A small piece of the corner of 
               the basement collapses from all the vibration.

                         on, I wanna show you something!

</b>               They both are waling towards a window.

                         We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta 
                         have a weakness. Come on, take a look.

</b>               Ray and Harland see two robots spraying vine like strands out 
               of a hole on the bottom of the ship onto the ground.

                         Somehow they killed a few of these things 
                         in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling 
                         me the Japanese can figure it out but 
                         we can't? 

<b> 
</b>               Ray goes over to Rachel and picks her up to take her somewhere 
               else.

                         We can do it. We can get 'em. We can 
                         figure it out. 

<b> 
</b>               Ray puts the now wide awake Rachel in a chair.

                         Stay right there!


               Ray opens up a window guard to see two robots skimming the ground 
               almost as if they are tilling up the soil. He now understands 
               that robots do this on a regular basis.

                         underground. When the time is right, 
                         we'll take 'em by supries, the way they 
                         took us. We'll take 'em by surprise.

</b>               Ray puts his hands over his face as he realizes he is staying 
               with an insane man.

                         We're right under their feet, Ray. Right 
                         here, under their feet.

               Ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing wildly. 
               He feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe. He examines 
               it closely as he walks over to the window where lights are beaming 
               in and out as the robots work. He takes another piece of a wall 
               and studies that one. 

<b> 
</b>               Ray hears a hovering craft over his head. A light flows over 
               the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a board 
               hall in the basement. Harland is sitting on the stairs with Rachel.

                         girl nearly your age. You know, if anything 
                         happens to your daddy, I'll take care 
                         of you. 

<b> 
</b>               Ray is very angry that Harland is saying things like that to 
               his daughter.

                         Rachel!


               Rachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside him. They 
               both stare at Harland, on the stairs, in dismay.

                         (distinctly angry, but not yelling) 
                         You don't have anything to say to her, 
                         do you understand? If you want to talk 
                         to somebody, or ask somebody a question, 
                         you ask me!

                         (also angry at Ray) What exactly is 
                         your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna 
                         do. How about you? You gonna sit here, 
                         wait for them to come get you? Is that 
                         your plan?

<b> 
</b>               Harland walks around to different parts of the basement doing 
               miscellaneous things. 

<b>

                         Maybe you want to get caught. Couple 
                         of days hiding in a basement too much 
                         for you, I bet. You'll probably turn 
                         yourself right in! 

<b> 
</b>               The robots outside stop moving. All the rumbling stops.

                         Listen. It stopped.

                         (paying no attention) Maybe you'll be 
                         okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll 
                         train you as their pet. You know, train 
                         you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks...

                         (yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!

<b> 
</b><b>                         
</b>               Pieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera comes floating 
               down into the hole. Ray hides behind the stairs. The camera eye 
               opens and lights turn on for it. 

<b> 
</b>               Rachel is hiding as well. The camera looks around the couch. 
               Ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the couch. It 
               sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds. Ray and 
               Harland exchange looks as Ray runs toward Rachel to hide with 
               her. 

<b> 
</b>               The robot continues checking out the basement. Harland grabs 
               an axe to cut off the camera from it's limb. Ray shakes his head 
               no to get him to stop. Ray silently does expressions to convince 
               him not to. 

<b> 
</b>               Harland goes towards ray so they can hide together. Harland almost 
               makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of glass containers 
               which clang together. The robot hears this and turns around toward 
               the noise. They run to a different spot.

<b> 
</b>               Robot gets closer...


               Ray puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the robot 
               into seeing another robot. The camera looks over the mirror and 
               sees nothing. 

<b> 
</b>               It turns around just as... Rachel's boot slides, making a noise. 
               The robot views into the boot that is hanging out. It looks behind 
               the mirror to find just a boot sitting there. Ray, Rachel and 
               Harland are in the middle of the basement. A sight of relief 
               comes as the robot camera exit's out of the hole.

<b> 
</b>               Now the actual aliens come into the basement. Harland turns the 
               lantern out and runs to hide. The aliens look around the basement. 
               They look at, smell, and touch various different things throughout 
               the basement. Ray, Rachel, and Harland scurry to different parts 
               of the basement.

<b> 
</b>               Harland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the aliens 
               but the gun is pulled back by Ray.

<b> 
</b><b>                                     RAY
</b>
                         (dead silent) Give me that!


               Ray and Harland are in a silent fight for the gun. They both 
               have their hands on it. The aliens continue looking around. 

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               Ray and Harland are both sweating bullets fighting for the gun. 
               Still silently.  Harland pins Ray against the wall and forces 
               him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of his grasp.

<b> 
</b><b>               
</b>               The aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box. 
<b>               
</b>
<b> 
</b>               Ray lets go of the gun and Harland jerks it away from him just 
               as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot. The aliens 
               scurry out through the open hole.

<b> 
</b>               Harland comes down to Ray, now sitting on the floor, and says....

               The vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal rate along 
               the concrete slab under the window. Robots are spraying a red 
               mist out of the back of their ships. Ray holds his hand in the 
               mist that is entering the window.  After a moment.... Ray retracts 
               his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be blood.

               blood. 

<b> 
</b>               They both turn back around then Harland runs. Ray watches a man 
               being set down, fighting to be let go. A needle like object comes 
               down and stabs the man. It then pumps the blood out of him. Ray 
               has a horrified look on his face.

<b> 
</b>               Ray realizes they will have the same fate if he keeps yelling.

               who is digging some sort of hole.

               Harland goes on saying odd things as Ray gets Rachel prepared 
               for what he has to do.

<b> 
</b>               Ray puts a black cloth over Rachel's eyes which makes her breathing

               Rachel releases her hands and takes off the blindfold. Ray is 
               sitting on the stairs.

               Ray and Rachel are sleeping on the couch. As we view down from 
               Ray's face we find that Rachel is wide awake for some reason. 
               She sits up and....

               A robot camera is 1' away from her face. Rachel runs to the wall, 
               still screaming as ray hit's the camera with his hands. The camera 
               hit's the ceiling and shakes it's self off of debris. 

<b> 
</b>               Ray begins blasting the axe he had in hand into the camera attachment 
               line. Rachel screams as he hit's the line. Over and over and 
               over. Rachel runs up the basement stairs. Ray continues hitting 
               it and it finally pulls away. The camera, still attached by a 
               hair, hits some wood planks and is pulled out of the hole.

               Ray sees an entire field of blood coated red vines beyond the

               A robot's lights turn on to him as a food lands close enough 
               to him to blow him back. One of the robot's grabbing claws comes 
               after Ray. He hides in a truck. The claw breaks through the glass, 
               grabs the car, and flips it, causing it to roll about 3 times.

               Now in the car, lying upside down, he hears Rachel scream. He 
               looks and Rachel is standing at the top of a hill. 

<b> 
</b>               The robot centers above her and begins to grab her with a claw. 
               Ray runs towards her to try and do what he can to stop it.

               The robot blasts through a building. Ray is right behind the 
               foot. He runs into an army vehicle and finds a belt full of grenades. 
               He takes on off, removes the pin and throws it at the robot.

               It hit's the robot's shields and the robot turns right around. 
               It eyeballs Ray for a moment and picks him up by a grabbing claw.

               He is thrown into a cage with about 30 other people in it as 
               well. The gate closes on the top as he is thrown in. The camera 
               shows he is in one of two cages. People scream and cry in confusion. 
               Ray spots Rachel sitting on the side of the grate.

               He goes towards her just as the door opens, it makes a sound 
               and a grabbing claw comes out of a hole on the robot. Ray falls 
               down (luckily), it grabs another person and sucks him into the 
               ship. The same happens in the other cage.

               Ray goes to speak just as BOOM! The grate shifts, tossing all 
               the people around and the door opens to take another person up. 
               Ray ducks down with Rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing 
               claw. He is swept up by it. Rachel holds on to his neck to go 
               with him. But then, Ray sees his belt of grenades. He prigs Rachel's 
               hands off of him and grabs the grenades. A soldier sees this 
               and latches onto Ray's arm.

               Hardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot explodes. 
               We can see the robot exploding on the inside. It breaks doors 
               and fluid stars spilling out of it. The robot releases it's cages 
               and they fall into a tree. Splitting open. People promptly climb 
               out. 

<b> 
</b>               Once the robot falls to the ground, Rachel looks at Ray in a 
               way that meant how did you do that.

               Ray walks with Rachel down the road as soldiers are ushering 
               them to "keep moving." The crows are now eating the red plant

               Seeing another robot, one soldier motions to get into the water 
               tunnel. Other soldiers make signals to get set up for defense

</b>               The soldier looks at them and doesn't get what Ray's getting 
               at. He looks back at Ray. The noise continues erratically as 
               if the robot is fighting to stay alive.

</b>               Soldiers scurry to get set up and they hurriedly fire missiles 
               at the robot. The first missile hit's the grabbing claws and 
               knocks them off. A few more shots and the robot collapses into 
               a nearby factory. The factory explodes and the robot grinds to 
               a halt on the ground. They check it to be clear as an alien falls 
               out of the door. It quickly dies on site.

               We watch the alien turn to stone as it dies.


               Boston - Walking Down Street near Mary Ann's Mother's house - 
               Day

<b> 
</b>               Mary Ann walks up to the front door and sees Ray walking down 
               the street with Rachel in his arms. She flutters open the doors 
               and she and Rachel run towards each other on the street. Mary 
               Ann begins crying.

<b>

</b>
<b>                         MOM!!!
</b>

               They hug each other crying. 


               Mary Ann looks at Ray who is still standing in the middle of 
               the street.

                         (just barely hearable) Thank you.

<b> 
</b><b>                         
</b>               Mary Ann's parents come out of the door. The mother has a shocked 
               look on her face. Tim is behind them. 

<b> 
</b>               Ray's eyes and face perk up as we see ROBBIE coming down the 
               front steps towards him. 

<b>

                         Robbie?


               Ray and Robbie take a good look at each other and Robbie finally 
               mutters with a dry throat.

                         Hey dad!


               They hug each other in thankfulness for each other's survival.

                         From the moment the invaders arrived, 
                         breathed our air, ate and drank, they 
                         were doomed. They were undone, destroyed, 
                         after all of man's weapons and devices 
                         had failed, by the tiniest creatures 
                         that God and his wisdom, put upon this 
                         earth. At the toll of a billion deaths, 
                         man had earned his immunity, is right 
                         to survive among this planet's infinite 
                         organisms. And that right is ours against 
                         all challenges, for men do not live 
                         nor die in vein.
