<b>   EXT: ARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY
</b>
   Snow and ice as far as the eye can see. What looks like a
   windowless MILITARY BASE surrounded by barbed wire fences
   sits in the middle of the wasteland.

<b>   TITLE CARD: TOP SECRET RESEARCH LABORATORY.   ARCTIC CIRCLE.
</b>
   At the GUARD GATE, two RUSSIAN GUARDS play poker using an
   overturned barrel as a table.

   Russian Guard 1 shows a five of diamonds... and four Aces.
   The other Guard folds. Russian Guard 1 LAUGHS and drags in
   the pile of coins.

   While he SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN and does a celebratory dance, the
   coins fly up into the air. Russian Guard 1 stops dancing and
   sees that the coins are gone. He accuses the other Guard of
   stealing them. Russian Guard 2 swears he didn't take them.

   Russian Guard 1 grabs a shovel and wields it menacingly,
   until it flies up into the air. They both look up to see
   where it's gone. Then the metal barrel they were using as a
   table flies up, knocking them over.

   Russian Guard 2 looks up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNET SHIP
<b>   LOWERING DOWN FROM ABOVE AND HOVERING OVER THE LABORATORY.
</b>
   A watchtower guard shouts. A door below opens as a bunch of
   Guards run out and point their guns at the magnet ship.
   Then...WOOSH! All of their guns are pulled up towards the
   ship, including the guards themselves, who are strapped to
   their guns.

   A SNOWMOBILE lifts off the ground and flies up to the magnet.
   Other vehicles and small buildings begin to pull away from
   the ground.

   Then--

<b>   THE ENTIRE LAB STARTS TO GET PULLED UP OUT OF THE GROUND.
</b>
   CLANK! The lab makes contact with the ship. It flies up and
   down, shaking the scientists and guards off. They fall to
   the ground. The magnet ship flies away with their lab,
   vehicles, and weapons.

   The remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the
   snow with the remnants of the damaged base. We see a porta-
   potty door open. A Confused Guard is sitting on the can
   reading a newspaper, having missed the entire incident. He
   closes the door.

<b>   INT: AVL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
   SECURITY FOOTAGE of the research station named PX LABS being
   carried away by the magnet ship plays on the screens at AVL
   Headquarters.

   We see the back of several heads watching the footage.

   There's a heavy sigh.

No response.

</b>          Right... bring him in.

</b>          Yes, sir.


<b>EXT: SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
</b>
Gru steps toward camera, holding some sort of menacing gun,
which he loads and cocks. He pulls the trigger, which shoots
out an inflatable unicorn balloon.

Smiling, he ties it to the windowsill next to some others.



<b>EXT: GRU'S BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
A banner reads: "Happy Birthday Agnes!" and a massive
backyard party is in full swing. The yard is decorated with
pink balloons and streamers, and a BOUNCY HOUSE shaped like a
castle.

AGNES and several other LITTLE GIRLS slide down a slide.
They are all dressed as princesses, but Agnes is dressed as a
princess riding a unicorn.

<b>                    AGNES
</b>          This is the best party EVER!!!

Edith, dressed as a ninja, emerges from beneath a table and
climbs across the monkey bars as a series of jousts, blades,
and boxing gloves come up from the ground underneath her.
She jumps down, narrowly avoiding a bear trap.

<b>                     EDITH
</b>          Haha!   Yeah!
<b>          DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO &amp; KEN DRAFT       3.
</b>

Two LITTLE GIRLS fish in a small kiddie pool. One of the
girls pulls up a toy duck and then razzes the other girl, but
then a LIVE PIRANHA jumps out and eats the toy duck.

A BOY and a GIRL sword fight. The Boy does a bunch of fancy
moves. The Girl waits for him to finish and then pounds him
on the head with a club.

Two kids in the background are on a see-saw made of bombs.
Agnes runs into the middle of the yard and points offscreen.

<b>                     AGNES
</b>          Oh no!   A dragon is approaching!

All of the kids turn and see KYLE dressed as a dragon. He
GRUMBLES and then they SCREAM and huddle around Agnes. Then
Margo enters wearing a SUIT OF ARMOR and wielding a SWORD.

<b>                    MARGO
</b>          Fear not, for here come the gallant
          knights to save us!

She gestures to a group of minions wearing tiny suits of
armor and wielding various MEDIEVAL WEAPONS. The Kids CHEER
as the minions charge toward Kyle. One accidentally hits
another with his sword. A fight ensues in which they use the
medieval weapons on each other.

One minion pounds another with a MACE. One Minion wanders off
from the fight with his helmet on backwards, wildly swinging
his mace.

Across the yard, Gru is busy grilling burgers and talking on
the phone. Not happy.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          No, no, no! What do you mean she's
          not coming?! I have a backyard
          full of these little girls who are
          counting on a visit from a fairy
          princess!

The mace-swinging Minion walks by and accidently, repeatedly
hits Gru with the mace in the shin.

<b>                     GRU (CONT'D)
</b>          Ah!   Hurts! Ah! Stop it!

Gru kicks the minion's helmet and chases him off with a
spatula, sending him towards the party swinging his mace.
Gru SIGHS and returns to the call.

</b>

<b>                    GRU (CONT'D)
</b>          Listen! I don't want a refund! I
          want a fairy princess... please!
          Please, I am begging you.
              (Resigned)
          You know what? I hope that you can
          sleep at night, you crusher of
          little girls' dreams!!!

Gru hits the phone with his spatula and hangs up.    Turns and
sees Agnes standing there.

<b>                     AGNES
</b>          Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess
          coming?

Gru stares down at Agnes' big excited eyes. He opens his
mouth to tell her the truth, but can't do it.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Any minute now!

Agnes squeals with excitement and runs off.

<b>                     AGNES
</b>          Yayyy!

Gru looks worried--what do I do now?    He signals two minions.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Stall them.


<b>EXT: BACKYARD - LATER
</b>
A hand-painted piece of cardboard reading "THE MAGIC SHOW" is
placed on an easel. Agnes and all of the little kids sit in
a semicircle on the grass. Two minions dressed as magicians
are doing a magic act with Edith as their assistant. One
minion blows up a balloon and puts it in Edith's mouth. Then
the other whips out a CHAINSAW and fires it up, heading
toward her.

Margo sees this and quickly intervenes.

<b>                    MARGO
</b>          Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright.
          That's enough of the magic show!

The minions don't hide their disappointment.

<b>                     MINIONS
</b>          Awwww.
<b>          DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO &amp; KEN DRAFT   5.
</b>

Margo suddenly looks around as if she just heard something.

<b>                    MARGO
</b>          Wait, did you hear that? It
          sounded like the twinkling sounds
          of magical fairy dust.

<b>                    AGNES
</b>              (gasps)
          It's the fairy princess!   She's
          coming!

Margo gasps and points up to the sky.

<b>                      MARGO
</b>          Look!

Edith spits out her magic balloon in horror and we follow it
up to reveal--

Gru. Dressed in a PUFFY PINK DRESS, fairy wings, glittery
eyelashes and tiara and magical wand.

Up on top of Gru's house, the minions struggle to lower him
down on a rope. Edith's balloon floats by and distracts
them.

They let go of the rope and Gru swings wildly, smashing into
the wall of the house and crashing to the ground.

<b>                      GRU
</b>          Aaaaaahh!

He stands up and tries to cover.

Agnes SIGHS HAPPILY, in awe of the fairy princess.

<b>                    GRU (CONT'D)
</b>              (in falsetto)
          It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The
          most magical fairy princess of all!
          And I am here to wish Princess
          Agnes a very happy birthday!

Gru sprinkles the girls with glitter and they continue to
stare, frozen. Then a LITTLE GIRL raises her hand and speaks
with a lisp.

<b>                    LITTLE GIRL
</b>          How come you're tho fat?

Gru grits his teeth, then forces a smile and speaks with a
high-pitched, dreamy voice.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Because my house is made of candy
          and sometimes I eat instead of
          facing my problems.

The girl starts to ask another question.

<b>                    LITTLE GIRL
</b>          How come you have-

Gru cuts her off with a puff of fairy dust to the face.   She
<b>COUGHS.
</b>
<b>                     GRU
</b>          Okay!   Time for cake!

As the kids run to the table, Agnes approaches Gru.

<b>                    AGNES
</b>          Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're
          the best fairy princess ever!

Gru smiles.

<b>                    GRU
</b>              (in falsetto)
          You are welcome, little girl.

She runs off, but quickly returns.

<b>                    AGNES
</b>              (whispers in his ear)
          I know it's really you, Gru. I'm
          just pretending for the other kids.

She runs off again to join her friends. Gru watches her go.
Couldn't be happier. Then he is approached by JILLIAN, a
heavily-Botoxed mom.

<b>                    JILLIAN
</b>          Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the
          Party!

<b>                    GRU
</b>              (forcing a smile)
          Hello, Jillian.

<b>                    JILLIAN
</b>          Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb
          here, but my friend Natalie is
          recently single, and...

</b>

In the background, a homely NATALIE leans against a buffet
table and seductively raises her eyebrows at Gru. The table
collapses to the ground beneath her.

<b>                     GRU
</b>               (realizes what's going on)
           No, no, no, get off of the limb
           right now. No limb.

<b>                     JILLIAN
</b>           Oh, come on...she's a riot. She
           sings karaoke, she has a lot of
           free time, looks aren't that
           important to her...

In the background, Natalie inadvertently walks in front of a
bottle pitch game, is struck by a ball, and falls to the
ground.

<b>                     GRU
</b>           No, Jill's, that is not happening.
           Seriously. I'm fine.

<b>                     JILLIAN
</b>               (calling after Gru)
           Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How
           about my cousin Linda?

Gru walks off, passing by Edith and Margo.

<b>                        GRU
</b>           No.

<b>                     JILLIAN
</b>           Oh, oh! I know someone whose
           husband just died!

SPLASH!   Suddenly Jillian is sprayed in the face with water.

Reveal Gru holding a HOSE with a SPRAY NOZZLE.

<b>                        GRU
</b>           I'm sorry.     I did not see you
           there.

SPLASH!   He sprays her again.    She falls down.

<b>                        GRU (CONT'D)
</b>           Or there.

He drops the hose and walks away, CHUCKLING softly.

<b>EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DUSK
</b>
Gru takes Kyle out to the front yard.

<b>CAMERA POV
</b>
A camera with nightvision is watching them. The screen
analyzes Kyle and a readout comes out as "SPECIES: UNKNOWN."
Kyle sniffs Gru's flowers.

<b>                       GRU
</b>             Kyle... Kyle!

Then it analyzes Gru and the readout says "TARGET ACQUIRED."

<b>                       GRU (CONT'D)
</b>             Ky--Kyle!   No, do not do your
             business on the petunias!

Kyle lifts up his leg next to Gru's flowers.

He picks Kyle up and places him next to his neighbor's bush.

<b>                       GRU (CONT'D)
</b>             There you go. Those are Fred's.
             Go crazy.

Kyle does and the bush immediately withers and dies.         Gru
<b>CHUCKLES.

<b>                         GRU (CONT'D)

<b>                         VOICE (O.S.)
</b>             Mr. Gru?

Gru turns and sees Lucy Wilde standing there.

<b>                        GRU
</b>             Wha?   I didn't... What... Yes?

<b>                       LUCY

                 (realizes her badge is
                  upside down)
             Oh. Whoops.
                 (clears her throat, all
                  business)
             Sorry, you're gonna have to come

</b>

Gru whips out his FREEZE RAY and fires it.       A WALL OF ICE
heads for Lucy.

But before it gets to her, Lucy pulls out a retractable gun
from her purse, which acts as a FLAMETHROWER. Melting the
ice.

<b>                    LUCY
</b>          You know you really should announce
          your weapons after you fire them,
          Mr. Gru. For example--

She pulls out a LIPSTICK. Fires it at Gru. The tip flies
through the air and connects with his chest, latching on.
ZZZZZAPPP! It tases him, which sends his body flailing in
different funny poses before passing out.

<b>                    LUCY (CONT'D)
</b>          Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so
          good.


<b>EXT: STREET - LATER
</b>
Lucy tries to drag Gru to her car, but he's too heavy.

<b>                         LUCY
</b>          Man.    Ugh.     Large...person.

She gets an idea.

Lucy gets into her car. In the background, we see Gru begin
to come to, but he is struck by Lucy's car as she pulls back
and is knocked out again.

<b>                    LUCY (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh...sorry!

Closer now, Lucy gets out and stuffs his body into the trunk.

Just then Tom and Stuart come out of Gru's garage and see
their boss being loaded in. Lucy struggles to close the
trunk.

<b>                    LUCY (CONT'D)
</b>          Get...in...there...you...big...man!

SLAM! Lucy finally slams the trunk then quickly gets into
the vehicle.

Tom and Stuart exchange horrified looks.

</b>          Boss!

</b>

They take off running after the car as it pulls away, running
as fast as their tiny legs will carry them. They get right
behind it and Tom LEAPS up onto the trunk. He reaches his
hand out to Stuart, who is falling behind.

<b>                    TOM
</b>          Koom ey lah!

<b>                    STUART
</b>          Koom ey lah! Koom ey lah!

Stuart leaps for the bumper and Tom catches him by his
overall straps. Tom holds on tight as Stuart dangles from
the back of the car, his overall straps stretching way out.

<b>                    STUART (CONT'D)
</b>          Aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah!

As Lucy turns a corner, he slams into some garbage cans and
ends up skiing behind the car in a cardboard box.

Now in the box, Stuart continues to ride behind the car, and
even starts to get the hang of that, too. He waves at Tom,
and Tom waves back.

<b>                    STUART (CONT'D)
</b>          Woooo!

<b>                    TOM
</b>          Ooooh!

All is good until they go past a clothesline and a sheet gets
stuck on Stuart.

The sheet forms a parasail which lifts Stuart up into the
air. He strikes a Superman flying pose. Then a flock of
GEESE fly toward him and one actually slams into his face.

<b>                    STUART
</b>          Quack quack!

It SQUAWKS at him as it flies off.

Lucy spots the commotion in her side view mirror and slams on
the brakes. SCREECH! Both minions fly forward--


<b>INT: LUCY'S CAR - SAME

Lucy sees this, drives forward, and opens the convertible
top, causing the Minions to land right in the passenger's
seat. They strike threatening karate poses.

Lucy tases them and they pass out.       She floors it.

Lucy's car continues driving until it reaches a crowded PIER.
And doesn't stop. It drives right off the end of the pier.
A confused fisherman leaps for his life.

<b>INT: OCEAN - SAME
</b>
Lucy's car now transforms into an UNDERWATER VEHICLE. As the
minions come to, one of them tries playing with the radio
until Lucy slaps his hand away. They speed through the sea
and an octopus slams into her windshield. She turns on the
wipers, which hits the octopus in the face until he's had
enough and swims off in a cloud of ink.

She HONKS her HORN as she passes through a school of fish.

<b>                        MINIONS
</b>           Whoa...

As the fish pass the Minions look ahead to see a shark
heading for them with his mouth open. They SCREAM. Lucy
quickly steers the car out of harm's way. They pass by
several more sharks until they arrive at a GIANT SUBMARINE
with the letters "AVL" on the side.

A HATCH opens and Lucy's car goes inside.       The hatch closes

Lucy's car lowers into the center of the room as a large
circular table assembles around it, effectively locking them
in.

Lucy and the Minions get out of the car. She pushes a button
on her remote and Gru, with a starfish attached to his head,
is ejected from the trunk.

The Minion with the banana in his mouth shrugs.

A single apple is passed down a line of Minions in the least
efficient way possible.

A few Minions mash fruits in large vats ala "I Love Lucy."

One wears a bunch of fruit on his head like Carmen Miranda
and sings the CHIQUITA BANANA song. His supervisor comes
over and tells him to get back to work.

The Minion tries to get out of the vat of fruit, but slips
and falls down into a large test-tube filled with mashed
fruit.

Then all of the mashed fruit is flushed down a large hole
where it is injected into jelly jars passing by on a conveyor
belt. The trapped Minion is injected into one of the jars.

Seven minions are lined up with seven fart guns. Dr. Nefario

Dr. Nefario COUGHS.     His eyes are watering (and not only from
the smell).

</b>           Farewell, my friends.

The minions CRY. Dr. Nefario pushes another button on the
scooter, transforming it into flying mode. He GUNS the
engine and it begins flying away. At the slowest pace
possible. Everyone just stands there awkwardly.

A Minion wears a French Maid's outfit and SINGS as he vacuums
the floor. The doorbell rings.

The Minion opens the door to see who it is.

A shadow falls across the terrified minion as something
unseen abducts him.

The vacuum moves back and forth across the floor by itself.
Another Minion walks by wearing a different Maid outfit. He
doesn't see the other Minion and closes the door.

Then he opens it again, cleans the doorknob, and closes it.

Gru comes down the escalator wearing the sunglasses, with the
three disguised Minions behind him. Stuart gets his dress
caught in the escalator. It comes off and he hides in a
nearby potted plant.

Gru glances at a store called the "EAGLE HAIR CLUB." He then
arrives at a charming, pink CUPCAKE STORE. The sign reads,
"BAKE MY DAY" Gru frowns and takes off his sunglasses.

<b>                       GRU

Gru unlocks the door and enters. JINGLE! BELLS on the door
ring. The inside is sugary and clean and quaint. Gru takes
it all in. Then turns to the minions.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Alright, here is the cupcake recipe
          I got off the internet.

The minions excitedly grab the recipe and head for the
kitchen. Gru kicks Stuart, who is still staggering around in
the potted plant.

Gru is left alone. He looks around. Sees a BUNNY CUPCAKE in
a glass cake dish. Then a SHARK CUPCAKE in the next cake
dish. And in the next dish he sees Lucy's head. She makes a
funny face.

Gru SCREAMS, which causes Lucy to SCREAM and jump up, hitting
her head on one of the shelves, sending all of the CUPCAKES
flying.

Lucy immediately goes into action, using incredible and
frankly weird-looking MARTIAL ARTS MOVES to dispatch the
cupcakes as they fly toward her.

</b>          Ha! Yaa!      Ho! Ooof!   Zaaa!   Ay-ay-

to Gru, out of breath.

Gru has a cupcake stuck to the top of his head, frosting side
down. Lucy gestures as if he's got a little food on his
face.

leaves a long smear on Gru's face.

</b>          Here, I'll-- I'll get it.

Gru stands frozen as she tries to clean him up.

Lucy backs off.

<b>                       LUCY

Gru SIGHS and wipes the frosting off his face.

Gru is about to respond when Dave the minion comes out the
kitchen door. He carries a cupcake in the shape of a Minion.

Immediately Lucy moves with lightning-quick reflexes. She
smashes his cupcake, flips him into the air, and pins him to

Classic Spaghetti western sepia-toned shot of El Macho
looking menacing. He looks like the large Hispanic man from
the mall, only younger and wearing a Lucha Libre outfit and
mask (a mask which looks similar to the one Gru imagined).

El Macho pushes the BARKEEP out of the way and grabs a large
bottle from behind the bar.

<b>                    GRU (V.O.)

El Macho pours himself a shot and then smashes the bottle
over his own head.

He reaches down and pulls up a rattlesnake from below the
bar. He squeezes its head, squirting venom into the shot
glass. He drinks it down and then eats the glass.

He sticks the snake's fangs into a few dollars that he leaves
on the bar, before breaking through the wall behind him,
leaving an EL Macho-shaped hole.

Back on the floor, three arm-in-arm minions take the chorus.
One of them clearly having had one too many sundaes is being
held up by the other two.

Another minion tries to carry empty mugs down a spiral
staircase, but he's knocked off by a bunch of minions running
up the other way.

Several minions sit around a communal bowl of ice cream,
lazily sipping at it through long straws.

Gru enters and takes it all in.

Other minions raid an ice cream cart, hanging from the
canopy, drinking directly from the spouts.

A SPOTLIGHT comes down from above, lighting up the terrified
minions. Before they can scream...

WOOSH! Jerry is sucked up into the air as if being abducted
by aliens. Kevin grabs onto a flower, and then the cat to
try and anchor himself down, but they both fly up into the
air.

The light goes out. A few seconds later the light comes back
on and drops the cat back down. It turns off again and the

it.

lunges and covers the chicken with the table cloth.

chicken and Gru's head inside. A muffled scream comes from

Eduardo, carrying the chicken, makes his way to the kitchen.
Grabs a LARGE KNIFE off of a table.

Gru and Lucy react to hearing Eduardo's voice. Gru pulls a
LASER CUTTER out of his jacket. Aims it at the ceiling.

Eduardo approaches the kitchen, brandishing the knife. Ready
to confront any intruders. He shoves open the door and sees
chips and the salsa container sitting in the open wall safe.

Eduardo enters the room, just in time to see a pair of legs
disappear into the ceiling.

Lucy quickly pops down and hits him in the eyes with her foam-
shooting watch.

Lucy and Gru quickly run through the mall.

SMASH! The car crashes through the glass doors and speeds
through the mall. They crash into a bunch of cleaning
supplies being pushed by a janitor.

Gru and Lucy watch them from the balcony above.

<b>                     LUCY
</b>          Hm.   Subtle.

They both run over to meet the car at the escalators.

The car heads for the escalators. As they reach the bottom,
Gru and Lucy realize the minions are about to go up the other
one!

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Over here, over here!    Over...
          here.

Too late. The minions shake as they go up the bumpy stairs.
Once they reach the top they take a left and start driving in
circles around the balcony. Gru pulls out a grappling hook
and aims for the balcony railing.

<b>                    GRU (CONT'D)
</b>              (grabbing Lucy)

They shoot up and land right back where they started - at
Salsa &amp; Salsa! The minions zoom by in the car and Gru SIGHS
in exasperation.

Just then, Eduardo emerges from the restaurant with fire in
his eyes and a knife in his hand. Eduardo produces many more
KNIVES and heads straight for them.

<b>                    EDUARDO
</b>          I have you now!

BAM! Eduardo is struck unconscious by Lucy's car.       Just in
time.

Lucy opens the car door. One of the minions holds a
toothpick in his hand and leans on the steering wheel,
seductively.

<b>                    DAVE
</b>          Rawr, rawr!

The other minion revs the engine suggestively.

Eduardo starts to wake up.    The car zooms past him.

CRASH! Lucy's car plummets towards the ground. Gru SCREAMS
hysterically, but Lucy just hits a button and the car
TRANSFORMS into a jet.

They fly off into the night sky.


<b>EXT: GRU'S NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING
</b>
It's a beautiful morning. An ICE CREAM TRUCK makes its way
down the street (playing the song the minions were singing
earlier). It stops and a couple of CHILDREN run to meet it.

Stuart opens Gru's front door, having heard the commotion.
Two other minions approach as well. Stuart spots the ice
cream truck and points to it, excited.

<b>                      STUART
</b>          Oh!   Oh!   Gelato!

And then suddenly a MOB OF MINIONS appears running for the
ice cream truck alongside the group of children. The minions
shove the children aside and clamor around the truck holding
out their money.

<b>                       MINIONS
</b>          Gelato!     Gelato! Gelato!

Stuart pushes himself to the top of the unruly pack and tries
to maintain order.

<b>                      STUART
</b>          Stopa!    Stopa!!

A hush comes over the minions.

<b>                    STUART (CONT'D)
</b>              (knocking on the truck)
          Hey-ho! Gelato!

Suddenly the ice cream cone on top of the truck transforms
into a LARGE TUBE and extends itself above the minions.
Stuart offers the tube a wad of cash and attempts to order
gelato, but the it begins SUCKING the minions into it. ZUP!
<b>ZUP! ZUP!
</b>
One by one the minions (dozens of them, including the minion
with his head still trapped in the jelly jar) are sucked into
the truck until there is only one left. He tries to make a
break for it, but the truck lowers a popsicle in front of
him.

He licks it, his tongue sticks, and he is yanked back into
the ice cream cone. The it closes and the truck drives away.

The children look on puzzled.

The hole that Lucy's car crashed through last night has been
patched with plywood boards.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL that Gru is inside a GARBAGE CAN
DISGUISE. Next to him is Lucy, also in a GARBAGE CAN
DISGUISE, using binoculars.

Floyd Eaglesan attempts to entice a customer to visit his
business, Eagle Hair Club.

          Go...go.

Gru quickly stands up, revealing his legs, and takes several
steps toward Eagle Hair Club. Floyd looks over his shoulder,
and Gru stops. Floyd enters Eagle Hair Club and Gru inches
closer.

Suddenly a MAN approaches the trash can with a steaming cup
of coffee. The binoculars readout says "WARNING! EXTREMELY

The man goes to throw the coffee in the trash and we see
Gru's legs pop out from beneath the can.

The man looks confused and tries again.     Gru dodges and takes
off running. The man chases after him.

Gru accidentally knocks into a bent-over woman's rear end.
Insulted, she turns around, sees the man with the coffee, and
slaps him across the face. Unfortunately, Gru doesn't see
the escalator ahead and goes tumbling down the moving stairs.

CRASH! BANG! CLANG! Finally, Gru pops out of the trash can
and lands at the bottom of the escalator with a THUD! Flat
on his face, he hears a familiar voice call out.

Gru looks up and sees Margo, Edith and Agnes.

Gru quickly shuffles the girls away from Lucy, trying to get
out of the uncomfortable situation. Gru pulls out his
wallet.

The girls are at the MALL FOUNTAIN. Agnes has her eyes
closed and a very intense look on her face, as if she's
really concentrating on something. There is something in her
tightly clenched fist. She tosses a PENNY. Then opens her
eyes, waiting for her wish to come true.

Then Edith emerges from the water wearing a DIVING MASK AND
SNORKEL, hands full of COINS.

Margo is busy texting.       Then something offscreen catches her
eye.

It's a boy. This is ANTONIO. Suave, cool, and a bit
dangerous. We watch in SLOW MOTION as he strolls behind the
fountain, and then disappears in its spraying water.

Margo looks for Antonio.       Backs into the fountain and nearly
falls into it.

Gru is about to respond when suddenly Edith and Agnes burst
in, out of breath.

Gru, Edith and Agnes race across the mall. Then Agnes points
over to the salsa restaurant as Margo and Antonio walk in.

<b>INT: EDUARDO'S SALSA &amp; SALSA - DAY
</b>
Gru enters to see Margo and Antonio sitting together in the
back of the restaurant together. Margo laughs at something
Antonio said.

<b>                    MARGO
</b>          Oh, you're so funny...

<b>                      EDITH
</b>          Gross!    Look, they're in love!

These words hit Gru like a smack in the face.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Oh, no, no, no! Do not say that
          they are...no no no, no!

He storms in.    Edith and Agnes follow.

<b>                      MARGO
</b>          Wow.    You're so complicated.

Gru storms over to Margo.     Attempts a smile.

<b>                      GRU
</b>          Margo.    What is going on here?

<b>                    MARGO
</b>          Oh! Gru, se llama Antonio.       Me

</b>          Me llama-lama-ding-dong, who cares.
          Let's go.

SALSA MUSIC begins to play and a curtain opens across the
room. WOOSH! Someone leaps out, spinning like a tornado,
then lands in the middle of the restaurant with a flourish.
It's Eduardo.

<b>                      MARGO
</b>          Whoa!

Everyone in the restaurant cheers.    Gru frowns.   Not this
guy!

</b>

The music continues and Eduardo dances across the floor and
out into the mall where he grabs a passing SHOPPER and pulls
her into the restaurant.

The confused woman holds on for the ride    as Eduardo twirls
and dances her all around the floor. He     dips her and she
melts, as do all of the women watching.     Eduardo gazes into
the woman's eyes and produces a business    card.

<b>                    EDUARDO
</b>          Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

The woman grabs the business card from his hand with her
teeth.

Then Eduardo flings her across the floor and she twirls back
out into the mall where she knocks over her confused husband.
Then the song comes to an end and Eduardo strikes a final
pose.

Everyone in the studio cheers.

<b>                     GIRLS
</b>          Yeah!   Wahoo! Cool!   Awesome!

Everyone except Gru.   Eduardo walks over to him and gives him
a big warm hug.

<b>                    EDUARDO
</b>          So good to see you again, mi

Gru tries to get out of the hug as quickly as he can.

<b>                    ANTONIO
</b>          Oh, I see you have already met my

          get you something.

Gru looks down and sees Eduardo's chicken glaring at him.    It
SQUAWKS. It's unsettling.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Oh... look at you.

Eduardo scoops the chicken up.

Gru tries to pet the chicken but Pollito lunges at him.

<b>                    EDUARDO
</b>          Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Pollito is
          usually very friendly.

          He had a rough night.

The chicken stares relentlessly.   Gru CHUCKLES nervously.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Well, we really should be going.
          Girls, come on.

Gru tries to gather the girls, but Eduardo stops him, pushing
Antonio and Margo closer together.

<b>                    EDUARDO
</b>          That is a pity. Young love is
          beautiful, no?

              (chuckling nervously)
          You know, they're not in love.
          They hardly know each other!

Eduardo suddenly lights up, having an idea.

<b>                    EDUARDO
</b>          You are right, Cabeza de Huevo!
          They must get to know each other
          better. Antonio, why don't you
          invite your girlfriend and her
          family to our Cinco de Mayo party?

</b>          Si!

The girls are all thrilled at this, as is Antonio. As if on
cue, MUSIC begins playing and they all begin dancing
together.

Antonio takes Margo's hand and twirls her across the floor.
Gru stares at Antonio with a look that could kill. A waiter
comes by to give Gru a party drink, and he promptly crushes
the glass with his bare hands. His eye twitches.

The minion with the popsicle stuck to his tongue wakes up on
a beach, disoriented. He slowly sits up--

--and sees hundreds of minions partying!

This is where all the abducted minions were taken!

There are minions sitting at a Tiki bar, being tended by a
bartender minion...

...The French maid minion and a ukelele-playing minion are
dancing in the sand. They wave at him...

Meanwhile, Jerry approaches the popsicle minion with two
bananas. He gives him one, does a Hawaiian dance with the
other, then runs off for the water. Popsicle minion tears
off his overalls and follows suit.

The Popsicle Minion, now nude, runs across the sand and jumps
into a clear, blue ocean. We pull back to reveal that
unbeknownst to any of the minions, this is all happening
inside a large terrarium, and they are being watched by a
mysterious figure in silhouette.


<b>INT: FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Gru sits with his laptop. He's on the eVillain site. He
clicks through various images of El Macho. Edith chases
Kevin, who has the wig in his mouth. A minion sets a stack
of magazines on the coffee table.

Then "YOU ARE NO LONGER CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET" appears on
Gru's screen. He grimaces and calls out.

<b>                       GRU

Gru waves his arms.

Gru looks even more uncomfortable.

Just then Lucy (unseen by Gru) enters the restaurant.     She
approaches the HOSTESS.

The Hostess leaves. Lucy looks around and then spots Gru.
Sees him with the wig and Shannon who is now doing crunches
on the floor. Lucy narrows her eyes, then has an idea. She
presses a button on her watch, which transforms into a HIGH
TECH EAVESDROPPING DEVICE, and puts it in her ear. Now she's
able to hear Gru and Shannon talking. She watches them,
intrigued. Shannon has returned to her seat.

Lucy presses a button on her watch and a target sight pops
out.

Gru watches in horror as Shannon reaches across the table for
the wig.

Quickly Lucy presses another button on her watch which fires
a MINI-DART GUN at Shannon.

PLIP. The mini-dart goes into Shannon's butt, knocking her
out instantly. And saving Gru from certain humiliation. Gru
stares at the now sleeping Shannon, confused.

Gru quickly removes the wig.

<b>                    LUCY
</b>              (noticing Shannon)
          Wow, looks like your date's out for
          the count. It's like she's been
          shot with a mild moose
          tranquilizer.

Shannon MOANS like a MOOSE, then passes out again.

<b>                    LUCY (CONT'D)
</b>              (winks)
          Yeah, I'm winking `cuz that's what
          actually happened.

AN ITALIAN WAITER approaches.

<b>                    ITALIAN WAITER

          `Scusi, whassa happenin' here?    She
          no like?

<b>                    LUCY
</b>          Oh, she's just uh--
              (makes drinking gesture)

The waiter nods and leaves.

          Oh, oh, si, si...

Lucy turns to Gru.

<b>                    LUCY
</b>          Shall we take her home?


<b>EXT: RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
Gru and Lucy carry an unconscious Shannon out of the
restaurant. Her head gets stuck in the swinging doors on the
way out. They try to dislodge her and accidentally end up
throwing her headfirst into a lamp post. They pick her up
between them, Weekend at Bernie's-style. They wave to a
passing COP. The cop tips his hat.


<b>EXT: SUBURBAN STREET - LATER
</b>
Gru and Lucy get in her car. But it's cramped with Shannon
in there too. She doesn't really fit.

</b>

<b>EXT: SUBURBAN STREET - LATER
</b>
Lucy's car drives down the street. Gru and Lucy now have
plenty of room in the car. We boom up to see that Shannon
has been strapped to the roof like a deer.


<b>EXT: SHANNON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Gru and Lucy arrive at Shannon's house. Lucy comes to an
abrupt stop and Shannon flies off the roof and slams into the
car in front of them.


<b>EXT: SHANNON'S HOUSE - LATER
</b>
Gru and Lucy sit on the front steps of Shannon's house.

<b>                    LUCY
</b>          Well, I think you did it. You just
          officially had the worst date ever.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Huh, tell me about it.

<b>                    LUCY
</b>          Don't worry--it can only get better
          from here, right? But if it
          doesn't, you can always borrow my
          dart gun. I've had to use it on
          one or two dates myself.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Yeah, you know, as far as dates go,
          I think I'm good with just the one.

Gru and Lucy exchange looks.   He CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY.   Time to
go.

<b>                    LUCY
</b>          Well, good night, partner.

She pats his shoulder and walks toward her car.   Gru gets up
to walk beside her.

<b>                    LUCY (CONT'D)
</b>          This was fun.

<b>                     GRU
</b>          Yes.   Surprisingly, it was.

<b>                    LUCY
</b>          Oh, and uh, just between you and

They smile at each other, and she gives him a peck on the
cheek and walks away.

<b>                    LUCY (CONT'D)
</b>          See you tomorrow!

Gru smiles a big smile. Shannon slumps over on the porch
behind him. Could he be...falling in love?


<b>INT: GRU'S BEDROOM - SAME
</b>
RIIIING! Gru's ALARM CLOCK goes off. He reaches out and
turns it off. Ready to greet the day.


<b>INT: SHOWER - DAY
</b>
Gru happily washes in the shower, acting out a puppet show
with his rubber ducky.

<b>                       GRU
</b>          Quack!     Quack!    Quack!


<b>INT: BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
Gru brushes his teeth with two toothbrushes. He jokingly
arranges them in his mouth like walrus tusks, then BARKS like
a seal.


<b>INT: KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
HEART-SHAPED PANCAKES are served to the girls sitting at the
table. Edith makes a face at getting hers.

<b>                       AGNES
</b>          Yeah!

<b>                    MARGO
</b>          So I take it the date went well?

<b>                     GRU
</b>          No!   It was horrible!

He laughs gleefully.    The girls exchange looks.    What?

Then he skips out of the room, dancing with a minion in the
kitchen. Agnes's face lights up. Yes!

</b>

<b>EXT: STREET - DAY
</b>
Gru makes his way to work--on foot:

--he strolls down the sidewalk.

--he passes a MAILMAN and gives him a high five.

<b>                       GRU
</b>          High-five!

Then a POLICEMAN, with whom he exchanges mimed gunfire.

Then a NUN, with whom he bumps rumps.

<b>                       GRU (CONT'D)
</b>          Bump it.

Seeing something offscreen, Gru GASPS.

--he stops traffic so a happy family of DUCKS can cross the
street.

--he plays ultimate frisbee with a bunch of COLLEGE KIDS,
balancing the spinning disc on his pointy nose.

--he joins a group of OLD LADIES doing Tai Chi.

--he "air" drums with a couple of BUCKET DRUMMERS on the
curb.

--he picks a flower, then walks by a MAN and a WOMAN sitting
alone with their backs to each other at a cafe. He quickly
turns their chairs around so they find each other and hands
the man the flower for the woman. They smile and Gru goes
his merry way.


<b>INT: SHOPPING MALL - DAY
</b>
Gru continues happily dancing through the mall on his way to
the cupcake shop. He shimmies with a FAT WOMAN on the
escalator, then GAPS and stops suddenly upon seeing Eagle
Hair Club closed. The MUSIC abruptly ends.

Gru sees Silas speaking with an AVL AGENT.    Gru approaches
him.

<b>                    GRU
</b>              (confused)
          Mr. Ramsbottom?

<b>                    GRU

<b>                    SILAS
</b>          We got him.

<b>                     GRU
</b>          Got who?

<b>                    SILAS
</b>          Floyd Eaglesan! Our agents located
          a secret room in his shop last
          night, and uh, discovered this!

He snaps his fingers and an AVL agent hands him a METAL
CANISTER in a ziploc bag. Silas holds it up.

<b>                    SILAS (CONT'D)
</b>          It's empty, but we found traces of
          the PX-41 serum in it. He's our
          man. So somehow, in spite of your
          incompetence, we solved this one.

TWO AVL AGENTS carry Floyd away in handcuffs.

<b>                    FLOYD
</b>          I was framed! You won't get away
          with this! Get your mitts off of
          me! I am a legitimate businessman!

Gru turns back to Silas.    He is stunned by this.

<b>                     GRU
</b>          Ah.   Alright. So...what now?

<b>                    SILAS
</b>          Well, now you're free to go back to
          your "business." Mmmm. Jams and
          jellies. And it looks like Agent
          Wilde will be transferring to our
          Australian branch.

<b>                    GRU
</b>              (in shock)
          Australia...?

<b>                     SILAS
</b>          Yes. But thank you--for
          everything. And by everything of

</b>

Silas walks away to join the AVL agents.   Gru stares blankly,
sadly. And then Lucy approaches him.

<b>                       LUCY
</b>          Hey there.

<b>                       GRU

          And now you're going to Australia?

<b>                     LUCY

          working on my accent.

          Wallaby. Diggeri-doo. Hugh

<b>                     GRU

<b>                    LUCY
</b>          Thanks. You too.
              (remembering)
          Oh. Here. I wanted to give you
          this.

She holds out her lipstick taser.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Your lipstick taser?

<b>                    LUCY
</b>          Yeah, it's just a memento. Just,
          you know, from the first time we
          met.

<b>                      GRU
</b>          Oh.    Thank you, Lucy.

Gru accepts the lipstick taser.

Lucy ignores this and just waits, not wanting to leave.     She
and Gru stand there awkwardly.

<b>                     GRU
</b>          Well... it looks like they need
          you, so...

<b>                    LUCY
</b>          Yeah, I uh, I better go.    Bye, Gru.

And she leaves Gru.    He stands there.   Completely miserable.


<b>EXT: STREET - DAY
</b>
Gru walks back home, completely depressed.

Walks past the college kids playing frisbee.      Catches the
frisbee and tosses it down the sewer.

Walks past the group of bucket drummers.    As he passes he
KICKS one of the buckets.

Walks past the old ladies doing Tai Chi. As they balance on
one leg he pushes them all and they all fall over.


<b>EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
It's pouring rain.    Gru sits alone outside his house.
Miserable.

And then an UMBRELLA approaches him. It looks like it's
traveling on its own. But when it gets closer it lifts up,
revealing Agnes.

<b>                    AGNES
</b>          I brought you an umbrella.

Gru takes the umbrella and Agnes joins him.    They both huddle
under it.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Ah, thank you.

</b>          Remember when you said that I liked

          right.

Agnes's face lights up.

</b>

<b>                       AGNES
</b>          Really?

<b>                    GRU
</b>          Yes, but...well, she's moving away.
              (sadly)
          I'm never going to see her again.

Agnes's face falls. All her hopes and dreams shattered.     But
she tries to encourage Gru.

<b>                    AGNES
</b>          Is there anything I can do to help?

<b>                    GRU

Gru thinks.

Gru is on the PHONE.

          Okay, here is the question. "Would
          you like to--to go out on a date?"

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Dave the minion standing across from Gru,
pretending to be on a cell phone on the other end of the
line. And wearing a RED-HAIRED WIG. He shrugs.

<b>                       DAVE
</b>          Eh, no.

<b>                    GRU

He stares at Lucy's card. Then turns to the phone. It's a
stand-off. He does stretches and calisthenics to psych
himself up. He SIGHS.

<b>                    GRU (CONT'D)
</b>          I can do this.

He stares down the phone again. It sits there, taunting him.
We cut back and forth between Gru and the phone, until
finally--

<b>                      GRU (CONT'D)
</b>          Agh!    I hate you!

He produces a FLAMETHROWER and burns up the phone.    Dave
dives out of the way.

</b>                 (satisfied)
          Ah.

CHOP! Suddenly AXES chop through the wall. Several minions
in FIREMEN'S GEAR enter.  Another minion imitates a siren
through a bullhorn.

</b>          Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!

One continues chopping everything in sight with his axe, then
chops his way right through the wall of the house and falls
outside. Another minion brings in a MASSIVE HOSE, turns it
on, and goes flying around the room as it whips around like a
snake. Dave tests out a fire extinguisher.

<b>                      SIREN MINION (CONT'D)

keeps on making the noise.

</b>          Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo!

Dave fires the extinguisher at the Siren minion. He makes
the noise again and Dave sprays him with the fire
extinguisher, sending him flying offscreen.

<b>INT: MINION BEACH HABITAT - DAY
</b>
The minions enjoy another day at the beach. Kevin the Golf
minion drifts out in the water on an inner tube. He fixes
his coconut bra, then unpeels a banana and eats it.


<b>INT: CONTROL ROOOM - SAME
</b>
A hand pulls a lever in a control room.


<b>INT: MINION BEACH HABITAT - SAME
</b>
Suddenly a WHIRLPOOL appears in the water right next to him.
He gets sucked into it.

Kevin is pulled down to the bottom of the habitat and into a
<b>TUBE.
</b>

<b>INT: LAB - SAME
</b>
Kevin pops out of the tube and lands in a waiting metallic
chair. His hat follows him down the tube and lands on his
head.

CLICK! A metal strap fastens around his waist.    He shrugs
and continues to eat the banana.

<b>                     FRENCH MAID MINION (O.S.)
</b>          Kevin?

Kevin looks over and sees the French Maid Minion strapped
into a chair nearby. He has a banana too.

They raise their bananas in the air.

And then a GIANT DEVICE appears, looking like a huge, scary
HYPODERMIC NEEDLE filled with purple liquid. The needle
comes toward the French Maid Minion.

MORPHS into a PURPLE MINION.

<b>                     PURPLE FRENCH MAID MINION
</b>          Blaaah!

Kevin points and LAUGHS at him. He doesn't see the needle
come down behind him. It injects him with the serum as well.

Gru's vehicle pulls up in front of the open gate in front of
Eduardo's house. His car almost knocks a bunch of parked
cars off the cliff.

The grounds are set up for the most elaborate and fun Cinco
de Mayo party of all time. Sumptuous spreads of MEXICAN FOOD
everywhere. LANTERNS hanging from trees. PEOPLE having a

As Gru turns to Margo he sees that she is holding hands with
Antonio, face-to-face, almost close enough to kiss.

Gru furrows his brow.

<b>                      GRU

He grabs Antonio and drags him far away from Margo.

<b>EXT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER
</b>
Gru, sneaking through the party, spots Antonio and Margo
dancing.

Gru sneaks up on Antonio, using the flashing strobe lights to
cover his approach. Suddenly Antonio is gone and Gru is the
one dancing with Margo, who has her back to him and is
oblivious to what's going on.

Antonio reappears and kicks Gru in the crotch from behind.
He dances once again with Margo while Gru hunches over in
pain.

Gru then gets the upper hand and starts choking Antonio and
shaking him. Margo turns around and sees this.

Gru and Antonio see they are being watched by Margo and start
casually dancing next to each other as if nothing is wrong.

As the song ends, Margo takes Antonio's hand and pulls him
away from Gru off the dance floor.

Gru is defeated and all alone.


<b>INT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER
</b>
Gru sits by himself in the corner, sulking and staring at
Lucy's lipstick taser. A WAITER walks by and places a
tortilla chip sombrero on his head with the rim filled with
guacamole. He breaks off a piece, dips it, and eats it.

<b>                    EDUARDO (O.S.)
</b>          So glad you could make it, mi

Gru looks up and sees Eduardo standing there.   Gru quickly
hides the taser.

</b>          Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong.
          I'm just chilling with the

Gru takes another scoop of guacamole, smiles, and gives a
thumbs up. A glob of guacamole falls from the sombrero.
Eduardo puts his arm around him.

</b>          Yes. But we are survivors.
          There's much more to us than meets
          the eye. Enjoy the party.

Eduardo gives Gru a meaningful look. And then walks away.
Gru watches him go. Deep in thought.

Gru notices Eduardo suspiciously sneak away from the party
and head into the house.

Gru gets up from the table and follows Eduardo. As he walks
through the party, several partygoers break tortilla pieces
off his sombrero to eat.


<b>INT: EDUARDO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Eduardo enters a dimly-lit room. Gru sneaks behind and peers
through a crack in the door.


<b>INT: SECRET MAYAN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Eduardo stands in the center of a secret room, which is lined
with Mayan-style totem poles. He dances on the tile floor,
which lights up and plays "La Cucaracha" with each strategic
step.

The musical pattern is a code which opens a secret passageway
through the largest totem's mouth. Eduardo enters and the
mouth closes behind him.

Gru tentatively enters the room. He pauses at the tile
floor. He tries to replicate Eduardo's "La Cucaracha" code,
but a glob of guacamole from his sombrero falls to the floor
and hits the wrong tile. This activates a booby-trapped
totem pole, which halves Gru's sombrero with a spear.

Gru observes the destroyed sombrero in his hands.

<b>                       GRU (CONT'D)
</b>          Huh.

Gru attempts the code again, but missteps.    An axe from the
wall swings at him and misses.

<b>                       GRU (CONT'D)
</b>          Oooh!

Gru missteps again and one of the totems lights up and spits
fire at him, burning his face.

<b>                     GRU (CONT'D)
</b>              (dazed)
          Aaaahhh...

He missteps again and a club whacks him over the head.

<b>                       GRU (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh!

One of the totems shoots darts at him, piercing his nose.

Gru falls to the floor.

<b>                       GRU (CONT'D)
</b>          Oooohhh.

His head hits the correct tile, and the Mayan passageway
opens. Gru walks to the door, pointing at the totems and
gloating.

<b>                      GRU (CONT'D)

Lucy sits alone and stares out the window.    Depressed.   She

She grabs an in flight magazine and opens it up to an ad for
wristwatches. It reads; "IN THE SKY, HE IS THE ONE MAN
EVERYONE CAN TRUST" and shows a picture of Gru giving the
thumbs up in a cockpit.

Lucy reacts, shakes her head, and now the picture is just a
regular airline pilot in the cockpit.

Lucy turns the page. It's another ad, saying simply "Gru
Now!" and showing a picture of a muscular Gru diving from a
waterfall. She GASPS and slams the magazine shut, then
slowly reopens it to find the picture is really just a random
muscular guy diving. It says "GO NOW - TO HAWAII!"

Lucy looks up from her magazine to see the flight attendant,
who looks like Gru. She REACTS. Then looks across the aisle
and sees a lady that looks and sounds like Gru, talking to
another man who looks like Gru.

The flight attendant stands up, recovering from her twirl.

The other passengers wave as the plane's oxygen masks fall
from each overhead console. And with that, Lucy jumps from
the plane, holding her purse.

Elevator doors open revealing EL MACHO'S UNDERGROUND LAIR.
Gru stands in the doorway, pulling the dart out of his nose.
The lair is a massive villainous complex that looks a lot

Agnes stops and sees evil minion Kevin already has it in his
mouth.

Agnes screams a crazy HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM. It SHATTERS all
the glass in the room, including the glass in evil minion
Kevin's goggles. He spits out the unicorn. He is slowed him
down for a bit, so Agnes safely grabs the unicorn, and Margo
grabs Agnes's hand.

They run for the elevator to the lower level, with the purple
minion hot on their tails.   The elevator drops just in time.
Evil minion Kevin slams into the glass door.

Gru covers a smeared yellow spot with purple paint.

They approach the front gate, which is closed. Dave boosts
himself onto a stray box and speaks gibberish into the
intercom. He hears Evil Minion gibberish in response. He
responds back in Evil Minion gibberish.

The intercom buzzes and the gate begins to open.

The gate opens and there are DOZENS of PURPLE MINIONS milling
about. They eye Gru and his captors suspiciously.

Dave and Stuart poke Gru with a spear.

Gru, Dave and Stuart have to walk all the way to the house
surrounded on all sides by evil purple minions. The painted
yellow minions are very nervous. The purple minions eye them
as they pass. They GROWL and the yellow minions attempt to
GROWL back.

It's extremely intense, but it looks like they're going to
make it.

Then one of the evil minions makes a slobbery raspberry at
one of the painted ones. They get into a raspberry fight
until the painted minion is grossed out and tries to rub the
slobber off him. It rubs off the purple paint.

One of the evil purple minions points and SCREAMS. They're

They climb a tree up to the roof of the house, only to be
pursued by more minions up there. And the Evil Minions have
devoured the tree so they can't go back that way either.

With no escape, Gru and the minions run up a tower until they
reach the top--a dead end.

Here come the purple minions. They're trapped. Gru kicks
them away and the yellow minions try to fight off the purple
ones. But they are clearly doomed.

And then Gru's ship appears hovering above them! Modified as
a jelly-dispensing weapon and with Dr. Nefario at the
controls! The minions hang on the sides holding JELLY

Gru leaps out of the ship down to the roof El Macho is on.
He has two big jelly weapons in his hands.

Meanwhile the ship flies off with its jelly blasters firing,
and comes to land on the ground below.

The minions and the girls start jumping from the ship.    Agnes
takes aim.

Agnes' gun is a little too big for her and the kick sends her
a bit out of control. But she still manages to hit a number
of Evil Minions. The tide is turning.

Meanwhile, Gru has gone ballistic on the evil minions.   BLAM!
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He takes the remaining few out.

El Macho kicks an evil minion at Gru, but he manages to hit
it with jelly and transform it back to yellow. Gru holds his
gun up to El Macho and gives him a threatening look.

He turns to a computer and pushes a button.

A fountain stops spewing water and underneath it STEEL DOORS
open from the ground. And out of them rises a ROCKET.
Strapped to it is Lucy. Tied to a SHARK with TWO HUNDRED AND
FIFTY POUNDS OF DYNAMITE strapped to her.

But unfortunately he smacks a roof support and drops the
remote. It bonks a bunch of minions on the head and lands on
the ground.

El Macho stares down Gru.   Fire in his eyes.

He pulls out a vial of PX-41 and drinks it. Gru GASPS. El

Gru pulls the trigger on his jelly gun, but he is out of
ammunition. He then pulls out the FREEZE RAY and fires,
encasing El Macho's fists in blocks of ice. El Macho GROWLS
and slams his fists to the ground, shattering the ice and
knocking Gru off the platform and onto a scaffolding. Gru

The scaffolding tips over. El Macho grabs the scaffolding
and holds it above his head, ready to crush Gru.

Suddenly Gru pulls out Lucy's lipstick taser and fires it at
Purple El Macho! The jolt of electricity has him shaking and
dancing and ultimately sizzling and smoking, until he finally
collapses on the ground.

<b>                     LUCY
</b>           Uh, better make it quick!

<b>                     GRU
</b>           If I'd asked you out on a date,
           what would you have said?

<b>                     LUCY
</b>           Are you kidding me?!   Yes!

Gru smiles. Then realizes that the rocket is still careening
toward the volcano. He grabs Lucy.

<b>                       GRU
</b><b>           JUMP!!!
</b>
Gru and Lucy grab hands and leap off the rocket.

The rocket plunges into the volcano.

Gru and Lucy plummet through the air.

KA-BLAAAAM!!! The volcano explodes in a massive tempest of
fire and smoke and lava.

The impact of the blast hits Gru and Lucy and sends them
flying.

SPLASH!   They hit the water.

BAM!   BOOM!   The volcano continues exploding.

SPLASH! Gru emerges, soaking and out of breath.     Fire and
lava flying all around him. He can't find Lucy.

<b>                      GRU (CONT'D)
</b>           Oh!  Lucy!
               (looks around, panicking)
           Lucy! Where are you?!

After a few moments, Lucy also emerges.    Gru is incredibly
relieved.

<b>                       GRU (CONT'D)
</b>           Oh, Lucy!

<b>                       LUCY
</b>           Gru!
<b>         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO &amp; KEN DRAFT      99.
</b>

Lucy smiles and hugs Gru. They both go underwater.       Then
come back up. Sputtering. And in love.

<b>                    LUCY (CONT'D)
</b>          Sorry...I guess you kind of need
          your arms to tread water, huh?

The Minions appear in the rowboat.

<b>                    TOM
</b>              ("Stroke!")
          Mack-oh! Mack-oh!      Mack-oh!

But they pass right by them.

<b>                    GRU
</b>          They'll be back...

<b>TITLE CARD: 147 DATES LATER...
</b>
Romantic music plays under the title card.


<b>EXT: HILLSIDE - DAY
</b>
Four minions, dressed in matching suits, begin to sing a All-
4-One's "I Swear," pronounced "Underwear" in Minionese.

We are at Gru and Lucy's wedding reception. We PULL BACK to
the WEDDING CAKE, and then to Gru and Lucy dancing. As they
dance we see all of the wedding guests watching: Gru's Mom,
Dr. Nefario, Silas, Jillian, Shannon, Natalie, etc.

Gru dips Lucy and they attempt their kiss, but their noses
keep bumping. They finally manage to kiss and the crowd
<b>CHEERS.
</b>
We see the three girls watching in their beautiful bridesmaid
dresses. Agnes can barely contain her glee. PAN OVER TO
Edith, who makes a face.

<b>                    EDITH
</b>          Can I be the first to say--ewwww!

The minions finish the song.

The girls sit at their table.    Agnes clearly has something on
her mind. She SIGHS.

<b>                      AGNES
</b>          Okay.

She stands up on the table.
<b>        DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO &amp; KEN DRAFT    100.
</b>

<b>                       AGNES (CONT'D)
</b>          Excuse me!

Looks out at the crowd, but they can't hear her.

<b>                     AGNES (CONT'D)
</b>          Um...hi!   Excuse me!

She still doesn't have the crowd's attention, so Margo taps
on her glass. Everyone looks to Agnes, who is visibly
nervous.

<b>                    AGNES (CONT'D)
</b>          Uh...hi, everybody! I'd like to
          make some toast. Uh...

She looks out at the crowd. Is really nervous. Looks over
at Gru. He smiles. Mouths "okay." This helps, and Agnes
pulls herself together and recites the Mothers Day poem from
earlier.

<b>                    AGNES (CONT'D)
</b>          She um...she um, kisses my boo-boos.
          She braids my hair.
          We love you mothers, everywhere!

Agnes turns to Lucy and looks her right in the eyes.

<b>                    AGNES (CONT'D)
</b>          And my new mom Lucy is beyond
          compare.

Lucy smiles, melting. The crowd goes "awwwww." Agnes and
Lucy spin around in a hug. The crowd cheers and applauds.
Gru, Margo and Edith join Agnes and Lucy in a group hug. The
family is complete.

<b>                    AGNES (CONT'D)
</b>          To the bride and Gru!

A minion begins to spin The Village People's "YMCA" at the DJ
table. The minions, several of whom are dressed as The
Village People, begin to perform the song. The minion
dressed as the Chiquita banana lady also joins in.

Then the entire family boogies across the dance floor,
including Dr. Nefario and Gru's Mom.

<b>                    AGNES (CONT'D)
</b><b>          I'M SO HAAAAPPPPYYYYYYY!!!!
