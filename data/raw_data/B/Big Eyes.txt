          TIGHT on TWO PAINTED EYES. The pupils are impossibly wide.
          Imploring. The watery rims spill a single tear.
          We PULL OUT... revealing the eyes belong to a child. A young
          girl, fingers clasped pitifully. She's forlorn, alone in a
          dirty gray alley. We feel shame. Compassion. Sorrow...
          Then -- an IDENTICAL girl SLAPS in front of the first one.
          Then another! It's a PRINTING PRESS, the creation of a BLUR
          of sad children.

          CU on two concerned eyes. The same eyes as the paintings. We
          REVEAL they belong to a real girl: JANE, 8. She sits in her
          small house -- a typical young family's, spare and
          underfurnished.

          Suddenly -- Jane's mother MARGARET ULBRICH, 28, rushes through
          frame. Margaret is blonde, yearning, fragile. Terribly
          upset, she is hurriedly packing.
          Margaret throws her clothes in a suitcase.
          She shoves Jane's clothes and toys into another.
          Margaret barrels through the breakfast nook, which is a mini
          art studio -- easel, canvases, paints. She scoops up her
          supplies.

          Margaret runs to the door -- then turns. The hallway is lined
          with her PAINTINGS. Oils and inks of wide-eyed Jane, who
          grows from baby to toddler to child. Hastily, Margaret takes
          them down, each frame leaving an empty mark on the flowered
          wallpaper. Finally she reaches the last spot -- a WEDDING
          PHOTO: Margaret and her HUSBAND, smiling, happy.
          Margaret peers -- then leaves it hanging. The door SLAMS.

<b>          INT. PACKARD - DRIVING - DAY
</b>
          Margaret grips the wheel, uncertain. Jane stares. The car is
          all loaded up. REFLECTIONS of passing BILLBOARDS drift across
          the windshield. Images of perky, happy-fake Americans.
          Margaret bites her lip. Has she made the right decision...?

</b>
          A weathered building: "G &amp; B FURNITURE SUPPLY." Margaret sits
          in the Packard, fixing her lipstick. Jane holds the "WANT
          ADS," a few circled. Margaret gets out and straightens her
          skirt. Jane smiles.

          A beaten industrial office. Margaret sits anxiously, watching
          the BOSS, a tired guy in a cheap suit. He glowers unsurely at
          her JOB APPLICATION. Scratching his face. Hmmmm...

<b>                          BOSS
</b>           We don't get many ladies in here. So
           your husband approves of you working?

           My husband and I are separated.

</b>
<b>                          (SHOCKED)
</b>           "Separated"?
          A deadly silence. He squirms uncomfortably.
          She presses on.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Sir, I realize I have no employment
           experience... but I sure need this
           job. I have a daughter to support.

<b>                          (PAUSE)
</b>           I'm not very good at tooting my own
           horn... but I love to paint, and if I
           could just show you my portfolio...
          He is baffled. Margaret pulls out a large ARTIST'S PORTFOLIO.
          She opens it, riffling through the pictures...

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I studied at the Watkins Art Institute

           a portrait in charcoal... though I
           enjoy mixing mediums, preferably oil
           and ink...
          She's alive, enthused.
          The guy shakes his head.

<b>                          BOSS
</b>           You do understand this is a furniture

          Margaret works on an enamel baby crib. Under stenciled
          "Humpty Dumpty," she quickly paints on a cartoonish egg man.
          We WIDEN, revealing ten identical, completed cribs behind her.
          We WIDEN again -- revealing a DOZEN PAINTERS. All surrounded
          by identical cribs. All painting identical Humpty Dumpty's.

          NORTH BEACH! An exotica of Beatniks, palm readers,
          interracial couples and coffeehouses. Ground zero for the
          Avant Garde. Margaret waits on a busy corner, a bit dazed,
          peering at the parade of fun-loving Hipsters. Primly, she
          fixes herself.
          Margaret turns -- and suddenly grins. Running up is DEE-ANN,
          30, a Beat girl in a black leotard and sandals. Dee-Ann
          excitedly grabs her, and they laugh and hug girlishly.

<b>                          DEE-ANN

<b>                          DEE-ANN
</b>           Yeah, I know. But I hit this scene...
           and "Deirdre" just sounded like
           something my mother would call me.
          Margaret giggles.

<b>                          DEE-ANN

<b>                          (PAUSE)
</b>           Though... it's hard without her father.
           I'm not sure we can do this...
          The thought hangs, and Margaret gets emotional. Teary-eyed.

           up. But if I ever see you wrong off

<b>          EXT. ART SHOW - DAY

          A Sunday ART SHOW. It's picturesque, amateur ARTISTS
          displaying their paintings, jewelry, sculpture...
          The modern stalls are crowded with trendy BOHEMIANS. Abstract
          lines, speckles of color. We drift away... and find Margaret,
          alone in her stall with Jane. Margaret sits patiently,
          surrounded by Big Eye paintings and charcoal portraits. In
          contrast with the neighbors, her work seems... quaint.

<b>           6.

          A pink, chubby TOURIST FAMILY ambles over. Margaret brightens
          hopefully.

<b>                          TOURIST GUY
</b>           Your stuff is cute. How much?

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Today's a special: Two dollars.

<b>                          TOURIST GUY
</b>           I'll give you one.
          Beat -- then she nods, agreeing. She gestures.
          The little BOY sits. Margaret clips a fresh sheet of paper,
          sharpens her charcoal... and... goes motionless. Studying the
          boy's face. He gazes back.
          Then -- inspired, she begins sketching his EYES. Large and
          exaggerated. Then she fills in the shape of his head. His
          ears. His jaw.
          In a rush, his likeness appears. The parents come over to
          peek -- then gasp. Margaret is good. She sketches faster.
          Focused. Until a LOUD, PLUMMY VOICE drifts in...

<b>                          MAN'S VOICE
</b>           Monet? "Monet"?! Whew -- that's a
           hell of a compliment. Though, if I
           may respectfully disagree, I'm more in
           the tradition of Pissarro.
          Margaret looks up, distracted. She resumes her work.

<b>                          MAN'S VOICE
</b>           C'mon, get closer. Closer! Look at
           that sunlight coming through the
           mottled leaves. That's a bold yellow!
          Curious, Margaret casually peers over...

<b>                         HER POV
</b>          Holding court in another booth is WALTER KEANE, 40. Walter is
          astonishing: Hugely confident. Charming. Waggishly
          handsome. And dressed like an "Artist" -- striped turtleneck,
          with hands full of brushes.
          Walter's stall is filled with oils of Paris street scenes. He
          casually flirts with TWO YOUNG COEDS. They admire a painting.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           You wanna touch it? Do it! I lay it
           on thick -- you're not gonna break it!

<b>                          (UNWAVERING)

           It's thirty-five dollars.

          Walter glances over -- and notices Margaret watching him.
          Shy, she quickly turns away, back to her portrait.
          Walter smiles rakishly. He's found a new interest.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Excuse me, Ladies.

<b>                         WIDE
</b>          Walter strides up to Margaret. She peers nervously... trying
          to ignore him. She sketches faster. Shading...
          Walter watches. Admiring... and discreetly smelling her hair.
          Margaret pays no attention. Done, she blows into a can of Fix-
          It. Poosh! A fine mist sprays, setting the portrait.
          Without fanfare, she humbly turns the picture.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           All finished.
          Her customers gape, impressed. She smiles. The guy counts
          out four quarters, then happily leaves.

<b>          MARGARET AND WALTER
</b>          are left together. An unspoken frisson, until --

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           You're better than spare change. You
           shouldn't sell yourself so cheap.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I'm just glad they liked it.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Ahhh! You're past that point! Your
           heart is in your work...
          He leans in, too close. Margaret shivers. Breathing faster.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           What's your name?

<b>                          MARGARET

          Mmm. He grins, checking her out... her loose sexy blouse and
          tight black capris. She flushes.

<b>                          MARGARET

           how it's done.
          Walter spins to Jane. He SHOUTS out, like a carnival barker.

<b>                          WALTER

           (she POINTS all over)
           And that one started as me, but then
           Mother turned it into a Chinese boy.
          Huh? Walter peers at Jane... then at Margaret. And then --
          it hits him. He grimaces, embarrassed.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Oh, you're Mommy! My apologies,
           Honey. I misconstrued the situation.

<b>                          (SHEEPISH)
</b>           Well I'll just mosey along, before Mr.
           Ulbrich comes back and socks me in the
           eye.

<b>                         ON MARGARET
</b>          A gut decision. She stares at Walter, then smiles slyly.

<b>                         ON WALTER
</b>          His face slowly lights up. Ah! Sun breaking through clouds.

</b>
          An enchanting bistro. Wine barrels, laughing, twinkly tivoli
          lights. Perfection. Walter flamboyantly enters, escorting
          Margaret. Instantly, the STAFF ERUPTS in excitement:
          "Monsieur Keane! Ah, Monsieur Keane is here! Bonsoir!"

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Bonsoir, gang! Henri! Sorry I didn't
           call first. Est-ce que tout va bien?

<b>                          MAITRE'D
</b>           Je vais bien, merci! Comment allez-
           vous?

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Je vais bien! I'm with a beautiful
           woman! Could life be any grander??
          They get led in. Margaret is dazzled. Walter whispers.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           And I don't even have to pay! I'm set
           because I gave the chef a painting.
           You know what he said? "Nobody paints
           Montmartre like Walter Keane!"

<b>                         LATER
</b>          Margaret and Walter enjoy an intimate dinner. The wine flows.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I can't believe you lived in Paris.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Best time of my life...

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I've never even been on an airplane.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Well you have to experience these
           things! Grab 'em!!

<b>                          (JOCUND)
</b>           I wanted to be an artist, so I just
           went! Studied painting at the Beaux-
           Arts. Lived in a Left Bank studio. I
           survived on bread and wine...

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           You're a romantic.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Damn right!
          A wistful shrug. He chugs his glass.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Of course, walkin' away from the
           bourgeois scene wasn't a snap. I had
           to quit my job. Leave my wife. These
           choices aren't easy...
          She stares at her wine.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I've never acted freely. I was the
           daughter. The wife. The mother...

<b>                          (SHE SIGHS)
</b>           All my paintings are of Jane, because
           she's all I know.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           You shouldn't knock your work. I'd
           give an eyetooth to have your talent.
          Margaret is taken aback. He's absolutely sincere.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           You can look into someone and capture
           them on canvas! You paint people!
           (he gestures sadly)
           I can only paint -- things. My street
           scenes are charming... but at the end
           of the day, it's just a collection of
           sidewalks and buildings.
          Walter goes silent. He has revealed his fears.

<b>          ANGLE - MARGARET
</b>          She doesn't know what to say. Gently, she takes his hand.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Walter, I'd bet you could paint
           anything.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>
<b>                          (INTENSE)
</b>           Whew... Baby, when you look at me
           like that, I could fall hard.
          Margaret gulps. Afraid to talk.

<b>           11.
</b>
                         

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           This is moving fast. You're my first
           date in a long time...
          Neither of them speaks. The tension builds --
          There is a spark between them...

<b>                          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. PALACE OF FINE ARTS - DAY
</b>
          A lush green knoll, overlooking the park. Margaret and Walter
          have set-up TWO EASELS. They both smoke cigarettes. Margaret
          is spattered with paint, stirring colors. Walter paces about,
          framing the scene with his fingers.
          Jane sits in front of them, playing paddleball. Bonk! Bonk!

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Sweetie, could you stop fidgeting?

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Mother, after all this time, you MUST
           know what my face looks like.
          Margaret winces. Walter laughs. She gets busy, penciling in
          LARGE OVAL EYES. Then -- quick marks for the mouth and nose.
          Impatient, Jane spies on Walter's canvas.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Hey! Your canvas is blank!

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Er, you can't rush inspiration --

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Jane! Don't bother Mr. Keane. You
           know creativity has to well up from
           the inside...

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Don't worry. She's not bothering
           me...!
          Walter leaves Jane. He points at Margaret's canvas.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           There's something I gotta ask you.
           What's with the big crazy eyes...?

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I believe things can be seen in eyes.
           They're the windows of the soul --

<b>           12.
</b>
                         

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Yeah, but, c'mon! You draw 'em like
           pancakes! I mean, they're WAY out of
           proportion!
          He's having fun, but she remains serious.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Eyes are how I express my emotions.
           That's how I've always drawn them.

<b>                          (EARNEST)
</b>           When I was little, I had surgery that
           left me deaf for a period. I couldn't
           hear, so I found myself staring...
           Relying on people's eyes...
          She smiles shyly. Understanding, he smiles back. Then --

<b>                          VOICE
</b>           Walter? Hey -- Walt!
          Walter spins, startled. A FRIENDLY GUY in a suit strolls up.

<b>                          FRIENDLY GUY
</b>           I thought that was you!

<b>                          WALTER
</b>
<b>                          (EMBARRASSED)
</b>           Oh! Uh... er, hi, Don.

<b>                          FRIENDLY GUY
</b>           Boy, I'm glad to see you! Have we
           heard back from the city, on that
           setback? My guys really need the
           variance, for the first floor retail.
          Walter is mortified. He turns away from Margaret.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Um... we should hear from Permits by
           Thursday.

<b>                          FRIENDLY GUY
</b>           Yeah? Well that's terrif'! I'll tell
           the architects!
          Pleased, the guy cheerily strides away.

<b>          ON WALTER AND MARGARET
</b>          He is stricken. Something ominous just happened.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           What was that??

<b>           13.

<b>                          (ASHAMED)
</b>           I -- I didn't want you to know...
          A long, horrible pause. Walter's face turns gray. We SLOWLY
          PUSH IN. This revelation is churning. Agony.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           I'm in commercial real estate.
          A stunned beat.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           You're a -- Realtor?

<b>                          WALTER
</b>
<b>                          (CONTRITE)
</b>           YES! A hugely successful Realtor!
           Top earner in the Downtown office
           three years running!

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           And you're... ashamed?

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Of course! Any blockhead can arrange
           a sublet!

<b>                          (HEARTFELT)
</b>           All I ever wanted was to support
           myself as an artist...

<b>                          (SAD; BEAT)
</b>           I tried to make a clean break, but
           couldn't cut it. I'm just a goddam
           Sunday painter. An amateur.
          Margaret looks at him, touched by his vulnerability.

<b>                          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - DUSK
</b>
          End of the day. Golden light slants in through the windows of
          this small tidy apartment.
          The door opens. Margaret holds it for Walter, who
          chivalrously staggers in, carrying all her supplies: Easel,
          paints, cans. He carefully puts it all down -- then turns.
          Beat. Walter stares at Margaret, their faces caught in the
          warm light. Then, enchanted, he kisses her.
          Silence.
          Margaret smiles, captivated. Caught in his glow. The moment
          could last forever...

<b>           14.
</b>
                         

<b>          IN THE DOORWAY
</b>          Jane stares unhappily. Threatened.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           A-hem!

<b>                         ON MARGARET
</b>          She turns, startled. Feeling guilty, Margaret rushes from
          Walter. Busying herself, she skims through the MAIL.
          Jane shakes her head and marches out.
          Margaret flips through envelopes -- until one stops her. On
          edge, she slowly removes an official DOCUMENT. She scans
          it... and her face drops. Crushed. Something terrible...
          Walter is worried.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           What's wrong...?

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>
<b>                          (SOFT)
</b>           Frank wants to take away Jane. He
           says I'm an unfit mother...
          Walter is taken aback.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           You're a perfect mother.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           He told the court Jane doesn't have a
           proper home. It's beyond my abilities
           as a single woman...
          Margaret trails off, shaken.
          Walter gulps unsurely. Then, he takes her in his arms. We

<b>          SLOWLY PUSH IN.
</b>
<b>                          WALTER

</b>           (he puts a finger to her lips)
           Shh. Don't think of a reason to say
           no. 'Cause I've got a million reasons
           to say yes.
           (he gives a winning smile)
           I know it makes no sense!

           girls.
          Margaret stammers, speechless. She doesn't know what to say.
          Walter pulls out his ace. In a debonair move, he creakily
          drops to his knee. He exudes a hammy, wonderful romance:

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Margaret, I'm on my knee! C'mon,
           whatdya say? Let's get married! We
           can be in Hawaii by the weekend.

<b>                          MARGARET

<b>                          (EMOTIONAL)
</b>           Walter, I'm crazy about you... but I'm

</b>
          Hawaii, 1958. Heaven on earth. Blossoming flowers, rare
          birds, lush greenery. Margaret is experiencing total bliss.
          We widen. She and Walter stand in front of a waterfall,
          getting married. Jane is Maid-of-Honor. A PRIEST smiles, and
          Walter places a ring on Margaret's finger. They kiss.

<b>          EXT. BEACH - SUNSET
</b>
          Margaret and Walter lie on the sand, making out. Cuddling,
          running their fingers along each other's bodies. She stares
          up, endlessly happy.

<b>                          MARGARET

<b>          EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY
</b>
          Thatched umbrellas, Polynesian fun. Margaret is set-up,
          drawing PORTRAITS of the GUESTS. Walter regales them as they
          wait. Joking, gregariously handing out Mai-Tais.
          Margaret finishes a picture. She beams at Walter... then
          signs the picture "KEANE."
          Walter gapes, astonished at this gesture. Margaret lock eyes
          with him. She smiles girlishly, radiating happiness.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           This is a waterfall... the air was so
           fresh you could taste it. Here's an
           ancient altar... that statue is Kane,
           the god of creation. I said a prayer

           Well, I am naive. But I know the man

           Walter is a blessing.
          Dee-Ann bites her tongue. The WAITER brings over the check.
          Sitting on it are TWO FORTUNE COOKIES.
          Hm. Margaret stares, utterly serious. She reaches for one...
          then impulsively grabs the other. She cracks the cookie. Dee-
          Ann waits, curious. Margaret reads... then slowly smiles.

<b>          INT. ART GALLERY - DAY
</b>
          A Modish, happening gallery. The white walls are hung with
          ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: Slashing angles of color, painted over
          rags and glued bolts. On the floor is SCULPTURE made from
          wood and wire.
          In charge is RUBEN, a fussy man in a goatee. He's schmoozing
          a FANCY LADY. They look at a spattered, distorted painting.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           What's brilliant about the composition
           is its spontaneity. The image has no
           visual center of attention.

<b>                          FANCY LADY
</b>           It's quite gestural.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by
           the tachistes.

<b>                          FANCY LADY
</b>           I heard Tab Hunter was in here,
           looking at one.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Well... I'm not allowed to say...
          He NODS HIS HEAD up-and-down: Yes, you're right.

<b>                         OUTSIDE
</b>          A car backfires. Ruben turns -- and winces.

<b>           18.
</b>
                         
          Through the windows is Walter, climbing out of his massive
          white Cadillac. He's all done up, in beret and scarf. He
          opens the giant trunk and removes a pile of paintings.
          Ruben cringes knowingly. He whispers:

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Oh Christ, don't come in here. Please
           don't come in here...
          The door SLAMS. Walter loudly barges in.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute?

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Walter. In polite society, the word
           is "appointment."

<b>                          FANCY LADY
</b>           (glancing back and forth)
           Uh, I could come back later...
          She anxiously hurries for the door. Ruben fumes.
          Walter ignores it all and starts laying out his wares. First,
          the Parisian street scenes, one after another...

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           You're gonna love my stuff today.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Haven't I seen that one before?

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Nah! That was painted in the Fifth
           Arrondissement. This is the Sixth
           Arrondissement!

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>
<b>                          (SKEPTICAL)
</b>           I don't understand. You lived in
           Paris for a week. How can you still
           be cranking out paintings?
          Walter laughs. He points to his head.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           It's all up here.
           (beat; a sentimental

<b>                          FLOURISH)
</b>           And here.
          He points to his heart. Ruben frowns and points to the wall.

<b>           19.
</b>
                         

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Well, it's not going up here.

<b>                          (CRUEL)
</b>           Walter, you know we don't go for that
           representational jazz! You're too
           literal.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>
<b>                          (HURT)
</b>           Hey, Art isn't fashion!

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Yes it IS!

<b>                          (CUTTING)
</b>           People want Kandinsky, or Rothko!
           They don't want goopy street scenes.

<b>          CLOSEUP - WALTER
</b>          Ouch! This stings terribly.
          Walter glares at the man, then softly slides aside his works.
          Quietly, he pulls out Margaret's Big Eye paintings.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Would they want... this?

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>
<b>                          (HE SHUDDERS)
</b>           Good God! You've entered a new
           period.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           No... they're my wife's.
          Fascinated, Ruben glances through Margaret's oils. Canvas
          after canvas of sad kiddies against gray, bleak backgrounds.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Why are their eyes so big?! They're
           like big stale jellybeans.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>
<b>                          (SNIDE)
</b>           It's Expressionism. Surely you
           recognize it.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>
<b>                          (LONG BEAT)
</b>           Well -- I'm just glad you two found
           each other.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           So... what do you say?
          Ruben looks up, amazed. Walter seems oblivious.

<b>           20.
</b>
                         

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           I say, NO! It's not art.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>
<b>                          (HORRIFIED)
</b>           Not -- "art"??

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           It's like the back of a magazine!
           "Draw the turtle! Send in a nickel
           and win the Big Contest!"

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           How dare you! Lots of people would
           like this.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Well, nobody who's walking through the
           door of this gallery!

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Now please! Clear out this clutter,
           before the taste police arrives.
          Walter's jaw drops.

</b>
          "The hungry i" -- the hottest nightclub around, so hip it's in
          a basement. The marquee says "Cal Tjader, TONIGHT!"

<b>          INT. HUNGRY I SHOWROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          A swinging mob of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE -- suits, gowns and pearls.
          CAL TJADER'S BAND is crazed: Vibes and bongo-driven JAZZ.
          Margaret and Walter are squeezed at a table. She nurses a
          Grasshopper. Walter's in a foul mood, CHUGGING cocktails.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           We'll never break in...! Because
           there's a CABAL. A secret society of
           gallery owners and critics, who get
           together for Sunday brunch in
           Sausalito, deciding what's "cool."

<b>                          (BROODING)

           McCarthy, in his hearings: "That
           painter, I anoint. That painter, I
           banish to nowheresville!"
          Heartfelt, Margaret disagrees.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I think people buy art because it
           touches them --

<b>           21.
</b>
                         

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Heh! You're livin' in fairy land!
           People don't get to discover a thing.
           They buy art, because it's in the
           right place at the right time.
          O.s., MUSIC BUILDS. Muddled, Walter turns. He looks -- and
          then -- his eyes light up. He is getting an idea...

<b>                         ONSTAGE
</b>          The band speeds to a climax, the percussion throbbing. Then,
          a final, crazed note. BAM!!
          The crowd APPLAUDS. The club's owner, ENRICO BANDUCCI, bounds
          on stage. Banducci is a theatrical, natty Italian guy with a
          skinny moustache and loud personality. He grabs a mike.

<b>                          BANDUCCI
</b>           Give it up for Cal Tjader! That set
           was HUMMIN'! Al-aright, be sure to
           stick around for the one a.m. show!
          The house lights come up. Banducci hops down, greeting
          guests, making his way out -- when Walter glides up.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Hey, Banducci. I love the music
           tonight. It's a gas.

<b>                          BANDUCCI

</b>           Really? Hm...! Maybe you're right.
           What color were you thinking?
          Huh? Walter holds his composure.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           No -- I'm an artist. I used to be
           based on the Left Bank. But now I've

<b>                          BANDUCCI
</b>           I like my club the way it is. Your

          A PHOTOGRAPHER runs around, tweaking equipment.
          Walter's at an easel, putting the final touches on a PAINTING
          of a French street scene. He gabs on the PHONE.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Yes! The paintings are available for
           public viewing daily, from 7 to 3!

          Margaret puts on a smock, a bit dumbfounded. Walter spatters
          some paint on his shirt. He grins, then holds up his brush
          and SIGNS the painting: "W. KEANE"
          Margaret forces a "cheese" smile, with her Waif. FLASH! The

          PHOTO: Walter at his street scene, Margaret at her Waif.
          Then -- a SHOE steps on it. We WIDEN... revealing the
          brochure on the sticky floor of...
          THE CLUB! It throbs with frolicking CUSTOMERS. We move
          through the pack. To a rear concrete hallway... to a sign
          with an arrow: "TOILETS." We go down the hall... into...

<b>          A DINGY CORRIDOR
</b>          The Keane paintings hang here. The only human in sight is
          Walter, forlorn at a card table. Brochures are stacked, and
          he wears a sailor coat with a dandyish ascot.
          The image is grim. Walter listens to the raucous mob. Until,
          THUMP! -- a sloshed MAN stumbles in. Walter brightens and

          The guy smiles and tosses Walter a BUCK, as a tip. Walter is
          stunned. The guy toddles away.
          Beat. The Ladies Room opens, and TWO GOSSIPY WOMEN rush out,
          oblivious to Walter. He glowers. ANOTHER MAN bounds in,
          right up to one of Walter's paintings! He stops at it.
          Walter gathers a moment of hope. Does he like it?
          Then the man leans down and opens a CLOSET. He removes a tray
          of bar glasses, kicks the door shut, and scoots away.

          gone nuts. Walter grabs a Waif and SMASHES it over Banducci's
          head. CRASH! Banducci drops.

          A neighborhood precinct, quiet at 6 a.m. Doors open, and
          Margaret leads Walter out. She's seething. He's bruised,
          with a mortified drunk-tank, slept-in-my-clothes swagger.

           at our work. ...So I socked him.

          The club is a ZOO. PARTYERS swarm the door, trying to enter.
          Suddenly, Walter pushes his way down the outside stairs. The
          DOORMAN starts to protest, but Walter somberly waves him off.

          Across the packed room, he spots Banducci with a black eye.
          Walter halts, uncertain. A bristling tension...
          Until -- Banducci suddenly rushes and GRABS him! Walter
          flails, freaked. Banducci DRAGS him into a back kitchen --

          Banducci shuts the door, looks around... then suddenly LAUGHS!
          He grins manically and pulls Walter into a hearty HUG.

          Banducci storms away.

          Margaret rolls over, groggy. Walter jumps on the bed,

          Margaret finishes painting a sad boy, using a fine brush to
          add a watery rim to his eyes. Magically, this detail brings
          the picture to life. She's pleased.
          Margaret signs "KEANE." There are two finished canvases, the
          sad little girl and boy. Margaret smiles, her heart swelling.
          She loves them. Then, she looks about. Nobody is there to
          share the moment.
          Hm. She thinks -- then picks up the PHONE. She dials.

          Then -- she gets jostled. Margaret notices Walter holding
          court with some GROUPIES. She approaches, unnoticed:

</b>           ...yeah, eyes are powerful. A poet
           said they're the windows of the soul.

          Walter gasps. He nudges Margaret.
          Olivetti peers at the artwork. Intrigued. Then -- excited.
          He starts gesturing and yapping in ITALIAN. The Blondes shout

          hijacked, blanketed by THE POSTERS. People gape -- astonished

          Disconnected from it all, strolling alone, is Margaret. She
          is burdened by her own thoughts. Regretful...
          Across the street, she sees a GOTHIC CHURCH. She stares up,

          We move in tight on the painting. Underneath is a tag:

          We drift along, to another painting: "CALICO CAT, by WALTER
          KEANE." Then, another: "IN THE GARDEN, by WALTER KEANE."
          Every painting is now by Walter Keane.

          He tosses his empty to a PASSING LADY. We reveal the waitress
          is... Margaret. She carries a tray of pigs-in-a-blanket.
          Margaret looks shell-shocked -- faking a happy party face.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Janie, sweetie, you need to respect
           your mother's privacy. Sometimes
           grownups need alone time.

<b>                          (HE WINKS)
</b>           Is that the ice cream truck? Why don't
           you go get yourself a fudgesicle?
          Walter tosses her a dime. She peers warily, then leaves.
          He waits a beat -- then pulls out a KEY. Walter discreetly
          unlocks the painting room.

          It's a factory. Big Eyes are everywhere. Margaret frenziedly
          works, surrounded by half-done canvases, solvents, easels.
          She's in a bathrobe -- a cigarette hanging from her lips.
          Startled, she looks up to see Walter.
          He gazes at all the art. At the bulbous faces, eyes watery
          and submissive, trapped in muddy yellows and dire browns. And
          then... Walter grins broadly.

<b>                          WALTER

          Walter glances at one PAINTING -- then does a take.

          He takes her face in his hands.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           I owe you an apology. I was initially
           dismissive of your kids, those emotion-

          A bizarre pause. The two of them look around the room. At
          all the Big Eyes peering down at them.

<b>                          MARGARET

          Walter picks up a picture of TWO LITTLE GIRLS IN TUTUS. He
          stares, perplexed.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           What would make a grown man paint a
           picture like this?!
          No answer. He thinks of stories, wheels spinning.

</b>           I grew up, surrounded by six sisters.

<b>                          (NO GOOD)

          Margaret smiles.

           streets and flower vendors?
          Huh? Walter stares off at the Waifs. They peer out from
          broken windows... chain-link fences...
          And then -- he gets it.

<b>                          WALTER

          with makeup, sitting rigidly, fingers gripping his chair.

<b>           WALTER (ON TV)
</b>           My psyche was scarred in my art
           student days. Nothing in my life has
           ever made such an impact as the sight
           of the children: War-wracked
           innocents, without homes, without
           parents, fighting over garbage...
          He sits in a half-circle of PROPER WOMEN, who are spellbound.

<b>           WALTER (ON TV)
</b>           Goaded by a frantic despair, I
           sketched these dirty, ragged little
           victims... with their bruised minds
           and bodies, their matted hair and
           runny noses. There my life as a
           painter began in earnest.
          Walter sadly looks up to the HOST.
          The man is shellshocked. Mute. Walter waits, then sighs.

<b>           WALTER (ON TV)
</b>           The insane, inhuman cruelty inflicted
           upon these children cut deeply into my
           being. From that moment on, I painted
           the lost children with the eyes.
           Those eyes that forever retained their
           haunting quality.
          The ladies are stricken. A few dab their eyes.

          Walter strides along, a bounce to his step. He reaches the

          Not rich, but regular folks, gawking at the art.

          happily accost him: "Walter Keane!" "Mr. Keane!" They thrust
          papers and POSTERS at him to autograph.
          Walter grins and scribbles his signature. Glancing over their
          shoulders, he sees Ruben down the block, standing outside his
          own gallery. Gaping in disbelief.

          Walter whirls, startled. Outside, two GIRLS tear a big poster
          off the front window.
          Walter's eyes widen. Slowly, he turns back. At the counter,
          FOLKS and KIDS are grabbing free posters from a box.
          Walter stares. Processing this. And then... being struck by
          an idea of absolute genius...

          An aisle of Sundries: Plastic toys, beach balls... Waifs. A
          sign says "WE HAVE KEANE!"
          Around the corner, Margaret shuffles along, listlessly buying
          banalities: Cereal. Soap. She turns the cart... and runs
          into her wall of teary-eyed kids.
          Margaret peers, muddled.
          Then she turns away -- to a RACK OF PAPERBACKS. They offer
          fast hope, inspiration. Margaret seems disconnected. She
          runs her hand down the options... a book of Numerology... a
          book on Judaism... an Edgar Cayce prophecies manual...
          AT THE REGISTER - Margaret gazes up. The CASHIER is a sad
          Beatnik Girl. In a haze, Margaret notices the whole market is
          full of LONELY WOMEN:
          One LADY is her doppelganger -- same age, blonde, gripping a
          cart. Next aisle over, a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stares into space.
          Nearby, a YOUNG MOM wrangles her children.
          We shift to Margaret. Face gaunt. Eyes empty. Troubled...

          Curtains drawn, Margaret frantically SKETCHES. She's cabin
          feverish. In her robe. Hair dirty. And -- up to something.
          These sketches aren't squat children with round eyes. They're
          different: Figures with long lines.
          Margaret frowns and rips the paper. She tries again! Another
          angular figure -- straight fingers... no!
          Again! A woman... reclining. Then an indication of a face:
          A slash... and then -- two small almond shapes for eyes.

          Margaret glances in a mirror. It's a self-portrait. It's
          Margaret, aloof. Alone at a table.
          Suddenly the door opens. Margaret GASPS, startled, and spins
          the canvas away. Walter barges in, dressed like a million.
          He HALTS -- making a sour face.

</b>           I have some peanut butter hidden in my

          We move... finding Margaret alone in a small ANNEX. It
          displays a few of her sad blondes, alongside Jane and Lily's
          paintings of flowers and Mr. Potato-Head. Margaret sits,
          seeming like an adult at the children's table.
          An urbane RICH MAN glides by... and is taken with one of
          Margaret's nubile blondes. He gazes at the lounging figure.
          Margaret sits up. Alert, pleased with his interest.
          She tingles. Then, happily excited, unable to hold it in:

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I painted it!

          He steps forward -- then peers closer at the painting. The
          SIGNATURE is a feminine scroll: "MDH Keane"

<b>                          RICH MAN

</b>           Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret
           Doris Hawkins! "M" is the 13th letter
           of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If
           you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives
           you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals
           16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven!
          The man's head is spinning. He's lost all interest.
          Across the room, Walter sees this debacle. He marches over.

<b>                          WALTER

</b>
          The Margaret sweatshop is going full-blast. Canvases are
          everywhere: Melancholy MDH ladies. Woeful Keane kids. Even a
          portrait of Natalie Wood, copied from a photo. Margaret dips
          a tiny brush, quickly detailing the tear on a child's cheek...
          when the doorbell CHIMES.
          Hm? Margaret puts down her brush, wipes her hands, then
          hurries out. She opens the door... REVEALING THAT WE'RE IN A
          DIFFERENT HOUSE. A GIANT, PHENOMENAL 1960s EXTRAVAGANZA.

<b>          INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - SAME TIME
</b>
          Margaret runs across the marble floors, past the swooping,
          Modern lines of a California ranch... all-white furniture... a
          kidney-shaped pool glistening blue outside the glass... a cute
          TOY POODLE barking at the door.

</b>           Rembrandt, shush!
          In the foyer, Margaret opens the front door. And standing
          there is Dee-Ann. Dazzled. She laughs with surprise.

<b>                          DEE-ANN
</b>           My God! I thought I misread the
           address.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Yeah. That driveway is long.
           (she giggles, embarrassed)
           Honestly, I can't believe I live here.
          Dee-Ann glides in -- then freezes, agape.

<b>                          DEE-ANN
</b>           Three? I thought there were four.

</b>           It's been so long since I've seen you.

           He brings people by... the Beach Boys
           were here. But, it's pretty isolated.
          Dee-Ann goes silent. Margaret seems dwarfed by the house.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Jane has nice friends. Sometimes I
           pick them up at the junior high, and

</b>           I'm thirsty.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Good! I'll whip us up two gin fizzes.
          Margaret forces a smile and scurries behind a giant curved wet
          bar. She pulls out ingredients: Gin, lemon juice, soda...

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           When we moved in, I thought a wet bar
           was extravagant... but it's surprising
           how much use you can get out of it.
          Dee-Ann watches the drinkmaking.

<b>                          DEE-ANN
</b>           How's Walter?

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           He couldn't be happier. He has
           everything he ever dreamed of.

</b>           And so do you! Fabulous.
          Dee-Ann smiles archly. She glances away -- and notices
          Margaret's STUDIO, the door half-open.

<b>                          DEE-ANN
</b>           Oh, is that your studio?
          Margaret turns -- and gasps.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           No --! You can't go in --

<b>                          DEE-ANN
</b>           I just want a peek. See what the
           workspace of a wildly successful
           artist looks like --

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Dee-Ann, please! STOP --
          Margaret rushes to block her -- but Dee-Ann pushes open the
          door, revealing...

<b>          INT. PAINTING ROOM
</b>
          A room full of MDHs and Keanes.
          Dee-Ann stops, puzzled. She glances at Margaret -- who has
          turned white as a ghost.
          Immensely curious, Dee-Ann slowly enters. She peers around at
          the two styles of paintings...
          A strained silence. Finally, Margaret whispers.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           W-Walter paints in here too.
          Hmm.
          Dee-Ann walks about, examining the canvases. Then, her gaze
          settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on.
          Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint.
          Margaret sucks in her breath. Dee-Ann sees this.

<b>                          DEE-ANN
</b>           Is Walter home??
          Margaret has no answer.
          The two friends look at each other... Dee-Ann waiting...
          wondering if Margaret is going to lie to her...

<b>           62.

</b>          Both women startle. FOOTSTEPS. Then... Walter strides in!
          Margaret's eyes pop.
          Walter's pop even bigger. He glares at the ladies.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           What the hell's going on here?!!

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>
<b>                          (TIMID)
</b>           Uh... Dee-Ann was just... she...
          Margaret trails off. Walter thinks, then SNAPS.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my
           work before it's done!
          Walter rushes to the Waif, then for show grabs up the wet
          brush and quickly starts to "finish" the painting.
          Suddenly -- an odd expression crosses his face. He eyeballs
          the canvas, realizing he doesn't know what to do.
          A furtive glance. Then, unbowed, he hastily dips the brush
          and slaps a little black onto the shaded background.
          Walter spins, victorious.

<b>                          WALTER

          Dee-Ann staggers outside, then hops in her car.

</b>          Dee-Ann GUNS the engine and squeals away. The car peels down
          the very long driveway.
          Margaret and Walter watch the car disappear into the distance.
          Without looking over, Walter speaks.

</b>           I don't want her ever invited here
           again.

          Margaret and 13-YEAR-OLD JANE play on the lawn with the
          poodle. Jane laughs as the dog chases in circles.

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Go, Rembrandt! Get the ball!
          She tumbles, and Rembrandt licks her ear. She giggles.

</b>           Okay, honey. I have to go work.

           No. I can never come. No! I
           shouldn't even ask.
          Jane glares glumly.
          Margaret peers hopelessly at her daughter... then goes inside.

<b>          INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE

          Margaret strolls to her studio. WE SEE the poodle scampering
          behind her on its cute little legs. She enters the

<b>          INT. PAINTING ROOM
</b>
          Margaret doesn't notice the tiny dog follow her in. She LOCKS
          the door, then turns -- surprised.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Where did you appear from? Didn't you
           hear? No visitors!
          Rembrandt wags his tail, his little eyes bright. Margaret
          peers.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Is this what it's come to? You're the

           Well -- I painted them all!
           (she shudders with release)
           It's TRUE! I did every single one --
          She gestures, then catches sight of a Walter street scene.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Well, every one except that street
           scene.

<b>                          (BEAT)

           And nobody will ever know. But YOU.
          Rembrandt pants and BARKS.
          Margaret chuckles, then goes to work. She pulls a CURTAIN
          across the sliding glass door. At her easel, she squirts a
          tube into a well and starts mixing colors.
          Rembrandt jumps on the couch.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           No you don't! It's nice to have
           company, but that sofa is new.
           (she pushes him off)
           Let's find you some carpet to lay on.

          Margaret goes over to a CLOSET. Rembrandt follows, curious.

<b>          IN THE CLOSET
</b>          Margaret turns on the bare bulb inside. It's filled with old
          easels... cans... junk...

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I think there's a scrap back here...
          She rummages, sliding the junk aside. In back is a TATTERED

<b>          WOODEN CRATE.
</b>          Hm?

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Well what's this?
          Margaret swings the bulb closer. The crate is covered with
          SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS and international markings.
          Margaret's interest is piqued. She tugs at the lid, pulling
          it off. Revealing inside a STACK OF STREET SCENE PAINTINGS.
          Ten or fifteen of Walter's canvases.
          Or so it seems.

<b>          TIGHT - MARGARET
</b>          She peers closer.

<b>          TIGHT - THE PAINTINGS
</b>          The top painting is a typical Parisian street scene: Cobble
          stones, a man carrying baguettes, an old lady selling roses...
          But down in the bottom corner is the signature: "S. CENIC"

<b>          TIGHT - MARGARET
</b>          She sucks in her breath, shocked. She examines the painting.
          Then, she hurriedly grabs the next canvas. It's another
          sunlit scene: A quaint Parisian cafe, a man playing accordian,
          and in the bottom right corner... the signature: "S. CENIC"
          WHAT?! Margaret grabs the next canvas. "S. CENIC"
          The next canvas.
          The next canvas!
          They all are signed "S. CENIC"
          Margaret starts hyperventilating.

<b>           66.

          She thinks, then suddenly bolts from the closet.

<b>          INT. PAINTING ROOM

          Margaret races, rushing up to Walter's painted street scene,
          hung on the wall. We PUSH IN TIGHT, as she shoves her face up
          to the canvas, so close we can see the brushstrokes --
          As we MOVE IN TO THE SIGNATURE. Simply, "W. KEANE"
          Margaret's face is flushed. She gazes at the name... then
          rushes back to her work area. She manically hunts: Brushes,
          tubes, rags -- and an EXACTO KNIFE.
          Ah! She runs back to Walter's painting. Heart pounding, she
          grazes the knife up against the signature, then DIGS.
          And -- the "W. KEANE" flecks off. Revealing... underneath...
          the name "S. CENIC"

          A grandfather clock says 10:15. Margaret sits gloomily,

          of life. He skids across the marble, humming to himself --
          when -- he's startled by his wife. He jerks.

          Margaret's anger is raging. She glares, steely.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           No, Walter. She's a dignitary.
           Doesn't she deserve a piece that comes
           straight from you?

<b>                          (SHARP)

</b>           Yeah? Maybe you're right. She
           probably doesn't have a Parisian
           street scene hanging in her palace.
          Margaret nods, as if they've settled something. She turns to
          walk away -- then suddenly SPINS.

          Suddenly sober, smacked to reality.

          Margaret stares, eyes sharp.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Cenic is the name of the artist who
           did all your early paintings.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Huhhh?
           (spinning his lie)
           Urgh... oh! CENIC!
           (he laughs crazily)
           Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All
           my art school pals loved my scenic
           views, so they called me "Scenic"!
           But since those Frogs can't pronounce
           a hard "e," I became "Cenic."
          He looks up at her hopefully.
          But she shakes her head.

           How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm
           proud of my early Cenics!

<b>                          MARGARET

          Walter gasps, floored.
          Margaret bores in.

</b>           A bit of advice: Don't use a water-
           base over an oil. It flecks off.
          Walter cowers.

<b>                          WALTER

<b>          CLOSEUP - WALTER

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           I studied art in Paris. I went to

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Have you even been to Paris?
          Walter blanches. He shakes, broken up.
          He looks away, then staggers to a chair. He falls into it.
          Trembling. Not able to look her in the eye...

<b>                          WALTER

          Margaret stares, seething.
          Then, without comment, she storms away. She SLAMS the door

          Walter doesn't move.

</b>
          Margaret makes Jane breakfast, scrambling up eggs.
          Jane glances over her shoulder -- and notices Walter in the
          living room, asleep on the couch.
          An awkward pause. Jane says nothing.

<b>          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
          Margaret is making the bed. Straightening the pillows.
          In the b.g., Walter silently creeps into view. Shamefully
          standing in the doorway. Not speaking...
          Margaret knows he's there, but doesn't acknowledge his
          presence. Finally, without making eye contact --

<b>           70.

          He nods.

<b>          INT. HOUSE - LATER
</b>
          Margaret sits, unmoving, trapped in the big house. Outside, a
          JAPANESE GARDENER trims the hedges.
          Margaret stares at the walls, a smothering Walter Hall of
          Fame: Framed magazine articles on Walter, smugly posed with
          the Waifs.
          She swallows, then gently opens a dresser drawer. Inside is
          an ORIGINAL WAIF from long ago. A small oil of Jane, when she
          was a toddler.
          Margaret stares... and then her face slowly crumbles.

<b>          INT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY

          Margaret huddles with a SKETCHPAD. Rembrandt is at her feet.
          She's drawing. She looks up, as Walter anxiously enters.
          He's holding a drink. He clears his throat.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           What are you working on?

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           A new MDH. Something for me. It's
           about a woman trapped in an uncaring
           world. I call it, "Escape."
          Walter bites his lip, afraid to talk.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           I figured out a solution to our

</b>           What?

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Teach me.

</b>           Show me your tricks. Then you can
           pass off the Waifs, and we won't be

</b>           Walter, this isn't paint-by-numbers!
           You think it's easy?! It took me
           years to learn --

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Y-you're right!

<b>                          (SHEEPISH)
</b>           But you know me! I'm a quick study.
           And I've got the basics...
          He trails off, unsure where this is going.
          Trying to rouse her, Walter rushes to an easel and throws up a
          blank canvas. She eyeballs him.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           If you knew the basics, you wouldn't
           be at the easel. You have to sketch
           it first!
          Walter tightens, feeling stupid. He lets go of the canvas.
          Margaret stares, deciding. Then, she tosses him a PAD.
          Walter catches it. Slowly, he crosses over...

<b>          ANGLE - MARGARET AND WALTER
</b>          They peer at each other, like a Mexican standoff. Then, he
          nervously picks up a pencil.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           So...? What's first?

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I dunno. You tell me. You're the

          He frowns.

           here naked and humiliated in front of
           you. Look... can we just do a crying
           child?
          She gazes at him. Fingering her pencil...
          Trying to jump-start things, he starts to draw a circle --

<b>                          MARGARET

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           It matters! A young child's head is
           round. An older child's head is oval!
          He feels pressured. Hand shaking, he draws a crooked circle.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           The child is this old!

<b>                          (ANGRY)

          Margaret easily outlines a head, then two circles for eyes.
          Walter tries copying, but his eyes are misshapen.
          Again, Walter copies, but he's wobbly. Angry, he scratches it
          out.
          Margaret tries to help, guiding his hand. Insulted, he pushes
          her off. He CRUMPLES the page.
          NEW TACTIC: Walter grabs her sketch. He puts it on a LIGHT-
          TABLE. Despairing, he starts to trace it..

<b>                         LATER
</b>          Walter finally paints. We can't see the canvas, but he's very
          meticulous. His expression quite earnest. He adds a final
          flourish... and then... a flicker of pride crosses his face.
          He smiles.

          We slowly MOVE AROUND... to REVEAL HIS PAINTING. And...
          it's... absolutely dreadful. Kindergarten quality.
          Walter stares.
          Then, he furtively glances at Margaret's work. Comparing...
          The realization slowly sinks in. He has no ability.
          A sadness swells into fury... and suddenly Walter GRABS HIS
          CANVAS and SMASHES IT AGAINST THE EASEL. CRASH!! The canvas
          SHREDS. The frame blasts into pieces!
          Walter spins. He glares at one of Margaret's finished
          Waifs... then explodes, even more enraged. HE PICKS UP

<b>          MARGARET'S PAINTING AND STARTS TO SWING IT AT THE WALL --

<b>          ACROSS THE ROOM
</b>          Margaret stares him down.
          Sweaty, chest heaving, Walter staggers towards her. His face
          scowls, untamed. He clenches his fist, like he might attack

<b>                         MARGARET --
</b>          Then -- he SCREAMS and smashes her CANVAS. BAM!!! The

          all over: "WALTER KEANE! THE WORLD'S TOP-SELLING ARTIST!"
          Walter ignores them. He rushes a buxom REDHEADED CLERK.

          ANGLE - An INSANELY BIG, BLANK CANVAS. It's 8 feet across,
          filling half the room. Margaret is in the throes of hastily
          creating the MASTERPIECE.
          Sketches are tacked everywhere. Margaret is chain smoking,
          sleep-deprived. The DESIGN is a staggering multiracial CROWD
          of children, mournful, extending to the horizon.
          Walter enters, silently scrutinizing.

          Nothing. No sign of Margaret.
          Jane tries the door of the PAINTING ROOM. As always, it's
          locked. Hm... Jane sneakily glances around. Opportunity.
          Quickly, she stands on a chair and reaches above the door
          sill. She feels around... and finds a KEY.
          Ah! Hurriedly, Jane UNLOCKS the door and lets herself in.

          The room is a madhouse of WAIFS. Jane takes it all in. Her
          face darkens.
          Then, heavy breathing. She turns. Margaret is asleep, curled
          up under the almost-finished Masterpiece. Jane leans in.
          Slowly, Margaret rouses -- then suddenly:

          Angry, Jane runs out. Margaret stares after her -- completely
          remorseful. She knows she did the wrong thing.
          Suddenly, she runs after Jane and grabs her tightly.
          Overcome, Margaret starts weeping. Jane starts crying too.

          In the doorway appear Walter and Margaret. They're dressed to

          Crazed, Walter grabs a FORK off the buffet.
          He lunges, like he's about to STAB Canaday!

          Walter RUSHES BY. In a dim alcove, we make out Margaret and

          Jane looks up at her mother with wide, frightened eyes.
          Suddenly -- Walter LUNGES at them!
          They SCREAM, startled.

           You were the ultimate betrayal! You

          Suddenly, he pulls out a BOOK OF MATCHES. He lights a MATCH

</b>           You got all that paint and turpentine
           in there? Well I'm gonna burn you up!

          Hawaii, paradise indeed. A dense, tropical forest of deep
          greens and giant blooming flowers.
          Margaret stands on the porch of her small, lovely house,
          breathing in the clean air. She looks lightened.
          In a clearing, Jane plays with some LOCAL TEENS.

<b>          INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - SAME TIME

          The house is simple. In one light-filled corner is an EASEL.
          Margaret is painting Nature: Splaying ferns. Wild succulents.
          In the window, a BIRD flies by, its plumage a dazzling red.
          Margaret thinks -- then takes out a tube of RED PAINT. She
          starts to apply the vivid color onto her canvas...
          When -- a RINGING PHONE. Margaret reacts, startled.
          This is unexpected. And unsettling. It RINGS. RINGS.
          RINGS. Finally, she hurries to her one telephone, mounted on
          the kitchen wall. She slowly answers it.

<b>                          MARGARET

</b>           Whew. It hurts to hear you say those
           words.
          Silence. He is feigning "hurt feelings." Struggling for a
          response. Finally, his thoughts sharpen up, smart and shrewd.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           I sure hate that it's come to this.

<b>                          (BEAT)

          Walter is surprised. Greedy, calculating, he wonders if he
          can push her further...

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Uh -- okay. And... then, we have to
           consider future revenue stream.

<b>          OUTSIDE THE WINDOW
</b>          Coming down the long driveway are two FIGURES. Two small
          WOMEN, patiently walking toward the isolated house.
          Margaret stares, puzzled. The women come closer. They are
          Asian, dressed in formal dresses. Curious, Margaret creeps
          over, spying on them...
          They walk up and ring the bell. DING-DONG! An unsure beat...
          then Margaret opens the door. The ladies smile politely.

          feet.

<b>           DICK (V.O.)
</b>           I'm concerned about my old pal Walter
           Keane. The Hawaiian heat may have
           cooked his brain! The only thing he
           knows about courtrooms and lawyers
           comes from watching Perry Mason on

          Walter stands down front. Like a Broadway star, center-stage.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           I'm the sole creator of my art. This
           is my total life. My contribution to

</b>           Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must
           ask the witness questions! If you're
           acting as your own attorney, you
           cannot make statements at this time.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           It's hard to keep this all straight...
          Walter gathers his thoughts -- then turns to the WITNESS
          STAND. Sitting in it... is Margaret.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Mrs. Keane. It seems impossible that

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Mrs. Keane. You seem like a lucid
           woman. Reasonably intelligent... So
           how could you possibly have gone along
           with such a far-out scheme?

<b>           103.

          We slowly MOVE IN ON MARGARET.
          This is her moment. And then -- quietly, she speaks.

<b>                          MARGARET

          She stops, bothered by this awkwardness. She looks away from
          Walter, to the Jury instead.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           He had me dominated. He would rant
           and rave if I didn't do what he
           wanted. I was afraid. I didn't see
           any option, so I went along. I felt
           very bad...

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           S-sorry.
          Margaret turns back to the Jury.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I just gave in. I allowed him to take
           credit for the big eyes. They
           reflected all my feelings... and... it
           was like losing a child...

<b>                          (SHE SIGHS)

           leave and support myself and my
           daughter. He said nobody would buy
           the paintings without his personality.

<b>                          (SOFT)
</b>           Maybe he was right...

<b>                          (TO WALTER)

           salesmanship and promotion.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Hm! It sounds like you've described
           two different men. One a sadistic
           ogre... and the other a delightful bon
           vivant.
          Margaret stares him in the eyes.

<b>                          MARGARET

           Overruled!!

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           (she loses her temper)
           No! You're outrageous! Constantly
           criticizing! Wearing me down! Saying
           I'd be "knocked off" if I ever told
           the truth!!
          The Jury GASPS.
          Walter throws out his hands.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Your HONOR! I ask for a mistrial!
          Both Keanes starts QUARRELING. The Judge STANDS.

<b>                          JUDGE
</b>           HEY! This is not a domestic squabble!
           Or -- maybe it is. But the rest of us
           have no interest in watching you two
           go at it.
          Walter calms himself, contrite.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           I'm sorry for the emotions. I'm an
           artist.
          The Judge stares harshly.

<b>                          JUDGE
</b>           Maybe.

<b>          IN THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM
</b>          Two SKETCH ARTISTS are busy, drawing the trial. One guy pokes
          the other one, to show off his work.
          His SKETCH is a typical courtroom drawing, except everyone is
          drawn with big ridiculous Keane eyes.
          The second guy GIGGLES. His buddy grins, then quickly erases
          the silly eyes before anyone sees it.

          Margaret is back at the litigant's table, with her lawyer.

          Walter stands, at his table. He shouts out.

</b>           I call as my witness... Mr. Walter
           Stanley Keane!
          A strange beat. The Jurors glance at each other.
          Walter reacts, like he just heard his name. He strides
          jauntily over to the witness stand.
          The BAILIFF gives the Judge a weird look. Then, he pulls out
          a Bible. Walter slaps down his hand.

<b>                          BAILIFF
</b>           Do you swear to the tell the truth,
           the whole truth, and nothing but the
           truth, so help you God?

<b>                          WALTER
</b>
<b>           YESSS!
</b>          Walter bounces out, a bit manic. He runs back to his lawyer
          table, then spins to address the empty witness stand.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Mr. Keane. There has been a lot of
           innuendo and contradictory testimony
           about the genesis of the "big-eyed
           waifs." Would you mind clarifying to
           this court, once and for all, who
           spawned these paintings?
          Walter sprints back into the witness stand. He sits, then
          reacts coyly, as if he's surprised.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Why -- I created the children.
          Walter starts to stand again -- but the Judge SLAMS his bench.

<b>                          JUDGE
</b>           The choreography is not necessary.
           Just sit down and testify.
          Oh. Walter sits, then gathers his thoughts...
          We slowly PUSH IN. He smiles, wistfully...

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           I've had a wonderful life. I've been
           an artist, a world traveler, a friend
           of untold celebrities...
           (he gets misty-eyed)
           But when I look back at it all, when I

          Margaret proceeds. Slowly, she pushes her chair from the
          table and rises.
          Walter doesn't move.
          Margaret walks over to the closest EASEL, then sits. She ties
          on a smock over her checkered dress.

          to his seat. His face tight, his expression queasy. Staring
          off to some faraway place.
          Margaret looks up at the CLOCK. 3:20.
          Okay then. Totally calm, in a motion she's done so many
          times, she focuses on the canvas and starts outlining a Waif.
          Everybody watches. Effortlessly, she pencils the EYES. They
          are enormous. The largest orbs she has ever done.

          composition. Then, she reaches for... the PAINT.
          She unscrews a tube and squirts it on the palette. She rests
          it on her lap and starts mixing a flesh tone...

          He grabs his shoulder.

<b>                          JUDGE
</b>           Mr. Keane! Are you all right?

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           No -- it's --

<b>                          (GRIMACING)
</b>           Ah shoot! My old shoulder injury just
           flared up. I've got a bad muscle --
           I've been taking medication for the
           inflammation...
          Walter shrugs pathetically --

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           I -- I don't think I'll be able to
           paint today.

<b>                         THE JUDGE
</b>          is astonished.

<b>                         WIDE
</b>          The courtroom reacts.

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>          peers at Walter, knowingly.
          She's not surprised. This was his only way out.
          A look between them -- and then she cocks a half-smile and
          turns back to the canvas. She squirts out some white oil
          paint, then begins painting the eyes.

<b>                         WALTER
</b>          sinks down in his chair, beaten. All life gone.
          He stares at the emerging canvas, eyes wide, and we PUSH INTO
          WALTER'S FACE. He is witnessing the end of his empire... the
          destruction of everything that makes him who he is.
          We push in TIGHTER... TIGHTER... until the screen fills with
          his two eyes.

<b>           111.
</b>
                         
          Big. Sad. And filling with tears.

<b>                          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
          The doors open, and Margaret comes tumbling out, victorious.
          She has WON!
          She's surrounded by Jane, her friends, and a MOB OF REPORTERS.
          They all SHOUT: "Mrs. Keane! Margaret! Congratulations!!"

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Thank you! Thank you so much.

<b>                          REPORTER #2
</b>           What are you going to call the
           painting?
          She smiles, clutching the finished Waif.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           "Exhibit 224."
          They all ROAR with laughter. A Reporter does a stand-up:

<b>                          REPORTER #1
</b>           The jury found in favor of Margaret
           Keane on all points. She won on
           charges of defamation, emotional
           distress, damaged reputation --

<b>          IN THE BACKGROUND
</b>          Walter drifts out, disheveled and lost. He stares hazily...
          angrily at the crowd.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           What a group of idiots... a quagmire
           of incompetence...

<b>                          (RAMBLING)
</b>           This doesn't change a thing!
          We slowly PULL AWAY, leaving him tiny in the shot. Forgotten.

<b>          BACK AT MARGARET
</b>          She hugs Jane. The Reporter jumps in.

<b>                          REPORTER #2
</b>           Margaret! Do you feel vindicated by
           the high award?

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Oh... it was never about the money.
           And honestly -- I doubt Walter will
           even pay.

<b>           112.
</b>
                         
          The Reporter chuckles. Margaret turns serious.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I just wanted credit for what I had
           done. The justice is... I got my art
           back.

<b>                          (SOFT)
</b>           My prayers have been answered.
          Margaret takes Jane's hand and starts to walk away.
          Among the eager fans, a PORTLY LADY steps out, holding a BOOK.
          She smiles nervously.

<b>                          PORTLY LADY
</b>           Margaret! Could I possibly have your
           autograph?
          Margaret looks down -- and realizes the book is Walter's
          volume of "TOMORROW'S MASTERS"
          Margaret stares at it in wonder, then quickly signs the cover.

<b>          CLOSEUP - MARGARET
</b>          We hold. She slowly smiles in pride.

<b>                          DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. MARGARET KEANE GALLERY - DAY
</b>
          A brand-new gallery of Margaret's art. The walls are covered
          with NEWLY-PAINTED Waifs and MDH's. We GLIDE through the
          gallery... down the corridors of children and women...
          These paintings of big-eyed children are different. They're
          in magnificent colorful gardens, surrounded by joyful splashes
          of red, orange, green...

<b>                         CLOSING CARDS:
</b>          "Walter never accepted defeat, insisting he was the true
          artist for the rest of his life. He died in 2000, bitter and
          penniless. He never produced another painting."
          "Margaret found personal happiness and remarried. After many
          years in Hawaii, she moved back to San Francisco and opened a
          new gallery. She still paints everyday."
          We move CLOSER to one child, into the face, until the eyes
          fill the frame. And then... finally, we tilt down. Revealing
          that the child is smiling.

<b>           FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>                          THE END
</b>
<b>
