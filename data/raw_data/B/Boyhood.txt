<b>EXT.   OUTSIDE SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
MASON waits outside his elementary school, laying in the
grass staring up at the clouds. In the distance, the school
door opens and Mason's MOM, Olivia, walks toward him.

<b>                         MOM
</b>             Hey, love bug. You ready?

He is quickly on his feet and they are walking toward the
car.

<b>                            MASON
</b>             Yeah.     Hey, guess what, Mom?

<b>                            MOM
</b>             What?

<b>                         MASON
</b>             I figured out where wasps come from.

<b>                           MOM
</b>             Oh, yeah?    Where?

<b>                         MASON
</b>             Well, I think it must be if you flick
             a rock into the air just right, it'll
             turn into a wasp.

<b>                            MOM
</b>             Dang...

<b>                            MASON
</b>             Yep.

<b>                            MOM
</b>             That's cool.

<b>INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
Driving...

<b>                         MOM
</b>             So how was your day at school?

<b>                            MASON
</b>             Fine.

<b>                         MOM
</b>             Hey, I had a good meeting with Miss
             Butler this time. I kinda liked
             her.

<b>                         MASON
</b>             What did she say?
<b>                                                            2.
</b>
<b>                      MOM
</b>          Well... she said that you weren't
          turning in your homework assignments.
          And I told her, "I know he does them,
          'cause I check them every night."
          She said she found a big chunk of
          them crumpled up at the bottom of
          your backpack.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          She didn't ask for 'em.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Well, baby, she doesn't have to.
          You're supposed to turn them in.
          And she said you're still staring
          out the window all day.

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Not all day.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          And she said that you destroyed her
          pencil sharpener.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Not on purpose.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Wait, she said that you crammed a
          bunch of rocks in it.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I thought if it could sharpen pencils,
          maybe we could sharpen rocks.

<b>                      MOM
</b>              (stifling laugh)
          Well, what were you gonna do with a
          bunch of sharpened rocks?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I was trying to make arrowheads for
          my rock collection.

<b>                         MOM
</b>          Hm.

She glances back at him, with an understanding sigh.

<b>EXT. HOUSE/DITCH - DAY
</b>
Mason rides his bike across the front yard and heads down
the street. Soon he and his friend TOMMY are riding down
the embankment of a large drainage ditch.
<b>                                                                3.
</b>
<b>EXT. DITCH - DAY
</b>
Mason runs up, as Tommy is spray-painting a drawing on the
concrete wall of the drainage ditch.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Dude, when's my turn?

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>          I don't know.

Tommy hands Mason the can of spray paint.     Mason begins to
spray-paint a letter on the wall.

<b>                      SAMANTHA (O.S.)
</b>              (calling out)
          ...Maaason.

<b>                          TOMMY
</b>          Samantha!

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>          Oh!    Tommy!    Is Mason down there?

<b>                          TOMMY
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Well, tell him he has to come home
          for dinner.

<b>                          TOMMY   (O.S.)
</b>          Okay.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Mason lays on the floor watching a cartoon.

There's a knock at the door, and Mom comes out to answer it.
It's TED.

<b>                          MOM
</b>          Hey.

<b>                      TED
</b>          Hey, sweetie. Why aren't you ready?
          Hey, Mason.

<b>                          MASON
</b>          Hey, Ted.

<b>                      TED
</b>          Come on, come on, hurry up.      Let's
          go.
<b>                                                           4.
</b>
<b>                      MOM
</b>          What time is it?

<b>                         TED
</b>          It's nine.     Let's go, let's go.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Okay, I meant to call you, 'cause
          Janice flaked out. I don't have a
          sitter.

<b>                      TED
</b>          Why didn't you call somebody else?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Well, I can't get a baby-sitter now,
          it's nine o'clock. But you're welcome
          to hang out with us.

<b>                      TED
</b>          Well, no. I mean we have plans.
          The guys are expecting me.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Well... you can go.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          All right. Yeah, well, I'll come
          back in a couple of hours. Is that
          okay?

<b>                         MOM
</b>          Yeah.   Yes.

<b>                         TED
</b>          All right.

<b>                         MOM
</b>          It's okay.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The kids lie on either side of Mom, as she reads a story
aloud to them.

<b>                      MOM
</b>              (Reading)
          "Turn back! Turn back! I don't wanna
          talk to Moaning Myrtle." "Who?"
          said Harry as they backtracked
          quickly. "She haunts one of the
          toilets in the girls bathroom on the
          first floor," said Hermione.
          "She haunts a toilet?"

</b><b>                                                             5.
</b>
<b>                      MOM (CONT'D)
</b>          "Yes, it's been out of order all year
          because she keeps having tantrums
          and flooding the place."
          "I never went in there anyway if I
          could avoid it. It's awful trying
          to have a pee with her wailing at
          you."

<b>INT. BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
Mason lies awake in bed listening to his mother argue with
Ted.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          Why can't you just say that?

<b>                       MOM (O.S.)
</b>          I'm sorry.   I don't want to go with
          you.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          You're sorry, that's bullshit!

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          That's right, I wanna stay here with
          my kids. That's what I'd rather do.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          All right. Would you stop using
          your kids as an excuse?!

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          I'm not using my kids as an excuse!
          You don't even know--

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          I know you have to stay here with
          your kids! You're acting--

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          You have this immature life--

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          And why do I always-- Why--

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          You have no responsibility.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          I have an immature life!   I have an
          immature life?
<b>                                                         6.
</b>
<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          And I have responsibilities, okay,
          you don't know what it's like to be
          a parent.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          No, I don't! And why am I responsible
          for your mistakes in life?

<b>                       MOM  (O.S.)
</b>          If you had any idea. You don't think
          I wouldn't--

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Mason peeks around the corner to watch as the argument
continues.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Don't call my kids mistakes!   Don't!

<b>                      TED
</b>          I'm not responsible for your life
          choic-- I didn't call your kids--

<b>                      MOM
</b>          You said, "Your respons-- your
          mistakes in your life," pointing at
          my kids.

<b>                      TED
</b>          I know what I said, you know what,
          and immediately you use your kids
          again.

Mason peeks through the doorway.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          This is the reality: I'm a parent!

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          That's, that's hysterical.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          That means responsibility.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          I know you're a parent.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          I would love to have some time to
          myself! I would love to just go to
          a fuckin' movie! You don't think
          I'd like that?
<b>                      (MORE)
</b><b>                                                           7.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Go have some dinner, go to a bar! I
          don't even know what that's like. I
          was someone's daughter, then I was
          somebody's fucking mother! Okay, I
          don't know what that's like.

<b>INT. KID'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</b>
Mason is comfortably asleep. Samantha slowly pulls the pillow
out from underneath his head and smacks him with it.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>              (singing)
          "Oops, I did it again... I played
          with your heart. Got lost in the
          game. Oh baby, baby..."

Mason throws a stuffed animal at her that she deflects.

<b>                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>          "Oops, you think I'm in love. I'm
          sent from above. I'm not that
          innocent."

Another stuffed animal.    She continues to sing.

<b>                      MASON (O.S.)
</b>          Stop! Quit it!

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          "You see my problem is this. I'm
          dreaming away. Wishing that heroes
          truly exist. I cry watching the day.
          Can't you see I'm a fool in so many
          ways..."

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Quit!   Mom!

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          "But to lose all my senses-- that
          is..."

He tries to drown out this last bit with a sustained scream.
Soon the door flies open and Mom enters, angry.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          What the hell is going on in here?!

Samantha has instantaneously shifted from singing to crying.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Do you guys know what time it is?
<b>                                                                   8.
</b>
<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>              (through tears/sobs)
          He's throwing things at me...

<b>                     MOM
</b>          Mason! Do not throw things at your
          sister!

<b>                      MASON
</b>          She's faking, she hit me first!!

<b>                       MOM
</b>          Listen, both of you! I am going
          back to bed. I don't wanna hear
          another peep out of here for an hour.
          Go to sleep.

Mom slams the door behind her.        Samantha is suddenly fine,
almost cheerful.

<b>                      MASON
</b>              (to Samantha)
          Faker!

<b>                            MOM   (O.S.)
</b>          Hey!

<b>EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Mason swings on a large outdoor swing, while Tommy sits
thumbing through a catalog. Immediately after, we see Mason
and Tommy looking through the lingerie section of the catalog
together.

<b>                            MASON
</b>                 (laughs)
          Ohh!

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>              (pointing, giggling)
          Look what I found in the street!

<b>                            MASON
</b>          Dude!

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>          I know, right?
              (turns page)
          Look at those.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Hm, look at those!
<b>                                                           9.

<b>                      BOYS

          Ohh!!

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Moments later we see Mason having an introspective moment as
he gazes upon a deceased bird's carcass in the dirt.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Mom, Samantha, and Mason eat lunch.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          So listen, guys, I wanna talk to you
          about something, and you might not
          like this idea at first but... we're
          moving to Houston.

<b>                         MASON
</b>          When?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Well, soon. We should be out by the
          first, so we don't have to pay two
          rents next month.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          No, Mother, we're not moving. Nope,
          nope, sorry Mom. Nope. Nope.

Smack, smack, smack...

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Samantha, I have to go back to college
          so I can make us a better living.

Smack.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          With this job I can't take care of
          us the way I'd like to. I can't
          keep going this way. And Grandma
          said she'd help us out... and it
          would be nice to be near her.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>          Fine, Mother. You can do whatever
          you want but
              (shrugs)
          We're not moving.
              (Smacks)

Mason moves his fork around in his bowl.
<b>                                                       10.

</b>           Oh, baby, we can e-mail them or write.
           We can come back to visit. And guess
           what?

She reaches out to touch Samantha's arm.

<b>                       MOM (CONT'D)
</b>           This place that Grandma found us,
           you'll each have your own room.
           Right?

Samantha shrugs.

<b>                       MOM (CONT'D)
</b>           And there's a pool.

Samantha shrugs again, clearly not sold on the idea.

<b>INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Mason and Mom are lying on his bed together.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Mom, do you still love Dad?

<b>                       MOM
</b>           I still love your father... but that
           doesn't mean it was healthy for us
           to stay together.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           What if after we move he's trying to
           find us and he can't?

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Oh, that won't be a problem. He can
           call Grandma and she'll tell him or
           he can call Information. We won't
           be hard to find.

She pushes back his hair lovingly.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Is he still in Alaska?

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Well, that's what your uncle says.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Probably taming polar bears or
           something.
<b>                                                            11.
</b>
<b>                      MOM
</b>          Yeah... well, I hope they're taming
          him.

<b>EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</b>
The moving van drives off as mom puts another item in the
pile of stuff to be left at the curb.

<b>INT. HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Mom and Mason are getting ready to paint in the empty bedroom.
They're looking at the two lone murals, which look a little
odd without the bunk bed in front of them.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Here, wanna help me out?

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Sure.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Okay. Take this paint... very
          carefully... and paint any little
          smudge or mark or anything on the
          baseboard there, behind the door,
          and all around the doorways on the
          inside.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Meanwhile, Samantha is talking on the phone.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>              (on phone)
          She says we're gonna come visit and
          I'm gonna write and call you. Oh,
          wait, hold on a second. I'm getting
          another call.
              (Pushes Flash)
          Hello? Sorry, Tommy, Mason can't
          come over today. We're moving. And
          I'm on the other line. Bye.
              (Pushes Button)
          Althea? I'm gonna be sending Sailor
          Scout instructions. Email, and write
          back telling me how the other scouts
          are doing. Well, because you're the
          leader now.

During the last bit of this conversation, Mason slowly paints
over the "growth chart" lines on the bedroom door jamb.
<b>                                                              12.
</b>
<b>EXT. OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR - DAY
</b>
Carrying their final belongings from inside the house, they
slowly exit the front door and head over to the car.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna get
          there before it gets dark.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Goodbye yard, goodbye crepe myrtle,
          goodbye mailbox. Goodbye box of
          stuff Mommy won't let us take with
          us but we don't wanna throw away.
          Goodbye house, I'll never like mommy
          as much for making us move.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Samantha! Why don't you say goodbye
          to that little horse shit attitude?
          Okay? 'Cause we're not taking that
          in the car.

Just before he gets in the car, Mason is looking out at the
neighborhood.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Goodbye old lady who listens to rock
          music and rides a motorcycle.

Soon the car is pulling away. As they drive off, Mason
notices out his side of the car, Tommy approaching on a bike
in the distance, gesturing toward the car. Mason watches
him out the window, but says nothing as Tommy recedes into
the distance.

<b>INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
Mason and Samantha are restless     and energetic, letting their
childish energy get the best of     them as they wrestle, hit,
and squeal at each other in the     back seat of the car. It is
all well-intentioned though, as     the two share a laugh after
Mom tells them to quiet down.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>          Eeeee!   Don't!

<b>                     MOM
</b>          Hey! Hey, what's happening back
          there? Stop, put the barrier up.

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>          Ahh!   Stop!    No!
<b>                                                            13.
</b>
Mason punches the pillow barrier between himself and Samantha,
while his Mom speaks.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Hey, put the pillow between you.
          Make a barrier, come on. Stop.
          We're gonna play a game called The
          Game of Silence. Whoever can stay
          quiet for the longest period of time
          wins. You guys think you can do
          that? Okay, go!

The family's car moves on toward the Houston skyline just as
dusk arrives.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Mason appears grumpy, trying to shove what he needs for the
day into his backpack quickly.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          The bus'll be here in ten minutes.

<b>                      MOM (CONT'D)
</b>              (steps into doorway)
          Put that homework in your backpack!

<b>                        MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Go eat!    Baby, go eat!

<b>                        MASON
</b>          I am!

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Samantha places pancakes on their plates while talking to
Mason in a cryptic language, reminiscent of pig latin.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          ...I affatay servay yoohay.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Speak English! Shut up. Mom! She's
          speaking that stupid language again!

<b>                        MOM
</b>          Samantha!

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          I was speaking perfectly clear
          English, Mother. You know, he's a
          little slow in the head. He did
          officially flunk first grade.
<b>                                                          14.

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Sit your butt down.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>           Yes sir, Mother sir!

She salutes.

<b>                       MOM
</b>           All right, listen up guys. Grandma's
           gonna pick you up after school.
           Your dad is in town for the day so
           you're gonna spend the afternoon
           with him.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           Hmm.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Is he moving back?

<b>                       MOM
</b>           I don't know.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>           We haven't seen him in about eighty
           years.

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Like... a year and a half.

<b>                       MASON
</b>               (points to Samantha)
           Ha-ha.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           Oh please...

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Can we please eat, here? The bus is
           coming. Who wants syrup?

<b>INT.   CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
Mason plays Oregon Trail on a classroom computer, while his
TEACHER speaks in the background.

<b>                       TEACHER (O.S.)
</b>           All right, nice cursive. Okay, Mason,
           when I check the mobiles, am I gonna
           find yours?

<b>                          MASON
</b>           No.
<b>                                                             15.
</b>
<b>                          TEACHER
</b>           And why not?

<b>                       MASON
</b>           'Cause I didn't finish it.

<b>                       TEACHER
</b>           Well, it's time to finish it.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Just a minute.

<b>                       TEACHER
</b>           No, let's do Apple Quit.

Mason cuts a sheet of construction paper in the shape of the
state of Texas, presumably to finish his mobile. He sits
across from a female classmate, GIRL IN RED, who teases him.

<b>                       GIRL IN RED
</b>           Time to finish your work, Mason.
           "Apple Quit."

<b>INT.   GRANDMA'S HOUSE - LATER
</b>
Samantha sits with her GRANDMA, Catherine, showing off her
good grades on various school reports. Mason sits in his
own chair, playing with a Gameboy.

<b>                       SAMANTHA (O.S.)
</b>           So this is my history test...

<b>                        GRANDMA (O.S.)
</b>           Mm-hm.   A+, very good.

<b>                       SAMANTHA (O.S.)
</b>           And that's another history test.

<b>                       GRANDMA (O.S.)
</b>           Mm-hm, and another A.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>           Yeah, well, it doesn't have a plus
           but... oh well.

<b>                          GRANDMA
</b>           Oh.

Grandma strokes Samantha's hair proudly.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>           And then um, that's my report on
           lizards...
<b>                                                               16.

<b>                       GRANDMA

<b>                        SAMANTHA
</b>           And then, um... Oh yeah, these are
           my pictures.

<b>                       GRANDMA
</b>           What is that?

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>           Well, that's called a dewlap.

<b>                       GRANDMA
</b>           A dewlap, okay.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>           Oh yeah, this is a math test.

<b>                       GRANDMA
</b>           Oh, "A" again.

Mason reaches into candy dish on the table.

<b>                       GRANDMA (CONT'D)
</b>           Mase, that's the last candy, okay?

<b>                           MASON

<b>                         GRANDMA (O.S.)

<b>EXT.   STREET/FRONT PORCH - DAY

A Pontiac GTO pulls up outside.

<b>                           GRANDMA    (O.S.)
</b>           That's him.

DAD gets out of the car and hurries to the door.    Samantha
squeals, as she runs out to greet him.

<b>                           SAMANTHA

<b>                         DAD

</b>          Aw, you know what, why don't I take
          them over to their mom's?

A moment of tension passes between them.

<b>                      GRANDMA
</b>          No, that's okay. She's expecting
          me.

<b>                      GRANDMA
</b>          I don't think that's such a good

</b>You guys got everything, huh?

<b>               MASON AND SAMANTHA
</b>Yeah.

<b>             DAD

<b>            DAD
</b>Alright, let's roll. Now wait a
second. You're not the type of kids
who like presents, are ya?

<b>               SAMANTHA
</b>Yes!

<b>            DAD
</b>Naw, you don't --

</b>Yeah!   Yay!

<b>            MASON
</b>I call front seat!

<b>            SAMANTHA
</b>I wanted the front seat, though.

<b>            DAD
</b>Alright. Well, Mason gets it on the
way there and Samantha gets it on
the way back, huh? Hop in there.
<b>                                                            20.

smells of cigarettes. It's Dad's turn to bowl.

</b>          Now in Pavlov's experiment, what was
          the stimulus, that he used? Come on
          now, people! Tough weekend? What's
          the deal, here? Meat. Right? Meat.
          Meat powder, actually. Whatever
          meat powder is, it worked on this
          dog. Okay. He put the meat powder
          in there and it produced an
          unconditioned response in the dog,
          which was? Salivation. Alright.
          Now, who can give me another example
          of an unconditioned stimulus-response
          pair that happens to you everyday.
          It's probably happening to some of
          you right now.
              (pause)
          How about sex? Sure, you know. You
          see an attractive member of the
          opposite gender, you have an automatic
          response. You don't have to think
          about it. Mick Jagger wrote a song
          about... Oh, when they call your
          name, I salivate like a Pavlov dog.

Class laughs.

<b>                      BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          Thank you very much. Class dismissed.

Students leave, as Mason and Mom approach the professor.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          Doctor Welbrock, this is my son Mason.

<b>                        BILL
</b>          Ohh.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Mason, this is Dr. Welbrock.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Your son. Now see, I thought this
          was a boy genius who was taking my
          college course.

Mason laughs.    He and Bill shake hands.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          He wasn't feeling well today, so I
          thought I'd bring him with me.

Bill touches Mason's forehead.
<b>                                                         31.
</b>
<b>                      BILL
</b>          Ah! No fever. It's a con job. I
          can tell because I have a nine year
          old son, he pulls this all the time.
          Same kind of deal. Hey, you play
          soccer?

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Mm, no.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Neither does my boy. He hates soccer.
          He likes computers. My 11-year-old
          daughter, loves soccer. Who can
          figure? Hey, maybe we can get all
          you guys together sometime, huh?

<b>                         MOM
</b>          Maybe, yeah.     Well, you ready to go?

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Nice to meet you, Mason.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Nice to meet you, too.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          And thanks for coming to my class.

Mason walks ahead of them as Olivia and Bill speak a little
more intimately. It's clear that they have more than just a
professor-student relationship. Mason notices a bit of this
and looks on, confused.

<b>                         BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          Olivia.

<b>                         MOM
</b>          Hm?

<b>                         BILL
</b>          Nice kid.

<b>                         MOM
</b>          Thanks.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          So you think, uh, Grandma might be
          available for a little baby-sitting?
<b>                                                                32.
</b>
<b>                       MOM        (O.S.)
</b>               (giggles)
           Maybe.

<b>                        BILL
</b>           Really?   Well, great.

<b>EXT.   BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Mason and Samantha play an outdoor trampoline game with Randy
and Mindy, their new stepbrother and stepsister. They are
in the big backyard of their new home, where Dr. Welbrock
and his children have lived.

<b>                       GRANDMA
</b>           Hey kids, they're here!

<b>                       KIDS
</b>           Oh, they're home, they're home!

<b>                         GRANDMA
</b>           Hurry!    Hurry!

They all scramble inside and quickly assemble for a big
welcome home ceremony in the front entryway. A sign reads,
"Welcome Home Honeymooners, We Love You Mom &amp; Dad". Olivia
and Bill open the door to enter the house.

<b>                           MOM
</b>           Hey!

<b>                           KIDS
</b>           Mom!   Daddy!

<b>                         BILL
</b>           Oh!    We're here!     Hey, we've returned!

Hugs all around. The family talks over one another.      Bill
notices the "Welcome Home" sign the kids made.

<b>                           SAMANTHA AND MASON
</b>           Hi Dad!

<b>                       BILL
</b>           Samantha, Mason, look -- Thank you.
           That's very nice.

<b>                       MOM
</b>               (to Randy and Mindy)
           Hey guys!

The group all speaks at once.
<b>                                                             33.
</b>
<b>                      BILL
</b>              (To Grandma)
          Hi, Mom. How are you?

<b>                      SAMANTHA (O.S.)
</b>          Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! Look at the
          sign we made!

<b>                      BILL
</b>              (To Grandma)
          They give you any trouble?

<b>                      MINDY
</b>          Samantha and I made it all ourselves.

<b>                      BILL (O.S.)
</b>          I know the boys helped you with that
          a lot.

<b>                      MINDY
</b>          No, not at all!

The group continues to speak at once.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          That's good... Oh, pass out the
          goodies.

Mom passes out a bag of presents to each of the kids.

<b>                       MOM
</b>          This is for the girls, this is for
          the girls...

<b>                      BILL
</b>              (to Grandma)
          Don't worry, we got you some absinthe
          or something.

<b>                      GRANDMA
</b>          Oh, let's pour it.

<b>INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
The family sits around the table, swapping fun stories and
pictures from their time apart.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          You take this big elevator up, and
          when we got to the top, we flew a
          paper airplane off.

<b>                      RANDY (O.S.)
</b>          And what happened?
<b>                                                         34.
</b>
<b>                         MOM    (O.S.)
</b>          It flew!

<b>                      BILL (O.S.)
</b>          It flew away. It went for miles.
          Went onto the Arctic Trail.

They laugh.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Oh, did you guys kiss under the Bridge
          of Sighs?

<b>                         MOM
</b>          Yes.

<b>                         BILL
</b>          Yes, we did.

Bill leans in to kiss Olivia.

<b>                      MINDY
</b>          Hey, Mom, can we see your wedding
          ring?

<b>                         MOM    (O.S.)
</b>          Oh, sure.

Mom hands over her wedding ring. The boys look at a 20
Questions game.

<b>                         MINDY (O.S.)
</b>                 (Eyeing the ring)
          Wow.

<b>                      SAMANTHA (O.S.)
</b>              (Holding the ring)
          Technically that's a fancy step cut
          surrounded by miniature brilliant.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I wish we could've gone to Europe.

<b>                         RANDY
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Yeah, we'll go as a family next time.
          But you didn't miss much, really.
          We just stayed in the hotel room the
          whole time playing video games.

Mom laughs.
<b>                                                 35.
</b>
<b>                         MASON
</b>          Really?

<b>                      BILL
</b>          And the hotels are really small and
          really old. Squeaky.

The WAITER comes over.

<b>                      WAITER
</b>          Can I get you anything else? Would
          you like to see a dessert menu?

<b>                       BILL
</b>              (To Randy)
          Listen, I told you to put that away.
              (To Mom)
          Would you put that in your purse,
          please? Computer games at the table.
              (To Waiter)
          Yes, uh, please, another bottle of
          wine.

<b>                      MASON
</b>              (to Waiter)
          Um, Coke.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Um, you know what? Mason, you're
          okay with water. No more Cokes.
              (to Waiter)
          Thank you.

<b>                      BILL (O.S.)
</b>              (To Randy)
          Now how 'bout you? Did you finish
          your science project?

<b>                      RANDY
</b>          Not quite yet.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Well, did you work on it? I mean,
          did you build anything, or plan
          anything, or..?

<b>                         RANDY
</b>          A little.

<b>                      BILL
</b>              (to Mindy)
          Did he work on it at all, Mindy?

<b>                         MINDY
</b>          No.
<b>                                                         36.
</b>
<b>                      BILL
</b>              (to Mindy)
          Did he sit around playing video games
          with Mason the whole time?

<b>                         MINDY
</b>              (laughs)
          Yeah.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Mm. You were supposed to finish
          that by the time I got back.
          Remember? Hey.

<b>EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY
</b>
Our gang of kids, plus two more (NEIGHBORHOOD BOY and
NEIGHBORHOOD GIRL) walk home from school together. The boys
walk in a pack slightly in front of the girls.

<b>                      NEIGHBORHOOD BOY
</b>          Grievous is the best, man.

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Yoda!   Yoda, man.

<b>                         RANDY
</b>          No, Yoda is!

<b>                         MASON AND RANDY
</b>          Yoda!

<b>                      NEIGHBORHOOD BOY
</b>          He has four arms.

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Yoda!   Represent.

<b>                      MINDY
</b>          I hate Ms. Billingsly. Everybody's
          been saying she's lesbian.

<b>                       NEIGHBORHOOD GIRL
</b>          She is.   She hit on Stacy.

<b>                      MINDY
</b>          Man, that's gross.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Think it's true?

<b>                      NEIGHBORHOOD GIRL
</b>          She's always walking in the locker
          room.
<b>                                                          37.

<b>                      RANDY
</b>          I think I still have a couple of
          those--

PAUL, overly large/mentally impaired neighborhood teen they
seem familiar with, walks by awkwardly bouncing a basketball.

<b>                         NEIGHBORHOOD BOY (O.S.)
</b>          Hey, Paul.     Tell us a joke.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>          Damn.   Fuck.     Go to hell.   Ass.

The kids look at him quizzically and keep walking.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
Mason and Randy are playing a video game.

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Uh!    Blew you up.

<b>                      RANDY
</b>          Aw heck, man. That was not fair.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          No, actually it was. That's like
          the fairest thing ever.

<b>                          RANDY
</b>          Ugh.

<b>                      MASON

<b>INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY
</b>
Samantha and Mindy sit with Mom on the sofa, laughing, while
Mason and Randy sit opposite them. Bill is up first, as the
whole family plays charades.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Three Musketeers?

<b>                          RANDY (O.S.)

<b>                         MASON AND RANDY
</b>          Chicken?     Bird?

Mom and the girls laugh.

<b>                          BOYS
</b>          Second word.
<b>                                                   38.

<b>                      BILL (CONT'D)

Samantha stands to take her turn.

<b>                         MOM AND MINDY    (O.S.)
</b>          Second word.

<b>                         MINDY   (O.S.)
</b>          Blanket?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Hey, you can't use props!

Samantha turns to smack mason with the blanket.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Hey, hey, hey, hey. Cut it out.
          Hey, uh-- Judges speak: No props.
          No props. Can't use props. You can
          do it without that. Think, think,
          think.

<b>                         MOM (O.S.)

<b>                      MOM
</b>          The gathered? Folded.

<b>                         MINDY

The boys laugh.

<b>                      MINDY (CONT'D)

Mom and Mindy clap and cheer at their victory.

<b>INT. BOOK RELEASE PARTY - NIGHT

Samantha got it right.

<b>EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
</b>
Mason, Randy, and Bill are practicing at a golf course.
Bill is advising the boys on their stances and golf swings.

<b>                      BILL
</b>              (to Randy)
          Oh no, no, no, no. Back up and take
          a practice swing first, remember?
          Nice and easy. Sweep the floor.
          Sweep the floor. That's good. Don't
          swing too hard, Randy.
              (to Mason)
          He always swings too hard.

Randy takes a swing.

<b>                      BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey, alright! Very good.

It's Mason's turn to take a swing.

<b>                      BILL (CONT'D)
</b>              (to Mason)
          Back your feet up a little bit.
          Yeah, like that. Now you're gonna
          hit it straighter. Okay. Alright,
          go up and hit it. That's good.
          Nice slow swing is going to be better
          for you.

Mason swings.

<b>                         BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          Alright!

Later, Randy putts the ball and misses.

<b>                      BILL (CONT'D)
</b>              (to Randy)
          I don't know man, you must've been...
          See, your feet are too open, Randy.

Mason sets up to take his putt.

<b>                      BILL (CONT'D)
</b>              (to Mason)
          Nice and natural.

Mason hits the ball into the hole.       Bill high fives him.

<b>                      BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          Yes! Go! Alright! Give me five.
          Good putt, son, good putt.
<b>                      (MORE)
</b><b>                                                             41.
</b>
<b>                       BILL (CONT'D)
</b>           Did you see that, Randy? That's the
           way to do it!
               (to self)
           Alright, birdie putt.

Bill misses the easy putt.

<b>                       BILL (CONT'D)
</b>           Goddamn it. Son of a bitch.
               (to Mason and Randy)
           Get my clubs, would you? Get the
           ball.

<b>EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY
</b>
Bill and the boys drive up to the local liquor store.

<b>                       BILL
</b>           This is just in case we have guests
           this weekend.

Bill gets out of the car.

<b>                        RANDY
</b>           He always says that.      But we never
           have guests.

The boys are chewing green bubble gum. Randy blows a big
bubble and Mason pops it with his hand.

<b>INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY
</b>
Bill pours a generous amount of vodka into a large, opaque
cup. He then hides the vodka bottle behind some detergent
in the laundry cupboard.

<b>INT.   KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Samantha and Mindy are busy loading the dishwasher.   Bill
enters the room, drink in hand.

<b>                       BILL
</b>           Samantha, I think I heard your dad
           pull up.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>           Oh, alright.

<b>                       BILL
</b>           You guys finish your chores?

<b>                          MINDY
</b>           Not quite.
<b>                                                      42.
</b>
<b>                        SAMANTHA
</b>          Just about.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          How 'bout the dusting, Sam?

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          I haven't done that yet.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Well, I saw you working on your art
          project. You mean you had time to
          finish your little art project but
          you didn't have time to finish your
          chores? I thought we talked about
          that.

<b>                      MINDY
</b>          Dad, it's fine. I can finish the
          dusting. I have all day here.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          No, it's not fine,    Mindy. You have
          your own chores to    do and Sam has
          hers to do. Huh?      It's simple!
          Poor choice there,    Sam. Hurry up.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Mason is pulling weeds, while Randy rakes the lawn.

<b>                      BILL
</b>              (yelling from the
               porch)
          Mason! Your dad's here...

As the boys approach...

<b>                      BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          You guys aren't settin' any speed
          records, are you? What'd you do,
          get about half done? Hey, hey, hey,
          hey, hey. So did you finish?

<b>                        MASON
</b>          No.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Is the job complete?

Mason shakes his head "No".

<b>                      BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          So, what are you going to be doing
          tomorrow? Same thing, right?
<b>                                                          43.
</b>
<b>                        MASON AND RANDY
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                        BILL
</b>          Okay.   Go.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Mom is doing work at the kitchen table, as Samantha and Mason
kiss her goodbye.

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Bye, Mom.

<b>                      MOM
</b>              (to Mason)
          Bye, baby. I love you.

<b>                        SAMANTHA
</b>          Bye, Mama.

<b>                      MOM
</b>              (to Samantha)
          Bye, honey. Have fun with your dad.

<b>                       BILL (O.S.)
</b>          Just a minute, Mason.
              (to Mom)
          The boys didn't finish raking the
          leaves. Samantha did not finish
          dusting. So tomorrow, when they
          come home, instead of swimming and
          all the other little stuff that they
          want to do, they're gonna do their
          chores. Right?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Right! Okay, guys, you had this
          conversation, you understand?

The boys nod.

<b>                        MOM (CONT'D)
</b>          Tomorrow?

The girls nod.

<b>                        MOM (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Thank you. I just wanted you to
          back me up on that so I'm not the
          only one yelling at them all the
          time.
<b>                                                               44.
</b>
<b>                      MOM
</b>          Okay, I back you up.      You guys got
          that?

Mason nods.

<b>                      MOM (CONT'D)
</b>          We all agree, everybody agrees, right?
          Tomorrow, chores?

Samantha nods.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Well, they don't hear it, you know.
          It goes in one ear and out the other.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          But Dad, I mean, dusting is pointless.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          It's not pointless, you just don't
          like to do it.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          But I mean, who dusts anymore?

<b>                      BILL
</b>          You do when we ask you to! And don't --
          Olivia, don't let her back-talk me
          in front of the other kids, please.
          Thank you.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Samantha, please...

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>          Whatever!

Samantha turns to walk away from the conversation.

<b>                      BILL (O.S.)
</b>          Bye-bye, have a wonderful weekend.

<b>                         MOM (O.S.)
</b>          Mm.    Okay.   Bye, guys. Love you.

The other kids follow Samantha as she exits.       Bill sits down
at the table with Mom.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          I'm sorry, but I thought we talked
          about it. You have to draw a line,
          you have to back it up.
<b>                                                                45.
</b>
<b>                      MOM
</b>          Okay. It's just... you have so many
          lines Bill. Everything's a line.

<b>EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Dad is parked in the drive way.     He gets out of the car to
greet the kids.

<b>                         DAD
</b>          Hey, Randy!

<b>                         RANDY

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Pretty good.

Dad throws the kids' bags in the trunk.

<b>                        DAD
</b>          Yeah?    Alright.    Let's roll!

<b>EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

They drive down the street in Dad's car.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          You guys ready for the big game?

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>          Yeah.
<b>                                      46.
</b>
<b>            DAD
</b>Sam, who are the Astros playing
tonight?

<b>            SAMANTHA
</b>I don't know.

<b>            DAD
</b>Milwaukee Brewers. Alright, get to
know 'em, get to hate 'em. Mase!
How you been, huh? How was your
week?

<b>               MASON
</b>Pretty good.

<b>             DAD
</b>Yeah?   What you been up to?

<b>               MASON
</b>Not much.

<b>           DAD (O.S.)
</b>No? You still hangin' with that kid
Joe?

<b>               MASON
</b>Yeah.

<b>            DAD
</b>Yeah, he's still your best friend?

<b>            MASON
</b>Yeah, I guess.

<b>            DAD
</b>Okay.
    (To Samantha)
How 'bout you? How was your week?

<b>               SAMANTHA
</b>Fine.

<b>            DAD (O.S.)
</b>What you been up to?

<b>            SAMANTHA
</b>Nothin' really.

<b>            DAD
</b>You um, you still working on that
sculpture project?

<b>               SAMANTHA (O.S.)
</b>Yeah.
<b>                                                      47.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Almost finished.

<b>                      DAD   (O.S.)
</b>          What's it of?

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Nothing.

Dad pulls the car over and parks.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Alright, no-no-no-no-no. Nope, that
          is not how we're going to talk to
          one another. Alright? Now, I will
          not be that guy. You can not put me
          in that category, alright? The
          biological father who I spend every
          other week with and I make polite
          conversation, you know, while he
          drives me places and buys me shit.
          No! Talk to me.

He turns to Samantha in the passenger seat.

<b>                      DAD (CONT'D)
</b>          Samantha, how was your week? Uh, I
          don't know Dad, it was kind of tough.
          Billy and Ellen broke up, and Ellen's
          kind of mad at me because she saw me
          talking to Billy in the cafeteria.
          And you remember that sculpture I
          was working on? Well, it was a
          unicorn and the horn broke off. So,
          now it's zebra. Okay? But I still
          think I'm going to get an 'A'.
          Alright?

Dad turns around to address Mason in the back seat.

<b>                      DAD (CONT'D)
</b>          Mason, uh, how was your week? Well
          Dad, you know it was kind of tough.
          Joe, he's kind of a jerk, actually.
          He stole some cigarettes from his
          mom and he wanted me to smoke 'em.
          But I said no, cause I knew what a
          hard time you had quittin' smokin',
          Dad. How 'bout that? Is that so
          hard?
<b>                                                           48.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Dad, these questions are kind of
          hard to answer.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          What is so hard to answer about what
          sculpture are you making?

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          It's abstract.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Okay. Okay, that's good. See,
          that's, I didn't know that. I didn't
          know you were even interested in
          abstract art.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>          I'm not.   They make us do it.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          But Dad, I mean why is it all on us
          though? You know, what about you?
          How was your week? You know, who do
          hang out with? Do you have a
          girlfriend? What have you been up
          to?

<b>                      DAD
</b>          I see your point.

Mason smiles.

<b>                      DAD (CONT'D)
</b>          So we should just let it happen more
          natural, right? That's what you're
          sayin', right?

Mason nods.

<b>                       DAD (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay.   That's what we'll do.    Starting
          now.

<b>EXT. BUTTERFLY MUSEUM - DAY
</b>
Dad, Samantha, and Mason are pointing out different
butterflies they find, using a nature chart. A butterfly
lands on Mason's shoulder.

<b>                      DAD

Dad opens his hands and shows them a butterfly in his palms.

<b>EXT.   SCHOOL - DAY

Mom is dropping Mason off at school.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           I mean, he didn't even ask! He just
           cut it. I mean, it's my hair!

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Well, no wonder you were angry.   I'd
           be angry too.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           I look like a martian now.

<b>                       MOM

           talk to him about it later, okay?

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Yeah, I tried to call you but you
           didn't answer your phone.

<b>                       MOM
</b>           I'm so sorry. I've been so busy
           with school... Hey.

She touches his hair, lovingly.

<b>                       MOM (CONT'D)
</b>           For what it's worth, it's hair and
           it will grow back. Now I can see
           your pretty eyes and your foxy face.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Why'd you even marry him?    He's such
           a jerk.

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Well, Bill has his good qualities.
           You know, nobody's perfect. And now
           we have a family.

<b>                       MASON

<b>INT.   SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Mason walks down the hall, towards his classroom door.

<b>INT.   CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
Mason enters the classroom, just as his class begins reciting
the Pledge of Allegiance.

<b>                       STUDENTS
</b>           I pledge allegiance to the flag of
           the United States of America, and to
           the Republic for which it stands,
           one nation, under God, indivisible,
           with liberty and justice for all.

Students snicker at Mason's new haircut.

<b>                       TEACHER (O.S.)
</b>           Please join me in the Texas pledge.

<b>                        STUDENTS

<b>                       TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>           Alright! Alright class, as you know,
           we've been working on our mythology
           projects. And we're going to be
           writing papers about gods and
           goddesses. We've listed those gods
           and goddesses here on the board. We
           added a couple of monsters, for some
           of you who might be interested in
           that. And you're going to write
           your essay about your god or goddess,
           and to make sure that you cover
           everything, let's make sure that we
           do all of these things right here...

Mason is handed a note from across the room.

<b>                       TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>           First of all, we need to name your
           god or goddess, and you need to
           include who, what, when, where, why,
           and how...

The note reads: Mason, I think your hair looks kewl! - Nicole

skateboards alongside them.

Neighborhood Boy skates off in a different direction.

</b>           Yeah.

<b>INT.   GARAGE - DAY
</b>
Mason and Randy pull up to a half open garage and drop their
bikes outside. Mom can be seen laying on the floor of the
garage, crying.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Mom, are you okay?

<b>                       RANDY

<b>                       BILL
</b>           Your mother had a little accident.
           Now she's being dramatic.

Mom is still crying as the boys exit.     Bill enters the garage
with a drink in his hand.

<b>                       BILL (CONT'D)
</b>           Get off the fucking floor Olivia,

Mom continues to cry.

<b>INT.   DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

Bill walks in angrily, carrying a bottle. He loudly bangs
things on the table, and pours himself a drink.

The family is seated at the dinner table, practically frozen.

<b>                           SAMANTHA
</b>          No.

</b>          No.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          I didn't think so.

He drinks the entire glass, and slowly zeros in on Mason.

<b>                      BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          You don't like me much, do you Mason?
          That's okay, I don't like me either.
          Think that's funny, huh? You think
          that's fuckin' funny?

Bill throws his empty glass at Mason's plate, shattering it.

<b>                           MOM
</b>          Oh!

<b>                      BILL (O.S.)
</b>              (to Randy)
          What's the matter, you feeling a
          little left out?

Bill throws the empty whiskey bottle past Randy.   It shatters
on the floor.

<b>                           MOM
</b>          Oh!

Mason watches THE LANDLORD web video on his laptop. The

</b>           Yeah, but he hasn't thrown and broken
           stuff.

on the sofa.

call histories.

Samantha and Mason look around.

<b>                       MOM (CONT'D)
</b>           Don't look back.

<b>                       CAROL (O.S.)

<b>INT.   CAROL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Mason and Carol's son, LEE, play a boxing game on Nintendo
Wii, while her daughter, ABBY, sings in the background. Mom
brings the boys a snack.

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Hey, Lee and Mason.    Take a break.
           Here's a snack.

Abby continues to sing.     The room is tense.

</b>           Hey, Abby, why don't you come help
           me with this, huh?

<b>                       SAMANTHA

<b>                      MOM
</b>          I'm not their legal guardian, honey.
          That would be kidnapping. I can't
          just...

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Well, what's gonna happen to them?
          What happens when their legal guardian
          is dangerous and abusive?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          You know, I don't know honey. I
          called their mom. I called the Child
          Protective Services. You know, I
          have you and your brother. We were
          in a dangerous situation. You're my
          responsibility.

<b>                      SAMANTHA

Mom fights back tears.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Not long. We're...

<b>                      CAROL
</b>          Yeah, it's like having a big sister?
          Like having a brother.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          We're gonna help out, right? You're

<b>EXT.   SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
Mom pulls up to drop Samantha off at the front doors of her
new Junior High School.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>           Mom, this is awful. You're dumping
           me in some parking lot of this school
           where I don't even know anyone! I'm
           leaving all my friends and I didn't
           even get to say goodbye! I don't
           know where to go!

<b>                       MOM

           that door. The office is right there.
           They're expecting you, they're gonna
           give you your schedule. Here's your
           lunch money. I will pick you up
           right here at 3:30.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>           I'm wearing dirty clothes! Because
           you wouldn't even let us get our
           stuff! We don't even have a place
           to live! This sucks!

Samantha gets out of the car, slamming the door behind her.
Mom screams out of the window as she walks away.

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Samantha... I'm doing the best I
           can! And you're right, it sucks!
           But it doesn't suck half as much as
           having a drunk fool slam your head
           against a wall! So cut your horseshit
           attitude.

Mom turns to Mason in the back as he climbs toward the front
seat.

<b>                       MOM (CONT'D)
</b>           Put your seat belt on!

Mason nods.
<b>                                                          71.

Mom leans in to kiss him.

<b>                         MASON
</b>           Mom...

Mason walks away, embarrassed at her public affection.

<b>INT.   SCHOOL CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

The students all make small talk as they wait for class to
begin. Mason enters and looks to MRS. DARBY for instruction.

<b>                        MRS. DARBY
</b>           Hi!   Are you Mason?

</b>           Yes ma'am.

<b>                       MRS. DARBY

           Alright? Let's get started.

<b>EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY
</b>
Mason pushes an Obama/Biden campaign sign into the ground,
before he and Samantha walk across the street. Samantha
waits in the street with more signs, while Mason knocks on
the RESIDENT's front door.

<b>                          RESIDENT   (O.S.)
</b>           What?

The white-haired Resident is standing to Mason's right,
beneath his carport.

<b>                      MASON
</b>           Oh, hi. Can I put an Obama sign in
           your yard?

<b>                       RESIDENT
</b>           Do I look like a Barack Hussein Obama

Mason shrugs.

<b>                          RESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>           No.

Mason turns to leave.

<b>                       RESIDENT (CONT'D)
</b>           This is private property. Get off.
           I could shoot you!

He rejoins Samantha at the street.

<b>                          MASON
</b>           What a dick.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>           He had a Confederate flag on his
           house.

<b>EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MOMENTS LATER

          way. Okay? Just not engage in that.
          That did not work out very well for

          said that although U.S. teenagers
          are not the most sexually active, we
          have the highest rate of teenage
          pregnancy. Okay?

A woman, TAMMY, walks up to the table, interrupting their
conversation.

<b>                        DAD
</b>          Oh, hey.    Hey, Tammy.    How you doin'?

Dad stands to greet Tammy.

<b>                      TAMMY
</b>          Nice to see you.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Wow, yeah, good to see you. Um,
          Tammy, this is my daughter Samantha.

<b>                         TAMMY
</b>          Hey.

<b>                      DAD

          Tammy.

<b>                      TAMMY      (O.S.)

</b>          Hi.

<b>                      TAMMY
</b>          Hi, Mason. Nice to meet you.      Heard
          a lot about you guys.

<b>                         DAD
</b>          Yeah, yeah.     What're you doin' here?

Dad sits back down at the table.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Um, we're going camping. Well no,
          this one is not going camping. This

<b>                                                          79.

<b>                      TAMMY
</b>              (to Samantha)
          Ohh... Fun.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          We, the men, are going camping.

<b>                      TAMMY
</b>          Boys are going camping. Alright,
          very nice. Well uh, we still on for
          tomorrow or...?

<b>                      DAD   (O.S.)
</b>          Yeah --

<b>                      TAMMY
</b>          Yeah?

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'll drop him
          off at seven and then I'll just call
          you, alright?

<b>                      TAMMY
</b>          Okay. Great. It was really nice

</b>          I'll see you.

<b>                      TAMMY
</b>          Talk to you soon. Bye.

Tammy walks away. Mason smirks at his dad.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Don't -- don't, don't look at me
          like that, alright? I just -- look,
          just to finish the point -- okay? I
          was twenty-three when your mom had
          you, alright? So was she, alright?
          And we didn't put ourselves in the
          best position to be great parents,
          and I wish that -- I wish I were a
          better parent to you guys. Alright?
          And I, I hope that you can learn
          from my mistakes. Okay? So, wear a
          condom. Or get Garrett to -- I don't
          know. Whatever.

Samantha cringes, as Dad laughs. Mason can't help but smile.

<b>INT. MOVING CAR - DAY
</b>
Dad and Mason are driving along the open road, listening to
a song by Wilco.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Now... listen to this song, alright?

Sings along:

<b>                      DAD (CONT'D)
</b>          "I try to stay busy" It's just
          straight up, the lyrics... it's a
          straight up old school country song.

<b>                      SONG
</b>          "I do the dishes, I mow the lawn..."

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Listen to the production of this.
          Production's like uh, like "Abbey

<b>                      SONG
</b>          "I try to keep myself occupied"

Dad sings along.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          "Even though I know you're not comin'
          home." You know, his old woman's
          gone... straight up. Nothin' fancy.

<b>                      DAD AND SONG
</b>          "I try to keep the house nice and
          neat. Make my bed. I change the
          sheets."

<b>EXT. RIVERBED - DAY
</b>
Mason and Dad walk along the rocks, mid-conversation. They
sit down near the water and begin taking off socks and shoes.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Yeah, I think she's about to get her
          master's degree.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Well, then she's gonna start applying
          for teaching jobs?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I think she already has.
<b>                                                             81.
</b>
<b>                       DAD
</b>          Really?   Where?

<b>                         MASON
</b>              (shrugs)
          All over.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          All over Texas?

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Well, if you gotta move, you gotta
          move, you know? It's no big deal.
          We can handle that. I'll still come
          get you every other weekend. I mean,
          unless she moves 500 miles away or
          something, it'll just be a little
          more car time. No big deal.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I'm just kinda sick of moving.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Well, I bet you are. But you know,
          you never know. I mean, I might
          have to move, right? I'm working
          for this insurance company now.
          These places get bought and sold all
          the time. You know? We'll just
          roll with it.

They take off pants, walk up to the water in boxer shorts.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I thought you were a musician?

<b>                      DAD
</b>          I am but... life is expensive, you
          know. Guy's got to be responsible.
          What do you think?

Mason pushes his Dad into the water, then dives in himself.

<b>                      DAD (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey, hey, you bast -- Oh you, punk
          kid! You got no respect!

Dad splashes his son and they both begin to swim.

Mason and Dad are now hiking through the woods.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          You know that redhead at the bowling
          alley?

<b>                         DAD
</b>          Sure.     What about her?

<b>                      MASON

<b>                      DAD

          little bit.

<b>                      MASON

<b>                      DAD
</b>          How do you mean?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Like... have you kissed her?

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Um... Yeah. Yeah. I've kissed her.
          What about you? You got a girlfriend?

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Sort of.

<b>                         DAD
</b>          Really.     Have you uh, have you kissed
          her?

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Not really.

<b>                         DAD
</b>          Yeah.     Well, what have you done?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Well, we talked on the phone.

<b>                        DAD
</b>          Oh yeah?    How'd that go?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Pretty terrible.

<b>                         DAD

<b>                  DAD (CONT'D)
</b>       (Laughs)
Why?

<b>            MASON
</b>Well, when we're at school, we got
plenty to talk about, but when we're
alone or on the phone, it's like we
have nothing in common.

<b>                  DAD
</b>Nothing?

<b>            MASON
</b>Uh, she's not interested in music or
video games or... the three best
movies this summer...

<b>              DAD
</b>All right.    What?

<b>            MASON
</b>Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight and
Pineapple Express.

<b>            DAD
</b>Yeah, what about 'em?

<b>            MASON
</b>She said they all sucked.

<b>            DAD
</b>Okay, well what's she interested in?

<b>            MASON
</b>I don't know. Goin' to the mall
with her stupid friends.

<b>            DAD
</b>Alright. Well, is she cute?      Watch
your step there.

<b>                  MASON
</b>Yeah.

<b>            DAD
</b>Yeah? Alright. Well, here's what
you do. Alright. First off, you
gotta ask her a lot of questions.
Then you have to listen to the
answers, alright, actually be
interested in her. Alright, if you
can do those things, you're gonna be
light years ahead of all the other
guys.

<b>EXT.   CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Dad and Mason sit around the campfire, making s'mores.

<b>                       DAD
</b>           Okay, this is the best s'more I ever

<b>                          MASON
</b>           Dad...

Mason laughs.

<b>                       DAD (CONT'D)

</b>           I don't know. I mean, I think if

           the period where the game is set is
           where it would have to be, 'cause
           there's nothin' after, really. At

<b>                       DAD

<b>                       DAD
</b>           You know, you can turn Han Solo into

Jill glances down at the book in Mason's hand.

          Kurt Vonnegut.

<b>                      JILL
</b>          I think my older brother likes him.
          I'm reading "To Kill a Mockingbird"

          fun of me. I think I'm the only

          like the "Twilight" books. Have you
          read them?

<b>                      MASON

<b>                      MASON

<b>INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
Mason walks into his mother's classroom. He takes a seat to
observe from the back, while she lectures.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          His cognitive series, his interviews
          with orphans, Ethology theorists'
          work... And then he in turn was
          supported strongly by Harry Harlow's
          rhesus monkey study. Now you guys,
          you gotta think, this is the 1950's,
          this was radical! This flew in the
          face of traditional learning theory,
          of B.F. Skinner's classical and
          instrumental conditioning. Now,
          Bowlby is going to argue that human
          survival depends on us falling in
          love. It depends on me falling in
          love with my mother, and my mother
          falling in love with me. And if
          that doesn't happen, we're pretty
          much doomed. Now think about it. A
          tiger chases our tribe out of a cave.
          Now an ideal mother goes, "Huh! My
          baby! I love you! I'll protect
          you!" Or... "Well you, why am I
          going to pick you up? You're going
          to slow me down. You... are... tiger
          kibble!"

The class laughs.

<b>                      MOM (CONT'D)
</b>          So next week we are gonna get into
          Bowlby's four stages of attachment --
          oh oh, uh, Professor Douglas and I --
          some of you might have classes with
          Elena -- she and I are hosting a
          little pre-Thanksgiving get-together
          at my place, so if anyone wants to
          come, please stop by.
              (pause)
          I'm not the greatest cook...

The class laughs again.

<b>INT. APARTMENT - DAY

Mason opens the door as he and his mother enter the house.

<b>                        MOM
</b>          Thanks.

Mom drops her purse on the table and then walks down the
hallway to Samantha's bedroom. She knocks on the door before
walking inside.

<b>                        MOM (CONT'D)
</b>          Samantha!

Samantha is sitting on her bed, listening to music with a
friend, GABY.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>          Mom, I know what you're gonna say.

          turn around.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          No, no! No excuses! The bottom
          line is you didn't do what you said
          you were gonna do. You stranded
          your brother!

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          It's embarrassing to ask my friend

          at the middle school.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          What do you mean "some kid"? He's
          your brother! And you know what?
          We've helped Janie out before. I
          mean, she lives right around the
          corner. It's no big deal.

<b>                        SAMANTHA
</b>          Sorry.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          You know what, Samantha? You need

           he's not a baby anymore. You don't
           have to treat him like one. He's in
           eighth grade and he can find his way
           home if he wants to.

the door.

<b>INT.   CAMPING HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Mason, Chase, and Tony are now with two older guys, CHARLIE
(Chase's older brother) and his friend (SENIOR GUY). The
boys are drinking beer and breaking wooden boards with their
feet.

<b>                          SENIOR GUY
</b>           Yeah!     That's what I'm talkin' about!

The boys murmur indistinctly.

<b>                       SENIOR GUY (CONT'D)
</b>           You ready? Check this shit out.
           That was alright, but this is gonna

<b>                      SENIOR GUY
</b>          Alright. This -- is your face. I'm

Senior Guy kicks through the wooden board.

</b>          Ohh shit, alright.    Nice.

<b>                      CHARLIE

<b>                      CHASE
</b>          Alright, alright. Now check this
          out. You might want to move.

Chase picks up a circular saw blade and throws it into a
large piece of sheet-rock with the outline of a body on it.

<b>                      CHASE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oww, that'd be painful. That's like

Mason also heaves the blade into the human outline.

</b>          Whoa!   Pancreas!

<b>                      MASON

          Man, have a beer, man.    That was

</b>          Fuck yeah, dude. You don't even
          have to play that well. I mean, you
          start playing your instrument, and
          they line up to give you blow jobs.
              (Points to Tony)
          Except for you. It doesn't impress
          the ladies so much when you play
          flute for the marching band.

<b>                      TONY
</b>          I'm not in the fucking marching band.

<b>                      SENIOR GUY
</b>          Ah dude, you sure? I heard you play
          the skin flute.

<b>                      TONY
</b>          Alright, I got a question for you
          guys. If you think you're so cool,
          why are you hanging out with a bunch
          of eighth graders on a Friday night?

<b>                      SENIOR GUY
</b>          Hey, fuck you, you little penis
          wrinkle. You know, you're lucky to
          even be here. This is our camp out.
          The only reason you little cum gums
          are here is because fucking Charlie's
          mom made him bring his little asshole
          brother, and then he drags along you
          little dice danglers. Fucking fuzz
          nut, talking shit!

Senior Guy throws a beer just past Tony.

<b>                      CHARLIE
</b>          It's all good, man. These little
          fuzz nuts are going to get their
          chance soon enough. We got some
          whores coming by later.

<b>                       CHASE

</b>          Now, I know Chase will fuck anything.

          guys? You in?

<b>                         MASON

          Peter Puffer?

<b>                      TONY
</b>          I don't know. Maybe.

<b>                      SENIOR GUY
</b>          Dude, it's okay to be gay. We
          understand. Just, you know, sleep
          over there.

<b>                         TONY
</b>          I'm not gay.

<b>                      CHARLIE
</b>          Give it some time, man.     You'll
          realize.

<b>                         TONY
</b>          Fuck y'all.

<b>                      CHARLIE
</b>          See, that's exactly my point, man.
          Nah, but we don't have whores coming
          over, we were just fucking with you
          to see what you'd say.

<b>                      SENIOR GUY
</b>          Yeah, and you just earned your Vag
          Badge.

<b>                      CHARLIE
</b>          Put it next to your bitch card.

<b>                      SENIOR GUY
</b>          Yeah, 'cause you know, you're a bitch.
          Now hold this, like the bitch you

<b>INT.   MOM'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Mom is hosting a pre-Thanksgiving get-together with 10-15
people all drinking wine and talking

<b>                       MOM
</b>               (to Mason and Samantha)
           Hey, you guys made it! Good.

Mom places a cheese plate on the living room table.

<b>                       MOM (CONT'D)
</b>           Oh, there you are.

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS hands Olivia a glass of wine.

<b>INT.   MASON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Mason sits on his bed, chatting with a COLLEGE GIRL, who
looks around his room. There is a large graffiti mural on
the wall behind him.

<b>                       COLLEGE GIRL
</b>               (points to the mural)
           Oh, that's cool.

<b>                            MASON
</b>           Thanks.

<b>                       COLLEGE GIRL

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Not very long. Um, I went to this

<b>                      COLLEGE GIRL
</b>          They have a camp for graffiti?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Well, they call it "urban art".

<b>                          COLLEGE GIRL
</b>          Oh.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          So it sounds, you know, less illegal,
          but... it was really just a way to
          get free spray paint.

<b>                      COLLEGE GIRL
</b>          Cool. So is this your tag?     Is that --
          do they still call it...?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Yeah, but you know, it's just letters
          that I'm good at writing.

<b>                          COLLEGE GIRL

<b>                      MASON
</b>          It doesn't really mean anything,
          though.

The College Girl notices a picture of Mason and his Dad
leaning against the GTO.

<b>                      COLLEGE GIRL
</b>          Is that your dad?

<b>                          MASON

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Yeah, yeah.    Some weekends, and over
          the summer.

<b>                        COLLEGE GIRL
</b>          Cool.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          So you're a student of my mom's,

<b>                      COLLEGE GIRL
</b>          Mm-hm. Yeah, she's uh, I got one
          class with her. Yeah, she's cool.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          How's she doing? You know, is she --
          is she a good teacher and everything?

<b>                      COLLEGE GIRL
</b>          Yeah! She's great. She's super
          smart and she cares, you know, she
          makes it interesting. She's probably
          even my favorite teacher.

Mason nods.

<b>INT. DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
One of Mom's students, JIM, tells a story while the group
sits around the table eating.

<b>                      JIM
</b>          ...So anyway, we figured out a way
          to rig up our iPods to the external
          speakers on the ASV. So every time
          we come rolling into town, you knew
          the 456 was there, 'cause we were
          bumping House of Pain. It was like,
          "Jump around, Jump around." And the
          whole family's coming outside, and
          you got the kids and the mom and the
          dad, and they're all bouncing up and
          down. We're throwing out candies
          for the kids, and soccer balls, and
          Beanie Babies, and Frisbees... Um,
          like, smokes for the adults. And
          they loved, they absolutely loved,
          Gatorade. But for some reason, you
          know, they hated the lemon-lime
          flavor. I don't know what it was.
          Yeah. Couldn't give it away.
<b>                                                 102.

The group laughs.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          How long were you over there?

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Uhh... I did two tours in Iraq and
          one in Bosnia.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Wow.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Did you enlist?

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Mm-hmm. Yeah. I was, um, Army
          National Guard. And, uh, you know
          coming straight out of high school.
          Needed money for college. Seemed
          like a decent paying job. And, uh,
          did my tour. And whenever I got
          done, I told them if there's, you
          know, a world-changing event, I'll
          come back. And, uh, 3 months later
          9/11 happened. And I was back 9/12.
          And I'm proud to say the 456, the
          whole time we were there, we never
          lost a guy. Not one casualty.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          But is that odd?    Is that unusual?

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Yeah. Almost impossible. Like the
          guys that came along after us and
          replaced us, they didn't listen to
          any of our advice. They, you know,
          did basically the polar opposite of
          what we did, and they lost seven
          guys in the first month.

<b>                       MOM
</b>          Wow. What did you guys do
          differently?

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Well, I'd like to think it's just a
          matter of mutual respect, you know.
          I mean, all the time we spent over
          there building trust, I mean these
          guys basically destroyed it in three
          days.

</b>
<b>                       PROFESSOR DOUGLAS

           why we were there?

<b>                         JIM
</b>           Oil.    Plain and simple.

point, Mason notices Mom talking with Jim outside on the
porch.

Mason is in the far back of the station wagon, making out
with a BLONDE GIRL.

<b>                       PROFESSOR DOUGLAS

Mason smiles.

<b>                        MOM

Mom mimes smoking reefer.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          A little bit.

<b>                        MOM

<b>EXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - DAY
</b>
Dad and Jim stand around in front of the house. ANNIE opens
the doors to the new mini-van, so the kids can load their
overnight bags.

Mom talks with two workers about an exposed pipe in the yard.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Can we just replace that part of the
          pipe?

<b>                      WORKER
</b>          No, no it's no good.      Everything is

</b>           So, this is like Annie's car and...
           and you drive the GTO? I guess you
           can't really put a baby seat in that
           thing.

<b>                          DAD
</b>           Yeah, no...     But I had to sell that
           anyway.

<b>                          MASON
</b>           You what?

<b>                       DAD
</b>           Yeah, I had to sell that.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           So... so it's gone?

<b>                       DAD
</b>           Yeah, some sucker collector from
           California paid twenty-two grand for
           it, which is great 'cause I basically
           got to pay for this in cash. I only
           paid eighty-five hundred for that
           thing way back when. I mean, you
           know, cars are generally a terrible
           investment. You know? Soon as you
           drive them off the lot you got a used
           car on your hands, and the value's
           only dropping from there.

          that.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I remember. I was in third grade
          and you were taking me over to Anthony
          Nagar's house for his birthday...
          and we were there early, so we gave
          him a ride around the block. And he
          was talking about how much he loved
          your car and so you were all like
          "Oh. This is going to be Mason's
          when he turns 16."

          Second of all, I would never say
          that. Never.

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Yeah.   You did though.

<b>                      DAD

          Look, you can sit there like there's
          a death in the family, alright, but
          bottom line is that was my car.
          Alright? I paid for it, I took care
          of it, and I can do whatever I want
          with it. Alright? I'm sorry if you
          had other ideas about it but when
          you get older you can save up and
          buy a car of your own. And be cool
          like I used to be. Or... you can

</b>           Yeah, we sure did.    We sure did.

<b>                       GRANDPA CLIFF

           How are you, darling?

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Annie and Nana quietly light the candles on Mason's birthday
cake.

<b>                       DAD
</b>           Alright, we ready?

<b>                       ANNIE

<b>INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>                        DAD
</b>           Hey, Sam.

He subtly indicates for her to get off her laptop and join
the family. They take their seats in the living room.

<b>                       DAD (CONT'D)
</b>           Hey, still sleeping here?

<b>                       GRANDPA CLIFF
</b>           Oh, yeah, sawin' logs.

<b>                        DAD
</b>           You ready?

The family sings happy birthday to Mason. Nana brings in
the birthday cake, complete with lit candles.

<b>                       ALL

           Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday

           Happy birthday to you!

<b>                       DAD

Mason blows out the candles. The family cheers.

<b>                     NANA
</b>          Real good! Presents!      Wait, wait,

Nana hands Mason a wrapped gift.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Hey Sam, would you get us a knife so
          we can cut this up? Hey? Alright.

Sam walks into the kitchen to grab a knife.

<b>                      NANA
</b>          I hope you like it. I heard you
          didn't have one, so.

He unwraps the gift.

<b>                      NANA (CONT'D)
</b>          It's a Bible. Is this your first
          Bible? Look, there's your name...

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Wow.

<b>                      NANA
</b>          ...In gold. And wait-wait-wait-wait.
          Look at this. It's a Red Letter
          edition, and that means that
          everything Jesus said is in red.

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Thank you.

<b>                         NANA
</b>          Like it?     Alright. I love you,

<b>                      ANNIE
</b>          And this one's from us.

Annie hands Mason a large gift box.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          It's not going to make all your dreams

          keep your expectations low. No, no,

Dad pulls a blue dress shirt, blazer, and tie out of the
box.

<b>                      DAD (CONT'D)
</b>          It's -- hey! Come, on right? You

Grandpa comes out of the kitchen with a covered gun.

<b>                      GRANDPA CLIFF
</b>          Mason?

<b>                      DAD

</b>          Uh-oh.

<b>                      GRANDPA CLIFF
</b>          Come here, son. Pull that off.

Mason walks over and pulls the case off to reveal a shotgun.

<b>                      GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D)
</b>          There's a 20 gauge shotgun.

<b>                      MASON

<b>                      GRANDPA CLIFF
</b>          Yeah. My dad gave it to me when I
          was a little younger than you, and
          his dad gave it to him, and well,
          you're fifteen and I'd like for you
          to have it. Alright? Here, you
          hold it. Yeah.

<b>                      MASON

<b>                      GRANDPA CLIFF
</b>          Congratulations, son. I'll teach
          you how to clean it, teach you how
          to fire it. I'll teach you a little
          bit of safety.

The family laughs, as Mason holds the gun pointing
precariously across the room.

<b>EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Samantha holds a pistol, ready to shoot. Dad is helping her
aim. There are bottles and cans lined up as targets.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Now cock it. Alright, there you go.
          Now, what you want to do is line up

          Now fire at will, alright?

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>          Okay.

Samantha shoots the can.

<b>                         DAD
</b>          Ho.   Whoa!

Dad claps as Samantha lowers the pistol.

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>          Yeah!

<b>                         GRANDPA CLIFF

Mason holds the shotgun, taking aim.
Grandpa Cliff throws a chunk of wood up into the air as a
target.

<b>                       GRANDPA CLIFF
</b>          Ready?   Pull!

Mason misses the fist shot.

<b>                      GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D)
</b>          You uh, you uh, hit a little low.
          Wait until it gets up high and then
          shoot. Alright? Cause then it's a
          better aim coming down. Remember,
          second trigger.

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Mm-hm.

<b>                       GRANDPA CLIFF

<b>                       GRANDPA CLIFF
</b>          Pull!

Grandpa Cliff throws another piece of wood into the air.
This time, Mason hits it.

<b>                      GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D)
</b>          Hah! Hah! Look what you did! Well,
          you nailed it, didn't you? How's
          that feel?

<b>                       MASON

<b>                      GRANDPA CLIFF
</b>          Yeah, it felt good. Good.

<b>EXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
The family sits out on the porch in a circle.   Dad plays
guitar as the family sings along.

<b>                      DAD
</b>              (singing)

<b>                      ANNIE
</b>              (singing)
          But still demand I stay.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>              (singing)
          I want for you to know me completely,
          but still remain mysterious.

<b>                      MASON
</b>              (singing)

          remain fearless.

<b>                       DAD AND ANNIE
</b>              (singing)
          Climb to the top, look over the ledge.
          Dance barefoot on a razor's edge.

          by the tail.

<b>                      MASON

          If I don't try, I'll never fail.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Good!

<b>                      DAD AND ANNIE
</b>              (singing)
          If you go home, you're rolling the
          dice. Can't step in the same river
          twice. If you love too much it'll
          turn to hate. If you never leave
          home you'll never be late. If you
          eat too much, you're gonna get fat.
          If you buy a dog, you'll piss off
          your cat.

Grandpa Cliff and Nana both laugh.

<b>                      DAD AND ANNIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Take a deep breath, and enjoy the
          ride. Cause arrivals and departures

Annie's parents cheer as the song concludes.

<b>EXT. CHURCH - DAY
</b>
A small country church.

<b>                      PREACHER (O.S.)
</b>          A week later -- we don't know why
          Thomas wasn't there the first time --
          but a week later, Thomas comes back
          and joins the other disciples. They
          say, "Hey, the Lord's alive, we saw
          him!"

<b>INT. CHURCH - DAY
</b>
The preacher stands at the front of the church holding an
open bible. The family sits among the congregation. Mason
is wearing his new suit.

<b>                      PREACHER
</b>          "I won't believe it until I put my
          finger into his side and I'm gonna
          see those nail prints in his hands."
          Poof! About that time, here comes
          Jesus, standing right next to him.
          Okay? And he turns to Thomas. Don't
          you know Thomas felt some shame?
          And he turns to Thomas and says,
          "Thomas, here, stick your finger in
          my side. Look at these nail prints.
          It's me." And Thomas says, "My Lord,
          and my God, I believe."

Annie's parents nod in agreement.

<b>                      PREACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          And Jesus said, "Well, that's good.

<b>                      PREACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          But blessed are those who can believe
          without seeing." It's a lot easier
          when you can see, and feel, and touch.
          But like us, we haven't seen him in
          the flesh. We haven't felt him in
          the flesh. But we have experienced
          him in the spirit. At least I have,
          and I hope y'all have too.

<b>EXT. WOODS - DAY
</b>
The family walks through the woods. Annie holds Cooper to
her chest in a cloth carrier. Mason has his camera in hand.
Dad chews on a piece of straw.

<b>                      ANNIE
</b>          The pond's right up here.   Ooh, it's

<b>                      DAD

          Hi, baby. What's goin' on?

Mason and Samantha walk down to the pond.   Annie sits on a
picnic bench with Cooper.

<b>                      ANNIE (CONT'D)
</b>          You know, I think we're just gonna

pond.

<b>                      SAMANTHA

They share a look and laugh.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          I wasn't the least bit concerned
          with the state of your soul. We can

<b>                      MASON

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I'm not sure.

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          I'm sure. All class. Did you
          complete your image diary?

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Not yet.

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          Completed your, uh, digital contact
          sheet?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Not quite, but... I mean, it's not
          gonna take me long.

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          Not yet. Not quite. Darkroom time
          is extra-curricular. I mean
          technically, you don't ever have to
          be in here these days, and certainly
          not until you've completed your
          assignments. That's the deal.

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Sorry.

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          I'm worried about you, Mason.

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Why is that?

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          I'll tell you why. The images you're
          turning in, they're cool. You're
          looking at things in a really unique
          way. Got a lot of natural talent.

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Thanks.

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          Yeah, but, that and fifty cents will
          just get you a cup of coffee in this
          old world. I've met a lot of talented
          people over the years. How many of
          them made it professionally without
          discipline, commitment, and a really
          good work ethic?

Mason shrugs and shakes his head, unsure.

<b>                      TURLINGTON (CONT'D)
</b>          I can tell you. I can count it on
          two fingers. Zero. It's not gonna
          happen for you, Mason. The world is
          too competitive. There are too many
          talented people who are willing to
          work hard. And a butt-load of morons
          who are untalented, who are more
          than willing to surpass you. As a
          matter of fact, a lot of them are
          sitting in that classroom out there
          right now. Hm? You know what they're
          doing? They're doing their
          assignments, which is what you're
          supposed to be doing, but you're
          not. You're in here. Why is that?
          Are you special, Mason?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          No, but I mean the things you're
          talking about, like work ethic or
          whatever, I feel like I do work pretty
          hard. I spend the whole weekend
          taking pictures a lot of times.

<b>                      TURLINGTON

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Not really.

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          Yeah, I know you don't. That's why
          I've just assigned you to shoot the
          football game tonight. Okay? It
          starts at 7:30. I want you to get
          there early. I want you to shoot a
          full card, three hundred images, and
          I want 'em downloaded, I want 'em
          sorted, and I want to see them very
          first thing Monday. Okay? You want
          to know why I'm doing this?

<b>                        MASON
</b>          I guess.

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          Who do you want to be, Mason?    What
          do you want to do?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I want to take pictures.    Make art.

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          Any dip-shit can take pictures, Mason.
          Art, that's special. What can you
          bring to it that nobody else can?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          That's what I'm trying to find out.

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          Try harder. Hey, maybe in twenty
          years you can call old Mr. Turlington
          and you can say, "Thank you, sir,
          for that terrific dark room chat we
          had that day."
              (walking away)
          Get back to class and do your work.

<b>INT. CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Mason walks back to his computer.    NICK sits at the
neighboring computer.

</b>          Hey man.   You're walkin' a little

</b>          I'm just saying, you guys were in

          bought you dinner first.

Mason playfully jabs Nick in the arm.

<b>INT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Jim sits at the kitchen table, opening a beer. Mom and
Samantha prepare dinner in the kitchen. Mom walks over to
the stairs to call up to Mason.

<b>                       MOM
</b>          Mason!   Honey, come down for dinner.

On her way back to the kitchen, Mom notices the screen on an
open laptop.

<b>                      MOM (CONT'D)
</b>          Samantha! You didn't post these

          get those posted.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Why are we even doing this? It's
          like an online junk shop. I thought
          you had a good job?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          I do. We're what you call house

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Hey, Sam, watch your mouth, alright?
          Don't disrespect your mother. You
          like a roof over your head, don't
          you?

<b>                      MOM

polish on his fingernails.

<b>                        JIM
</b>          Nice nails.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Yeah, some girl did that in sixth

<b>                      JIM
</b>          You planning on keeping them?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Until it comes off, I guess.

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Last summer it was the earrings, and
          now the nails. You got a, uh, you
          got a purse to go with all that?

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          A lot of guys do that.   He's just
          trying to be cool.

<b>                      JIM
</b>          When I was in high school, having a
          job, being responsible, being able

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Mason, honey, why don't you get you
          and your sister some water.

Mason gets up to help set the table.

<b>EXT. FOOTBALL GAME - NIGHT
</b>
An announcer comments on the game over the loud speaker.
The crowd cheers and the band plays. Mason is on the
sidelines, photographing details he finds interesting. He
scrolls through the images on his camera.

<b>                      NICK
</b>          Hey man, Turlington says to cut the

A player catches the ball and is tackled.

<b>EXT. PARTY - NIGHT

</b>          Oh! First one. What was that?
          What was that? What is up?

Nick plays drums with teen band.    Mason approaches SHEENA.
He nudges her shoulder.

<b>                      MASON

<b>EXT. QUIET SPOT - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Mason and Sheena sit and talk.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I just feel like there are so many
          things that I could be doing and
          probably want to be doing that I'm
          just not.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          Why aren't you?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I mean, I guess it's... just being
          afraid of what people would think.
          You know, judgment.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          Yeah. I guess it's really easy to
          say, like, I don't care what anyone
          else thinks, but, everyone does, you
          know? Deep down.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Exactly. I find myself so furious
          at all these people that I'm in
          contact with just for controlling me
          or whatever, but you know, they're
          not even aware they're doing it.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          Yeah. So... in this perfect world
          where no one's controlling you, what's
          different? What changes?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Everything. I mean, I just    wanna be
          able to do anything I want,   because
          it makes me feel alive. As    opposed
          to giving me the appearance   of
          normality.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          Whatever that means.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I don't think it means much.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          You're kinda weird, you know that?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Yeah?

<b>                      MASON (CONT'D)

          Is that a compliment?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I mean, I don't want to like... scare
          kids at the park, or anything like
          that.

Sheena laughs.

<b>                      MASON (CONT'D)
</b>          I really like talking with you. I
          don't usually even try to like
          vocalize my thoughts or feelings or
          anything. Just, I don't know, it
          just never sounds right. Words are
          stupid.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          So, why're you trying with me?

<b>                       MASON
</b>          I don't know. I guess I feel
          comfortable.

<b>                       SHEENA
</b>          I'm glad.

<b>EXT. JIM'S HOUSE - LATER
</b>
Mason comes home late. Jim sits outside on a chair surrounded
by empty beer cans and one in hand.

<b>                       MASON

<b>                      JIM

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Awhile ago like, thirty minutes ago,
          an hour ago? Cause, truthfully,

</b>          Yeah, been hearin' a lot of that
          lately. See, but you don't actually
          care. You just kinda... kinda come
          and go as you please and you don't
          care if your mom's upset or what
          time you gotta be home... Is that
          what's up?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I don't know what to tell you.

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Stop mumbling! You know, speak up!
          I can't understand a word comin'
          outta your mouth. It's just like,
          "uh uhh nuhh" and I ask you questions
          and you just--

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Man, can I just have one day where
          everyone isn't all over my ass!?

Jim gets up abruptly and advances on Mason.

<b>                      JIM
</b>          I'm up your ass? This is my house.
          Now, if you wanna live in my house
          then you get home when you say you're
          gonna be home.

<b>                      MASON

<b>                      JIM
</b>          No, I'm not your dad! You know how

          here. I'm the guy with the job,
          paying the bills, taking care of
          you, your mom, your sister... Huh?!

Mason goes inside.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Yeah, Phillip. He did it. Can

Mason prepares cereal.

<b>                      MOM

carries in a bus tub of dirty dishes, one with uneaten
battered shrimp on it. He sticks one in his mouth and flirts
with APRIL, a waitress.

<b>                      MASON

              (Laughs)

<b>                      SHEENA (O.S.)
</b>          Thank you. So how long have you
          guys been dating?

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          About three months. Yeah, we met at
          a party and it's been, ya know, chill.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          Yeah, he seems cool.

<b>                        SAMANTHA
</b>          Yeah.    He is.

The guys are shooting pool.

<b>                      SHEENA (O.S.)
</b>          Does he go to UT too?

</b>          Cool.    What is he studying?

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          He's studying history and uh, Italian,
          I think?

The girls laugh.

<b>                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>          His minor, yeah.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          Does he wanna... does he wanna teach?

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          I don't know, I think, I think he's
          still figuring stuff out. Yeah,
          he'll figure it out, he's smart,
          he's smart. So where are you thinking
          about living when you come here?

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          Um, I'm not really sure yet. We're
          gonna look at apartments tomorrow,
          um, but I know my parents sorta were
          expecting me to live in a dorm.

<b>                        SAMANTHA
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          Yeah. But I mean, I'm paying my way
          through college, so it doesn't really
          matter that much.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Yeah, you don't have to listen to
          your parents after you turn eighteen.
          I mean, especially if they're not
          helping you financially.

They laugh.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          That's what I figured.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          But I mean, living in a dorm isn't
          so bad.

<b>                        SHEENA
</b>          Yeah.
<b>                                                          145.
</b>
<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          I mean especially if it's a coed
          dorm. I mean, I've never been around
          like, so many cute guys at once.
          Like, college is really fun.

They laugh.

<b>                         SHEENA
</b>          I'm excited.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          It's great, yeah.

<b>EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
</b>
The sidewalk is populated with college students. The teens
walk together in couples and pass a street musician and a
woman hoola-hooping.

<b>                         BOYFRIEND
</b>          Watch out.

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>          Oh!

They laugh.

<b>INT. CONTINENTAL CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
A four man band plays as our guys watch from the audience.

<b>                      MUSICIANS
</b>              (singing)
          "On the day that I was born I started
          growin' old. No one told you life
          would be so lonesome and cold. I
          had a grey hair by the age of 23,
          this hard-luck livin's gonna be the

<b>EXT. CONTINENTAL CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
Sheena and Mason wander out of the club and walk up the
street.

<b>INT. CAFE - NIGHT
</b>
Sheena and Mason are seated at a table at a late-night diner,
full of a variety of people.
<b>                                                           146.

<b>                      MAN ALONE IN BOOTH
</b>          The last death at the Hoover Dam
          construction site was his son, Patrick
          Tierny, who died on December 20th,
          1935, exactly thirteen years to the
          day.

Sheena notices a table of sorority girls and practically
whispers to Mason.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          See those sorority girls over there?
          I've just decided, if you delete
          your Facebook page, I'm pledging.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Yeah, in just a few years that's you

          And that's gonna be me.

He subtly indicates the Man Alone guy, still sitting at his
booth, giving a lecture of some kind, with data, etc.

          he obviously has money to eat here.

<b>                      MASON (O.S.)
</b>          He just said. He's a UT professor,
          tenure and everything.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          Look at all these people. What are
          they even doing here at 3:00 in the

<b>                      MASON

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Hell yeah.

<b>                       SHEENA

<b>                      MASON

</b>          Sometimes.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          When it feels right.     When the
          inspiration hits.

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Only then.

A WAITRESS comes by their table.

<b>                      WAITRESS
</b>          Anything else?

<b>                      SHEENA

          Yeah.

<b>                       WAITRESS
</b>          Mm-hm.

She leaves, and Mason just takes it all in.

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Ah, Jesus.

<b>                       SHEENA

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I don't know, doesn't it all seem a
          little overwhelming? I mean, college?
          I mean, I like the idea of being
          away from home and gaining skills
          and getting better at photography.
          I just, I don't know, I'm not counting
          on it being some big transformative
          experience.

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          I don't think it's that
          transformative. I just see it as
          the next step.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          But it's like a pre-ordained slot
          that's already got your name and
          number on it. I don't think it's
          the key to my future. Cause, like,
          I mean, look at my mom. She got her
          degree, and got a pretty good job,
          she can pay her bills...

<b>                      SHEENA
</b>          Well, I like your mom.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Well, I like my mom, too. I just
          mean, basically, she's still just as
          fucking confused as I am.

Waitress drops off more queso.

<b>                      SHEENA

          Thank you.

Mason and Sheena dip chips into the bowl of queso.

<b>EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Mason and Sheena walk on the sidewalk.

<b>EXT. PARKING GARAGE - SUNRISE

Mason and Sheena walk across a parking garage rooftop.

They watch the sunrise. Mason stands behind her and wraps
his arms around her. She turns to him and they kiss.

<b>INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

Mason and Sheena lie in bed under the sheets.     Sam's roommate
comes in.

<b>                      MASON

</b>          Right.

The roommate exits.    Sheena and Mason hide under the sheets.

<b>                      MASON

<b>INT. SCHOOL PHOTO EXHIBIT - DAY

There is an exhibit of various art works set up. Mason enters
and walks over to a series of photographs he took of Sheena.

<b>            SHEENA
</b>Why are we even... I mean, we both
knew this was coming. I'm just the
one who did something about it.

<b>            MASON
</b>Yeah, fucking some college guy...

<b>             SHEENA
</b>Oh, fuck you!
    (a beat)
I don't regret anything.

<b>            MASON
</b>    (Bitter Laugh)
Of course you don't.

<b>            SHEENA
</b>You know, it's actually kind of a
relief not to have to be around
someone who's so gloomy all the time.
The world's not so horrible. Not
everything's some big conspiracy
against humanity.

<b>            MASON (O.S.)
</b>It's great that you can think that
way. And you know, I'm sure dating
a jock really helps to clear the
mind.

<b>            SHEENA
</b>He's not a jock, okay? He just
happens to be on the lacrosse team.
We're all going to other schools
next year anyway, it's not some super
serious relationship.

<b>             MASON
</b>Great.   I feel so much better now.

<b>            SHEENA
</b>We're just having fun.

<b>            MASON
</b>I bet he's having fun.

</b>Grow up, Mason.

A pause.

<b>                       SHEENA (CONT'D)
</b>           This is pointless.

She gets up and starts to walk away.

</b>          If you think she's a bitch now, you
          should have seen her fucking twenty
          years ago.

They laugh.

<b>INT. DEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Later, Uncle Steve, Dad, and Mason have a manly discussion.

<b>                      UNCLE STEVE
</b>          You got to remember, you're going to
          college, though, alright? And if
          you're anything like me or your old
          man, you're gonna be pulling down
          some serious wool. You're gonna be
          tapping some masterful gap.

<b>                        DAD
</b>          Steven...

<b>                      UNCLE STEVE
</b>          You're gonna be doing some good work
          out there. Think about it, awful
          lot of flowers in that bouquet.
          But, you gotta do me a favor. You're
          going to be vulnerable this summer,
          alright. Remember to use protection
          during breakup sex.

He puts his hand on Dad.

<b>                      UNCLE STEVE (CONT'D)
</b>          This guy knows exactly of which I
          speak. Look what happened to him.
          Viola'.

Uncle Steve gestures to Mason.

<b>                        DAD
</b>          Steven...

<b>                      UNCLE STEVE
</b>              (laughing)
          Cheers.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          It's not that simple.
<b>                                                        164.

<b>                      UNCLE STEVE
</b>              (chanting)
          Four more years. Four more years.
          I'm just saying.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - GRADUATION PARTY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Later Dad enters the kitchen where Mom happens to be.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Do y'all recycle?   Should I --

<b>                      MOM
</b>          I have one started there.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Oh, yeah, right. Okay, great. Okay.
          Am I, uh, am I your only ex at this
          party?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Yes, but I'm not your only wife here,
          though.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                       MOM
</b>          Can you believe they're both out of
          high school?

<b>                       DAD
</b>          No.  No, I can't.
              (a beat)
          You did a great job with both of
          them, by the way.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Thanks for saying that. I never
          thought I'd hear you say that.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Well, it's true.    Thank you.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          And you're doing it all over again,
          huh?

<b>                      DAD
</b>          I know, I know, right? It's gonna be
          uh, fifteen years till I have an
          empty nest. But hey, I'd love to
          pitch in, help with this, if I could.

<b>                      DAD (CONT'D)
</b>          I mean, it's so great that you did
          this. I was just going to give you
          a little. I'd appreciate it if I
          could.

He pulls out his wallet.

<b>                          MOM
</b>          Sure.   Yeah.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Yeah. But I don't have any cash.
          It's in Annie's purse. I'll be right
          back.

<b>INT. ANTONE'S - EVENING
</b>
Mason and Dad are wandering through the green room area while
the band is doing a sound check.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          ...So it sucks. I mean, the guy's a
          college lacrosse player. I mean,
          what are you gonna do?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          She didn't even like sports.

An iced-down bucket of drinks beckons.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          You want a beer?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          No, that's alright.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          You can have one.

<b>                          MASON
</b>          It's okay.

They continue their conversation out of the green room to a
little area overlooking the stage.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Yeah, well, for what it's worth,
          we've all been through the exact
          same thing, at one point or another.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          It's not the same, though.     I mean,
          you never got to know her.
<b>                                                           166.
</b>
<b>                      DAD
</b>          No, I know, I know.    It's not the
          same.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I just don't know what I did wrong.

At this point Dad yells down to Jimmy, his roommate from
years before, briefly interrupting the sound check.

<b>                        DAD
</b>          Hey, Jimmy.    Hey, man.   Hey --

<b>                        JIMMY
</b>          Hey, Mason.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          We're up here raiding the green room.
          Hope that's okay.

<b>                      JIMMY
</b>          That's totally cool.

<b>                        DAD
</b>          Alright.

<b>                       JIMMY
</b>          Wow!   Is that M.J.?

<b>                        DAD
</b>          Uh-huh.    Right?

<b>                      JIMMY
</b>          Unbelievable.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Well, we just decided to come a little
          early, check you out.

<b>                      JIMMY
</b>          That's cool man, let me finish up,
          I'll be up in a minute.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Alright, alright.

He and Mason slowly start to drift around the venue.

<b>                      DAD (CONT'D)
</b>              (back to Mason)
          I guarantee you, you didn't do
          anything wrong. These high school
          love things, they never work out.
          Here, come here.

</b>
<b>            DAD (CONT'D)
</b>I mean, everyone's just changing so
much. The odds of two young people
staying on the same wavelength are...

<b>            MASON
</b>Yeah, but still --

<b>            DAD
</b>Look, and I also guarantee you that
every day of your life that you spend
crying over some silly girl is a
complete waste of time.

<b>            MASON
</b>She wasn't a silly girl, though.   I
mean, she's a serious person. I
really thought we were --

<b>            DAD
</b>What?

<b>            MASON
</b>I don't know.

<b>            DAD
</b>Here's the truth. Women are never
satisfied. Ok? They're always
looking to potentially trade up and
that's, I'm sorry to say, what I
think has happened to you my fine
feathered friend.

<b>            MASON
</b>What does that even mean?

<b>            DAD
</b>It means don't hand over the controls
to your self-esteem to Sheila.

<b>            MASON
</b>Sheena.

<b>            DAD
</b>Alright. It means you are responsible
for you, not your girlfriend, not
your mom, not me. You. And if you
truly take care of you, you will be
amazed at how much girls like Sheena
start lining up at your front door.

<b>            MASON
</b>Great.
<b>                                         168.
</b>
<b>            DAD
</b>Yeah, you know, you just gotta
separate yourself from the pack in
some way. Excel at something, you
know, and then you have your pick of
the litter when them front-running
hussies start sniffing around.

<b>            MASON
</b>So what you're saying is, I should
take up lacrosse.

<b>            DAD
</b>Exactly. Or you could, you know,
start a band. Worked for me a long
time ago. I think it's still working
for Jimmy. Or you just keep taking
pictures.

<b>            MASON
</b>She hated the pictures I took of
her.

<b>            DAD
</b>Alright. I'm sick to death of her,
okay? I only met her a few times
and yes she was cute, alright. But,
truth be told I always thought she
was a little bit, you know, a little
bit too square for you. Y'know, not
quite the same vibe.

<b>            MASON
</b>You really thought that?

<b>            DAD
</b>On some subtle, lower level. I mean,
uh, I wasn't surprised when it turned
out she was interested in some
knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?
I mean, bottom line is, it's all
timing with these things. Y'know.
I mean, uh, take your mom and me.
Y'know I think I probably turned
into the boring castrated guy she
wanted me to be fifteen or twenty
years ago, y'know? And man I'm not
saying she was wrong to be pissed.
I'm not, I'm just saying that, y'know,
she could have been a little more
patient... a little more forgiving.

<b>            MASON
</b>Would've saved me that parade of
drunken assholes.

Dad gestures zipping his lip, saying nothing.

<b>                      MASON (CONT'D)
</b>          So what's the point?

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Of what?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I don't know, any of this.
          Everything.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Everything? What's the point? I
          mean I sure as shit don't know. I
          mean, but, neither does anybody else.
          Okay, we're all just winging it, you
          know? I mean the good news is you're
          feeling stuff. You know? And you
          got to hold onto that. You do. I
          mean you get older and you don't
          feel as much. You're skin gets
          tougher. The point is those pictures
          you took. Thousands of submissions
          from all over the state and you won.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Well, I got silver.   And nine other
          people did, too.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          I'm gonna kill you. I'm tryin' to
          tell you that I believe in you,
          Mason. I think you're really special,
          and if some girl doesn't see that,
          then fuck her, y'know?

Jimmy's at the mic.

<b>                      JIMMY (O.S.)

          young man in the house --

<b>                      JIMMY

          boy, now he's all graduated from

          Happy high school graduation, Mason.

He plays his guitar, and the band kicks in... sounding pretty
great.

<b>INT. CAFE - DAY
</b>
Mom, Mason and Samantha sit down at a table.     A waitress
places menus.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Thank you. Okay guys, let's be clear.
          I'm going to break this into four
          categories. One. Anything you wanna
          keep from your childhood and your
          taking with you. Two. Throwing
          away. Three. Donating. Four.
          Whatever you wanna try to sell at
          the garage sell next weekend, whatever
          we don't sell, we're donating.

<b>                      MASON

          attic, or storage or something?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          No. You're missing the point. We're
          not going to drag a bunch of crap to
          mom's tiny apartment.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Can't believe we're moving again.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          No, I'm moving! You moved two years
          ago. You have an apartment in Austin.
          Mason is moving the fall. I'm done.
          This will be great for me. I'll
          have all these options. I could
          take a sabbatical. I could get some
          writing done and try to get published.

<b>                      MASON

</b>          One of you will sleep on the couch,
          and we'll use that blow-up mattress.

<b>                      SAMANTHA

Mom puts her glasses on.

<b>                      SAMANTHA

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>              (weak laugh)
          No. To be honest, I drank way too
          much last night.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          You weren't driving, were you?

<b>                      SAMANTHA

bin into the bed of his truck. He walks back toward Mom's
new apartment.
<b>                                                          173.

<b>INT. APARTMENT - MORNING
</b>
Mason is packing a box, in mid-conversation with Mom, who is
seated in another room.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          ...Isn't that kind of crazy though,
          that a computer knows who you are
          from just twenty questions off a
          form? I guess there are really only
          like eight types of people in the
          world.

Mom goes to the kitchen and pours coffee into a mug.

<b>                      MASON (CONT'D)
</b>          I mean there are subsets, like male
          and female, but apparently we're not
          as unique as we want to think we
          are.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Have you even talked to this guy
          yet?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          No, but we've been trading emails.
          He seems pretty cool. He's studying
          literature, and uh, anthropology,
          and he's way into Bright Eyes... so
          that's not so bad. But anyways, he
          was telling me about how the system
          they use for assigning roommates is
          kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen
          satisfaction rate for new roommates
          used to be like 60%, and now it's
          100%. Just cause of the computer.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Well. Sounds like he'll be a good
          roommate, then.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Yeah. But we've pretty much decided
          that soon they won't even need a
          questionnaire. Because they'll just
          let the NSA scan your digital ghost,
          and they'll tell you who your roommate
          is, based on everything you've ever
          said, written, or clicked.

Mason walks back into the living room, carrying a box.   He
holds up a framed picture.
<b>                                                            174.
</b>
<b>                      MASON (CONT'D)
</b>          Did you -- Did you put this in here
          again?

Mom laughs.

<b>                      MASON (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't want it.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Come on, it's the first picture you
          ever took.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Well, I mean, all the more reason to
          leave it behind, right?

Mason goes to put the picture back in his room, while Mom
suddenly breaks into quiet sobs.

He comes back out, wearing a backpack, and notices Mom crying.

<b>                         MASON (CONT'D)
</b>          What?

<b>                         MOM
</b>              (crying)
          Nothing.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          No, what is it?

<b>                         MOM
</b>          Nothing!

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Mom...

<b>                      MOM
</b>          This is the worst day of my life.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          What are you talking about?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          I knew this day was coming. I just --
          I didn't know you were gonna be so
          fuckin' happy to be leaving.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I mean, it's not that I'm that happy.
          What do you, what do you expect?
<b>                                                             175.
</b>
<b>                      MOM
</b>          You know what I'm realizing? My
          life is just gonna go, like that!
          This series of milestones. Getting
          married, having kids, getting
          divorced, the time that we thought
          you were dyslexic, when I taught you
          how to ride a bike, getting divorced
          AGAIN, getting my masters degree,
          finally getting the job I wanted,
          sending Samantha off to college,
          sending YOU off the college... You
          know what's next? Huh? It's my
          fuckin' funeral!

A beat.

<b>                      MOM (CONT'D)
</b>          Just go, and leave my picture!

Stunned, Mason doesn't know what to say.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Aren't you jumping ahead by like,
          forty years or something?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          I just thought there would be more.

Mom sits at the table crying.   Mason does not know how to
comfort her.

<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
Mason drives his pick-up truck through the open roads and
mountains of West Texas.

<b>EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
</b>
Mason stops at a gas station to fill up.   While he waits, he
takes pictures.

<b>EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY
</b>
Mason pulls into the parking lot of his University and parks.

<b>INT. DORM - AFTERNOON
</b>
Mason walks through a hallway area and finds his dorm room.
He enters to find it half decorated with music going. He
throws his bag up on the available bed and starts to unpack
and get situated. DALTON enters.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Hey, you must be Mason.
<b>                                                       176.
</b>
<b>                       MASON
</b>          Yeah.   Dalton, right?

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet
          you.

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Definitely.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Are you cool with this side of the
          room?

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Got in this morning, just moved my
          shit in, man.

<b>                       MASON
</b>              (laughs)
          Well, yeah. I don't- I don't care.
          No worries.

He unzips his bag, but keeps the conversation going.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Cool. Can I help with anything,
          man? Any bags? Any last stuff you
          need brought in?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I just got like one... box left, I
          packed pretty light. But I appreciate
          it.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          My pleasure, man. Of course.

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Um, are you goin' to the orientation
          mixer thing?

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Orientation mixer thing? Fuck no,
          man! I'm not goin' to that and
          neither are you, by the way. We got
          way better stuff to be doin', dude.

BARB, Dalton's girlfriend, drifts into the room.

<b>                        BARB
</b>          You ready?
<b>                                                           177.
</b>
<b>                     DALTON
</b>          Yeah. Hey, Barb, this' my roommate
          Mason. Mason, Barb.

They shake.

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Hi.

<b>                       BARB
</b>          Hey.   You comin' with us?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Where're you going?

<b>                       BARB
</b>          Hiking.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Yeah, man, you should come. If we
          leave now we can catch the late
          afternoon at Big Bend. You ever
          been before, man?

<b>                     MASON
</b>          Yeah. But not since I was really
          little.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Oh, well then all the more reason to
          come now, man. That's why we're
          here, dude.

Barb's roommate, NICOLE, is now hanging out by the door.

<b>                       DALTON (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, Mason.   This is Nicole, Barb's
          roommate.

<b>                      NICOLE
</b>          Hey, what's up?

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Hi.

Barb is reaching in her bag for something.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Mason, Nicole.

<b>                      BARB
</b>              (to Mason)
          So, you game?
<b>                                                            178.
</b>
<b>                        MASON
</b>          Sure.

She has produced a chunk of brownie that she hands to Mason.

<b>                      BARB
</b>          Here. Have the rest of this. Got
          it timed perfectly. It'll kick in
          when we get to the mountains.

Mason takes it, a little amused, looks at the others
(confirmation), then starts to consume.

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Awesome.

<b>                        DALTON (O.S.)
</b>          Let's go.

They roll out of there.

<b>EXT. BIG BEND - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
Mason, Nicole, Dalton and Barb hike through a BIG canyon.
Nicole talks to Mason about teaching dance.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Do they let you major in that here?

<b>                      NICOLE
</b>          Well, it's not that serious here, so
          I kinda like train outside the
          university, but I'm taking all my
          basics like History of Dance and all
          that.

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Nice.

<b>                        NICOLE
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          What do you teach?

<b>                     NICOLE
</b>          Oh, gosh. Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical,
          hip-hop...

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Wow.    Which one's your favorite?

<b>                        NICOLE
</b>          Tap.
<b>                                     179.
</b>
<b>                  MASON
</b>Yeah?

<b>            NICOLE
</b>Yeah. You can make up all your own
sounds and there's no rules.

<b>                  MASON
</b>Right...

<b>            NICOLE
</b>Just, like, creative freedom.

<b>            MASON
</b>That's great.

<b>                  NICOLE
</b>Yeah.

<b>                  MASON
</b>Right.

<b>            NICOLE
</b>... So to be a part of bringing it
back to the kids...

<b>            MASON
</b>Right, keep it going.

<b>            NICOLE
</b>... Is really rewarding.   Yeah.

<b>            MASON
</b>How old are they?

<b>            NICOLE
</b>Six to eight.

<b>                  MASON
</b>       (laughs)
Wow.

<b>            NICOLE
</b>    (laughing)
Yeah. They have like no fear, and
they're not self-conscious at all.

<b>            MASON
</b>They haven't reached the awkward
years yet.

<b>            NICOLE
</b>Yeah, not yet. It's coming.
<b>                                                            180.
</b>
The group continues walking over a ridge as the sun is
setting.

<b>EXT. HIKE - LATER
</b>
As Barb and Dalton coyote call on the rocks, Mason joins
Nicole sitting on a rock overlooking the river and sunset.

<b>                         NICOLE
</b>          Hey.

Dalton and Barb continue like coyotes, much to Nicole and
Mason's amusement.

<b>                      NICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>          Dalton can be crazy sometimes.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          He seems cool, though.

<b>                         NICOLE
</b>          Yeah.     Yeah, they're both really
          cool.     How are you feeling?

They both laugh.

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Great.    Really great, to be honest.

<b>                      NICOLE
</b>          Good. I'm really happy that you're
          hangin' out with us.

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Yeah.     Me too.

Meanwhile, over on a big rock, the coyotes are now yelling
words.

<b>                      DALTON (O.S.)
</b>          This moment's having a multiple
          orgasm! It's like as if all of time
          has unfolded before us so we can
          stand here and look out and scream -
          Fuck yea!! Wooo!

Back with Nicole and Mason laughing.

<b>                      NICOLE
</b>          You know how everyone's always saying,
          "Seize the moment"?

Mason nods yes.
<b>                                                  181.
</b>
<b>                       NICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>           I don't know, I'm kinda thinkin'
           it's the other way around. You know,
           like, the moment seizes us.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's constant,
           the moments, it's just... it's like
           always right now, you know?

<b>                      NICOLE
</b>           Yeah.

They trade smiles.
