    A series of shots.

    Blue sky through shabby windows.
    Run down walls. A paint splashed pine floor.    Tens of paint
    brushes soaking in stained jars.
    An artisan's hands - weather-worn, swirling a paint brush
    in dirty water that sways at the bottom of one of the jars.

    A canvas - the sketched face of a woman - blonde, blue eyed
    as the artisan strokes paint into her features - a poster
    girl for 18th century portraiture. (We will later
    recognise her as ELIZABETH MURRAY)

    A swallow cuts across a red tinged sky.   SOUND of footsteps
    trudging through mud.
    EXTREME CLOSE UP: a small figure being dressed by someone -
    a shoulder, an arm, little hands. We do not see a face.
    CLOSE: heavy naval boots move at sombre pace through slums.

    Against a stone floor, a child's feet are laced into boots.

    A starving dog barks , darts between tradesmen, sailors.
    Hold this image as Handel comes to an END.

    A CHILD'S POV as the door opens. We see a gentleman in
    ceremonial naval dress - CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY,
    aristocratic, handsome...alarmed at the sight before him.

    His eyes close with some sad, internal pain and as they re-
    open...We see what he sees...
    A fragile girl...around six years old stands in shabby
    surroundings. Her terrified eyes stare back, leaving
    LINDSAY at a loss. He takes in her features - delicate
    with a full mouth that underlines her ethnicity.

    She is DIDO ELIZABETH BELLE...part black, part white.
<b>                                                                 2.
</b>

    He speaks quietly- words almost as fragile as she is.

<b>                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>              Hello little girl...Little Dido.
                  (pause)
              I am your father.
    Silence. Then a tear rises to the surface and as her
    confused tears spill, so too do LINDSAY'S.

    His POV: a POOR BLACK WOMAN oversees DIDO from afar.
<b>                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
</b>                  (re. Dido)
              How lovely she is. So much of her
              mother.
                  (his eyes sting)
              I tried...but how...how could I
              separate a mother from her child?
                  (he restrains tears)
              And now nature has deprived me of
              such a dilemma.
    He composes himself - feeling futile...

<b>                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
</b>              Thank you..for taking her.
    He reaches into his pocket, holds out money to the woman.
<b>                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
</b>              You may leave us.

    The WOMAN hesitates, scurries to DIDO, placing her lips to
    the child's head in a prolonged kiss. Then she is gone.
    DIDO is left frightened and stunned!

<b>                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
</b>              Do not be afraid sweet thing. I
              am to take you to a good life.
              The life you were born to.

    He takes out a cube of chocolate, shows it to her. She is
    reluctant. He takes a bite - delicious! DIDO moves
    forward. He puts the chocolate in her hand. She tastes
    it. Sweet cocoa and sugar..and now her tiny mouth is
    filled. It makes LINDSAY laugh out loud.

    Silence, except bird song - the splendor of the English
    countryside - A neoclassical estate stretches before us.
    The figure of a LITTLE GIRL running across the lawns - her
    giggle fills the air, her outline faded by the sun.
    At French doors to the nursery, a furious greying woman -
    LADY MARY MURRAY (40s), waves a wooden spoon and yells...

<b>                         LADY MARY
</b>               Elizabeth Murray, bring yourself
               back here this very moment!

    The child crashes to the grass in fits of laughter. She is
    no more than 6 years old - Hair the colour of bleached hay
    and delicate pale skin.

    She rolls on to her back, squinting at the sunlight as...
    The SOUND of horse and carriage at the front of the house.
    ELIZABETH bolts upright. Her POV: As CAPTAIN SIR JOHN
    LINDSAY guides DIDO from the carriage.
    WIMBRIDGE, the butler, steps out to receive them.

</b>
    LADY MANSFIELD (40s), the years have been kind. She is
    beautiful, regal - stares ahead in shock...
    LORD MANSFIELD (50's) - a majestic man, white wigged and
    low brows, is incandescent, his sister, LADY MARY, frozen.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               What in God's name have you done!!

    Their POV - LINDSAY and little DIDO stand.
<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD
</b>               She...she is black.

    LINDSAY is pained.
<b>                         CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>               She is my blood.
<b>                         LADY MARY
</b>               But she IS black!

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               A detail you chose NOT to share.

<b>                         CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>               Uncle? You assured me!
<b>                                                           4.

<b>                     LORD MANSFIELD
</b>              (fury)
          Captain Sir John Lindsay, do you
          find me a fool? She is a MULATTO!

LORD MANSFIELD'S blood boils, he rages towards LINDSAY. LADY
MANSFIELD restrains him. LINDSAY is red with humiliation.

<b>                    CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>          I have no wife to take her...In a
          few hours I am to captain a
          voyage to the Indies on a
          longitude experiment.
              (strained)
          From there, who knows!!! It is
          not in my gift to question the
          King and his Royal Navy.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          You keep in mind my position..?
          My reputation...?
<b>                    CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>          Sir...
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          Then have some sense of propriety
          boy...and understand what you are
          asking.
LINDSAY lowers his voice, shielding DIDO.

<b>                     SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>          Her mother is dead! My wishes may
          not be orthodox but they ARE
          necessary!

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          How do we raise her...?

<b>                    SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>          I beg you, uncle...love her - as
          I would, were I here.
              (sadly)
          And ensure that she is in receipt
          of all that is due to her as a
          child of mine.

LADY MARY gasps, under...
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          That is simply impossible.

<b>                    SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>          What is right can never be
          impossible.
<b>                                                              5.

His firm gaze holds his aunt and uncle to account. A long
beat. LADY MANSFIELD stands conflicted.
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          What has she been named?
<b>                    SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>          She is Belle...after her mother.
          Dido Elizabeth Belle...Lindsay.

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          She takes your name?

<b>                    SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>          I am not ashamed.

LINDSAY stands his ground.

<b>                    LADY MARY
</b>          We cannot have another
          Elizabeth in the household.
LADY MANSFIELD regards the child, then looks to her
husband, gravely. He turns his back - aggrieved.

<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          We...we will call her Dido.
              (off Lindsay's nod)
          Good Lord, she is thin. Mary,
          find her something to eat.
LORD MANSFIELD storms from the room. LADY MANSFIELD
follows. LINDSAY kneels, choked with emotion.

<b>                    SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>          Little Belle - sweet child...
              (weak smile)
          My wish is to keep you...keep you
          with me...but a ship...it is no
          place for one so precious as you.
              (pause)
          In these walls, yours will be a
          life equal to my blood.
A beat. Through eyes that brim...he catches his breath.
LADY MARY is both stunned and moved - she has to turn away.
<b>                    SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
</b>          You will not understand in this
          moment, but hold this in your
          heart...you are loved...Just as
          I loved your mother.
A tear spills and DIDO's little fingers come up to wipe it
from his cheek. He presses his lips to her hand, sobbing a
moment, and then he is gone - to stay any longer would be
too much to bare.
<b>                                                                 6.

    DIDO emerge. Like ELIZABETH, DIDO is now freshly dressed in
    rich silks, an adorable sight as they move through corridors
<b>                        ELIZABETH
</b>              Are you...a nee-gro?
    ELIZABETH makes her way across...taking her aunt's hand as
    all three walk. DIDO is silent.

<b>                        ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>              Are you what they call `a negro?'
              I heard them talking.
<b>                        LADY MARY
</b>              Questions, questions, Elizabeth!
              Tis a most irritating trait you
              and your father share.

              Murray. You should not insist on
              always speaking your mind, you
              know. You will end up an old maid
              with only your own company for
              entertainment!
<b>                        ELIZABETH

    ELIZABETH takes off. LADY MARY rushes after her.
    DIDO is left alone - through the doorway of the gallery, a
    portrait of LINDSAY stares at her. She gazes at it.

    LORD MANSFIELD approaches, arrested at the sight of DIDO,
    newly tidied. He follows her gaze to LINDSAY'S image. The
    sight affects him, unexpectedly.
<b>                        LORD MANSFIELD
</b>              Captain Sir John Lindsay.
                  (off her reaction)
              Do you recognise him?
    She nods. A beat as conflict fills him.
<b>                                                                  7.

                Lindsay of Evelick.

    DIDO examines the painting. LORD MANSFIELD watches her.
<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>                I am here too....do you see?

    Her eyes search the long line of her aristocratic heritage,
    until her gaze settles. He chuckles, reluctantly charmed as
    she points to his likeness.
<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>                Yes...I am William Murray, First
                Earl of Mansfield.
    A beat as he looks to her, affected by this little person.
    Gently, he leads her to a final portrait.

<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>                    (carefully)

    He pauses
<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>                You are a sharp little one. He is

                ...to inherit everything that we
                are standing on when I am gone.

    She nods, bites her lip - that much has gone over her
    head...he can see. He closes his eyes. The enormity of this
    new responsibility weighing heavy.

    LORD MANSFIELD's POV: through window - The lawns. ELIZABETH
    gently takes DIDO'S hand in hers, leads her off to run
    between the trees. As their delighted screams filter...
    LADY MANSFIELD enters - observes LORD Mansfield, a moment.
<b>                          LADY MANSFIELD

<b>          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>Indeed. He discovered her mother
aboard a captured Spanish slave
ship. He was charged with
conveying it back to these
shores, he tells me.
<b>          LADY MANSFIELD
</b>Evidently he had some...`feeling'
for the woman.
<b>          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>    (dry)
And there I was believing it was
sheer lack of `self control'.
    (scathing)
He has been at sea, six years.
All of this child's life!
<b>          LADY MANSFIELD
</b>Well, he clearly saw to their
wellbeing. The child is not
altogether uncivilized.
    (she breathes deeply)
So...now we have two nieces in
our guardianship.
<b>           LORD MANSFIELD
</b>    (reticent)
Elizabeth was much in need of a
companion.

<b>          LADY MANSFIELD
</b>And that is what we shall say
when questions are asked of us?
<b>          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>We shall say that in accordance
with her birthright, she is
entitled to live beneath this roof.
    (with irony)
Such...is the nature of `order'.

<b>          LADY MANSFIELD
</b>And where in this `order' should
her colour be placed? Below or
above her Murray bloodline?
    (off his silence)
May she dine with us?
<b>          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>She may...(pause)...NOT...in
company. We cannot escape
society's confines on etiquette
<b>            LADY MANSFIELD
</b>Marriage?
<b>                                                                  9.

     He shakes his head at the complexity of it all.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               Impossible. Any match her..'other
               origins' may attract would surely
               disgrace her and the family rank.
<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD
</b>               And when we are no longer here? No

     The YOUNG MAN stands collecting bibles as the congregation
     file out. DIDO hands him hers.
     He is chaotically handsome with deeply set, expressive eyes
     that lock with hers for a moment, stirring her. Then his
     gaze moves suddenly to LORD MANSFIELD - intense, as he
     watches him drift from the church, the family in tow.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               Dido...my dear.

<b>                         LADY ASHFORD
</b>                   (whispers to her sons)
               Good Lord - the negro! She really is...
<b>                          JAMES ASHFORD
</b>                   (quietly disturbed)
               ...a lady.

<b>                          OLIVER
</b>               Capital!
<b>                         LADY ASHFORD
</b>               I hadn't expected her to look
               so...black.
<b>                         OLIVER
</b>               Mamaa, did you not listen to the
               rumours when you were spreading
               them?
     DIDO curtseys respectfully to LORD MANSFIELD.
<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               May I present to you the second
               of my nieces - Miss Dido Lindsay.

     DIDO curtseys. LADY ASHFORD nods graciously. OLIVER bows -
     has to nudge his troubled brother do the same.

<b>                         OLIVER
</b>               A pleasure, Miss Lindsay.

     She curtseys once again, then moves to sit with ELIZABETH.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>                   (sotto - re. James)
               He is the eldest - to inherit the
               entire Ashford fortune. He is
               also to inherit from his uncle -
               a healthy man, who shows little
               sign of departure.

<b>                         DIDO
</b>               How do you know?
<b>                                                          19.
</b>

<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Lady Ashford herself. She seems
          rather despondent at her
          brother's robust constitution.

JAMES catches DIDO'S soft brown eyes resting on him.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          He has much to recommend him. And
          a second fortune in life should
          please any wife.
ELIZABETH clocks the gaze between DIDO and JAMES.
<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Dido! You are not to be a
          coquette with him! You already
          have your fortune!
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Are you suggesting I now
          condescend to a gentleman without
          means, Bette?! What should good
          society think of us!
OLIVER moves to his brother, follows his gaze to DIDO.
<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          She is intriguing, is she not?

<b>                    JAMES
</b>          I find her repulsive.
<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          I suppose she is...if you find a
          most rare and exotic flower so.
          She is quite something to behold.

ON DIDO as she falters under the brothers' stares.
<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>              (flustered, to DIDO)
          Good Lord! They are appraising me!
ELIZABETH composes herself. JAMES' eyes remain on DIDO,
swallowing hard at her undeniable beauty.

<b>                    JAMES
</b>          One does not make a wife of the
          rare and exotic, Oliver. One
          samples it on the cotton fields
          of the Indies...

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          So far, when it is right at my door?
<b>                                                               20.
</b>

<b>                         JAMES
</b>               ...Then finds a pure ENGLISH rose
               to decorate one's home.
     OLIVER smiles. OFF both men - trained on DIDO.


<b>26   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT 4.               26    *
</b>     ELIZABETH is at the pianoforte. She sings, plays hard, for
     JAMES' attention, gazing up at him as he stands beside her.
<b>                         LADY ASHFORD
</b>               Is she `OUT'??

<b>                          LADY MANSFIELD
</b>                   (embarrassed)
               Not quite.
<b>                         LADY MARY
</b>                   (awkward)
               Any day now.

     LADY ASHFORD raises an amused eyebrow - precocious creature!
     OLIVER offers DIDO a discreet smile, as she sits beside
     LORD MANSFIELD. His mother quietly moves across to him.
<b>                          LADY ASHFORD
</b>               You will refrain from any
               intercourse with the negress.
                   (beat)
               Lord and Lady Mansfield may find
               it fascinating to have a Lady
               Mulatto running around their
               household, but I will not have
               one running around mine!

<b>                         OLIVER
</b>               She is an heiress.
     A seamless change of heart for LADY ASHFORD.
<b>                          LADY ASHFORD
</b>               Although exceptions can be made.

<b>                         OLIVER
</b>               It is said that her father left
               her a rather vast fortune.

<b>                         LADY ASHFORD
</b>               I mean to say, if that is your
               inclination.

<b>                         OLIVER
</b>               She is rather soft on the eye - I
               have thought no further Mamaa.
<b>                                                             21.
</b>

LADY ASHFORD stares across at DIDO.

<b>                    LADY ASHFORD
</b>          From where did you receive your
          information?
<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Her sister-cousin has a rather
          fast tongue.

ON LADY ASHFORD as she studies DIDO. ELIZABETH finishes,
amid a smattering of polite applause led by JAMES.

<b>                    OLIVER (CONT'D)
</b>          And what of you Miss Lindsay?
          Are we to hear you play tonight?

DIDO looks up to find OLIVER smiling across at her.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Well...
              (deferring to her father)
          Papaa...?

LORD MANSFIELD hesitates. DIDO is embarrassed.

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Oh do not be selfish with your
          good fortune, m'lord!
A beat...then put on the spot, LORD MANSFIELD caves,
throwing up his hands, helplessly.

DIDO is tentative, ELIZABETH less pleased.
<b>                    LADY ASHFORD
</b>          This will be most interesting!
DIDO moves to the pianoforte settles her fingers on the
keys. A beat, then Handel's Suite No.9 fills the room.

LORD MANSFIELD closes his eyes, irritated with himself.
LADY MARY whispers to LADY MANSFIELD.
<b>                    LADY MARY
</b>          She has never played in company!
LADY MANSFIELD is silent - stiff with anxiety.

DIDO is raising a beautiful and fluent sound - as skillful
as the most gifted of Georgian young ladies.
LORD MANSFIELD'S eyes spring open - sees all held hostage.
OLIVER moves forward, utterly fascinated.
Relief floods LADY MANSFIELD - she sighs with pride as LADY
MARY lends LADY ASHFORD a smug look.
<b>                                                                   22.

<b>                         LADY ASHFORD
</b>                   (conceding)
               She is...most accomplished.
<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD
</b>                   (with deep satisfaction)
               Hers was a most diligent governess.


<b>27   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. UPSTAIRS CORRIDORS - NIGHT. 4             27    *
</b>
     Echoing footsteps. LORD and LADY MANSFIELD move toward
     their rooms, each with a lamp to light their way.
<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD
</b>               The liberty of asking her to
               play! And when he can have no
               better intentions towards her.
     She stops in her tracks briefly, suddenly unsure...
<b>                            LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>               Can he??

     They round a corner.
<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>               ...His family name will, no doubt,
               entice her to take him seriously.
<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               She must not delude herself. Such
               decisions are not hers to make.
<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD
</b>               Then spell it out to her! Before
               she renders herself...sport to
               some `gent' of cruel promises!!!
<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               She has no reason. Hers is an
               inheritance that renders her free
               of the usual inducements to marry.

<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD
</b>               Well, that, at least, is true,
                   (burdened, grave)
               Indeed, it is Elizabeth who needs
               to secure her bread and butter.


<b>28   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. GROUND FLOOR CORRIDORS/STUDIO. DAY. 5 28        *

     her way to LORD MANSFIELD'S study.

     Her POV: through the doorway to the studio.
<b>                                                                 23.
</b>

     An UNFAMILIAR FACE mixing paints, engrossed. His weather-
     worn hands are recognisable from the opening credits. His
     stare meets DIDO's, calmly moved by her beauty as she
     stands, frozen - her full lips parted in astonishment.


<b>29   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. DIDO AND ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DAY. 5 29      *

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>               A portrait? Are you sure?

<b>                         DIDO
</b>               Yes...Aunt Mary has confirmed it.

     DIDO sits, light headed, anxiety running through her.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>               Good Lord. How...truly wonderful.

<b>30   INT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LORD MANSFIELD'S STUDY. DAY. 5          30    *

</b>               Papaa...should he not have wished
               to SEE me before deciding?

     She throws her hands up woefully, and finds another face
     staring back at her - It is JOHN DAVINIER. He regards her
     from a huge law book. She stands mortified.
<b>                         DIDO (CONT'D)

                   (to DIDO)
               Miss Lindsay.

     She curtseys, brief and stiff - a smile to match.
<b>                                                   24.
</b>

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          Decide what?
She is hesitant now, awkward in JOHN'S presence.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          If he should...should WANT to
          paint me!

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD

<b>                      DIDO
</b>          But...

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          Dido, you are to simply sit
          still. Not a challenging task!

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          As you always are - right beside

DIDO's chest heaves with distress.
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Should...should not any lady be
          flattered to be such a subject?

His tone is impatient, irritating her.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          How should any male know the ways
          of a lady when he has not even
          mastered the ways of a gentleman?

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Quite! Though one should be
          forgiven for thinking he was in
          the presence of a lady - when she
          is, in fact, still a juvenile!
<b>                    DIDO

LORD MANSFIELD casts her a stare and she is silenced.
DIDO begins collecting giant hardbacks, exasperated.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD

</b>          Hummm...
              (contemplation)

JOHN says nothing - swallows hard. DIDO steals a glance.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)

<b>                    JOHN

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          The Zong ship and those drowned.

LORD MANSFIELD stiffens. He looks uncomfortably at DIDO
piling books. JOHN'S eyes follow.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          It is one of the few trades
          acceptable to a gentleman.

<b>                    JOHN

          wish to rely on the law courts.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          You aspire to the judiciary?

LORD MANSFIELD laughs at him. DIDO stares at the ground -
cringing on JOHN'S behalf. John asserts himself.
<b>                    JOHN

     A beat. His words force DIDO to look up, affected.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               Noble if not pompous! A country

               you pay every regard to what you
               are taught - but you have neither
               the rank nor finances for any more!

<b>                         JOHN
</b>               That I do not know, M'lord. I
               have not yet been afforded those
               considerations...but I know a
               country life does not suit me.

     LORD MANSFIELD's gaze is trained on JOHN. DIDO has finished
     gathering the books and is quietly slipping from the room.
<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD

                   (Beat)
               What do you think?

     DIDO freezes, in the doorway - all eyes locked on her.

</b>     DIDO moves along the hallway, lined with enormous artists'         *
     interpretations, communicating a certain lifestyle.

She slows, caught by one of the paintings - an English rose
stares out, as a black domestic submissively fastens a
priceless bracelet around her lady-master's wrist.
DIDO's POV: CLOSE on the domestic. Suddenly...
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Thank you for your gracious
          support.

DIDO jumps - finds JOHN standing beside her.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          I neither spoke for or against
          you - since neither is my place.

<b>                     JOHN
</b>          Silence speaks volumes.
Elizabeth approaches, calls out, as she curtseys.

<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Papaa's new student.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Indeed!
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Mr Davinier, my cousin, Elizabeth.
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          A pleasure.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>              (to John)
          Papaa has never taken a pupil,
          you realise?
<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Someone to keep you company while
          you take Papaa's dictation, Dido.
              (to John)
          Truth is, there have been more of
          your sex at Kenwood this week,
          than I've previously seen in all
          my entire life!
DIDO flushes.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Hopefully we have not disappointed!
<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          On the contrary!
She raises a minxish eyebrow and moves off. Awkward silence.
<b>                                                             28.
</b>

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Mr Davinier, what...what is the
          importance of the Zong... why is
          the case before Papaa's court,
          the supreme court...?
He searches her, taken aback.   Why is she asking him?

<b>                       JOHN
</b>          Well...
              (he struggles, tentative)
          It is a cargo ship.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          I...I am aware of that.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          A human-cargo ship.
DIDO hesitates, tentative.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Oh. You said those who were
          drowned.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          It lost most of its slaves before
          arriving at its destination.
              (hesitant)
          Drowned - by the crew on the
          captain's order.

JOHN watches as DIDO falters.

<b>                       DIDO
</b>          But...why?

The SOUND of the MANSFIELDS gathering with the ASHFORDS. A
maid approaches hurrying about her duties.

<b>                    MAID
</b>          Miss, your supper is served
          now in the ladies' parlour.

<b>                       DIDO
</b>          Thank you.
JOHN hesitates, struck with confusion at the maid's words.
DIDO becomes awkward. LADY MANSFIELD emerges, disappearing
into the dining room.
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          Mr Davinier, will you be joining
          us for dinner?
JOHN's eyes dart to DIDO - sees her unease. It pierces him.
<b>                                                                  29.
</b>

<b>                         JOHN
</b>               I..er...I thank you, Madam, but I
               am promised to the company of my
               aunt this evening. She has recently
               moved to the cottage at Belsize.
<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD
</b>               Of course - as you wish.

     She moves off, and DIDO and JOHN are left in tense silence.
<b>                         JOHN
</b>               Permit me to ask, why you do not
               dine with your family - ever?
<b>                         DIDO
</b>               That is not correct.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>               Forgive me...but twice now I have
               seen...I have seen you separated
               from the gathering.
     DIDO's cheeks begin to burn.

<b>                         JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>               I am confounded.
     DIDO snaps, her shame over-spilling...
<b>                         DIDO
</b>               And well you might be - when the
               son of clergy is permitted to the
               table before a lady of the house.
<b>                         JOHN
</b>               Is that a reminder of my place,
               Miss Lindsay?
     She holds back frustrated tears, pained.

<b>                         DIDO
</b>               No. It's a statement of mine!

     Both of them are smarting. JOHN moves off, stung.

     DIDO steps into the room, expressionless. She sits on the
     chaise longue, allows her gaze to settle on her reflection.

     Something terrible resonates through her - some awful
     thought or feeling, that leaves her breathless with
     emotion. And then her fingers come up to the skin on her
     chest...and she begins to pinch and pull with self-hatred,
     rubbing the heel of her palm across her cheek, her
     forehead, as her face crumples and she begins to cry.

     New day. LORD MANSFIELD and JOHN ride through Kenwood's
     lands on horseback, slowing under the shade of trees.
<b>                         JOHN
</b>                   (he pats his animal)
               There is much speculation on your
               decision. Anticipation seems to
               be turning to panic, m'lord.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               I cannot disagree.
<b>                         JOHN
</b>               One hundred and thirty two drowned
               on route from Africa to the West
               Indies. Your ruling could bring
               the slave trade to its knees -
               entirely destroy an economic
               foundation of these lands.
                   (off Mansfield)
               Is that pressure not maddening,
               m'lord?
     LORD MANSFIELD reigns in his horse. He quotes in Latin.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               Justitia fiat, ruat coelum, Mr
               Davinier - Let justice be done,
               though the heavens may fall.
<b>                         JOHN
</b>               The insurance claim states, the
               slaves were thrown overboard for
               the safety of the ship - that
               there wasn't sufficient water for
               the cargo and crew to survive the
               rest of the voyage.
<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               It does.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>               Then, if I am correct, the case
               hangs on...

<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               ...IT HANGS on `Absolute
               necessity'. If the cargo was
               spoiled...
<b>                          JOHN
</b>               Cargo?
     LORD MANSFIELD adjusts his language.
<b>                                                               31.
</b>

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               If the killing of the..'negros' was
               truly `necessary' in order to save
               the ship - as the captain contends.

     A difficult silence.   JOHN is careful, but sceptical.
<b>                         JOHN
</b>               But...is that where it hinges?

     LORD MANSFIELD does not welcome the challenge.
<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               The ship's journey was thwarted
               by impossible weather conditions -
               what should have been weeks
               became months! What once appeared
               enough water, may not have been!
<b>                         JOHN
</b>               I am sensible of this, m'lord...
<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               Then do you know what a hundred
               thirsty slaves are capable of? I
               can tell you no man happily
               disposes of his cargo, even in
               the face of rebellion!
                   (Off John's silence)
               So now tell me - were you to
               dock at port with barely a piece
               of merchandise left to trade -
               what would you do?   Swallow
               financial ruin - or claim your
               due from the insurers.
     John is conflicted - to speak up, or not?

<b>                         JOHN
</b>               With due respect... I should
               question, whether 'human' life
               should have been insurable as
               cargo - at all.

     quietly. She is somehow tranquil under Zoffany's gaze.

     sketches madly, filling in DIDO'S eyes in great detail.

uneasy at what it shows - the last few letters of THE ZONG

               refusing to pay for murdered
               slaves.

     Her eyes sting. JOHN can see she is having difficulty - he
     touches her hand absentmindedly, startling her, but their
     eyes remain locked. She attempts, weakly, to return self-
     possession. Then almost a whisper...

     and volumes of news pamphlets. A set of them bound, LORD
     MANSFIELD'S wax seal hanging from the cord. She unties the
     cord, wax seal all over her hands. She fingers her way
     through the pile - legal headlines...all referring to Lord
     Mansfield. She stops dead...

     POV - pamphlet cover...image of LORD MANSFIELD, drooping
     bottom lip touching the ground - foolish and dithering,
     whilst beside him a `Negro' slave wields a judge's' gavel.

     moves urgently to the next pamphlet, and the next...
     More MANSFIELD caricatures - a big nose, fat lips, all with

     ON ELIZABETH wide eyed, then moved as her eyes brim.

     A tentative knock and MABEL enters - DIDO becomes tense.
     MABEL speaks gently - strong Welsh accent.

<b>                         MABEL
</b>               Some bed socks for you, Miss
               Murray, Miss Lindsay. It's not as
               warm as we hoped tonight

     She hands a pair each to the girls.
<b>                         ELIZABETH,
</b>               Thank you Mabel...How kind.
     MABEL pauses as DIDO struggles with her hair.

<b>                         MABEL
</b>               Can I help you with that, Miss
               Lindsay?

     ON DIDO, self-conscious under MABEL'S stare.
<b>                         DIDO
</b>               Mabel, I am fine - thank you!

     She struggles once again, wrenching the brush.
<b>                         MABEL
</b>               You must start from the ends, miss.
     DIDO stares at her - a long beat.

<b>                                                      CUT TO:
</b>     Candle lit faces... DIDO's reflection in the mirror - her
     hair separated into four sections.
     In the reflection BG, ELIZABETH sits serenely watching
     MABEL brushing through each section from ends to roots.

<b>                         MABEL (CONT'D)
</b>               My Mam taught me, see?
     DIDO stares at her a moment, some kind of pain resonates in
     her eyes as her face softens and she begins to relax.

     The four MANSFIELD ladies step from the carriage. Before

</b>
     A sophisticated landscape, very much in keeping with LADY
     ASHFORD'S sense of style.
     A maid steps out - LADY MANSFIELD follows with the four
     Mansfield women. ELIZABETH beams.
<b>                         MAID
</b>               Lady Mansfield, LADY MARY and
               their nieces, Madam.

     LADY ASHFORD moves towards them, face bright with ambition.
<b>                          LADY ASHFORD
</b>               Ladies.
<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD
</b>               Lady Ashford.

     The girls curtsey.
<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>               And the gentlemen? Mr James?
<b>                         LADY ASHFORD
</b>                   (reassuring)
               Here, of course. Very little could
               have prevented him, knowing that
               Miss Murray would visit today.

     ELIZABETH could burst. She looks up to see JAMES and
     OLIVER approach from the North side of the gardens.

<b>                                                     CUT TO:
</b>
     The ladies sip drinks as LORD ASHFORD appears from the
     house, a man with presence (50s) cultivated and astute.

     He moves to OLIVER, observing DIDO, under a nearby tree.
<b>                         LORD ASHFORD
</b>               Lord Mansfield's infamous Mulatto.
               No wonder our `Lord Chief Justice
               knows not whether he is coming or
               going! Not your usual game, Oliver.

     OLIVER examines his father.

</b>               She can not know your thoughts
               unless you offer them to her.
     He moves off, leaving OLIVER pensive.
<b>                                                             45.
</b>

<b>                    LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)
</b>          The ladies Mansfield! As sweet on
          the eye as the freshest flowers
          in bloom....
              (off Lady M's laughter)
          What is in those glasses?
ON OLIVER as he moves to the pond. In the BG...

<b>                    LADY ASHFORD
</b>          Grenadine syrup...
<b>                       LADY MARY
</b>          And port!!
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          Which has gone to my head already!

ELIZABETH is knelt at the pond's edge with JAMES - a paper
boat floats on the water, toppling over to a unanimous cry.

OLIVER watches as DIDO approaches. His eyes light up.
<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Oh Dido look - Mr James has made
          me a boat and it has capsized.
JAMES stretches a branch into the lake to rescue the boat.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          What a dreadful shame.

OLIVER collects paper from the grass. CLOSE on his hands as
he folds it into a boat under DIDO'S nose.
<b>                    OLIVER
</b>              (to DIDO, earnest)
          For you.
She smiles, can't help being charmed.

<b>                       DIDO
</b>          Thank you.
He places it in the water, stands and examines DIDO. From
afar, LADY MANSFIELD watches.
<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Miss Lindsay, would you do me the
          honour of taking some air with
          me, some time?
DIDO is dumbstruck - what to say? JAMES is halted.
<b>                    JAMES
</b>          Don't you care what people will say
<b>                                                                46.
</b>

     DIDO is jolted by the antangonism in JAMES' tone -
     ELIZABETH too - it pierces her and she speaks up.
<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>               What is that to mean Mr James?
               What should anyone say?!
     JAMES hesitates, then...

<b>                         JAMES
</b>               That he should compromise a
               lady's reputation by stepping out
               with her - scarcely having made
               her acquaintance!
<b>                         OLIVER
</b>               I think you are a great deal too
               anxious, brother. We should merely
               take a turn around Vauxhall.
     DIDO observes JAMES - His protestation is bitter. She
     traces OLIVER'S features, warmly.
<b>                         DIDO
</b>               I should be delighted, Mr Oliver!
               Most delighted.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>               Are you really to defy Papaa?

     Teaming with parasols, fountains, and hidden pathways.
     61.1: JAMES and ELIZABETH stroll, followed by DIDO and
     OLIVER, then, LADIES MANSFIELD, MARY, and ASHFORD.

<b>                          LADY MANSFIELD
</b>                   (re. Dido with Oliver)
               I am not at ease with this.
               Lord Mansfield would be most
               aggrieved.
<b>                         LADY ASHFORD
</b>               Oh it can do no harm. This is
               simply two families, enjoying a
               day together.
     LADY MANSFIELD takes an unhappy breath, burdened.
<b>                                                           47.

<b>                    LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D)
</b>          Though surely...IF a desirable
          match were a ... certain...
          possibility your dear husband could
          have no objections, could he?
LADY MANSFIELD, turns slowly to regard LADY ASHFORD,
aroused by the insinuation and alarmed at the same time.
She looks back to DIDO and OLIVER, wide eyed.

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Well I did not think I would ever
          find a lady who was not to be
          conquered or ignored...Until you.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Ah now how do I know this is not
          just another tactic in your
          battle to conquer?
He stops, takes her hand and places it on in his chest.

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          See how my heart beats.

She lets her hand rest a moment.

<b>                    OLIVER (CONT'D)
</b>          I am utterly taken with you, Miss
          Lindsay.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Despite...such pronounced
          protestations from your brother?

<b>                     OLIVER
</b>          He cannot overlook your mother's
          origins, as I do. Foolish. Why
          should anyone even pay her regard
          when your better half has equipped
          you so well with loveliness and
          privilege.

Dido is stung. OLIVER shrugs, oblivious. The sound of Handel
filters from a nearby concert. DIDO tries hard to recover.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          What a lovely sound.

He smiles at her, studies her...mischievous...

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          You are unrelentingly cultured.
          Come, let's find it!
He takes her waist spinning her round with him into another
pathway, disappearing from the others, giggling as they go.
<b>                                                           48.

<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          People will think she has no family!
<b>                    LADY ASHFORD.
</b>          People will think they are courting!
LADY MANSFIELD and LADY MARY exchange a look. LADY MARY is
somehow softened - her eyes appeal to LADY MANSFIELD...

<b>                    LADY MARY
</b>          Let her enjoy his society.
LADY MANSFIELD is effected - reads MARY'S emotion.
61.2: An open pavilion with classical concert. ON OLIVER
and DIDO watching.

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          I might only have dreamed of
          these moments, at one time.

DIDO smiles - allows herself to be flattered.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Really? You are much of the
          conqueror Mr Oliver.
He chuckles, brings his hand up to brush her cheek, gently.
She smiles just as her eyes fall on the back of a gentleman's
head, shoulders - his movement somehow familiar.
The sight roots her, uncertain of what she sees. And then
he turns to address another, and his profile becomes clear.

It is JOHN DAVINIER.
In that moment, he flicks his head round and his gaze falls
on her - a beat between them then his eyes fall on OLIVER.
JOHN excuses himself from others and makes his way across.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Miss Lindsay.
<b>                    DIDO

          see you.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          And you, Miss Lindsay.
He looks to OLIVER.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Forgive me - Mr Ashford, may I
          present to you...Mr Davinier.

<b>                    DIDO (CONT'D)

<b>                    OLIVER

              (an `off' smile)

OLIVER bows, manfully, asserting his greater status.
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Sir. (beat) My regards to
          your family, Miss Lindsay.
Unexpected hope fills her.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Elizabeth and Mamaa are here...
          in fact.

DIDO watches as JOHN nods politely and moves off, returning
to his company - male and all of a similar type to him.

ON OLIVER, as he takes in JOHN'S effect on DIDO.

<b>                                                   CUT TO:

stands engrossed as the sky lights up. DIDO looks up at
him. She wavers. Then...slowly she backs away from the crowd

61.4 DIDO walks quickly - follows the sound of the concert
to find her way back to JOHN.

Her POV: JOHN listening diligently to the music. He double
takes at the sight of her hovering at the edge of the
concert. He stands alarmed, negotiates his way to her.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>              (dismayed)
          Miss Lindsay, you are alone!!

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Your pupilage. Father would

His eyes soften as he looks at her...

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          He would make mine a living hell,
          were he to know of us speaking.
DIDO tugs him into a quiet lane, away from the concert and
promenading.

Hardly a breath and BAM!! She is slammed against a walled
maze, suddenly!! JOHN pressed against her tightly!
Confused, her gaze darts around her, finds LADY MANSFIELD
and LADY ASHFORD ambling past along a cross path, oblivious.
DIDO freezes - held tightly against JOHN. She stares
panicked into his eyes and he into hers.

61.5:CUTAWAY So they do not see ELIZABETH as she strolls by
with JAMES - Her gaze falling on JOHN and DIDO, instantly.

ELIZABETH is stunned!!!! But doesn't falter.
61.4 CONT'D: As DIDO and JOHN look back - nothing but
anonymous strangers, leaving them none the wiser to being
discovered. JOHN pulls away, embarrassed...
<b>                    JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>          Forgive me.
She nods, equally bashful. They regard each other.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          What are you doing here in London
          Mr Davinier?
<b>                    JOHN

          than petty disputes between
          unsavoury landlords and debauched
          tenants, but I cannot discount it.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Not what you wished for.
<b>                    JOHN

          comes easily.
<b>                    DIDO

          Where are my manners? I trust

DIDO is unexpectedly struck - recovers herself.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          I have tried to keep up - with
          the Zong. These past weeks.
<b>                    JOHN
</b>              (agitated)
          Tis pitiful! Such inability to
          simply know what value to put on
          another's life.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>              (bitterly)
          What price, a worthless Negro.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>              (frustrated)
          You utterly misunderstand me.
          I am saying that no man may have
          the value of that of cargo!!!
          Human beings cannot be priced,
          since we are priceless!! Freemen
          and slaves alike!
Her eyes begin to sting at the `integrity' in his words.
<b>                    JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>              (enthused)
          I am with others here. We are
          all students in law - applying
          pressure on the insurance companies
          to refuse from here on to insure
          slaves on any ship. A simple clause.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          But that would require a change
          of law. I know nothing but...

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          A change in law - something the
          insurance companies can lobby for
          IF they can be persuaded to band
          together.
              (softly,)
          We may only be students,
          but...change is most always
          precipitated by the young.
              (shrugs - poignant)
          Someone has to have the courage.
          How can we expect to be civilised
          if we live in a barbaric world.
His words wind her as JOHN shakes his head, frustrated. She
takes him in - he is so very handsome!

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          No. It is more than that. It's
          the shame of a law that would
          uphold a financial transaction
          upon that atrocity.
She is scathing and accepting all at once, affecting him.

               Money is no substitute for a
               man's protection. I cannot deny
               her a match so suitable.

     LADY MANSFIELD nods, satisfied.

          be acceptable to you.

          Since...it would very much be my
          privilege...my honour, if you
          would agree to become my wife.

finds a large black sapphire glistening in his fingers...

</b>               We are to make many calls today,
               Elizabeth. Acquainting oneself

     She picks up her pamphlet. On the back, a headline reads:

</b>          Papaa's notes on the ship's log.
          It seems the First Mate has come
          forward with it - one Mr Stubbs. I
          could not find the log itself, but
          look at Papaa's markings - See the
          map positions - From December
          29th, Captain Collingwood and

JOHN'S gaze darts from notes to the map, absorbed.
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          This...This is remarkable.
He looks up from the papers.   DIDO is still tentative.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Is it? Perhaps if you made these

</b>               Erm...I believe so.

     LORD MANSFIELD stares at her irritated - peculiar girl!
<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               Well is she, or isn't she?
     MABEL wavers, attempts to sound convincing.

</b>               Yes. She is, M'lord.
     LORD MANSFIELD watches as she stiffly moves from the room.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>              (conciliatory)
          The fault was never with you.
He stops a beat as he catches her gaze on a painted metal
sign swinging from the back of an inn. It shows a gent,
hat in hand, his black servant bowing behind him.

<b>                    JOHN (CONT'D)

He follows her gaze back to the image and realisation hits.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          You were afraid.

<b>                       DIDO

She looks back at him earnestly...

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Do not feel ashamed.
              (she observes him)
          Elizabeth said something when we
          arrived in London. She said:

          we are but their property.

<b>                       JOHN

JOHN nods, uneasily.    DIDO thinks aloud.

<b>                    DIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          And it came into my head that I

          who is she, without a husband of
          consequence?
              (she ponders)

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Unless she marries her equal. Her

DIDO is silent. She steals a glance at him.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          I remember my Papaa's eyes. They
          were kind, gentle... a little

<b>                    JOHN

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          She is a ghost in my life -
          present in my reflection,
          in each scowl I receive, yet I
          know very little of her than the
          colour she has given me.
<b>                    JOHN
</b>              (moved)
          Then at the least, you know she

pulls back, nervous of the intimacy.
<b>                       DIDO
</b>             I am to marry, shortly - Mr Ashford.

JOHN falters but tries to recover.
<b>                       JOHN
</b>             Oh!
She begins to walk again - composing herself.

<b>                       DIDO
</b>             He is amiable and of good family.
<b>                       JOHN
</b>             Is it...what you want?
She stops.    The question strikes her.

<b>                       DIDO
</b>             The alternative is to replace
             Lady Mary in her responsibilities
             at Kenwood.

<b>                       JOHN

<b>                       DIDO
</b>             Papaa did not trust I could
             achieve a match that might raise
             my rank - or even equal it.

JOHN searches her, then gently...
<b>                       JOHN
</b>             You...are above reducing yourself
             for the sake of rank.
She stares at him, frozen - his words bury somewhere deep.
She studies him, harder. He moves towards her, letting his
breath settle on her face. They are both deadly nervous.
<b>                       JOHN (CONT'D)

DIDO searches him. He takes her hand, brings it to his lips,
kissing it gently sending a shiver through her.
<b>                       JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>             I will take you back to your coach.

               he looked at me...I somehow

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

     LADY MANSFIELD interrogates a gentleman.

<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD
</b>               How charming. Is that not

<b>                         GENTLEMAN 1

<b>                         GENTLEMAN 1

     He turns to look at the bush of flowers behind him. When
     he turns back, LADY MANSFIELD and ELIZABETH are gone.

     ON BARONESS VERNON (50s) who passes on a punt, utterly
     captivated as she waves. Her eyes are on DIDO, stunningly
     beautiful in fuchsia, beside OLIVER.
<b>                         BARONESS VERNON

<b>                    BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D)
</b>          Now has she met Mr Willoughby...

She points to a gent and leans into the bankside...

passing in another.
<b>                    BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D)
</b>          Mr Francis, Mr Smith...!!! You

          Mamaa, Mr Vaughan approaches.

A slender, dapper gent moves towards us on the river bank.
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          Now I have checked and he has no
          London home, but I have good

<b>                    ELIZABETH

<b>                    MR VAUGHAN
</b>          With her Ladyship's permission?
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          I shall make arrangements.
ON DIDO, as OLIVER chats to others. She moves past as...

<b>                    LADY ASHFORD
</b>          A pity Lady Mansfield and I could not
          do business on James and Miss Murray.

<b>                    LADY MARY
</b>          A greater pity you rejected her.

<b>                    LADY ASHFORD
</b>          Let us not dwell on the
          unfortunate. Oliver and Miss
          Lindsay are a blissful match.
          Tell me, when exactly does she
          receive her inheritance?
As DIDO observes her reflection in waters - easy laughter
floats by - a group of gentleman josh.

A figure beside her turns - icy blue stare takes her in as
she meets his gaze and finds herself staring into the eyes
of JAMES ASHFORD.
<b>                    JAMES ASHFORD.
</b>          Miss Lindsay. Not Husband
          hunting, are we?
              (off Dido's disdain)
          Good Lord, I forgot - you have
          ensnared my brother. Now is he to
          share his dining room with you, as
          well as his bed??
His words bury deep and painful.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Oh, Mr James, your manners are as
          poor as your brother's finances.

<b>                    JAMES
</b>          And you are foolish enough to marry
          him. I on the other have no better
          use for your impoverished
          cousin!...(beat)...Though she does
          make for rather amusing sport!
<b>                                                               76.
</b>

She follows his gaze through trees to ELIZABETH breathing
in the scent of the azaleas beside MR VAUGHAN. The joshing
gentlemen trickle away leaving only DIDO and JAMES.
She goes to move off. JAMES grabs her arm, spitefully.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          That is painful, sir.
<b>                    JAMES

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          It is not in my repertoire to
          keep company with beasts.

He regards her - her disdain reflected in his eyes. His
free hand comes up, fingers rest on her lips, then spread,
as he crushes her beauty in his hand.
Her eyes fill as he brings her close. So close. She is
afraid, angry. She struggles desperately, spirited, both
arousing and alarming him. As she tears herself from him

<b>                    DIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          How dare you? HOW DARE YOU!

He stares at her - takes her in, calmly. Then...
<b>                       JAMES
</b>          With ease.

DIDO wavers nauseous with contempt.   JAMES moves off.   She
watches, incensed, humiliated.

ELIZABETH strolls with MR VAUGHAN, as JAMES passes OLIVER,
he whispers to his brother.

<b>                    JAMES (CONT'D)
</b>          You will destroy us. You will destroy
          the entire order of our family.
Nearby, DIDO emerges from the trees...
<b>                    LADY ASHFORD
</b>          Oliver has been searching for you!

LADY MANSFIELD notes DIDO'S odd demeanour, LADY MARY too.
Her eyes dart suspiciously to JAMES as he approaches.
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          Are you unwell, my dear?
DIDO's affected eyes come up to meet her mother's. She goes
to answer...interrupted as...ELIZABETH gasps overwhelmed...

<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Oh!..Mr James!
<b>                                                                77.

     A distressed DIDO follows her gaze back to JAMES.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>               Lady Ashford, you had not mentioned
               Mr James was to attend!
<b>                         LADY ASHFORD
</b>               Surprisingly.

     LADY ASHFORD closes her eyes,livid. VAUGHAN stands usurped.
<b>                         JAMES
</b>               Ladies.
                   (off Dido's reaction)
               Miss Murray.

     He kisses ELIZABETH'S hand oh so gently, for DIDO'S
     benefit. LADY MANSFIELD's heart sinks.
     OFF DIDO, turbulent.

     A busy area - As workers traipse up and down.
<b>                         JOHN
</b>               I had never imagined myself to be
               married. But my aunt is determined.
               It is true that if one were to count,
               I had not even been acquainted with
               Miss Beresford on three occasions.

<b>                         DIDO
</b>               Is she not terribly disappointed that
               you will not return to Hampstead?

<b>                         JOHN
</b>                   (ironic)
               my Aunt?

     They begin to laugh...it's good to see DIDO laughing.
<b>                         JOHN (CONT'D)JOHN
</b>               I doubt Miss Beresford has
               anymore wish to marry me
               than I her. I should rather
               make a nuisance of myself
               alone in London, than in an
               unwanted marriage in Hampstead...

</b>               Were you a curious child?

<b>                         DIDO
</b>               Completely. Elizabeth, always
               asked the questions for me...
               then took blame for
               the impropriety when
               in fact she was protecting
               me! Dear, dear Bette.

     ANOTHER DAY....ON JOHN and DIDO as they meander.
<b>                         DIDO
</b>               ...I find myself unable to
               sleep. Papaa is to finally speak in

<b>                         JOHN
</b>               It is quite extraordinary ...but I
               fear...I fear despite persuasive
               argument...your Papaa has not been
               moved.
                   (despondent)
               I am not certain he is ready to
               go against the traders - they are
               some of the most powerful in
               these Isles - theirs are the
               finances that hold up England,
               after all. The enemies of any man
               who stood against the trade would
               be vicious.

     DIDO stops, turns JOHN to face her.   She is intense...
<b>                         DIDO
</b>               And yet if he does...stand

               condemns the trade...The Lord
               Chief Justice of England...it may
               be impossible for the slave laws

     LORD MANSFIELD steps from the shadows, watches quietly, as
     she creeps up the stairs, silently.

     He thinks a moment - then hears the horses neighing out

     DIDO appears in the doorway, listens a moment, then moves
     to join ELIZABETH, using only the one hand to play. A
     harmony emerges, continuing to its natural end.
<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>               I have heard nothing from him,
               since Vauxhall, Dido. I was
               certain an announcement was

<b>                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

          last few days...that it is my
          little means that has delayed
          James in making his approach.

DIDO regards her, sadly - tentative as she ventures...
<b>                    DIDO

<b>                    ELIZABETH

</b>          No!

<b>                       ELIZABETH

DIDO gets up too, now.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          James Ashford is not kind. He is
          not a man to give your life or

<b>                    ELIZABETH

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          He does not desire you, Bette!
          At least, even if he does, you
          would regret such a mistake.
              (off Bette's silence)
          He...he laid his hands on me,
          Bette - in the most
          un-gentlemanly fashion.
<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Why should you say such a thing?

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          He hurt me.
<b>                    ELIZABETH

A long beat.

<b>                    DIDO

She dares ELIZABETH to cross their line of sisterhood.

<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          ...You...you are....(courage leaves
          her)...You are illegitimate!!

DIDO is winded, but relieved.
<b>                                                                  82.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

               guests?

<b>                          DIDO
</b>               My mother and father never married
               - you are correct. But my father
               acknowledged me as his child.
                   (beat)
               It is yours who refuses to
               legitimise your position, Bette -
               that is why you are poor! And that
               is why it is not me who is beneath
               Mr James, Bette. It is not me!
     ELIZABETH stings - she fights tears, before she disappears.

     A dreadful silence. DIDO looks down at the black sapphire
     on her finger. A moment, then she slips it off.

                a little too radical for them.
<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD

                that you said it but... something
                in the way you looked at me.

                sure I could have married a
                gentleman without that...`thing'

                And sometimes you cannot fight it
                because you are a part of it.

                - surely as humanity evolves so
                too must its laws. And frankly I
                really do not care if you as an
                individual are without character
                or conscience - But a land whose
                laws contain neither - whose laws
                sanction not control the barbarous
                among its citizens - that is a
                country whose hope is lost.

      LORD MANSFIELD's gaze falls away, as he swallows hard.

      LORD MANSFIELD fits his tricorn (hat), preparing to leave.
      The two men lay eyes on each other - both rooted. LORD

LORD MANSFIELD keeps walking.

</b>          I HAVE SEEN YOUR NOTES!! If they

ON LORD MANSFIELD'S realisation - DIDO has given the
information to JOHN.

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          If you find for the traders, you
          will be formalizing in law the
          concept of insuring `human' cargo.

LORD MANSFIELD climbs into his carriage.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          That is correct!...(to his
          driver)...Drive!
The carriage begins to move off.   JOHN walks alongside it.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Then know that when you are gone,
          your legacy will be to have left
          Miss Lindsay in a world that says
          she may be worth more dead, than
          alive.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          She is not a slave.
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          By the very grace of God!

The words provoke LORD MANSFIELD. He stands, slamming his
hand to the driver's wall. The carriage halts abruptly.

JOHN stands at the carriage window, breathless. LORD
MANSFIELD looks down at him furious, suddenly disarmed by
the emotion in JOHN'S eyes.

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          This is not about Miss Lindsay.
JOHN is confused, flustered.
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Of course it is! It's about all
          of us. It's about everything...
          everything that is important!

</b>

      LORD MANSFIELD searches JOHN, palpably affected now. He
      doesn't want to show JOHN his empathy, fights it - but for
      a split second it escapes in the profound silence.
      He recovers himself - considers his words before he speaks
      quietly - as though from personal experience...
<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>                Mr Davinier, the world is a
                devastating place. You must learn
                to protect your emotions if you
                are to prevent matters of both
                law..and love from devastating you.
      JOHN is frozen, averts his gaze. LORD MANSFIELD regards
      him, affected, bangs on the carriage again and is gone.

      OFF JOHN, shaken.

                to bear in this appeal. This is
                the question. That is, first:
                whether the slaves were drowned
                as an anticipatory act. An act to
                avoid the disease caused by their

</b>          journey, killing them once on shore,
          and at their destination...depriving
          the slave owners of any compensation.
He takes in the gaze of a free black man in the gallery.

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          Or secondly: whether they were
          `jettisoned' as cargo! To save
          captain and crew from certain death,
          when the extended journey threatened
          shortage of drinking-water.
              (steely eyed)
          Let me be clear, loss of water on a
          ship constitutes a singularly
          dangerous affair - insurrection of
          thirsty and hostile slaves at its
          extreme - and an impossible task to
          share diminished water reserve, among
          all those living, at best. Each
          implies severe threat to the lives of
          the seamen. In such circumstances our
          law is transparent and equivocal -
          the jettisoning of enslaved cargo
          ...IS legal!
              (he spells it out)
          And in these circumstances, combined
          with unavoidable loss of water, our
          laws leave the ship-owners securely
          within their rights to make a claim
          ...and behoves the insurers to pay
          losses.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          No!

Gasps from around the room...gasps that turn into cries,
including DIDO'S own. JOHN is rigid, anger rising.

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          The ship's owners chose a tight
          `packing fashion' to transport
          the slaves...A popular fashion of
          transportation that is known for
          causing death and disease.

His voice is raised over the sounds of a chaotic court.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          This choice of laying the slaves
          tightly together is undertaken at
          the Captain's own risk. In the
          event that over packing renders
          an avoidable lack of drinking water
          on board a protracted journey,
          such a decision may be viewed as
          simple `bad management' on a

</b>
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          Captain's part, and further, weigh
          as his own risk. An extended journey
          - one in which the destination is
          overshot may also be viewed as
          the captain's own mismanagement.
The noise lowers to silence. LORD MANSFIELD settles on JOHN.

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          It is not legal...to discharge lives
          from a ship into the waters, to
          prevent those lives dying on land,
          and to facilitate insurance
          compensation. Whether they be the
          lives of horses... or human beings
          ...slaves or otherwise - It is
          not legal, neither is it right.

DIDO lets out a gasp - breathless relief.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          Further, the claim of shortage of
          water is illegitimate shown by the
          evidence put forward. To my
          mind, it is clear a fraud has been
          committed in claiming insurance on
          slaves who were...drowned solely
          for financial gain.
He looks around the room - sees LORD ASHFORD's acceptance.
His eyes fall on DIDO now and here they remain.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          It is my opinion, that the state of
          slavery is so odious a position that
          nothing may support it. This case
          has displayed with searing clarity
          the depravity of any such nation
          whose choice is to practice it. You
          may be certain that I have laboured
          over my judgement and statements
          today and am in full understanding
          of all of the ramifications. Justice
          be done,though the heavens may fall.
JOHN'S eyes brim at the realisation of those words.

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          I find in favour of the insurers
          and overturn the decision of the
          lower court. I order a retrial.

Stunned confusion in the courtroom. Then, all kinds of
commotion - anger, cheers amid shock. LORD MANSFIELD stands.

      JOHN jumps up, desperate for eye contact through the
      commotion...but LORD MANSFIELD fixes ahead, moves off.
      DIDO stands, caught by her own breath. JOHN turns to her.
      She begins to sob. For the first time he pulls her close,

      WIDE on the court room - JOHN holding DIDO as she sobs.

</b>                I am trying to be.
<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>                Then your efforts are not in vain.

      DIDO moves to JOHN'S side, taking his hand. LORD

LORD MANSFIELD nods, then finally moves off.    JOHN can't

          Because, I cannot conceive of a
          life without you...and if...if
          such were all that were before

He breaks down now too, wiping her tears before kissing her
through his own sobs. Then tears turn to laughter.

We draw back on the couple - two fragile figures, amid the
