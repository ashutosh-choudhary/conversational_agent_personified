            A rusted Chevy El Camino drives against dissolving Louisiana

            Occasional oncoming headlights illuminate the driver's face:

            We're staring at three sacks of sample unmounted EMERALDS,
            set on a filthy counter.

                      This one here's more expensive, but

                      Jake, get on it.

            ACROSS THE ROOM are two other men -- JAKE and DOUG. Ex-cons
            at a table, riffing through Bud's cash.

            A CURTAIN YANKS BACK and RAY WHEELER, 29, enters. Dope-thin,
            bloodshot eyes. He looks at Bud. Bud looks at him... Ray
            clicks on the TV and opens a beer. 

            TV IN: Evening news. The storm outside alters the reception.

                      murder in the slaying of accused sex
                      offender, Jeffrey Doucett.

            Bud watches Ray empty a gram of coke onto the bar. Using a
            credit card, Ray starts chopping lines. The SOUND continues
            throughout the scene...

            Grace hefts a lock box to the counter, removes a drawer of
            emeralds. Bud SEES packed carelessly underneath, uncut
<b>            DIAMONDS.
</b>
<b>                                BUD

            And the volume of the TV now becomes more apparent...

                      hearing, was the arresting officer.

            Bud has been tuning out the TV distraction... until that last
            statement. He sneaks a look.

            Bud is stunned. HIS OWN FACE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. A younger
            photo of Bud, clean shaven - DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORM.

<b>            EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME

            Rain pours. A beat-up PLUMBER'S VAN is parked in the distance.

            TV IN: Signal wavers. It's archive footage of Baton Rouge

            Ray does a line of coke, keeps chopping. Watches the TV.

            Grace is bagging emeralds.

            Jake and Doug count cash.

            Bud keeps the TV in sight. Quick glances. Mind racing.

            TV IN: The procession moves past a row of pay phones. At one
            phone, a discreet figure, GARY PLAUCHE, turns...

</b>                      The victim's father, Gary Plauche, stood
                      waiting at the terminal. As Doucett
                      walked by, Plauche turned, raised a
                      handgun...and fired.

            Bud's vision is suddenly obscured when Grace steps forward
            with the emeralds in a satchel.

<b>                                GRACE
</b>                      Here you go. Fifteen three-karat blues.
                      Wholesale. Twenty large.

            Sudden GUNSHOTS and SCREAMS on the TV. Everyone turns...

            TV IN: Jeffrey Doucett lies dead as POLICE wrestle Gary
            Plauche to the ground amid chaos.

            TIGHT ON RAY'S EYES, intense, watching the footage. 

            As Bud stuffs the satchel in his coat, WE SEE what Ray
            sees...

            TV IN: Bud, POLICE BADGE AROUND HIS NECK, arresting Plauche.

            ON RAY, slow burn realization as he looks from the tv to Bud.
            And again. EYES LOCK, THEY BOTH KNOW.

<b>                                RAY

            Bud yanks a .45.

            And everything happens at once.

            A SUDDEN GUNSHOT and Jake FIRES again.

            Wood splinters as Bud FIRES back.

            Jake is HIT in the throat. A SECOND SHOT in the forehead - he
            SLAMS against the window, cracking it...

<b>            INT. PLUMBER'S VAN - SAME 
</b>
            Among surveillance equipment, sits Bud's crew: TODD SHEPARD,
            DAVID MARANDINO and DALE COBB.

            Gunshots ECHO.

            Marandino, behind the wheel, SLAMS his foot on the gas.

<b>            INT. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME 
</b>
            A SHOT ZIPS across Bud's back; he SPINS off the table.

            On his knees, Doug is firing a .32. BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM.

            Bud FIRES a burst through Doug's chest, dropping him.

            A HOLE EXPLODES beside Bud's head -- Grace FIRING a .45 -- as
            Ray SCREAMS and runs out the door.

<b>            EXT. TRAILER PARK, VAN - SAME 
</b>
            Marandino winds through gears, as Ray hits the yard
            running... 

            POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Marandino swings the wheel hard,
            SLAMS INTO RAY -- launching him through trash bins, into the
            mud.

            Cobb jumps from the van and pounds Ray into handcuffs.
            Simultaneously, Shepard sprints for the trailer door...

<b>            EXT. GRACE'S TRAILER PARK - SAME 
</b>
            Grace explodes from the back door, bolting across the yard.

<b>            I/E. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME

            Bud scrambles on the floor of the demolished trailer. .45
            held tight, he runs out after Grace.

<b>            ACROSS THE YARD
</b>
            the chase rages. 

<b>            MOVING WITH GRACE
</b>
            as he jumps a link fence, lands and trips into a roll of
            chicken wire. His sleeve catches, rips as he pulls free...

<b>            MOVING WITH BUD
</b>
            at a searing pace. He slips in the mud. Staggers up. SEES
            Grace disappear in the shadows.

            Grace throws himself against the side of a power unit. Eyes
            darting. Wheezing hard... Tries to slow his breath. Then
            turns the corner...

            GRACE'S POV: A SHOVEL swings from around the corner, WHAM!!!

            The blow sends Grace sailing back. He SLAMS on the ground,
            with a blood-covered broken face. As he tries to get up...

            Bud's gun is there. And like that, it stops.

<b>            INT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - AFTER HOURS

            At a table, the METRO SQUAD: Bud, Shepard, Marandino, Cobb
            are drinking. A bartender (SHERRY) is wiping down glasses...

            Sherry arrives with shots of whiskey, moves on.

</b>                      I think its a part of somethin' bigger.

            Bud takes his shot.

            Bud smokes, standing with Shepard in semi-darkness. They're
            looking through a two-way mirror into an INTERROGATION ROOM,
            where Cobb interviews Ray Wheeler.

<b>                                RAY

            Bud paces to a neighboring INTERROGATION ROOM where Marandino

            The door blasts open. Bud charges in, throws Grace against

            Bud and Cobb stay to the shadows, down a side yard...

            Shepard, Marandino reach the front door. Locked. A tv plays

            COP #1 feels behind a couch. He finds a .38, then a COLT .25
            below a chair cushion.

            COP #2 removes the toilet's basin cover. With a pen, he

            Cops talk excitedly over one another. Shepard leans over a

            Bud takes a seat at the table...

            For the first time, we get a good look at Jesse Wheeler: Cold
            eyes. Handlebar mustache. Covered in tats. With a
            boilermaker's build, he looks what he is... DANGEROUS.

                      So how you like Baton Rouge?

            Jesse's stare drifts to Bud. It's deadly.

            he's seen something we haven't... Cop #3 moves on...

            Jesse sees Bud's eyes. They connect with his own...

            Bud opens the fridge. He scans condiments then stops. From
            inside a bag of HOT DOG BUNS, several sealed VIALS.

<b>                                BUD

            cautiously from the shadows... 

            IT'S RAY. Pale and nervous. Jesse stands over him. The
            brothers' eyes connect. And there's a moment...

            High stone walls topped with concertina wire. Looming guard
            towers. Thick FOG blankets the yard filled with CONVICTS.

            Jesse takes hold of a metal bar, lifts it from a bench press.
            He does two reps. The weights BANG down and Jesse sits up.

            Ray adds weight to the already excessive amount. He sweats as
            he talks nervously over Jesse's shoulder... 

<b>                                RAY
</b>                      There's eyes everywhere. Like I got a
                      sign on my back, Jesse, they all think I
                      talked.

            Jesse scans numerous WHITE CONS watching the Wheeler brothers.

<b>                                RAY
</b>                      Just the other day... some spic fish got
                      hit with a weight. Ten other cons, they
                      beat him and stabbed him till there
                      weren't nothin' left. And the guards let
                      it happen.

            Ray fastens the safety collars and Jesse leans back.

<b>                                RAY
</b>                      His brains were on the wall, Jesse. Like
                      somebody painted 'em.

            Jesse does another set. Weights BANG down. He slowly sits up.

<b>                                JESSE

                      feel it fuckin' coming.

            Ray shoots a look at a group of ARYAN BROTHERS across the
            yard. CZAPP, their "leader," and ROACH. Jesse turns. Czapp
            looks at him. Eyes meet. Jesse leans back.

            The press shakes as Jesse does a last set. His red strained
            face as the bar lands with a CRASH.

            A sea of tables divided by race as far as the eye can see.  

            Jesse and Ray, trays in hand, find an island of ARYAN
            PRISONERS. They quickly part to make room for Jesse to sit.

            Suddenly Czapp and Roach arrive with their trays and abruptly
            sit across from the Wheeler brothers.

            Suddenly Jesse SPRINGS. A headbutt EXPLODES Czapp's nose and
            throws him back.

            As Lynn wipes tears, trembling in her seat, Jesse looks away
            from his son, and glances up...

            Behind a glass partition outlying the room, a MAN is watching
            them...

            BUD. Stark still. Fixing Jesse with a hard stare.

<b>            INT. PROPERTY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATER

            A CLERK passes Lynn her belongings through chain link. She
            wipes her eyes, holding the baby.

            The back bay doors open. Bud enters. Sleepless, wrinkled
            clothes.

<b>                                BUD

            Bud lays his card atop the bills, looks at Lynn.

<b>                                BUD

            They look at each other. She pulls her baby close. There's an
            unspoken moment. And Bud walks away... 

            Lynn waits till Bud is out of view. Then takes the money. And
            the card.

<b>            INT. CELLBLOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            A Guard buzzes Jesse through.

            PRISONERS line the tier. Smoking cigarettes. Looking out.
            Jesse walks past, enters...

<b>            HIS CELL
</b>
            ...where Ray sleeps in shadow on the bottom bunk.

            Jesse pulls a Polaroid from his pocket: His infant son. He
            gazes at the photo for a beat, then brings it to Ray...

<b>                                JESSE

            Jesse rolls him over. Ray is limp. A filthy SYRINGE imbedded
            his arm. Jaw slack. Eyes wide and vacant.

<b>            THE PHOTO FLUTTERS FROM JESSE'S HAND TO THE FLOOR...
</b>
            Jesse lowers, pulling Ray to his arms. He shuts his eyes.
            Teeth clench. And as Jesse feels the bile rising, his massive
            frame begins to shake... Then we realize, he's crying...

<b>            AFTER HOURS

            Jesse sleeps. Hand under the pillow. When there's a sound...

            His eyes SNAP OPEN to discover the silhouettes of SIX MEN,
            rushing into his cell...

            A LOADED SOCK swings out from Jesse's pillow, slams MAN #1 in
            the jaw with a CRACK!!

            On his feet, Jesse whips the sock around and whacks MAN #2's
            head against the concrete wall. He slumps down unconscious.

            A BLUNT OBJECT is rammed into Jesse's sternum. Another shot
            bangs his neck. The sock drops and a PADLOCK clatters out.

            With a final burst of energy, Jesse turns, SCREAMS and rushes
            MAN #3. Man #3 slams into the cell bars. CLANG!! Lights out.

            The remaining three Men attack. A series of blows rain down
            and Jesse sinks into their grip.

<b>            HALL LIGHTS BUMP ON: NOW WE SEE, THESE "MEN" ARE GUARDS.
</b>
            More GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy. They yank Jesse from his
            cell and take him down the tier.

            Guards toss the cell in a thorough search. Mattress
            overturns. Shelves crash.

            PRISONERS move to their bars, SHOUTING and JEERING as Jesse

            Jesse thrashes violently as the Guards slam him through a
            door into...

<b>            A TUNNEL
</b>
            between cell blocks. The ROAR of prisoners recedes as Jesse's
            dragged into darkness getting darker.

<b>            A DOOR SLAMS OPEN...
</b>
<b>            INT. READY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON

            ...THERE'S A FLASH OF LIGHT. We're in a windowless room.

            And Bud pouring coffee for two...

<b>                                BUD
</b>                      Want a cup of coffee?

            Jesse is handcuffed to the table. Guards are breathing hard.

<b>                                JESSE

            Jesse pauses, caught by Bud's tactics. The Guards file out
            and shut the door.

            Jesse's eyes are fierce and watching Bud's every movement as
            he hands him a coffee, then takes a seat...

<b>                                BUD

            Jesse's face is tense. Unyielding.

            Jesse silent, a dark internal pause. He meets Bud's eyes
            across the table; then...

<b>                                JESSE

                      not only guilty, but also a serious
                      threat to the community. The State
                      recommends that bail be denied.

                      reasonable bail. He has every intention
                      of appearing and answering to all these
                      false charges. In addition, he is the
                      sole provider for his wife and newborn

</b>
            Dark. Eerie and desolate. The car arrives. Jesse steps out
            and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane.

            On the jetty, a nondescript MAN stands alone against the calm
            Mississippi. His back is to us.

            A swamp area used as a mud retrieval source for the levy.
            Amite River. FOG OBSCURES NEARLY EVERYTHING.

            Jesse slowly emerges... Then Bud and Metro, on all sides, MAG-
            LIGHTS, FLAK JACKETS and SHOTGUNS. A DUFFEL BAG of SHOVELS.

            The sounds of the swamp are terrifying. Herons and bobcats.
            Boots hitting water. The buzz of a million mosquitos.

            SUDDENLY A RUSHING SOUND -- An ALLIGATOR shoves off the mire.

            BLOW TORCHES ROAR as Pathologists burn through the drums.

            Sparks fly. The lids CRASH. Swamp water floods out... And
            immersed within: two sore-covered, DECOMPOSING BODIES.

            The room recoils from the fumes.

<b>            EXT. DRIVEWAY, JESSE'S HOUSE

            Jesse is under the hood of his truck, fixing the engine...
            When a '71 Mustang, white-on-white, roars up the street. 

            Jesse glances over as the car pulls alongside the driveway.  
            It's CATFISH, at the wheel. A wolfish grin.

<b>                                CATFISH

            Jesse tightens a nut with a torque wrench, says nothing.

<b>                                CATFISH

                      glorious Louisiana mornin'.

            Jesse EYES his .45 atop the engine block, within reach.

                      Fact, a lot of people are.  

            Jesse stays on the engine, never turns around.

<b>                                JESSE

                      That's good. I'll see you real soon then.

            As Catfish drives away... We HEAR a series of photos being
            taken at high-speed. FREEZE FRAME to BLACK &amp; WHITE.

            MARTIN FITCH (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for US Attorney
            General. Pressed suit. Young face. Out of his element.

                      To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need

                      value, over what time table it's gonna
                      take place... Which target do we go after
                      first. We don't want to miss a big target
                      hitting a smaller target, you understand?

                      Those people are dead. We can't retrieve

<b>                                FITCH
</b>                      What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads.
                      He'll need to present something that
                      separates him from those we're going to
                      arrest. If Jesse can't offer something

                      not your partner, Bud. This case is
                      beyond our capacity. It requires
                      resources we don't have.

            Bud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                      They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They
                      send us some kid with a year under his
                      belt?! He don't even know what state he's
                      in... You want him in charge?!

<b>                                BRADDOCK
</b>                      You're God damn right I do! You're out on
                      a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job
                      to make sure you get back!

<b>                                BUD
</b>                      This is bullshit.

<b>                                BRADDOCK
</b>                      That may be. What it ain't, is open for
                      discussion.

            Braddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car.

<b>            INT. A ROOM - FOLLOWING MORNING
</b>
            A bare room; nothing to tell us where we are. Jesse's on a
            stool. He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth.

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                      Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I
                      could tell y'all things. Names.
                      Locations. What boat is movin' what
                      drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get
                      cut up and why. ...But what I got to know
                      is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear
                      your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's
                      right by me and keep my head from gettin'
                      shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is,
                      you need me. You ain't got enough cops
                      with enough sense or enough time, to
                      clear them crimes that already been
                      committed and will be.
                          (pause)
                      Y'all need me... I got the devil's
                      address.

            REVERSE: We're in a HOTEL SUITE.

            Shades down. Full of AGENTS: FBI, ATF, DEA, SECRET SERVICE.
            Law enforcement everywhere. On the furniture, against the
            wall, sitting on the floor. Staring at Jesse in silence.

            Bud stands by the door with Braddock. And Fitch steps
            forward, laughs nervously...

<b>                                FITCH
</b>                      Okay, great... Thanks. Thank you, Jesse,
                      for that. And thank you, everyone for
                      attending...
                          (tight)
                      Uh, we all know why we're here. To solve
                      a matter of custody--

<b>                                FBI #1
</b>                      We'll protect you and your family, Jesse.
                          (to the room)
                      It's a federal matter, gentlemen. Those
                      bodies were transported over state lines.

            An ATF AGENT #1 imposes:

<b>                                ATF #1
</b>                      Not so fast. Ammunition, grenades? This
                      man's house was a factory, for Christ's
                      sake. ATF is taking this.

<b>                                DEA
</b>                      Those murders were drug related. DEA's
                      got to do follow ups.

<b>                                SECRET SERVICE
</b>                      He was printing counterfeit money. 
                      That's Secret Service.

            ARGUING ENSUES, Agents' voices step over one another. Fitch
            tries to take control. Jesse's been silent, until...

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                      There's a hit list.

            Fitch hears this. He turns, loudly to the room...

<b>                                FITCH
</b>                      Wait! Wait a minute, quiet! Everyone
                      quiet!

            And EVERYTHING stops. Fitch moves to Jesse:

<b>                                FITCH
</b>                      A what?

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                      A hit list. There's much as twelve. Might
                      be one or two less now, I ain't sure.
                      Some could've already been gotten.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                          (to Braddock)
                      Now we're talkin'.

            FBI #2 approaches Jesse...

<b>                                FBI #2
</b>                      Why these twelve, Jesse?

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                      Different reasons. It ain't so much why
                      or what they done that matters. Pick any
                      one of 'em off that list, AB puts you on
                      salary.

            Everyone is suddenly interested. Bud sees this.

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                      And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken...
                      You're Mr. Nokes, right?

            Agents part, revealing JOHN NOKES(50s), black, an emminent 
            figurehead in a plush suit. Surprised to be pointed out...

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                      First U.S. Attorney, John Nokes?

<b>                                NOKES
</b>                      That's right.

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                      Well, last time I seen it...you was
                      number two on that list.

            It's quiet. Nokes thinks. Then LAUGHS and approaches Jesse.

<b>                                NOKES
</b>                      Can you fill us in on the rest of those
                      names, Jesse?

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                      Yes, I can. But there's something I gotta
                      make clear 'fore that happens.

<b>                                NOKES
</b>                      What's that?

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                      I've listened to you, Mr. Nokes. And I've
                      listened to these suits here, on who's
                      gonna take me in...
                          (beat)
                      I will die, go to hell and take all y'all
                      cocksuckers with me, if he--
                          (motions to Bud)
                      --tells me to.
                          (beat)
                      I want y'all to know that.

            Jesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a
            CHILL falls over the room.

<b>                                NOKES
</b>                          (to Bud)
                      How's that fly by you, Lieutenant?

            Bud simply nods.

<b>                                NOKES
</b>                      I'll sponsor him. Jesse's welfare will
                      come out of our budget. Anyone has
                      pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me.
                      I'll loan him out.

            Jesse stares at Nokes. As the meeting settles back to a
            comfortable level...

<b>                                NOKES
</b>                      And, Jesse... I'm a little pissed I'm
                      number two on that list. Who the fuck is
                      number one?

            The room erupts with LAUGHTER. Everyone except Bud and Jesse.

<b>                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            Jesse's truck moves over an old wooden bridge through
            sweeping fields that stretch to a vast, wooded area.

<b>            EXT. FRONT GATES, PRIVATE PROPERTY - DAY
</b>
            Jesse stops at a long drive protected by locked iron gates.

            A surveillance camera zooms in. Jesse looks up. A second
            camera pans on Jesse, staring...

            MOVE IN as crackling, electronic pixels FILL THE FRAME and... 

<b>                                                                 CUT TO:
</b>
<b>            INT. GUARD STATION - SAME
</b>
            A BANK OF MONITORS showing Jesse at the gates. A GUARD sits
            in shadow, hits a button: We see the gates unlock and open.

<b>            INT. JESSE'S TRUCK

            pulls down the private road.

            Shafts of light mottle then burst, REVEALING an elegant
<b>            VICTORIAN HOME. 
</b>
            Jesse parks -- walks up the porch, where Catfish is relaxing,
            shoulder holster, revolver. And Buzz, cleaning a pistol.

<b>                                BUZZ
</b>                      Jesse.

            Jesse nods, eyes Catfish.

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                      I'm here to see Lucian.

            Catfish grinds out his cigarette, gets to his feet.

<b>                                CATFISH
</b>                      He's busy right now; You can come in and
                      wait.

<b>            INT. LUCIAN ADAMS' OFFICE - DAY
</b>
<b>            CLOSE ON: A SNIFTER
</b>
            as Louis XIII pours to the rim. From elsewhere in the room:

<b>                                MALE VOICE
</b>                      This operation of your's has become big
                      business. You need relationships now more
                      than ever...

            THE VOICE belongs to RICHARD MORRIS, 40s. He sits in a
            leather chair, facing Lucian Adams, who's face we cannot see. 

            Seated next to Morris, is Daniel Kiersey.

<b>                                MORRIS
</b>                      ...We've done business successfully
                      before, Mr. Adams. But it's a larger
                      scope now. I'm here today because I want
                      to represent you exclusively. You need
                      someone lobbying at a state level, as
                      well as in Washington. My organization
                      can provide both. We've got contacts that
                      you don't have and other people can't
                      get. Now, I'm aware that you have
                      multiple businesses... However you need
                      one go-to guy, so that all your ventures
                      stay coordinated and all transactions and
                      contracts are realized. I am that person,
                      Mr. Adams. That's what I do.

            LUCIAN'S HAND lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks.

<b>                                KIERSEY

<b>                                MORRIS
</b>                      As a retainer, I want an advance of three
                      hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten
                      percent of whatever economic benefit I

<b>                                MORRIS
</b>                      If you want a quality global economic
                      plan, that's what you pay for--

                      what it's worth.

            Morris goes suddenly silent, looks across at Lucian.

<b>                                LUCIAN O.S.
</b>                      The advance is a drop in the bucket. The
                      real money is the percentage. It's in
                      your interest to see it my way.

            Morris stares across the desk, several tense moments. Then:

<b>                                MORRIS

<b>            INT. LIVING ROOM, LUCIAN ADAMS' HOUSE - DAY

            Morris emerges from the office. He glances at Jesse, then
            shrugs on his coat and leaves... 

            Jesse looks back at the office doorway. FOLLOW Jesse in...

<b>            INT. LUCIAN ADAM'S OFFICE
</b>
            ...past Kiersey, behind a massive desk in this impeccable
            room, we finally SEE LUCIAN ADAMS.

            Jesse is not invited to sit.

            Kiersey walks out and shuts the door... 

<b>            ON LUCIAN
</b>
            he crosses slowly to a credenza, selects a clean shirt.

<b>                                LUCIAN

            As he removes the shirt he's wearing, REVEAL tattoos: BLACK
            SUN on his back. GERMAN RUNES, SS BOLTS, HRUNGNIR'S HEART.
            And around his stomach, a belt of NORSE GODS with the words,
            "INVISIBLE EMPIRE." Prison tats, dark and aged.

            Lucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens
            cuff-links.

<b>                                LUCIAN

                          (pause)
                      I gave you that time... Then safe jobs

                      on a hunt for pig's feet. But they all
                      professional. Burn jobs. Hot-weld oxygen.
                      Laid out, burned, laid back, perfect.

                      I knew right then and there, only a white
                      respectable burglar could've done this.

            Jesse smiles slightly. They know each other well...

            ...When Lucian's smile suddenly drops. There's a flash of
            controlled anger across his face; and WE FEEL a curtain of
            tension fall heavily on the room.

                      Where's the tribute to the greater cause?

            Jesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch. Sets it on the
            desk...

            He pours the contents into Lucian's palm: DIAMONDS and
<b>            EMERALDS.

            Lucian approaches the desk, opens the pouch: DIAMONDS and
            EMERALDS... A slow smile spreads across his face.

<b>                                LUCIAN

            Jesse helps Lynn and the baby from his truck. Together, they

            Bud, watching from a distance, nods to Lynn.

            Jesse and Lynn stare at each other. She's crying as he pulls

            we cannot hear...

            Then with the baby, Lynn boards her plane. An AGENT shuts the

            Omar reaches for the bag of cash...

            BLAM! Catfish FIRES, point blank, shooting Omar in the face.

            And World War III erupts.

            AB's FIRE. Shiites RETURN FIRE. From several stakeout
            locations, ATF AGENTS deploy and OPEN FIRE.

            Jesse is grazed in the shoulder, slips, staggers-runs.

            SHIITE #1 FIRES THREE SHOT BURSTS at AB #1, who's blown
            apart. A generator and ATF #1 collapse.

            ATF #2 and #3 with pump shotguns OPEN UP on the AB's van.

            Naseem, over a Mercedes roof, FIRES A BURST at ATF, then
            swings onto AB #2 and FIRES, killing him. Naseem jumps into
            the Mercedes, yells at the DRIVER to go.

            Buzz RAPID FIRES, hits Shiite #1 in the back. Shiite #1 is
            spun around and Buzz shoots him in the head.

            Catfish FIRES into the lot... Hitting SHIITE #2.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver floors it. ATF re-emerges, kneels and
            PUMPS SHOTS into the Mercedes.

            Jesse has taken off, past the lumber storage. Catfish and
            Buzz follow, breaking for the Freight truck.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver is blown apart by ATF. The car
            CRASHES into a dumpster, knocking Naseem out.

            Jesse, Catfish and Buzz jump into the Freight. ATF FIRES.
            WINDOWS EXPLODE. SHIITE #3, trying to climb in is shot down.

            Jesse, behind the wheel... BURNS rubber pulling out of the
            stop, over and through a scaffold, collapsing it.

            The Freight truck draws everyone's FIRE. Jesse pilots it
            through the CHAOS. Scaffold DRAGGING behind. Sparks fly.

            JESSE'S POV: Where he's going. An opening in the
            construction, leads back to the HIGHWAY and ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

            ATF CARS speeds in, the opposite way...

<b>            AS THE VEHICLES PASS: JESSE AND ATF

            lock eyes. And the Freight makes the highway, scattering

            As Catfish exits the truck...

            ...Jesse takes Catfish's gun, grabs him by the neck and SLAMS

            Lucian is met by Kiersey. They walk together through glassed

            ON JESSE. Absorbing this. His face begins to tremble. Eyes

            Pouring rain.

            It's a madhouse outside. A crowd is gathered around a police
            action in progress. MEDICS are tending to the broken nose of
            a bartender (PETE) in his 30s. METRO COP #1 stands by. 

            A car pulls up and Cobb gets out with Marandino. They
            approach the bartender.

            The place is A MESS. Chairs broken, tables overturned. Music
            BLARES on the jukebox. And empty except Bud... three sheets
            to the wind, drunk. Pacing the ruins with his 9MM in hand...

            Bud spins, glass-eyed and red-faced. His wavering vision can
            barely make out Cobb and Marandino approaching...

            Two FBI AGENTS #4 and #5 walk together down this sterile

            A metal door rises up. Jesse, in silhouette, steps in.

            A BARE BULB comes to light. Mottled with fly excrement.

            Jesse unlocks and opens several SAMSONITE SUITCASES. Stacked
            in grey packing foam are rows and rows of GUNS.

            Jesse hefts his choices. Checking line and breach: A 12 Gauge
            Shotgun. A Colt .357 Magnum. A Remington sawed-off with
            pistol grip. Les Baer Tactical .45. Glock Semi-auto 9MM. Buck
            Knife. Duct tape. 5-Gallon gas cans. He loads up a gym bag.

            Jesse pulls scissors from a grooming kit and stands before a
            grimy mirror. He cuts off his hair. Then using clippers,
            shaves his scalp and mustache. 

            Jesse yanks a tarp off a '75 beat-up Chrysler. Pops the
            trunk. Throws in the gym bag. Then drives away.

            Long-Hair on the couch, watching tv, drinking liquor. SPEED
            METAL MUSIC blasts from a stereo somewhere.

            There's a METALLIC BANG O.S.

            Long-Hair looks up.

            The screen door rattles. Long-Hair grabs an aluminum bat,
            slowly approaching...

            the helpless Long-Hair writhing on the floor.

            Bandaged hand clamped to the collar. Shotgun at the neck.

            step... They turn another hallway... Light spills from under
            a door, shadows behind it... Jesse edges Long-Hair forward,

            As Long-Hair rounds the corner... Buzz looks up, SEES Jesse.
            Dives for a gun. CHROME FLASHES. Everything EXPLODES at once.   

            The WALL DETONATES and Buzz goes down. Shocked. Choking.
            Blood juts from his side. He tries to get up. Can't.

            The HOOKER SCREAMS and cowers terrified in the corner.

            Jesse pumps, aims through the haze and fires again. Stereo
            explodes. MUSIC CUTS OUT, plunging us into silence.

            Jesse tosses clothes to the Hooker.

            Two chairs. Buzz and Long-Hair back to back. Hands and feet
            tied. Blood spigoting. Jesse circles them with the shotgun.

            The boat rocks gently.

            In one motion, Jesse racks the shotgun, thrusts the barrel to
            Long-Hair's chin AND BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF.

            Buzz screams, REARS UP, chair collapses beneath him, DRAGGING
            a dead Long-Hair along the floor, still tied together.

<b>                                BUZZ

            As Buzz pleads for his life, Jesse unloads the shotgun, dead
            aim...FIRES.

            Jesse stands there, the heat reflects the intensity in his

            Needles. Rusted pliers. An electric tattoo drill.

<b>                                JESSE

            Without warning, Jesse grabs the PLIERS. A flash of movement,
            and there's a TERRIBLE SCREAM AS CATFISH'S FRONT TOOTH IS
            RIPPED OUT. He bucks violently in his chair.

            Jesse jams the DRILL into Catfish's gums, high speed. BLOOD
            SPRAYS. Loud, electric pain and Catfish CRIES OUT IN TERROR.

            Jesse sets down the drill, deadpan.

            Jesse TIGHTENS his grip. Vice-like. Blood fills Catfish's
            mouth. He gurgles, then SPITS in Jesse's face... 

            ...FLASHES OF STEEL and two more teeth rip out at the root.
            Catfish SCREAMS then passes out. Jesse slaps him awake.

<b>                                JESSE

            THE DRILL STRIKES. Bone deep. Gum line splays open. Teeth
            crack and split. Catfish SCREAMS UNCONTROLLABLY. Blacks out.

            Jesse stops. A brief reprieve. He gets up and looks around
            the apartment. SEES: Magazines. A few revolvers. Empty liquor
            bottles. Meth on the counter. And on the stove:  

            A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling.  

            Jesse stares. He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up,
            drawing fluid...

            ...then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip
            of the needle, pops a cc.  

            Catfish bolts awake, EYES WIDE. A long, wet WHEEZE.

            Remaining PATRONS SCREAM, drop under tables.  

            Doorman #1 KEEPS FIRING, advancing towards the Cafe, when--
            BOOM! A SHOTGUN BLAST takes his head off -- REVEALING BUD --
            behind him, running toward Tibedaux's.  

<b>            I/E. TIBEDAUX'S, DOWNSTAIRS
</b>
            PATRONS stampede for the door. Lucian, Bingham and Kay with
            AB #7 and #8 follow...

<b>            OUTSIDE TO THE STREET
</b>
            ...and Bud is coming right for them.

            CLOSE ON LUCIAN. The shock of seeing Bud. 

            Lucian FIRES.

            Bud kneels and PUMPS SHOTS - hits AB #7 and #8 - killing them.

            Lucian, Kay, Bingham flee back inside.

<b>            INT. TIBEDAUX'S, MAINTENANCE ROOM
</b>
            Jesse yanks off the cover of the main electric panel. He rips
            out incoming lines and FIRES into the lighting circuit. 

<b>                                                                 CUT TO:
</b>
<b>            VARIOUS ROOMS INSIDE TIBEDAUX'S
</b>
            Fluorescent units explode, plunging us into DARKNESS. Arcs
            SPUTTER and FLARE, the corridors now strobe-lit. 

<b>            EXT. TIBEDAUX'S - SAME
</b>
            Cobb runs out of the cafe, pushing through civilians. 

<b>                                COBB
</b>                      Down! Get down!

            Bud pursues Lucian...

<b>                                BUD
</b>                      Stay on the door! I'm goin' in!

<b>            INT. TIBEDAUX'S
</b>
            Bud enters-

            Split-second and DOORMAN #2 OPENS FIRE from the waiter's
            entrance.

            Bud drops and FIRES BACK. Doorman #2 goes down. Bud runs
            across overturned tables and up a STAIRWELL...

<b>            INT. DOWNSTAIRS, TIBEDAUX'S
</b>
            Jesse emerges. AB #9 steps out, FIRES. The bullet hits
            Jesse's vest, knocking him backwards.

            Jesse levels the sawed-off. FIRES. AB #9 falls in a heap.
            Jesse rises, keeps moving...

<b>            INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAYS, ROOMS - TIBEDAUX'S
</b>
            MOVING WITH BUD entering, KICKING down doors, sweeping rooms
            with his shotgun... No sign of Lucian.

<b>            INT. DOWNSTAIRS, BACK ROOMS
</b>
            Jesse is coming... 

            ...and the SLAUGHTER BUILDS. 

            He throws open a door to a BAR AREA.  

            AB #10 and #11 FIRE SMGs WILDLY, running from the room. Jesse
            UNLOADS the sawed-off. MISSING. Plaster throws and crumbles.

            A GUNSHOT rips through Jesse's left arm. The sawed-off drops
            to his side. Jesse turns - EDGAR BINGHAM is FIRING a SERVICE
            REVOLVER - SHOTS MISS as Jesse dives behind the bar.

            HAROLD KAY is moving down the stairwell. FIRING an Automatic
            wildly. Bottles and glasses explode.

            Bingham keeps firing. Mirrors SHATTER.

<b>            BEHIND THE BAR
</b>
            bullets splinter wood, Jesse slams another magazine into the
            .45. Above him, strays catch lights, glass filaments EXPLODE. 

<b>            INT. UPSTAIRS, HALLWAYS + ROOMS
</b>
            Bud KICKS down a door. AB #12 charges out. Grabs for Bud...
            who breaks the grab, pulls AB #12's neck down, slams his knee
            into his forehead twice, knocked cold. Grabs his gun.    

<b>            A HALLWAY DOOR SWINGS OPEN
</b>
            AB #13 emerges, HAMMERING GUNSHOTS. Bud covers. SHOTS BLOW
            HOLES in the wall.

<b>            A SECOND DOOR OPENS
</b>
            ...and AB #14 steps out, draws. Bud throws him in the way of
            CROSS-FIRE. AB #13 takes AB #14's SHOTS. 

            Bud aims past. FIRES ONCE.

            AB #14 is hit dead center and drops like an oak.

            Both men dead. That fast, and Bud is on the move... 

<b>            EXT. ALLEY, TIBEDAUX'S - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            AB #10 and #11 run out and swing their SMGs, FIRING onto the
            alley and KILLING MARANDINO... Then charging to the front--

            COBB FIRES. AB #10 is BLOWN APART, as AB #11 FIRES back,
            hitting Cobb in the vest. His ribs broken, he sits down
            stunned.

<b>                                COBB

                      I'm hit. I'm fuckin' hit.

            AB #11 running past as several BLACK AND WHITES now arrive.
            TAKE AND RETURN FIRE -- AB #11 is shot dead.

            Police shouting. Civilians running, as...

<b>            INT. BACK BAR AREA, DOWNSTAIRS
</b>
<b>            GUNFIGHT ENSUES. 
</b>
            Jesse rises over the bar, FIRING BURSTS into Kay, who tumbles
            down the stairwell like a rag doll. 

            Bingham shoots Jesse in the hip. He staggers, then falls and
            rolls to his back... 

            Bingham rounds the bar just as Jesse, somehow, lifts the .45
            and FIRES two slugs into Bingham's chest.

            Bingham collapses on top of Jesse. The .45 hits the floor.
            Both men, bleeding profusely, thrash along the floor...

<b>            INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
</b>
            Bud, racing toward a stairwell, LEAPS down a flight, turns,
            and RUNS down another. 

<b>            INT. BACK BAR AREA
</b>
            Jesse, trapped under the heavy Bingham, pulls the buck knife
            from his holster and sinks it into Bingham's kidney. TWISTS.
            Blood POOLS. Bingham MOANS...

            ...Jesse rolls the big man over, hoists himself high and
            impales Bingham through the throat. Dead.

            Jesse exhales, struggles up...rising to his feet...

<b>            BLAM! - A SUDDEN GUNSHOT
</b>
            out of nowhere. JESSE COLLAPSES, A BUNDLE OF TWITCHING
<b>            NERVES, BLOOD POOLING FAST OUT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD...
</b>
<b>            ...AND LUCIAN STANDS OVER HIM, HIS .357 SMOKING.
</b>
            Lucian turns slow. Toward a cracked MIRROR. Suddenly...

<b>            IN THE REFLECTION: BUD EXPLODES DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SLAMS
</b><b>            INTO LUCIAN WITH THE IMPACT OF A TRUCK. BOTH HIT THE FLOOR. 
</b>
            Lucian points his gun at Bud's head, who reaches for the
            trigger guard, shifts the barrel an inch -- A ROUND GOES OFF,
<b>            BLOWING THROUGH BUD'S SHOULDER -- HE YELLS OUT, HOOKS HIS
</b><b>            FINGER IN THE TRIGGER, STOPPING THE NEXT SHOT.
</b>
            Bud flips Lucian over, rips the gun away. Lucian tries to
            break free. Bud grabs him - smashes the gun over and over
            against Lucian's face.

            Lucian's head BOUNCES. Eyes roll, then right.

            Lucian quarter rolls, then CRACKS a forearm into Bud's head.
            Again, and Bud is knocked back with a gash over his eye. 

            Lucian REARS BACK and KICKS HARD into Bud's sternum.

            Lucian scrambles. Bud tackles him into a table, which goes
            down. A chair breaks. Bud lands a thunderous hook and
            Lucian's nose shatters. Another and his cheekbone caves.

            Lucian drops like a rock. Tries to crawl under another table.
            IN A MANIACAL RAGE, Bud flips the table and stomps down on
            Lucian with furious blows that come one after another.

            Lucian tries to cover up. BUD IS ALL OVER HIM. Grabs Lucian
            by the throat and presses down.

            Lucian, fighting to breathe, digs his nails into Bud's face,
            tearing skin. 

            Bud's face twists with hate as he chokes the life out of him.

            Lucian's eyes BULGE...His mouth stretches WIDE...clutching at
            Bud's fingers, trying to pull away...

            Bud SNORTS, tightens his grip... bearing down... And at the
            last moment, the cop in him reemerges...

            Bud lets go.

            Lucian rolls to his side and coughs up a thick ribbon of
            blood and vomit. Bud slams on restraints.

            Bud staggers to his feet...breathing hard...Spots Jesse on
            the floor...And he slows...

            Jesse lies in shadow. Perfectly still. We cannot see his face.
            Only the dark pool of blood around him.

            Lucian passes out.

<b>                                BUD

                      I got him... I got Lucian.

<b>            SLOWLY PULL AWAY AND TRACK OVER THE MASSACRE...
</b>
            ...as POLICE come in...over bodies and blood and guns, and up
            the stairs and out a broken window, to the CROWDS in the
            street held back by POLICE, past flashing lights and
            emergency vehicles... 

            ...to where life goes on in New Orleans.

            The sun is out. The sky above is clear.

<b>            INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY
</b>
            ON BUD, as he leads Lucian through the bowels of city lock-up. 

            Lucian - in prison garbs, haggard, dark bruises - looks up as
            they pass a two-way mirror of an INTERROGATION ROOM, SEES...

<b>            KIERSEY
</b>
            ...seated, making statements to Shepard, who is taking notes.
            Stacks of Jesse's reports surround them.

            Bud walks Lucian past, into...

<b>            INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2
</b>
            ...and Lucian sits at a table. Bud across from him. Silence
            hangs, several moments. 

<b>            ON BUD                                                             
</b>
            starting again, knowing... There's something bigger. A slow
            smile spreads...

<b>                                BUD
