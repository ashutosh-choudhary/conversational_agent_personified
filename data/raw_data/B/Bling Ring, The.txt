<b>1   EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS MANSION - NIGHT                             1
</b>
    A Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards
    us, down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills.

    One of them, a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat
    suit stumbles.

<b>                        DRUNK GIRL (NICKI)
</b>                        (laughing)
              Shit.

<b>                        GIRL 1 (REBECCA)
</b>              C'mon. Hurry up.

    They come to a gated home. A girl that seems to be the
    leader, leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the
    bottom of the chain link fence.

    She rolls under, and the others follow.

    A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in
    unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house.

    They've done this before, they have it down.

    One checks under the mat of the front door, we follow them as
    they go around to the back, checking doors, and find a back
    window open.

    A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up, we see her bright underwear as
    she climbs inside into a laundry room.

    She runs around to open a side door for the rest, and they
    slip inside.
    Once inside, we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area.
    She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader, who is
    totally cool and composed.

    She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye-
    brow.

<b>                        REBECCA
</b>              Let's go shopping!

    And she pulls open the closet door.

    CLOSE UP: grabbing Louis Vuitton bags.

    A drawer opens with a few Rolexes, that are scooped in to a
    Louis Vuitton duffle bag.

     An underwear drawer is opened, and picked through.

     A medicine cabinet is opened, a hand grabs bottles of
     prescription pills and dumps them in a bag.

     We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags.

     Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a
     mirror posing, then gets back to it.

     Vuitton bags and other loot, as much as they can carry.

     CLOSE UP: flashbulbs go off.

     Titles intercut with montage of Mug shots of attractive
     teenagers and news clips.

     We see a clip of black &amp; white video surveillance of the
     kids' approach to the house walking backwards with hoods up.
     Pan across a row of Louboutin platform heels.

     We see the glittery view of Hollywood at night.

     CLOSE UP: a Facebook page of a party photo of Rebecca in the
     hat we saw her try on earlier.

     Pan across a pile of quilted Chanel bags.

     T.V. image of a starlet on the red carpet posing for
     pictures.

     CLOSE UP: on a stack of shiny diamond necklaces.

     Nicki and Sam, also pretty, slutty and 17, are waking up in a
     messy teenage bedroom.

     Clothes are all over the floor, a knot of duvet covers part
     of a girl, with legs sticking out, we can see a lotus blossom
     tattoo.

    She rolls her eyes.

</b>              Oh my lord, you were so out of

    Laurie, Nicki's mom, pretty ex-playboy model in her 40's in
    Juicy sweatpants and a tank top, gets breakfast ready.

    She opens a cabinet as she calls up to them. A little Yorkie
    nips at her heels.

</b>              Mom, they got home so late last

    Laurie with wide eyes and a forced calm voice answers her.

</b>              That's none of your concern, I'll

    She calls up to them again.

              I have the ability to reach my aim
              in life, by persistent action and
              that the thoughts of my mind will
              reproduce themselves in outward
              physical reality.
              I will channel my energy towards my
              aim in life with graciousness and
              loving kindness to myself and

     Marc opens a drawer and finds diamond encrusted gun lighter.

     He leans over and lights Rebecca's cigarette.

     She smokes and they look through her stuff. The dog sits next
     to her.

     Rebecca stands in the doorway of the bathroom that opens on
     to a dressing area.

     She looks through drawers, takes a make-up bag, and looks
     through the medicine cabinet.

     She finds a necklace on the counter - a gold chain, with an
     `R'. She puts it around her neck and clasps it as she looks
     at herself in the mirror.

     At a dressing table, Rebecca sprays herself with Lindsay's
     perfume - slight slow motion as she sprays her neck while
     looking at herself in the mirror, lit by the vanity table

     sprays the perfume and watches herself in the mirror.

                 thing.
