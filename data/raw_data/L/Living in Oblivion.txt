               A battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod 
               surrounded by blackness. Opening credits begin. An almost 
               imperceptible DOLLY in toward the movie camera. The dolly 
               forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME 
               CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, 
               glass full moon. Fade to BLACK.

               Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping 
               the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White.

<b>               EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT
</b>
               A quiet, deserted industrial street. It is over an hour before 
               dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness 
               of night.

               In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT 
               and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out 
               breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete 
               silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie-
               talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters 
               and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a 
               mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered 
               donuts.

                              (pause)
                         There's a deli on Broadway.

</b>                              (sniffs the milk)
                         Is it that bad?

<b>                                     CYBIL
</b>                         I don't know. You're the one who 
                         said it was bad.

               At that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and 
               shudders to a stop in front of the building. Bert replaces 
               the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice.

               Amid low, one-word greetings, the CREW tumbles out of the 
               trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the Craft Service 
               table. WOLF -- the Cameraman, assumes a place of prominence. 
               He wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black 
               leather half-fingered gloves.

</b>
               NICOLE sits quietly in the back seat of a beat-up station 
               wagon. She glances out at the empty city moving past her 
               window and lets out a deep sigh.

               JEFF, the young intern assigned as her driver, glances into 
               the rearview mirror.

                         got a big scene today and I'm kind 
                         of nervous.

                         tell my mother I never felt she really 
                         loved me.

               CU sidewalk. A pair of women's orthopedic shoes enter the 
               frame and begin pacing.

               Camera pans up to reveal CORA, a small woman in her early 
               60s, pacing beneath the awning of her residential hotel. She 
               appears to be rehearsing dialogue with herself.

                         memory of this whatsoever.

               Jeff pulls the car up to the curb and Cora gets into the 
               back seat.

               Cora immediately lights a cigarette. Nicole instinctively 
               wrinkles her nose and turns away. Cora notices this and makes 
               an exaggerated effort to keep the smoke away from Nicole by 
               blowing it hard out the side of her mouth. Jeff glances back 
               at the two women in the rearview mirror. No one speaks.

               holding coffee cups. The Gaffer can be seen in the background 
               fumbling with a light.

               Screen is still white. Gradually it shifts back to proper 
               exposure revealing NICOLE in Medium CU. Her eyes are riveting; 
               it is obvious she is emotionally primed for the scene. A 
               light meter is thrust in front of her face. She barely 
               registers it.

               WS, the entire Living Room set. Nicole sits on a sofa facing

               A table lamp and assorted framed photographs complete the

               Nick moves behind the camera and looks through the eyepiece. 
               Another CU of Nicole fills the frame. The image is visually 
               and emotionally breathtaking.

               From the moment Nick calls "action" the film will cut directly 
               to the shot the set camera is filming. The shot is fluid, 
               graceful and in richly, beautiful COLOR. Nicole's performance 
               is very strong; flawed only slightly by her nervousness.

               Nicole turns to Cora with the heartbreaking gaze of an

               Nick looks for Nicole but sees only Cora standing by the 
               couch. Les has both arms up the back of her dress, running 
               the wire to her radio mike. She's wearing stockings rolled

               Nicole gets up quietly and sits next to Cora on the couch, 
               wordlessly taking her hand in hers.

                         Cora, don't even think that. You're 
                         doing great. I'm the one who's fucking 
                         it up. If I get through this I swear 
                         I'm never acting again.

               She means it. Cora glances up at her, seeing for the first 
               time how pain and defeat have drawn the life from Nicole's 
               face. On an impulse Cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand 
               of Nicole's hair from her eyes.

               A sudden amazed alarm fills Nicole. The living room grows 
               strangely quiet.

               the open door of the hospital room.

               CU Nicole, seated on the edge of the hospital bed. Still 
               confused, she looks down at the old woman lying in the bed. 
               The woman's face is pale and drawn. As Nicole leans closer 
               her mother reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair 
               away from her face. The gesture is one of love, acceptance, 
               and farewell. It is identical to the one we have just seen 
               Cora make to her.

               WS, the Living Room Set. Nick, Wanda, the rest of the crew 
               standing quietly. Nicole glances over at Cora and instantly 
               something unspoken and unexplained passes between them. The 
               run-through begins.

               From the moment Nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there 
               has been a remarkable change in her. Every word now has the 
               stunning clarity of truth. Cora is completely engulfed in 
               the moment.

                         crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
                         me alone. He went over and started 
                         hitting Danny.

               As Nicole continues, one by one the crew turn and watch this 
               exquisite moment happening before them. Nick's face is lit 
               with rapture.

               He glances over and to his horror sees that no one is behind 
               the camera. He whispers frantically to the AC.

               agony.

                         worried about me?

               There is a heavy, stunned silence as the scene ends. Nicole 
               and Cora are in each other's arms. Pam and Cybil share a 
               piece of tissue. CUT TO: an extreme CU of Nick.

               In the cramped confines of the dingy basement bathroom, Wolf 
               pukes violently into the toilet. His face is pale and slick 
               with perspiration. His eyes look upward toward the sound of 
               Nick yelling.

               Wolf tries to continue but another spasm of nausea wrenches 
               him back toward the toilet bowl.

<b>               INT. SET APT. THE COUCH. DAY. B/W

               The set is quiet, subdued. Nick sits on the couch with Nicole 
               and Cora. Wolf sits groggily behind the camera wiping the 
               sweat from his face. Wanda addresses the crew.

                         be bad.

               Nick speaks uneasily to Nicole and Cora. He is a wreck and 
               his insistent smile of encouragement looks absolutely 
               demented.

                         for time. It'll just be a CU of Ellen 
                         for the last part of the scene,

                         cut this into the fourth take. We 
                         almost had it. That was unbelievable, 
                         both of you. But let's not think 
                         about it. That moment is gone, and...

               And so on, until all watches have been checked with negative 
               results. The beeping continues, growing louder and louder.

               Suddenly Nick loses it. He starts running around the set, 
               ripping things apart, knocking over tables, lamps, chairs. 
               He shoves Cora off the couch and whips off the cushions, 
               heaving them against the wall with a startling violence.

               Everyone watches Nick demolish the set in stunned, open-
               mouthed amazement. Nick turns to the crew in rage.

               WS, the entire room. Nick's last word echoes throughout the

               QUICK CUT TO extreme CU Nick's face, just as his eyes open. 
               The film is in COLOR now. The room is in heavy darkness except 
               for the light on Nick's face. Nick reaches over and shuts 
               off his clock radio. The digital dial shows 4:00 A.M. The 
               beeping finally stops.

               Nick turns on a light and sits up in bed, drenched in sweat 
               and still breathing heavily.

                              of relief)

               The camera DOLLIES swiftly back away from Nick. He stares at 
               it in stunned amazement. Just then a DOOR closes right into 
               the lens turning the frame into complete BLACKNESS.

               Out of the BLACKNESS a door opens away from the camera 
               revealing WANDA looking into her closet (the camera is inside 
               the closet). From this point on, the rest of the film is in

                         gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a 
                         hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick.

               The three men sit in silence. WS, showing the car parked

<b>               INT. THE SET. MORNING
</b>
               A small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the 
               middle of the huge empty space. One wall has a fake window. 
               The GAFFER lies on the bed staring absently at the AC sitting 
               motionless beside the camera a few feet away. Neither speaks 
               for a long moment.

               The Gaffer tugs a thin, tattered SCRIPT, folded lengthwise, 
               out of his back pocket.

                         somewhere.

               Suddenly the Gaffer reaches out and warmly shakes the AC's 
               hand.

               Nicole sits before the makeup mirror. LORDE, the male Makeup

               it under Nicole's eyes just as Nick walks up.

               Something in Nick's voice makes Nicole glance up at him. He 
               looks away quickly. The moment is awkward, as if they both 
               realize he has inadvertently revealed something. Just then 
               Palomino approaches.

<b>                                     PALOMINO

               Lorde reenters as Nick leaves. Palomino sits in the chair 
               beside Nicole and Lorde immediately begins his makeup. No 
               one speaks.

               Instantly the film cuts from color to B/W. Chad and Nicole 
               begin their Love Scene.

                         professional.

               The camera starts to dolly, however Chad does not move. He 
               goes out of frame forcing Wolf to pan abruptly to Nicole.

               Wolf doesn't answer, though he stands a mere foot away, 
               watching the Gaffer set up a light.

               Palomino saunters over and sprawls on the bed, forcing Nicole 
               to turn her head completely away from the camera.

               Nicole remains seated on the bed, lowering her head and 
               closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion 
               for the scene. Everyone watches her in complete silence.

<b>               INT. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY
</b>
               Palomino tiptoes over to the camera where Wanda and the 
               Scriptgirl are standing side by side. As he leans between 
               them, checking his lines on the Scriptgirl's script, he 
               inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh.

                         Someone over here smells very, very 
                         nice.

               Thinking he means her, Wanda's lips flutter in a brief, 
               involuntary smile. Meanwhile, the Scriptgirl turns away, 
               blushing furiously.

<b>               INT. THE SET. DAY

               Palomino tiptoes again back to his spot. Nicole raises her 
               head and nods once to Nick. She seems to have aroused some 
               real emotion in herself.

               Several members of the crew loiter around the table. The 
               Scriptgirl approaches carrying a donut in one hand and a cup 
               of coffee in the other. Palomino notices her and moves quietly 
               to her side. Without a word he picks up the milk and pours 
               some in her coffee. Nicole stands nearby and watches the 
               following exchange.

</b>                         Uh, yeah.

</b>                         Lower it about three feet.

               Palomino hands the Gaffer back his script and walks off. The 
               Gaffer and AC stand in silence for a long awkward moment.

               Nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror. Leaning 
               closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair 
               falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself.

                         tonight? Hey, Nicole, what do you 
                         say you and I have a drink tonight?

               Suddenly the door opens behind him and Nicole walks in.

               The two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment. Nick looks 
               like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out.

               Nick hesitates, again gathering his nerves to pop the 
               question.

               Nick suddenly runs up just as Wolf and Wanda are on the verge 
               of blows.

                         Ellen in the background.

               Nick suddenly sees Palomino is wearing a black eyepatch.

                         don't want anyone wearing it. It's 
                         insanitary.

               Palomino removes the eyepatch and tosses it back to Wolf.

                         fucking pay for it myself.

               Nick pulls Palomino aside and whispers to him confidentially.

                         this in front of Wolf but it makes 
                         you look a little... gay.

               Palomino sneaks a glance back at Wolf then whispers to Nick.

               The scene begins again. Palomino milks his Close-up for all 
               it's worth.

                         professional.

                         sound?

               Right on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed. As the camera 
               moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with 
               extreme care and concentration.

                         want anything to interfere -- God!

               Under the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, Nicole 
               suddenly jerks her head away hard. Palomino jumps up and 
               begins pacing at the rear of the set.

               Palomino suddenly stops pacing and addresses Nick with a 
               curtness that is a little startling.

               Palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head 
               indicating his wish for Nick to follow him.

               The Sound man gives Nicole his headphones and rewinds the 
               tape recorder for her. The first several lines of the last 
               take are heard through the headphones.

               Nick follows Palomino behind the set, stopping just beside 
               the fake set window. Palomino whirls on Nick and whispers 
               fiercely.

                         tell you: she cannot act worth a 
                         shit! I'm giving her everything! The 
                         whole thing I just did with the hair; 
                         did you see that? I came up with 
                         that on my own because I thought it 
                         would help her. But no, she's giving

               Nicole listens to the last line of the previous take.

<b>                                     PALOMINO
</b>                         God, and all this time I thought...
                              (the muted rustle of 
                              the kiss)

               The Sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take, 
               sets the machine in standby mode, and picks up his crossword 
               puzzle. Nicole is just about to take off the headphones when 
               she realizes she can hear Nick and Palomino talking quite 
               clearly. Glancing up, she sees the Boom man has left his 
               boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the 
               open set window.

</b>                         Why did you cast her? She sucked in 
                         that Richard Gere movie!

</b>                         You're right. She is not the best 
                         actress in the world. I see that now 
                         but you've got to help me, Chad. I'm 
                         asking you to please help me here. 
                         We've got to get through this somehow.

               The camera begins a slow DOLLY in to Nicole's astonished 
               face. This will be intercut with a similar DOLLY in to the 
               microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an ECU of the 
               mike.

               Camera is close on Nick and Palomino.

</b>                         I'll tell you what this is about, 
                         man. You know why she took a cab 
                         this morning?

</b>                         No. She was in my hotel room and she 
                         didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm 
                         sorry it had to come out like this 
                         but I told her this morning "thanks 
                         a lot, it was a lot of fun last night 
                         but let's get something straight -- 
                         it was just a one-time deal," and 
                         she didn't want to hear that. She 
                         wanted more, you see what I'm saying? 
                         It's rejection.

               The camera reveals Nicole now seated in her spot on the bed. 
               She rises as Nick and Palomino reappear and approach her 
               from behind the set.

</b>                         Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't 
                         working. I apologize. Chad, I 
                         apologize to you too. I'm completely 
                         unfocused here and I think you're 
                         absolutely right; what we need to do 
                         is loosen the scene up somehow.

               Nick and Palomino stare at Nicole for a moment.

</b>                         I was wondering if we could try 
                         improvising the scene. More along 
                         the lines of what Chad has been doing. 
                         Maybe that would help me find 
                         something.

               Nick's smile of gratitude to Nicole looks almost drug-induced.

               Although Wolf says this quite loud, Palomino doesn't hear 
               him because he suddenly yells:

               Nicole stays seated, though Palomino moves around making a 
               great show of loosening up.

<b>                                     NICOLE

                         incredible. But that sounds kind of 
                         professional doesn't it? Admired?

</b>                         Great!
                              (laughs)
                         What's it mean?

                         It's sort of like I think you're a 
                         piece of shit.

               Palomino is somewhat startled by this. He looks to Nick in 
               confusion. Nick silently encourages him to keep going.

                         That sounds like the champagne

                         a piece of shit.

                         say.

                         tell everyone what you just told 
                         Nick behind the set.

                         isn't working is because you and I

                         everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad

               Nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement.

                         to come wiggle on the bed anymore, 
                         or stroke my hair real soft and

                         opera acting piece of shit!

               Palomino snaps, and lunges for Nicole. She leaps to the other 
               side of the bed.

               Palomino suddenly punches Nick in the stomach, leaving him 
               bent over and gasping for breath. Nicole instantly leaps on 
               Palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of 
               his head. Palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as 
               Wanda rushes forward.

                         Stop this right now!

               As she tries to separate Nicole and Palomino, Palomino shoves 
               her hard, knocking her down. Instantly Wolf leaps off the 
               camera and runs up to Palomino.

</b>                         Alright, you've asked for it, Chad!

               Palomino suddenly punches Wolf in the teeth, dropping him 
               like a stone.

                         Wolf!

               Suddenly Nick staggers to his feet and rushes at Palomino. 
               His momentum knocks all three backwards onto the bed, 
               Palomino's head cracking Nicole in the teeth.

</b>                         Oh, God!

               Nicole rolls free as Nick and Palomino wrestle on the bed. 
               Nick gets Palomino in a vicious headlock and starts pounding 
               his head against the mattress.

                         scumbags like you!

               As Nick continues to pound Palomino's head the Gaffer notices 
               Palomino's eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of 
               Nick's forearm around his neck. He and the Boom man rush 
               forward and finally manage to pry Palomino free.

                         him back to his hotel!

               As the Gaffer and Boom man drag off the almost unconscious 
               Palomino, the Scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him.

               Suddenly, everything becomes quiet except for Nick's labored 
               breathing and the Scriptgirl's sniffles. Nick leans over and 
               touches Nicole's shoulder.

               The Gaffer and AC help the still-groggy Palomino into the 
               back of the production van. JEFF, the driver, watches them 
               in sleepy curiosity.

               With Palomino safely propped in a seat, the AC goes back to 
               the set. The Gaffer waits a moment then slips his script out 
               of his back pocket and slaps it into Palomino's motionless 
               hand.

                         with you, man.

               As Palomino stares at him blankly, the Gaffer slams the door. 
               The car pulls out.

               Nick and Nicole move into a shy, trembling, heartfelt kiss.

<b>               INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN

               Nicole snaps awake with a jolt. She glances quickly at the 
               clock which reads 4:35. The sound of the shower still running 
               in the bathroom.

</b>                         Oh, God.

               Nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom. As the 
               camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right 
               against the lens, turning the image to total BLACKNESS.

               The frame is BLACK. The recognizable clatter and clunk of 
               the FILM CREW is heard. Wanda's voice is prominent.

</b>                         Don't go out that door!

               Suddenly a DOOR opens away from camera and the AC stops, a 
               foot away from the lens. Behind him, Wanda and the rest of 
               the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming. 
               We see now the door and the plywood walls around it are FAKE.

               slowly through the fake door toward Wanda pacing near the 
               set camera.

               The AC bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and 
               walks quickly toward the camera. Without knocking he pushes 
               open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short.

               Standing on his tiptoes at the sink, straining to turn off 
               the running faucet is, TITO a DWARF. He is dressed in a sky 
               blue tuxedo with tails. A top hat and white gloves rest on 
               the closed toilet seat. Tito appears extremely annoyed.

               A dented, ancient smoke machine squats forlornly in the middle

               Nicole stands motionless in the middle of the empty set. Her 
               white wedding gown stands out sharply against the deep red 
               walls. A sad shred of smoke drifts by her head.

               Tito opens the door and walks in, staring hard at Nicole. 
               His sky-blue tuxedo gleams in the rich light. He walks around 
               her in a circle holding the golden apple just beyond her 
               reach. He stops on his mark and the camera dollies into a CU 
               of him. He doesn't laugh. Nick watches this for a moment in 
               intense concentration.

               is to stare back at him sadly.

               Nicole stands motionless in her white wedding dress, looking 
               genuinely alarmed, possibly because of the huge clouds of 
               smoke now spewing out of the panting smoke machine.

               Tito enters, stares at her hard and walks around her in a 
               circle holding the apple just beyond her reach. The smoke is 
               so thick both of them are barely visible. Just as Tito gets 
               to his mark the smoke machine backfires with a tremendous 
               explosion and begins filling the room with dense, blinding 
               smoke.

<b>               INT. THE SET. DAY

               The smoke blanks out the entire frame. Frantic shouts are 
               heard from unseen bodies.

               The smoke machine emits a loud hiss and dies, filling the 
               room with sudden silence. Slowly the smoke begins to clear 
               as the crew moves around muttering and coughing.

               A pair of fuzzy-slippered feet enter the smoky frame. The 
               camera BOOMS up, passing over a woman's bare shins, a 
               flowered, blue silk housecoat until finally coming to rest 
               on the pleasantly smiling face of CORA. This is the same 
               woman who played Ellen's Mother in Part One; she is dressed 
               exactly the same as she was in their scene. The camera pulls 
               back to reveal JEFF the Intern standing nervously beside her 
               with a red notebook in his hands.

               Wanda speaks urgently into the phone while Nicole stands 
               beside her. Jeff (still wearing his hat) waits at a distance 
               clutching Nick's red notebook.

                         a real fucking problem.

                         notebook. She said she was looking 
                         for him so I figured I should just

                         pretty in that dress.

               There is a subtle tension smoldering between her and Nick.

                         feel that you really want it. I mean, 
                         Christ, how many times do I have to 
                         tell you!

               Nicole glares at Nick for a moment then abruptly turns and 
               walks off the set. Nick stares after her in confusion then 
               quickly follows her.

               Tito walks in, stares at her hard, then walks around her 
               once with the golden apple just beyond her outstretched hands. 
               He stops and the camera dollies into his CLOSE-UP. Nick 
               watches in hopeful expectation. He waits and waits but Tito 
               does not laugh.

               Just then the door in the rear set wall opens and Cora steps 
               in, looking oddly puzzled.

               Wolf (still wearing his eyepatch) walks over and sits quietly 
               in a chair beside Cora. He does not speak to her and gazes 
               blankly out at Nick, Tito, and Nicole on the set some distance 
               away. Cora however stares at the side of his head with such 
               intensity Wolf can't help but turn to her.

               Cora still doesn't take her eyes off him and in fact stares 
               even more intently into his eye.

               Wolf glances away for a moment then looks back. Cora continues 
               to stare at him. Suddenly, his eye is full of tears. Cora 
               watches in rapt silence. Wolf is crying openly now. Cora 
               reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently 
               lifts the eyepatch off of his eye. A tight smile of 
               satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is 
               released, streaming quickly down Wolf's cheek. No one sees 
               this.

               Tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks 
               out. Everyone stares at Nick who is frozen in stunned silence. 
               Finally Wanda approaches him hesitantly.

               Nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence. 
               Wolf appears behind him, still wiping his eyes.

                         anymore. I tried to roll with it but 
                         it's time to face the music; I can't 
                         do this. I am not a director. The 
                         shoot is over. I give up.

               Nick's speech has the simple eloquence of truth; he is not 
               bitter or self-pitying. He seems unaware of how disturbing 
               this is to the crew. They all stand around him in shock, 
               afraid to move or speak. Finally Wolf turns to the AC and 
               puts his hand on his shoulder, like a father to his young 
               son.

               Everyone watches the AC unfasten the camera in silence. Nicole 
               stands alone on the set in her wedding dress, still holding 
               the golden apple. Her face is frozen in dismay. Suddenly 
               CORA comes through the set door and marches up to Nicole.

               At the sound of his mother's voice, Nick looks up. He sees 
               her snatch the apple from Nicole's hand and march back out 
               the door, closing it behind her.

               Wolf grabs the camera and puts it on his shoulder (hand-held) 
               as the rest of the crew moves quickly and silently into 
               position. On a terse signal from Nick the camera starts 
               rolling.

               Nicole takes the silent "action" cue from Nick.

               Right on cue Cora walks through the door, holding the golden 
               apple out in front of her. She circles Nicole with 
               determination, seemingly oblivious to Nick and the rest of 
               the crew hovering behind Wolf as he begins following her 
               with the hand-held camera. Wolf is now in his element; gliding 
               like Nureyev with the camera. When he pans suddenly with 
               Cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of camera 
               range.

               Cora finally stops circling Nicole and stops abruptly. 
               Suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of Nicole. 
               Wolf glides forward with the camera, framing an amazing CU 
               of the apple with Nicole seen behind it. Nicole reaches out, 
               grabs the apple and takes a huge, resounding bite out of it.

               CU Nick's face, eyes wide in anxious delight.

               Cora takes one step forward. CU her fuzzy slippers stopping 
               right on the yellow tape mark. Cora waits momentarily until 
               Wolf has reframed both her and Nicole, then lets out a huge 
               laugh.

               Wolf slaps the AC's palm, then the Gaffer's standing right 
               beside him. He turns gleefully to the next person but seeing 
               it is Wanda he rigidly turns away.

               Nick runs up to his mother and throws his arms around her. 
               Nicole stands beside him.

               Suddenly, on an impulse surprising both of them, Nick and 
               Nicole embrace. Just then Wanda steps up.

               The set grows suddenly quiet as Nick begins pacing rapidly,

               Nick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him;

               still eating the apple, Wanda, the crew.

               At that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a

               Jeff, the Driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be

               The camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew. 
               Everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues. 
               As the silence continues the mood on the set gradually 
               changes. One by one people drift into their own private worlds 
               of reflection.

               MS the Sound man, alternately watching his recorder and his 
               stopwatch. Behind him the Boom man holds the mike in position 
               to record general ambiance while staring off into the 
               distance.

               CU the tape recorder spinning in quiet precision.

               CU the stopwatch, its giant second hand showing five seconds 
               have passed.

               MS Nick standing next to his mother who drapes one arm 
               casually over Nick's shoulder. Nick glances up and sees Nicole 
               beside him, absorbed in her own thoughts. Suddenly she looks 
               up and her eyes meet Nick's. She slips him the barest hint 
               of a smile.

               The camera DOLLIES slowly through the standing, silent group, 
               passing over faces in different degrees of thought.

               CU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing 
               ten seconds have passed.

               MS Nick. He is so immersed in thought he looks at no one. 
               The camera slowly DOLLIES into a CU of him.

<b>               INT. AN AWARDS CEREMONY

               Amid thunderous applause Nick bounds on the stage and accepts 
               an Oscar from Chad. He stands grinning like an idiot as the 
               applause continues.

               the same idiotic smile. MS Nicole. The camera DOLLIES slowly 
               into her face, now tinged with a slight uneasiness.

               Wolf stands like Thor in the middle of the Red Set, his arms 
               crossed over his chest, his jaw set in determination. Smoke 
               billows around him. At his feet, dressed in Nicole's wedding 
               gown, Wanda sobs hysterically.

                         love you! I love you, Wolf!

               Wolf remains unmoved for a long moment. Finally he reaches 
               out with a forgiving smile and pats Wanda's head.

               DOLLIES into a CU of him.

               placed in a toasted bun on a gleaming white oval plate. A

               to the lunch counter. Camera PANS to reveal the GAFFER sitting 
               on the stool. He picks up the hamburger and takes a huge

               Suddenly she begins striding toward it. Effortlessly, easily,

               finishes the last word of his speech in a choked whisper and 
               the Sound man frowns hard at him.

               CU the Sound man's stopwatch showing twenty-five seconds 
               have passed. The camera stays on the watch until the final 
               five seconds have elapsed.

               The room erupts with activity. Everyone moves and talks at 
               once. Nick whispers something to Nicole then runs off.
