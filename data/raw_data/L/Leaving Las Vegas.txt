</b><b>	TITLE ON BLACK; '10 P.M. - LOS ANGELES'
</b><b>	
</b><b>	DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	1 INT. SMART BAR IN BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b><b>		
</b>	It is the kind of bar where the well-to-do folks of LA go 
	to pick up - or be picked up. Lesser-known actors, agents 
	and executives of all ages.
<b>	
</b>	Into this bar comes Ben.
<b>	
</b>	Ben is in his thirties. He is wearing an Armani suit 
	that could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. He hasn't 
	shaved in the last twenty-four hours (but neither has 
	any of the actors in the bar). He is a good-looking man 
	but is clearly in trouble of some kind. Although still 
	in control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the 
	following scene that he is much the worse for wear with 
	drink. He looks around the room until he sees someone he
	recognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples
	are seated. The men are young execs, the girls, both blonde 
	and busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time. 
	The camera follows Ben over to the table. One of the execs
	looks up as Ben gets close. He recognizes him but delays 
	his recognition until the last moment in the hope that Ben 
	is not looking at him.
<b>	 
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Peter
<b>		
</b><b>				PETER
</b>		Ben... how are you, man?
<b>	
</b>	They shake hands. Ben is not invited to take a seat and 
	Peter waits for a while before being forced to introduce him 
	to the table.
<b>	
</b>	Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum, Sheila, Debbie.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>				MARC
</b>		Nice to meet you. I think I 	
		spoke to you on the phone a 	
		couple of years ago. Weren't 	
		you both at MGM with Laddie?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		That's right. Are you still
		at ICM?
<b>	
</b><b>				MARC
</b>		No, I'm at Tri-Star now.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		That's great. Say hello to 	
		Mike for me. That's a 	
		beautiful dress, Debbie, and 	
		those are fabulous earrings, 	
		Sheila.
<b>	
</b>	There is an awkward silence. Ben does not make a move and 
	is not invited to join them. The girls smile.
<b>	 
</b><b>				MARC
</b>		I gotta tell you, I'm a big 	
		fan of your writing. I loved 	
		Bay of Pigs.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Thanks a lot. I didn't 	
		actually write it, I just got 
		the credit. I was fired.
			(to Peter)
		Can I talk to you for a 	
		moment?
<b>	
</b>	Peter gets up and he and Ben walk to the door together. 
	Peter speaks very quietly.
<b>	
</b><b>				PETER
</b>		Listen, Ben, I can't help you 
		any more. Do you understand?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			This is the last time. 	
		Promise. I just need some 	
		cash tonight. I lost my 	
		credit cards. The money'll be 
		on your desk first thing 	
		tomorrow morning, Scout's 	
		honor. How's the new one 	
		coming along? I here you got 	
		Richard Gere.
<b>	
</b>	The two men look at each other for a while. Peter's 
	friends are looking at them, as are other people in 
	the room. Peter takes out his wallet and extracts some 
	notes.
<b>	
</b><b>				PETER
</b>		This is all I have in cash. 	
		Please don't drink it here.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Yes, that's fine. I'll	
		messenger it over to you 	
		tomorrow.
<b>	
</b><b>				PETER
</b>		I don't want it. Ben... I
		think it would be best if you 
		didn't contact me again.
<b>	
</b>	And he turns and walks away, back to his table.

</b><b>	TITLE ON BLACK; 'LAS VEGAS - 1.20 A.M.'
</b><b>	
</b><b>	FADE UP ON:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	2 EXT. HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Las Vegas. A blaze of color in the middle of a desert.
<b>	
</b>	Credit sequence begins.
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	3 INT. LOBBY OF EXPENSIVE HOTEL - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	A mixture of businessmen and gamblers creates a sense 
	of activity and superficial excitement. Music wafts 
	across the soundtrack, almost drowned by the dense 
	texture of thousands of slot machines, creating an 
	insane New Age symphony.
<b>	
</b>	Credit sequence ends.
<b>		
</b>	Into the lobby from the street comes Sera.
<b>	
</b>	It's hard to tell how old Sera is - somewhere between 
	twenty-five and thirty-five. She is a beautiful American 
	girl. Her face has the freshness of a model in a Sears 
	catalogue. She is dressed simply in a short black skirt 
	and matching jacket. High heels complete the picture. 
	Heads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's 
	clear they find her very sexy. She acknowledges their 
	glance with a half-smile and steps into the elevator. 
	She could be a secretary, or a PA to one of the many 
	execs here in Las Vegas at a convention. The body language 
	is a bit different, though.
<b>	
</b><b>	4 INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE OF HOTEL - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	A view of night-time Las Vegas through a window. Traffic up 
	and down The Strip; bright, gaudy neon flashing and winking.
	We hear the sound of men laughing and the camera pulls 
	focus and we see reflected in the glass...
<b>	
</b>	...a group of people.
<b>	
</b>	On the table are bowls of potato chips and dip and 
	sandwiches. The TV is on at a sports channel and two 
	boxers pound the shit out of each other.
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	5 INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Sera looks at herself in the gold-tinted mirror in 
	the elevator. She takes out a lipstick and freshens 
	her lips. Some people get out and the elevator climbs 
	higher. We see from the indicator that she has punched 
	the Penthouse button. Camera moves in tighter and we 
	see that she is nervous but concealing it well. The 
	elevator stops, the doors open and she steps right 
	into the Penthouse.
<b>	
</b><b>	6 INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	A bottle of Scotch is almost empty. The man talking is Yuri. 
	He is Russian, in his early forties, a little overweight, 
	a big man wearing a blue silk suit. His thick black hair 
	is greased and combed back. He wears a lot of jewelry, 
	all gold. Rings, a bracelet and a Rolex. Two men in 
	business suits and a weird stoned woman in her late 
	thirties listen to him.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		...but please, my friends, 	
		call me Yuri. It is my 	
		American name... I picked it 	
		myself.
<b>	
</b>	The three people laugh. There is a hint of contempt in 
	the way that they speak to Yuri.
<b>	
</b><b>				FIRST BUSINESSMAN
</b>		Where are you from, Yuri? I 	
		mean, you sure don't talk 	
		like you're from this neck of 
		the woods. 
<b>	
</b>	Yuri smiles at them.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>			(silky voice)
		No... you are right, my 	
		friend. How very observant 	
		you are. I am from Latvia.
<b>		
</b><b>				WEIRD WOMAN
</b>		Tough place.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		Yes, I hear this too. But I 	
		am not a tough man. I am a 	
		simple man who is here to 	
		learn from my new American 	
		friends.
<b>	
</b>	The door opens and Sera comes in. Everybody stares at her.
<b>	
</b><b>				WEIRD WOMAN
</b>			(turned on)
		Is this your friend, Yuri?
<b>		
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		Ah, yes... Sera.
<b>	
</b>	The second businessman takes out a small manila envelope from 
	his inside pocket.
<b>	
</b>				YURI(cont'd)
		Sera is my gift to you, my 	
		friends from New York City. 	
		You may do with her as you 	
		wish in this beautiful room, 	
		which is also my gift for the 
		night to my friends. You will 
		find her a very willing girl, 
		for all of you...just as we 	
		arranged.
<b>	
</b>	Yuri smiles again as the Second Businessman hands him the 
	envelope. The rest of them just stare at Sera, aroused by the 
	idea of her.
<b>		
</b><b>			SECOND BUSINESSMAN
</b>		Of course, Yuri. I think 	
		you'll find this just as we 	
		discussed.
<b>		
</b>	Yuri gets up.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		So, my friends... I have other 
		business to attend. Enjoy.
<b>		
</b><b>		
</b>	He heads for the door, passing Sera. She holds out his arm as 
	he passes.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>			(whispering)
		Yuri... please! Can I talk to 	
		you for a moment.
<b>		
</b><b>		
</b>	Still smiling, he takes Sera's arm and leads her into the 
	bedroom.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		My friends... excuse me for 	
		just one moment. 
<b>		
</b><b>		
</b><b>	7 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
</b>
	Mirrors reflect mirrors.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I don't want this. Yuri, 	
		please. I really don't want 	
		this. You know I don't like 	
		to do groups.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>			(playful)
		I want this, Sera. I need 	
		this!   
<b>		
</b><b>					SERA
</b>		Please, Yuri.
<b>		
</b><b>		
</b><b>		
</b>	He holds put his arms. Sera goes to him. He hugs her with one 
	arm. He pulls up her skirt so that her panties are exposed.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>			(seductive)
		These are pretty.
<b>	
</b>	Sera watches in the mirror as he pulls her panties to reveal 
	her buttocks. He strokes her there gently with his other 
	hand. We see that there are two fine scars there. He speaks 
	gently, like a father to a daughter.
<b>	
</b>				YURI(cont'd)
		Is this how you would repay 	
		me for coming all this way to 
		find you again? Driving 	
		through the desert to protect 
		my little Sera.
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	FLASHBACK-SILENT-GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE
</b><b>	
</b><b>	8 INT. ROOM - NIGHT
</b>	Yuri and Sera - different time, different place. Sera looking 
	frightened, backing away from Yuri, who pulls a switchblade 
	from his jacket and opens it.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	CUT BACK TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	9 INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>	Yuri enters from the bedroom. The weird woman is doing a line 
	of coke.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>			(cheerful)
		Sera wanted me to ask if she 	
		might undress at once for 	
		you. She has a very beautiful 
		undergarment witch she would 	
		like you to see.
<b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE ON BEDROOM DOOR
</b><b>	
</b>	Sera comes into the room. She smiles and begins unbuttoning 
	her jacket.
<b>	
</b>	She takes it off and drops it on the floor, and then unzips 
	her skirt and steps out of it. Sera is now in control and 
	playing the room. In the background. Yuri leaves the room.
<b>	
</b><b>				WEIRD WOMAN
</b>			(strange voice)
		Come here.
<b>	
</b>	Sera walks over and something strange takes place between 
	them.
<b>			
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>		
</b><b>	10 INT. BEN'S BAR. LA - MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	The bar is dark but through a small window we see that it is 
	a very bright sunny day outside. The bartender reads the Los 
	Angeles Times. The bar surface is red vinyl. There are five 
	customers, all single men. One of them is Ben and he is 
	sitting at the bar watching TV. A game show is in progress 
	and the TV sound is loud. Ben finishes his drink and grimaces 
	before indicating to the barman that he'd like a repeat. 
	Barman pours him a whiskey - Cranberry - and the camera moves 
	in closer to Ben, ending in a close-up. Ben takes a big hit 
	from the drink and concentrates on the TV. We hear from the 
	TV sound that it is a word game with a big prize. Ben smiles 
	to himself.
<b>	
</b><b>	BEN'S POV OF TV
</b><b>	
</b>	The talk show hostess, an American TV beauty, is showing the 
	audience the prizes available in today's game show.
<b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE ON BEN
</b><b>	
</b>	As he finishes that drink and asks for another. The camera 
	moves in close on his eyes. 
<b>	
</b><b>	BEN'S POV OF TV
</b><b>	
</b>	She turns from the prizes and looks straight into the TV 
	camera, which starts zooming into her. At first, what she is 
	saying makes complete sense, but then things change...
<b>	
</b><b>				HOSTESS
</b>			(smoky, sexy voice)
		Just look at this studio, 	
		Ben, filled with glamorous 	
		merchandise, including an 	
		extra special prize chosen 	
		just for You! A big, bad, BMW 
		motorcycle, complete with 	
		saddle bags stuffed with 	
		thousands of US dollars.
<b>	
</b>	"There are oohs" from the audience.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>				HOSTESS
</b>		So, Ben,
			(tosses her hair)
		Let's find a bar, get drunk 	
		and go for a ride.
<b>	
</b>	The studio lights dim.
<b>	
</b><b>				HOSTESS
</b>		Then we can get a suite 	
		somewhere and order up a case 
		of champagne while we fuck 	
		ourselves silly.
<b>	
</b>	Close-up on males in the audience doing the grunt.
<b>	
</b><b>				HOSTESS
</b>		This is it, just for You,
		Ben. 
<b>	
</b>	She unbuttons her top, licks her fingers and makes her 
	nipples hard.
<b>	
</b><b>				HOSTESS
</b>		Because You've been so 
		patient, and because I want 
		to fuck you, take care of 
		You, and because there's 
		nothing else in the world 
		worth doing.
<b>	
</b>	Section of the audience clapping - some women dabbing their 
	eyes.
<b>	
</b><b>				HOSTESS
</b>		Tell you what, Ben, let's go 
		to Las Vegas. The bars stay 
		open twenty four hours night 
		and day. Just you, just me, 
		Ben, think about it, all 
		right? 
<b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE ON BEN
</b><b>	
</b>	Lost in his fantasy
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I'll think about it.
<b>	
</b>	He looks back at the screen, but the show has returned to 
	what is known as "normal". He finishes his drink and then an 
	attack of nausea hit him. He takes a deep breath and rolls 
	his neck and his head. The barman puts down a fresh drink. 
	Ben looks at his own hands...which are steady.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARMAN
</b>		You should go on that show.
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	11 INT. SMART BUSINESS SPACE - MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	Ben sitting at a desk with a phone wedged on his ear, a cup 
	of black coffee on the desk. The walls are covered with 
		framed film posters and one complete wall has shelves jammed 
	with scripts. He nods from time to time and sometimes says 
	'yes' or 'OK', but it becomes clear that there is no one on 
	the other end. He drinks from the coffee cup. A woman comes 
	up to his desk, a business colleague. She puts a wad of 
	messages down on the desk.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Yeah, but what's the back end 
		like? By the time we're 
		through with P and A, the 
		above-the line is going to 
		take it to about fifteen and 
		with something like this... I 
		don't know if Disney will go 
		for it... can I call you back 
		on this? OK... chow for now.
			(to the woman)
		Good morning.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>				WOMAN
</b>			(cautious)
		Ben... Mr. Simpson was looking 
		for you. I said that you had 
		a doctor's appointment. He 
		said for you to go in as soon 
		as... are you OK?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(pulling himself together)
		I'm fantastic, but I gotta go 
		out now... very important 
		meeting, could make a coupla 
		million for the company.
<b>	
</b>	Ben gets up and as he passes her he grabs her and dances a 
	few steps. It is clear that she likes Ben, but when his face 
	gets close to hers she smells the alcohol on his breath and 
	she turns away. Ben stops dancing and smiles sadly.
<b>	
</b><b>				WOMAN
</b>			(tender)
		Ben?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		What?
<b>	
</b><b>				WOMAN
</b>		You should go now.
<b>	
</b>	She leaves the room and Ben goes through some routine at the 
	desk. He opens a drawer of a filing cabinet and puts in his 
	whole arm, looking for something at the very back. He pulls 
	out a small vodka bottle and opens it and then pours the 
		contents into his coffee cup. With cup in hand he leaves the 
	room.
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	12 INT. SMART OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Ben is sitting opposite his boss, Mr. Simpson, who is very 
	upset. He hands Ben an envelope. Ben opens it and pulls out a 
	check. He looks at the amount.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(genuinely moved) 
		This is to generous Peter.
<b>	
</b><b>				SIMPSON
</b>			(close to tears)
		Well... we liked having you 
		around, Ben, but you know how 
		it is.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(ashamed)
		Sure thing... and I'm sorry.
<b>	
</b>	Ben takes a swig from his coffee cup.
<b>	
</b><b>				SIMPSON
</b>			(trying to cheer things along)
		Well... what are you going to 
		do now?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I thought I might move out to 
		Las Vegas.
<b>	
</b>	Simpson looks puzzled.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		The bars never close.
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	13 INT. BEN'S BMW  DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Ben drives though Beverly Hills. He pours the content of a 
	small bottle of vodka into an empty Coke can, puts the empty 
	bottle under the seat and then drinks from the can.
<b>	
</b>	He slips a tape into the player and we hear "Lonely 
	Teardrops", by Michael McDonald, one of Ben's favorite songs. 
	At a traffic light a cop on a bike pulls up next to him and 
	Ben takes a pull from the Coke can and smiles, mouths the 
	word "hot". The cop nods back at him, the light changes and 
	they both pull away.
<b>		
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	14 EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET  DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Ben carries a brown paper bag which clinks. Camera follows 
	him as he walks down the street. He looks at... 
<b>	
</b><b>	BEN'S POV
</b><b>	
</b>	A girl walking ahead of him in the same direction. She is 
	walking her dog. She is attractive from behind. We hear Ben's 
	thoughts.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(voice-over)
		Beautiful, no just the shape 
		which is nice, but the whole 
		walk, the feeling, the 
		movement. This girl is 
		pleased with herself. Maybe 
		this is the only art I can 
		appreciate... I don't know if 
		this is good or bad, but 
		right now she is really 
		beautiful. When I was a boy 
		it would have been really 
		important that she have a 
		pretty face, to go with this 
		body, I mean. I still would 
		like to see her face, but her 
		beauty is no dependent on her 
		face.
<b>	
</b>	The dog gets interested in something on the sidewalk and she 
	bends down to pull at its collar. 
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(voice-over)
		I wonder what kind of panties 
		she's wearing. Shit, that's 
		too specific, but... on the 
		other hand, you can never be 
		too specific... but then, the 
		infinitesimal must be, by 
		definition, as infinite as 
		the infinite.
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly the girl stops. Ben catches up with her and cannot 
	resist looking into her face.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(voice-over)
		God, she's so young.
<b>		
</b>	The girl sees Ben and smiles an innocent smile,
<b>	
</b><b>				GIRL
</b>		Hi!
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Hi... 
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	15 EXT. BEN'S HOUSE IN SANT MONICA - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Ben walks up to his house still carrying the paper bag. A 
	young boy of about thirteen years of age is fixing a beat-up 
	bike. Ben greets him.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Hey, Brad... how's it going?
<b>	
</b><b>				BRAD
</b>		Hey Ben. There were a couple 
		of guys looking for you.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		What did they look like?
<b>	
</b><b>				BRAD
</b>		Suits. I didn't tell them 
		anything. You know anything 
		about gears?
<b>	
</b>	Ben takes a look. The gear mechanism is all bent out of 
	shape. He bends down to have a look. It is clear from the way 
	he deals with this mechanical problem that he's good with his 
	hands. He doesn't try to force anything but he moves the 
	chain and gear mechanism to get to the problem.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		How'd this happen? 
<b>	
</b><b>				BRAD
</b>		I was going real fast down on 
		the beach and something 
		slipped and everything got 
		jammed up.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		The news is not good, kid. 
		This bit here... see 
		there... it's broken. You need 
		a new  one.
<b>	
</b><b>				BRAD
</b>			(upset)
			How much, do you think?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I don't know. I'll find out 
		though.
<b>	
</b>	Ben gets up, picks up his bottles and heads for his house. He 
	looks back and Brad is sitting still by the bike, looking 
	totally dejected. This really seems to upset Ben.
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	16 INT. BEN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</b><b>	
</b>	Ben is naked and the shower can be heard in the background. 
	The house is austere, only the minimum of furnishing. He 
	pours a large tumbler of vodka and takes a gulp, then tops up 
	the glass. He turns on the stereo, selects a record - Miles 
	Davis, Kind of Blue - and puts it on the turntable. He turns 
	on the cassette recorder and inserts a new blank tape. He 
	puts the machine into the record mode. He kneels down next to 
	the deck and with complete precision puts the needle on the 
	second track without any problem. The music starts and 
	continues through the next sequence. 
<b>	
</b><b>	17 INT. SHOVER - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Ben is in the shower with the glass in his hand.
<b>	
</b><b>	18 INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Ben shaving with the glass in his hand. He does the area 
	around his mouth first so that he can drink while he does the 
	rest.
<b>	
</b><b>	19 INT. LIVING SPACE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Showered and shaved and wearing a smart dark suit, Ben looks 
	handsome and normal. He selects another record and again sets 
	up the cassette machine to record. He turns the stereo up 
	full and dances by himself while watching MTV silent. He 
	tries a turn which is a bit ambitious and loses hi balance. 
	In slow motion we see him fall. Ben lies still on the floor. 
	He smiles to himself and decides top stay there for a 
	while... 
<b>	
</b><b>	FADE OUT:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	FADE IN:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	20 INT. SERA'S BEDROOM. LAS VEGAS - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Sera wakes up in bed next to Yuri. (The camera is high above 
	the bed looking down.) She is completely drenched in sweat. A 
	thin shaft o light comes from the crack in the drapes and 
		falls across their bodies. Other than that, the room is in 
	darkness. To get out of bed she would have to climb over him. 
	She lies still. Yuri speaks without opening his eyes... 
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		I missed you, Sera. You have

<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I'll get you another

<b>	
</b>	She watches him walk to the bar. He gets the drink and walks 
	back to her. He sets the drinks down on the table and sits 
	down. As he does so, his face gets close to hers and she 
	smells the booze on him.
<b>	
</b><b>				PRETTY WOMAN
</b>		Wow... been drinking all day?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		But of course.
<b>	
</b>	She looks at him, a disappointed expression on her face. She 
	is no longer interested in being seduced by this man and this 
	much is clear to Ben.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Why don't we finish these and

</b>		No, OK.
<b>	
</b>	Ben tries to stand and has to pull himself up by holding the 
	bar. It's a strange thing with drunks like Ben... when they're 
	up they have balance and timing, but when they're down it all 
	falls apart. She starts to speak but then doesn't. A look of 
	great sadness comes over her.
<b>	 
</b><b>				PRETTY WOMAN
</b>		I have to go now. Thanks 
		anyway.
<b>	
</b>	She stands to go.
<b>

<b>	
</b>	She walks to the door and Ben turns to the bar, watched by he 
	Barman, who is a little concerned.

</b>	A tough black girl dances in a world of her own, impervious 
	to the men who stare at her. The trio grinds out a dirty 
	blues. A man opposite Ben places a dollar bill on the stage 
	and as the dancer squats down to pick it up he stares between 
	her legs an winks. The Waitress puts down a styrofoam cup and 
	a bottle of water in front of Ben but refuses to look at him.

</b>	He looks around for a clock.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		... it's late.
<b>	
</b><b>	76 INT. YURI'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Sera comes into the room, takes her purse out and counts out 
	seven hundred dollars.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Sorry, Yuri... good 
		night... lots of tricks... I 
		think things are picking up.
<b>		
</b>	Yuri sits on the bed. He looks unwell and disoriented. His 
	face is covered with a thin film of sweat. He seems to be 
	listening for something, because he stops her talking by 
	putting his fingers to his lips. He looks at her and then 
		beckons her to the bed. Sera is nervous. As she walks to the 
	bed, she begins unbuttoning her blouse. Yuri stops her with a 
	wave of his hand. Sera is puzzled and frightened now. Yuri 
	seems to be deranged.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		Have you told anyone that I'm 
		here?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		No.
<b>	
</b>	Yuri suddenly hears something. He grabs Sera's hand and takes 
	her to the wall. He presses her head to the wall.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		Do you here that?
<b>	
</b>	He looks at her.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		They're talking about me.
<b>	
</b>	He pulls himself together.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		Go, Sera.
			(whispers)
		Go. Stay at home. I will call 
		you tomorrow.
<b>				SERA
</b>		Yuri... are you... 
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>			(patiently)
		Sera... please go.
<b>	
</b>	He indicates the wall.
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>		This is very important... and 
		I must listen. Now go.
<b>	
</b>	They face each other for a moment and then Yuri does an 
	almost comic gesture to tell her to go. He hustles her to the 
	door and shoves her out as she is still buttoning up her 
	blouse. He slams the door. 
<b>	
</b><b>				YURI
</b>			(through the door)
		Goodbye, Sera. Don't come 
		back here. I will not see you 
		again.
<b>	
</b>	Sera stands there for a while, almost in shock, and then she 
		begins to walk. The camera follows her as she makes her way 
	down the endless corridor of doors. Ahead of her, three men 
	are walking towards her, checking the door numbers as they 
	make their way. Sera doesn't take them in. They pass and turn 
	a corner. We recognize them as the men from the black 
	Town Car.
<b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE
</b><b>	
</b>	The men have stopped outside Yuri's room. The camera pans and 
	we see Sera down the other corridor getting into the 
	elevator.

<b>	
</b>	A coughing fit hits him. He is very short of breath. We see 
	how ill he really is.
<b>	
</b>	There is a tap at the door.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		No thanks... I'm fine.
<b>	
</b>	The tapping persists and eventually Ben gets off the bed and 
	unlocks it, but keeps the chain on. It is Sera.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Still want to have dinner?
<b>	
</b>	Ben stares at her for a while.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Yes.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I have to change and take a 
		shower first. If you want to 
		come home and wait.
<b>	
</b>	Ben opens the door.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		We should pick up a bottle of

</b>	Sera is finishing in the shower and Ben is sitting at the 
	kitchen table. He gets up and walks around the house, trying 
	to get a sense of her. The furniture is very plain and there 
	is spartan quality about the hose. He looks with interest at 
	the bookshelf, which has a good selection of literature. 
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(to himself)
		This is the home of an angel.
<b>	
</b>				SERA (off-screen)
		You OK out there?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Yes. Take your time. I'm 
		fine.
<b>	
</b>	He pours himself another drink.
<b>	
</b>				SERA (off-screen)
		Pour yourself another drink.
<b>	
</b>	He sots down and she comes in, toweling her hair.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		You OK?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Of course. Wow... you look 
		extremely beautiful.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Thank you. What time is it?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Don't know. My watch went the 
		way of the car.
<b>	
</b>	He holds up his empty wrist for her to see. Then looks up and 
	sees her watching him.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I'm rambling. I really like 
		you. You make me want to 
		talk... I don't know what time 
		it is.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I like hearing you talk.
			(businesslike)
		If you feel up to a short 
		walk, there's a place to eat 
		around the corner. All the 
		food in Vegas is terrible so 
		the place doesn't really 
		matter. How does that sound

</b>	Ben and Sera are eating. He plays with his food, eating very 
	little of it. Finally he pushes it away and orders another 
	drink.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I'm from the East. I went to 
		college, did an arts course. 
		I now live in Vegas. I think 
		of it as home. I came here 
		deliberately to carve out a 
		life. I was in LA before, but 
		I'll come back to that later.
			(pause)
		The tough times are behind me 
		now. I can deal with the bad 
		things that happen. There 
		will always be dark 
		characters. But my life is 
		good. It is as I would want 
		it to be. So, why are you a 
		drunk? 
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Is that really what you want 
		to ask me? 
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Yes.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(worried)
		Well, then I guess this is 
		our first date... or our last. 
		Until now, I wasn't sure it 
		was either.
<b>		 
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Very clever.
<b>	
</b>		Sera thinks for a while and decides to give in to him on 
	this.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		First. It's our first. I'm 
		just concerned. So... why are 
		you killing yourself?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Interesting choice of words. 
		I don't remember. I just know 
		that I want to.
<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Want to kill yourself? Are 
		you saying  that you're 
		drinking as a way to kill 
		yourself?
<b>	
</b>	And she leans across the table to be close to him, listening 
	intently. Ben becomes uncomfortable and tries to joke it off. 
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Or killing myself as a way to 
		drink.
<b>	
</b>	Sera continues to stare at him, wanting to know the real 
	answer. He takes a slug from his drink. She sits back.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		We'll talk about it some 
		other time maybe. OK?
<b>	
</b>	Sera relaxes and continues with her food. We hear her 
	thoughts for a moment.
<b>	
</b>				SERA (v.o)
		It wasn't so important to me. 
		I mean, he never asked me why 
		I was a hooker, sand that was 
		impressive. I really liked 
		him. So I decided to just 
		play my part. I mean... it's 
		good to help someone once in 
		a while., it's a bonus to 
		being alive, and that was my 
		plan... to stay alive. I 
		suddenly came to a decision.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		What are you thinking? Are 
		you angry with me?
<b>		 
</b><b>				SERA
</b>				(decides something)
		Ben, why don't you stay at my 
		place tonight? I mean... look, 
		you're so drunk. I like you. 
		I trust you.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		That's astonishing. Sera, 
		look... 
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I hate to think of you in 
		that cheesy motel. I mean... 
<b>	
</b>	And she folds her arms and grins at him.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Let's face it, what the fuck 
		are you doing in Las Vegas?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(overwhelmed by her)
		I'm going to move to a smart 
		hotel, tomorrow if it'll make 
		you feel better.
			(looks at her)
		Let's talk about tomorrow. 
		Wanna do something?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>			(warmly)
		Sure... tonight. Then please 
		stay at my place.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Sera... you know I'm not much 
		good in the sack.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		It's not about sex, Ben. I'll 
		make you up a bed on the 
		sofa. Do it for me. We can 
		talk till late and then sleep 
		till late. As you know, I am 
		my own boss.
<b>		
</b>	Ben laughs loud, the most animated we've seen him, and his 
	laugh as infectious, and Sera join in. Other diners turn to

	each other.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		How long have I been her?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Three nights, two days. When 
		is your rent coming up at the 
		motel?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I don't know.
			(sits up)
		I'll go and sort it out 
		today. Why don't you 
		come?... We'll find a real 
		room for me. You can pick it

<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		There's no reason to blow all 
		your money on a hotel room.
<b>		
</b><b>					BEN
</b>		What do you mean?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		What I mean is that you 
		should bring your stuff over

		fuck!
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Sera... 
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Let's face it, Ben, we're

		done so much talking in my

<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			Me neither.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		So! Let's dispense with the 
		formalities. I want you 
		here... now!
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Sera you are crazy.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		So... I'm not too concerned 
		with long term plans.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Don't you think you'll get a 
		little bored living with a 
		drunk?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		That is what I want. Why 
		don't you go and get your 
		stuff?
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		You haven't seen the worst of 
		it. These last few days I've 
		been very controlled. I knock 
		things over... I throw up all 
		the time.
			(looks at her)
		Now I feel really 
		good... You're like some kind 
		of antidote that mixes the 
		liquor and keeps me in 
		balance, but that won't last 
		forever. You'll get tired of 
		it really quickly. Believe 
		me.
<b>		
</b>	They sit in silence for a while.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		OK, you go back to your hotel 
		and I'll go back to my 
		glamorous life of being 
		alone.
<b>		
</b>	She walks out of the room, and into the bathroom, where she 
	sits on the toilet to pee.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>			(to herself)
		The only thing I have to come 
		home to is a bottle of 
		Listerine to wash the taste 
		of come out of my mouth. I'm 
		tired of being alone... that's 
		what I'm tired of.
<b>		
</b>	She finishes, wipes herself and flushes the toilet. Pulling 
	up her panties, she walks back into the bedroom, where Ben is 
	putting on his shoes. 
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Don't you like me, Ben?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(devastated)
		Don't be silly?
<b>	
</b>	Ben is unable to deal with the fact that he is absolutely in 
	love with her. He walks out of the room. She foolows.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		We gotta decide this... right 
		now. Before we go any 
		further. You either stay here 
		with me or... 
<b>	
</b>	Ben turns to look at her.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		... we can't see each other 
		any more.
<b>		
</b>	Ben and Sera look at each other for a long time.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Sera... what you don't 
		understand is... 
<b>		 
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		What?
<b>	
</b>	Ben is deeply troubled. He comes to a decision.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		You can never... never... ask 
		me to stop drinking. Do you 
		understand?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>			(dead serious)
		I do. I really do.

		OK. I have to do some

	packed any clothes. They are all in a pile on the bed. He 
	talks to himself.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Maybe this isn't a good idea 
		after all.
<b>		
</b>	He tries to put clothes in with the bottles, but the lid 
	won't close. He sits on the bed and has an imaginary

<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Yes, he's my friend. I guess

		Thanks for the concern. Sorry

		Well, call me if there's

	down next to Ben and shakes him gently.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Can you wake up?

</b>	Ben opens his eyes and looks around with a pleasant, cheerful 
	expression.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Hi!
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Why don't you go in and sit 
		down. I have some gifts for

<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Right... OK... 
<b>

	suitcase and attempts to pick up her packages as well, but 
	she stop him.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Don't worry... I got'em.

			Want a drink? Great nap. 
		Wanna go out tonight?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Seriously, Ben... I need to 
		keep pretty low-key around 
		here. Maybe next time you 
		could nap this side of the 
		door. That was the landlord.
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Of course.
<b>	
</b>	She reaches into her purse.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Gift number one.
<b>	
</b>	And she gives him a newly cut key. He takes it and tries it 
	in the lock, then drops it into his pocket.
<b>

</b>		I used to carry a lot of 
		keys, but one by one they all 
		fell victim to the great

	follows.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Sera, I love that

		something I need to say. OK?
<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b><b>		OK.
</b><b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I've come this far... here I 
		am, in your house. I want you 
		to let me pay the rent for 
		this month. All right?
<b>		
</b>	And he stares at her as if to say that nothing can happen 
	until this matter is resolved.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Why?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Because... it's better for me 
		that way. OK?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Well... OK... 
<b>	
</b>	She is uncomfortable.
<b>	
</b>	They sit in silence for a while.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Sera... I hope that you 
		understand how I feel about 
		this. First of all, you're 
		welcome to my money. We can 
		buy a couple of cases of 
		liquor and you can have the 
		rest. But I don't think 
		you're talking to me right 
		now about money.
<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b>			(smiling)
		No?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		No. I think you're talking 
		about you. I'll tell you 
		right now that I'm in love 
		with you... but, be that as it 
		may, I'm not here to force my 
		twisted life into your soul.
<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I know that... 
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		... and I'm not here to demand 
		your attention to the point 
		where it changes your life. 
		We know I'm a drunk... but 
		that seems to be all right 
		with you. And I know that 
		you're a hooker. I hope you 
		understand that I'm a person 
		who is totally at ease with 
		this... which is not to say 
		that I'm indifferent or that 
		I don't care... I do... it 
		simply means that I trust and 
		accept your judgement. What 
		I'm saying is... that I hope 
		you understand that I 
		understand.
<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Thanks, I do understand. I 
		was worried about how that 
		would be... but now I'm not. 
		And you should know that 
		included with the rent here 
		is a complimentary blow job.
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or 
		later we ought to fuck.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Whatever that means. Open 
		your presents.
<b>	
</b>	She hands him the larger of the two parcels.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Open this one first.
<b>	
</b>	Ben awkwardly unwraps the present, a large, colorful shirt. A 
	genuine smile comes on to his face.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Very nice.
<b>	
</b>	He holds the shirt against himself.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		This should work very nicely 
		with my suit, which, by the 
		way, is the only item of 
		clothing I brought over from 
		the motel with me.
<b>			
</b>	Sera raise an eyebrow.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Right... the suitcase was 
		clinking. So what did you do 
		with your clothes?
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(laughing)
		I threw them into the 
		garbage., which was perhaps 
		immoral, but I wanted to come 
		to you clean, so to speak. I 
		thought we could go shopping 
		and pick up a pair of jeans 
		and forty-five pairs of 
		underwear and just throw them 
		out each day.
<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b>			(smiling)
		Nice talk, Ben. Keep 
		drinking. In between the 
		hundred and one proof breath 
		and the occasional drool, 
		some interesting words fall 
		from your mouth.
<b>		
</b>	She hands him the last present.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Now, try this one.
<b>	
</b>	Ben unwraps the smallest gift. It is a silver hip flask. He 
	is very touched and a little tear trickles down his cheek.
<b>	 
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Well... looks like I'm with 
		the right girl.
<b>		
</b>	He turns it in his hands.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I must say that I'm very 
		impressed that you would buy 
		this for me. I know you 
		wouldn't do this without 
		thinking about it. 
		Funny... you did just what I 
		would have done.
<b>		
</b>	Ben stands and tries the flask in his pocket for fit. It is 
	fine. He walks to the door.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEN
</b>		I'm going to fill it right 
		now.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Do you want to go gambling 
		tonight? We could go out and 
		play for a few hours.
<b>		
</b>	Ben comes back into the room, takes the flask out of his suit 
	pocket and has a drink.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I hadn't planned to 
		gamble... but if you would 
		keep the bulk of my money 
		here, then I could safely 
		blow a couple of hundred 
		bucks.
<b>		
</b>	He takes out all of his money, peels off a few hundreds and 
	then gives her the rest.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Giving you money makes me 
		want to come.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Then come.
			(pause)
		I'm going to change. Watch 
		TV. I'll be half an hour.
<b>	
</b>	And she leaves. There is a slight edge to her voice and Ben 
	is not sure if he offended her or not. He watches through the 
	small angle of the door as she changes.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I am planning to go out and

</b><b>	88 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Ben and Sera walking. The camera follows them. He is wearing 
	his new shirt and looks good in it. She is wearing a green 
	dress and mismatched earrings and looks great. They walk and 
	talk.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEN
</b>		I like your earrings.
<b>	
</b>	He changes sides.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I like women who wear 
		mismatched earrings.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Well, then... I hope we don't 
		run into any tonight.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(laughs)
		What do you mean?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I expect some kind of loyalty 
		here. Just because I fuck for 
		money doesn't give you cause 
		to start picking up women and 
		leaving me looking silly.
<b>		
</b>	And she stops and looks at him, smiling but serious. 
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		And I only have eyes for you. 
		And we both know that you 
		would never become 
		romantically involved with a 
		trick, right?

</b><b>	89 INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	They walk around the huge space, which is full of people and 
	energy, and suddenly Ben grabs Sera and pushes her against a 
	slot machine and kisses her deeply. At first she resists and 
	then she gives in to him and responds. They knock over some 
	change, which falls to the floor, and Ben pulls from her a 
	beat to bend down and scoop up all the change and hand it to 
	the bemused player, before returning to Sera's mouth or more. 
	They break for air and then Ben leads her towards the bar. As 
	he waves to attract the barman's attention, she squeezes his 
	arm. 
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>			(quietly)
		I love you.
<b>	
</b>	But he doesn't hear her.
<b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE ON CASINO ACTIVITY
</b><b>	
</b>	On long lens we see Ben and Sera at the bar. Suddenly Ben 
		seems to fall asleep. Sera tries to wake him and then he goes 
	crazy and falls backwards off his stool, knocking a waitress 
	and her drinks over. Security Guards appear and begin arguing 
	with Sera.

</b><b>	
</b>	Ben wakes up on the sofa, fully dressed. A night-light gives 
	a soft glow. He rolls off the sofa, landing on all fours on 
	the floor. He crawls to the kitchen , opens the fridge door 
	and takes out a vodka bottle and carton of orange juice. With 
	difficulty he gets to his feet, finds a glass and pour s a 
	drink. He swallows the mix and then stands over the sink just 
	in case he has to vomit.
<b>	
</b><b>	91 INT. SERA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Sera wakes and Ben comes in and gets into bed with her.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		How are you doing?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Very well... umm... I never 
		expected to have to ask you 
		this again... but how did our 
		evening go? I remember 
		getting to the casino... I 
		remember kissing you... that 
		was really nice but 
		everything after that is a 
		blank.
<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Well - I was prepared for 
		worse, but it wasn't so bad. 
		We were sitting at the bar, 
		talking about blackjack. You 
		seemed just fine, a little 
		drunker than usual, but 
		nothing really strange, but 
		then your head started to 
		droop and I put my arm on 
		your shoulder and then, wham, 
		you swung you arm at me, and 
		fell backwards off your stool 
		into a cocktail waitress. You 
		smashed everything on her 
		tray, it was a real mess. You 
		kept yelling and yelling.
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Oh, and what did you do?
<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I tried to shut you up and 
		help you to your feet but you 
		kept swinging at me - not 
		like you wanted to hit me, 
		but more just waving me away. 
		Security came and when you 
		saw them you stopped yelling. 
		They wanted to carry you out 
		and dump you on the street, 
		but I talked them into 
		letting me walk you out.
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		That's impressive. How did 
		you do that?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I told them you were an 
		alcoholic and T would take 
		you home. I also promised 
		that we would never come in 
		there again.
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		We?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Yes, we.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(holds her hand)
		What happened then?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		You were OK for a while, so 
		we walked for about a block 
		and then you said you wanted 
		to go home and fuck, but I 
		think even you knew that 
		wasn't going to happen. We 
		got a cab and you asked him 
		to stop at a liquor store, 
		even though I told you that 
		we had plenty at home. In the 
		store you gave the kid a 
		hundred and told him to keep 
		the change. I asked you if 
		you knew it was a hundred. 
		You said you did, so I let 
		you do it. We got here, you 
		fell asleep on the couch and 
		I covered you up and came to 
		bed.
<b>			
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I warned you... 
			(kisses her hand)
		... but I'm sorry.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Here's my speech... 
			(kisses his hand)
		... I know this shouldn't be 
		acceptable to m, but it is. 
		Don't ask me why. I sense 
		that your trouble is very 
		big... and I'm scared for 
		you... and so I'm doing what I 
		think you need me to do. 
		Falling down in casinos is 
		little stuff. It doesn't 
		bother me. It has nothing to 
		do with us.
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		That's amazing. What are you? 
		Some sort of angel visiting 
		me from one of my drunk 
		fantasies? How can you be so 
		good?
<b>		
</b>	She turns away to the wall and curls up like a small girl.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I don't know what you're 
		saying. I'm just using you. I 
		need you. Can we not talk 
		about it any more, please. 
		Not another word.
<b>		
</b>	He thinks about this. He gently pushes her until she is lying 
	on her front and then he pulls up her nightdress and strokes 
	her naked back. He kisses her in the small of her back.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Why don't you go back to 
		sleep. I'll go out and buy us 
		some breakfast.
<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Be careful.
<b>	
</b>	He stands and goes to the door.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Don't worry.
<b>	
</b>	As he leaves the room, she calls after him.
<b>		
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Ben, I'm  working tonight.

</b>	Ben enters and makes his way to the bar. This is a dirty, 
	dark place. An ageing blonde in leather hot pants is dancing 
	by herself at the jukebox. A very drunk Biker Couple argue 
	noisily in a corner, slurring their words. There ins not much 
	gambling taking place at the eight slot machines. Ben sits at 
	the bar and the Bartender slaps down a paper napkin.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		A beer and a double kamikaze 
		please.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARTENDER
</b>		Sure thing. Anything to eat?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Not quite yet. First I have 
		to drink myself sober, 
		then... a few crackers, maybe 
		an egg and toast... 
<b>		
</b>	The Bartender walks away to get Ben's drinks, Ben continues 
	anyway.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		... then I'll go home with the 
		groceries and we'll have 
		breakfast together, and 
		that'll make her feel better 
		about my condition... 
<b>		
</b>	Ben is interrupted by the arrival of the Biker Girl. She is 
	young tough and pretty. She puts an arm around him and 
	presses against him.
<b>		
</b><b>				BIKER GIRL
</b>		Who the fuck are you talking 
		to, Mr?
			(laughing)
		Why are you all dressed up, 
		honey? My, don't you look 
		fine.
<b>	
</b>	She runs her tongue around her mouth.
<b>	
</b><b>				BIKER GIRL
</b>		I am very bored with my date. 
		Would you like to buy me a 
		drink?
<b>	
</b>	Ben looks around and sees the Biker staring at the two of 
	them.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(loudly)
		Do you mind if I buy her a 
		drink?
<b>		
</b><b>				BIKER
</b>		Fuck her. I don't care what 
		the fuck you do with her.
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Maybe I could buy you both a 
		drink?
<b>	
</b><b>				BIKER
</b>		Fuck you. Don't fuck with me, 
		motherfucker. Fuck off. Go to 
		it, she's waiting for her 
		drink.
<b>	
</b>	The Biker walks over to the slot machine and begins dropping 
	in quarters, never taking his eyes off Ben and the Girl.
<b>	
</b><b>				BIKER GIRL
</b>		See what an asshole he is.
			(big smile)
		I'll have a rum and Coke.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Barman? A rum and Coke, 
		please.
<b>	
</b>	The Girl leans with her back to the bar, closer to Ben , who  
	is facing the bar on a stool. She brings her face closer to 
	his.
<b>	
</b><b>				BIKER GIRL
</b>		Can I stay with you for a 
		while?
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		You mean move in with me? 
		Isn't this a bit sudden?
<b>	
</b><b>				BIKER GIRL
</b>		Oh, I don't have a lot of

<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>			(smiling)
		I don't think my wife would 
		dig it too much.
<b>	
</b>	She moves to his ear to whisper.
<b>	
</b><b>				BIKER GIRL
</b>		Maybe we could just go find a 
		room and fuck all day. You 
		wouldn't have to tell your 
		wife about that, would you? I 
		could suck you like this.
<b>		
</b>	And she begins sucking on his lobe. Behind them. At the slot 
	machine the Biker is still watching. His face fills with a 
	drunken rage.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		See, the thing is... fucking 
		you would be wonderful, but I 
		am deeply in love with 
		Sera... 
<b>		
</b>	The Biker throws down his beer can and walks towards the bar.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		... and it's almost impossible 
		for me to imagine being with 
		someone else... 
<b>		
</b>	The Biker arrives at the bar and grabs Ben.
<b>	
</b><b>				BIKER
</b>		Now listen, asshole, I'm not 
		gonna just sit around and 
		watch her suck on your ear.
<b>		
</b>	The Biker is about to hit Ben then holds back. He leans in 
	and puts his face next to Ben's.
<b>	
</b><b>				BIKER
</b>		Now, I know that she came 
		over to you, like she does, 
			so I'm gonna pretend that 
		you're innocent and give you 
		one chance to walk out of 
		this place... right now.
<b>		
</b><b>				BIKER GIRL
</b>			(to biker)
		Get lost, jerk.
<b>	
</b>	The Biker slaps her and then grabs Ben by the collar.
<b>	
</b><b>				BIKER
</b>		What do you say?
<b>	
</b>	Ben shakes his arm free from the Biker's grip. He thinks 
	about it for a couple of beats and then decides.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I'm sorry... but she and I 
		have decided to spend a few 
		hours together in a mo -
<b>		
</b>	The Biker headbutts Ben in the face, sending him crashing off 
	his stool to the floor. His head cracks against the tiled 
	floor. The Biker walks over to him, picks him up by his shirt 
	front and punches him in the nose. Blood sprays on to his 
	face. The Biker walks out of the bar. The Girl follows him 
	quickly. The Bartender takes a wet towel and walks over to 
	where Ben is struggling to get up, holding his face. 
<b>	
</b><b>				BARTENDER
</b>		You're quite a fighter.
<b>	
</b>	He gives him the towel.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARTENDER
</b>		This may sound silly, but I'm

<b>

</b>		Oh, no! Oh, fuck, Ben, look 
		at your face. You get in a

</b>	She goes to the bathroom and we hear her rummaging in the

<b>	
</b>				SERA (off-screen)
		Did you stop at the bar?

</b>	She comes back into the room, armed with bottles and cotton 
	wool.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Did you say something stupid

</b>	She goes to work on his face, dabbing an open cut with some 
	mercurochrome.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Absolutely not... ow... I was 
		defending the honor of some 
		poor wayward maiden.
<b>		
</b>	She thinks about this for a moment and then kisses him on the 
	forehead.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Why don't you go and finish 
		this in the bathroom. Take a

	and holds up the empty glass to let the waitress know she 
	should bring another.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Open it.
<b>	
</b>	She does so. It is a pair of onyx earrings. Black onyx set in

</b>		I think you should wear one

<b>

<b>	
</b>	She looks at him, aware of what she has said, wondering how 
	he is reacting. She smiles and Ben takes a deep swallow, 
	finishing his drink. His mood suddenly changes.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Yes... tonight. Put it on.
<b>	
</b>	She does so. Ben helps her, bringing his face down close to

</b>		Years ago, in LA, I turned a 
		trick on Sunset and Western. 
		The guy was polite and didn't 
		argue about the price. He 
		parked his car and I took him 
		to a house that I had an 
		arrangement with. A fat 
		Mexican woman was watching a 
		TV and I told him to give her 
		the twenty for the room. 
		There were three or four 
		small naked children playing 
		on the floor and we had to 
		step over them to get into 
		the room. The room had a bed 
		and a dresser. He lay on his 
		back on the bed and I put a 
		rubber on him and sucked him 
		for a while until he was hard 
		and then I eased on to him. 
		About twenty minutes later 
		there was a knock on the door 
		and it was the woman saying 
		our time was up. I felt kind 
		of guilty because he hadn't 
		come and I offered to reason 
		with the woman and get 
		another ten minutes, but he 
		said it was all right and 
		began dressing. When we were 
		ready to leave the room he 
		stopped me and... hugged me 
		and kissed me on the cheek. 
		He gave me an extra hundred 
		as a tip and went back to his 
		car. I remember being 
		relieved that I wouldn't have 
		to work again that evening.

</b>		Last spring I happened to 
		walk past a house that I had 
		once patronized. There was a 
		cool breeze blowing off the 
		ocean and through the window 
		I could see a bare leg. The 
		girl must have been taking a 
		break between customers. It 
		was a strange moment for me 
		because it reminded me of my 
		mother and despite the fact 
		that I was late for something 
		already I just stayed there, 
		loving the atmosphere of it 
		and my memory and... the 
		reason I'm telling you  this 
		epilogue is that I felt that 
		I'd come full circle.

	camera follows him as he goes...  
<b>	
</b><b>	108 EXT. POOL-SIDE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	... to the side of the pool, where Sera is sunbathing. He 
	lowers himself unsteadily into the chair but avoids spilling 
	a drop of the drinks, which he puts down on to a glass-topped 
	table. He is pretty loaded. Sera turns over and moves out of 
	his shadow.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		I've missed the best sun. Why 
		did you have to pawn your 
		watch?
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I didn't know I'd ever need 
		it again.
<b>	
</b>	Sera gets up, takes a drink and then walks to the diving 
	board. As she takes a position at the end, she pulls the 
	bathing suit out from her bottom, does a very natural dive 
	into the pool, swims a length under water and then comes out 
	near Ben, pulls herself out of the pool in one move and bends 
	down and kisses Ben for a long time. Ben responds and kisses 
	back. There is no one else around the pool.
<b>	
</b>	The kiss becomes heated and urgent and Sera sits on Ben, 
	making him wet from her. He pushes the top of her suit down 
	and kisses her breasts. She picks up the glass and drinks, 
	letting the alcohol spill from her mouth, over her breasts. 
	Ben drinks from her.
<b>	
</b><b>					BEN
</b>		Take this off.
<b>	
</b>	He tries to pull her swimsuit down.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Maybe we should go inside. 
		Come on.
<b>	
</b>	She stands up, covering herself. Ben stands up, laughing, 
	loses his balance and slips on the wet concrete. He falls 
	backwards, half on to the chair, which he breaks, and then on 
	to the glass table. The table goes over and it and the 
	glasses all shatter on the concrete. Ben falls on the broken 
	glass and cuts himself all over his back and his arms. Glass 
	goes into the pool. Blood mingles with the water on the 
	steaming cement.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Whoops.
<b>	
</b>	Sera picks up her towel and lays it down next to him. She 
	kneels and helps him up, trying to pullout the little bits of 
	glass sticking to him. Ben stands unsteadily.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I'll go and clean up. Perhaps 
		you could take care of this. 
<b>	
</b>	He indicates the mess, then walks to their room. Sera begins 
	carefully picking up the broken glass. The desk clerc appears 
	with a broom and a dustpan.
<b>	
</b><b>				DESK-CLERK
</b>			(cheerfully)
		Everybody OK?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Yes, fine. Don't worry. We'll

		clean all this up, the pool 
		too.
<b>	
</b><b>				DESK-CLERK
</b>		Don't worry.
<b>	
</b>	He begins sweeping the broken glass into the pan, cheerfully 
	ignoring Sera.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		You seem prepared for 
		accidents.
<b>	
</b><b>				DESK-CLERK
</b>			(still smiling)
		Yeah... we get a lot of screw-
		ups here.
<b>	
</b>	He looks directly at Sera.
<b>	
</b><b>				DESK-CLERK
</b>		Now, you two keep you loud 
		talk and your liquor to your

		tomorrow and after that I 
		don't want to see either of 
		you here again. I don't need 
		you paying for the chair or 
		cutting your pretty hands on 
		the glass. Let's leave it at

	body covered with countless bits of bloodstained tissue. The 
	image has an almost religious feel to it. The TV is on and a 
	sitcom is playing.
<b>	
</b>	Something funny catches Sera's attention. She laughs and sits 
	on the bed next to Ben.

		I think we realized that we

</b>		What in the hell happened to 
		you, Miss?
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Oh... it was an argument. 
<b>	
</b><b>				BLACK DRIVER
</b>		Leave him, Miss. Pretty girl 
		like You could get any man 
		that You wanted.
<b>	
</b><b>	144 INT. BEN'S MOTEL ROOM - DUSK
</b><b>	
</b>	The door opens. Ben is naked. His body looks bad. Leaving the 
	door open, he retreats to the bed.
<b>	
</b><b>	145 INT. BEN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>		
</b>	Sera comes in, closing the door behind her. The shades are 
	drawn and the room is gloomy. Ben has got back into bed. She 
	comes to the bed and sits.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Ben... I've been looking for 
		You. Have You been here since 
		You left? It smells bad in 
		here. It's so dark.
<b>		
</b>	She clicks on the bedside light and is truly shocked by his 
	face.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I wanted to see you... 
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Oh, Ben... you look so very 
		sick... my love... you're so 
		pale.
<b>	
</b>	She goes to the bathroom and returns with a wet face-cloth. 
	She wipes his face.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I wanted to see you... you're 
		my angel.
<b>	
</b>	He sits up painfully and finds a bottle, summoning up some 
	last strength to drink. His entire body shudders as he drains 
	the bottle. He puts it down and focuses on her for the first 
	time. H sees her damaged face, touches her face, looks at her 
	questioningly.  
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Something went wrong... I'm 
<b>		OK.
</b><b>	
</b>	Ben begins to cry and that sets her off.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		I'm sorry I put us asunder.
<b>	
</b>	She shakes her head, unable to speak for the moment. She gets 
	into bed with him, kissing his face. She caresses his whole 
	body, which is shaking, possessed by an uncontrollable fever.
<b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		See how hard You make me 
		angel. 
<b>	
</b>	She excites him with her hand, kissing his face gently. When 
	he is about to come, she straddles him and brings him inside. 
	As he comes, he opens his eyes wide and looks at her.
<b>		
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		You know I love you... yeah? 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>			(she comes)
		Yes.
<b>	
</b><b>	SLOW FADE TO BLACK:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	FADE IN:
</b><b>	
</b>	Sera is sleeping. A sudden gasp wakes her. Ben is having a 
	spasm. Suddenly his body relaxes. He turns his head, opens 
	his eyes wide and looks straight at her.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>				BEN
</b>		Oh... I'm so sorry... 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	He smiles and turns his head away. He is very still.
<b>	
</b><b>				SERA
</b>		Ben... Ben... Ben?
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	146 INT. BEN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	In the darkened room we can just make out Sera sitting on the 
	bed, looking at the still form of Ben.
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	 
</b><b>	147 EXT. STREET NEAR MOTEL -  DAWN
</b><b>	
</b>	Sera walking. A paramedic van goes past with its lights 
	flashing. The soundtrack is empty - silent. We slowly fade in 
	theme music and titles start to roll.
