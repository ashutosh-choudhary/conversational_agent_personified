    North Hayworth Avenue, off Sunset Boulevard. A quiet, tree-
    lined residential street. Note the small apartment complex
    set back from the curb.

    Our narrator is HENRY OBERT (O-BURT)(30).

<b>                           HENRY (V.O.)
</b>               This is where where F. Scott
               Fitzgerald died on December 21, 1940.

    INSERT ARCHIVAL PHOTOS of Fitzgerald.   His work.   His life.

<b>                           HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>               Fitzgerald was one of the truly great
               American writers of the 20th century.
               Tender is the Night. The Last Tycoon.
               This Side of Paradise. And, of course,
               my favorite, The Great Gatsby. But
               Fitzgerald ended up out here. Writing
               movies that never got made. Drinking
               too much. Alienating people. Losing
               his way.

<b>2   EXT.   FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - DAY             
</b>
    Henry stands on the sidewalk. Full of promise and hope.
    Wears a pizza delivery outfit as he stares at the apartment,
    more with reverence than curiosity.

<b>                           HENRY (V.O.)
</b>               I stop by here sometimes--out of
               respect. Fitzgerald had this amazing
               gift.

<b>3   EXT. FITZGERALD/GRAHAM APARTMENT -- SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS        
</b>
    Henry crosses the street--heading for his parked Honda.     He
    unlocks the car. Swings open the back door.

<b>                           HENRY (V.O.)
</b>               But he wasted it. He wasted his
               talent.

    Henry yanks a MAGNETIC SIGN out of the back seat and slaps
    it on the outside of the driver's door: PIZZA STARZ. One
    last glance at the fabled apartment complex.

              his mistakes.

    The man (40's) and woman (30's) sit on the couch in their
    tastefully-decorated San Fernando Valley home. Expensive
    taste in clothes. Her cleavage a bit too obvious. Both
    seem a little uncomfortable. Uncertain.

    They look off to the side, speaking to someone off-camera.

<b>                          ALAN
</b>              We thought this was going to be a
              reality series.

<b>                          COLETTE
</b>              You know, like the Kardashians.

    They listen.    Here comes the bad news.

<b>                          ALAN
</b>              Oh. Really? A documentary? This
              is going to be a documentary about
              our writing group?

<b>                          COLETTE
</b>              The whole group. Not just us, right?
              Not that it should be just about
              us...

    Nervous laugh.

<b>                            ALAN
</b>              No.

    They look at each other: A documentary? They try to mask
    their disappointment.

<b>                          COLETTE
</b>              So this is going to be like--like
              what I saw the other night on cable?
              About bees mating.

<b>                          ALAN
</b>              Or that, um, that one about the
              Holocaust.

    Colette nods, remembering.

</b>              Powerful.   Yes. Powerful.

<b>                          COLETTE
</b>              We love documentaries.

<b>                             ALAN
</b>              We do.

    They look at each other again: What have we gotten into?

</b>              Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed
              oh-so-slowly...

    A POSTER BOARD SIGN--someone went to Kinko's--is posted
    prominently reading: QUIET, PLEASE--WRITERS AT WORK.

              hand groping her womanhood, knowing...

    They sit around the dining room table. Colette, convinced
    she's the next Amy Tan, reads aloud from her TYPED PAGES.
    The others all have copies in front of them. We recognize
    Henry, the frog waiting to become a prince, making copious
    notes and Alan, oh-so-proud, hanging on every word. Beaming.

    Three others round out the group:

    Younger MAN (early 30s). Unshaven. Always thinks he's the
    coolest guy in any room. Can't avoid glances at the camera.

    The OLDEST MEMBER of the group (over 60) sits with his arms
    folded as he listens, shifting in his chair. Captain Grumpy.

              her chastity spraying across the
              ceiling...Spraying across the ceiling
              like passionate graffiti. Natasha
              never thought such a moment possible.
              "Have I satisfied you, Natasha?"
              Yuri had inquired after their fourth
              round of vodka-soaked lovemaking.
              "Nyet, Not yet," Natasha stated,
              exhausted, but grateful.

    Awkward silence around the table as Colette removes her
    reading glasses and waits. Alan clears his throat, looking
    cheerful.

<b>                           ALAN
</b>              Well?   Comments?

</b>
    Henry's sparse studio apartment. Minimal furniture. His laptop
    is set up on an old door, stretched across some blue plastic
    crates.

    There are BOOKS piled everywhere. All sorts of books. And
    PAPER -- pieces of paper, including letters and cards and
    printed emails, dozens of them, are taped throughout the
    small apartment.

    We are introduced to Henry the writer: pondering over his
    battered laptop, pacing up and down the floor, checking his
    nearly empty refrigerator, stretched out on his Goodwill
    couch, watching TV.

    Finally, inspiration. Henry rushes to his desk and taps out
    a sentence or two on his computer, feeling proud for his
    accomplishment.

<b>                          HENRY (V.O.)
</b>              I graduated from the University of
              Illinois. English major. Taught
              high school for a couple years, but
              hated it. Moved out here to be a
              writer.

    As Henry's voice over continues, we see him in uniform with
    pizza in hand at the front door of a house. Rings doorbell.

<b>                          HENRY (V.O.)
</b>              I work two jobs. Delivering pizzas
              and cleaning carpets. Good jobs for
              a writer.
<b>                                                                   5.

     Henry cleaning the carpets as the heavily-tattooed MOTORCYCLE
     DUDE points to a dirty spot: Over here.

</b>               You meet lots of interesting people.

     Henry points to the letters on the wall. C.U. picks up on
     phrases like "We regret to inform you," or "Sorry, but this
     story isn't right for us," or "The Baxter Agency currently
     isn't accepting new clients."

<b>                           HENRY (V.O.)
</b>               I have two unpublished novels.
               Working on my third, Pizza to Go.
               These are my rejection letters.
               Rejected by agents. Rejected by
               publishers. When you think about
               it, it's pretty amazing how many
               ways people can reject you.

     Henry, John, Alan, Colette, Hannah, and William sit around
     the table. Impressive buffet of cold cuts, cheeses, and
     shrimp has been set out.

<b>                           HENRY (V.O.)
</b>               Our writing group meets every Tuesday
               night. Mostly at Alan and Colette's.
               Sometimes we rotate.

     John helps himself to some shrimp.   Then helps himself to
     some more.

<b>                           HENRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>               I love coming to the group. Everyone
               always has such constructive feedback.
               It's like we're all in this together.

<b>                           HANNAH
</b>               I really like the way Yuri is
               developing, Colette.

<b>                              COLETTE

<b>                           JOHN
</b>               Well, if you ask John K. Butzin...

     Can't help looking at the camera. Making sure it's on him.
<b>                                                              6.
</b>
<b>                      JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>          You're still going to have to explain
          why this Natasha dame goes AWOL on
          her husband. Still kinda iffy to
          me.

Another glance at the camera: Did you get that?

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          I was bothered by that, too. Why
          would Natasha betray a reliable,
          dependable husband for a washed-up
          young punk?

All eyes on Colette.    She shifts in her chair.   Uncomfortable.

<b>                       COLETTE
</b>          Oh.   Well...um...um...

An uneasy silence. Colette is blocked--nowhere to go
creatively. Her face tightens up. Bites her lip.

<b>                      COLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh God. I've been rewriting and
          rewriting and rewriting and--

<b>                         ALAN
</b>          Poodles.     It's OK.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          No. It's not OK. I still can't
          explain Natasha's motive. What's
          the use? I'm not a writer.

William to the rescue.

<b>                      WILLIAM
</b>          Whoa. Whoa. Time out. The dude's
          good in bed. Trust me, that's all
          the motive she needs.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>          Roger that. Torpedo Chapter Three.
          Blow it up. Get the focus back on
          this broad--Natasha.

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          --Yes. I was thinking the same thing.

<b>                       HANNAH
</b>          Make it clear that Natasha wants to
          be closer...

Colette makes notes furiously, nodding in agreement.
<b>                                                                   7.

<b>                            HENRY (V.O.)
</b>                Writing can be such a solitary
                existence, so it's good to have this
                outlet where you can meet other
                writers and exchange ideas. Here it
                really is all for one and one for
                all.

     Later that evening.    Meeting is over.

     Alan, Colette, Hannah, Henry, William, and John are all
     standing up now. William stretches. John reaches for more
     shrimp. Friendly banter. Laughter.

     Everybody does.    William taps Henry on the shoulder.

     Henry sits at his desk, staring at the blank computer. Lost
     in thought. Emphasis on lost.

<b>                            HENRY (V.O.)

     She takes the glasses off. Puts them back on. Off again.
     Debating. Hannah prepares herself with a series of quick
     breaths and waves her hands in the air. Then she stares
     directly into the camera.

     The evening meeting is winding to an end. John stands up to
     stretch. Alan slides papers into his leather satchel.

     HANNAH'S CHAIR remains empty. Henry remains concerned.

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          I wonder what happened to Hannah.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          It's not like her to miss.

The mystery is quickly solved. Front door opens. In rushes
Hannah, dashing directly towards the others, looking harried.

<b>                       HANNAH
</b>          I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for missing
          the meeting.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>          What happened? Your car break down?

<b>                      ALAN

<b>                     WILLIAM
</b>          People. C'mon. Look at her. That
          glow. Hannah met a guy. She got
          laid.

Hannah gives William a playful smack on the back.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          As a matter of fact, I did meet a
          guy.

<b>                      WILLIAM
</b>          Told ya.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          His name's Brian.

Check out Henry. He looks absolutely horrified. No!

Hannah takes a deep breath and flashes a smile the size of
the Grand Canyon.

<b>                      HANNAH (CONT'D)
</b>          He's my new agent!

She remembers the camera.

</b>              (Directly to camera)
          An agent. I've got an agent!

Surprise and silence. The writers look at each other and
then back at Hannah. Not quite sure how to react.

</b>                That writing class I took? Well,
                for the final project, I turned in
                the first chapter of Sleeping on the
                Moon. I guess the teacher liked it.
                Then he gave it to his friend who's
                an agent. Brian. He called. Had to
                see me right away. Brian wants to
                sign me.

<b>                            WILLIAM
</b>                Bet Brian wants more than that.

     Playful smack from Colette to William on the shoulder: Behave.

<b>                            COLETTE

<b>                             ALAN
</b>                Yes.   Fantastic. Fanntasstic.

     Henry takes it all in quietly, unable to speak.

     Alan bounces up and gives Hannah a big hug as the others
     immediately start peppering her with questions.

     But our camera picks up on the individual writers and
     something is amiss. Everything seems a beat off. People
     appear happy, but a little subdued. The joy seems a bit too
     forced.

<b>                           HANNAH
</b>               I'm merely the first one to get

               an agent in Santa Monica very
               interested in John K. Butzin. He's
               reading the manuscript as we speak.

     The others let John's remark pass without comment.   William
     taps Henry on the shoulder.

     The front door to the restaurant swings open and the writing
     group members tumble out into the evening. Alan carries his
     WRITERS AT WORK sign.

     William makes a move towards Hannah, but the the ever-
     protective Henry grabs her gently by her elbow, cutting
     William off. They start walking in one direction. William
     and John head out in the other. Meanwhile, Alan and Colette
     wave enthusiastically to Hannah.

<b>                           ALAN

               better writer than I am. So much
               better. You went to college.

</b>               He's a great writer. Henry Obert. I
               knew him when.

     Henry, clearly embarrassed, puts his hand up to block the
     camera. Tries to change the subject.

<b>                           HENRY
</b>               Listen. Maybe some afternoon we
               could go for a drive. There are

</b>               Four years. It's been four years
               since I moved here. And now I have
               an agent. It's the number four again.
               My lucky number. I should have known
               this was going to happen.

<b>                           HENRY
</b>               There is no one more deserving.

     Hannah rewards Henry's praise with a peck on the lips.    And
     a warm hug.

     Hannah steps in her car, starts it up and rolls down the
     window.

     A final wave and Henry watches as she disappears into the
     night. He sighs.

Conversation interrupted by RINGING DOORBELL. Hannah frowns
at the interruption as Maureen scurries to the door and opens
it, revealing Colette hiding behind a HUGE GIFT BASKET. She
breezes in. Takes over. Over the top.

Long beat. Conversation over. The three women wait for one
another to speak. Colette checks her watch.

     Rows of EYE GLASSES on display as Alan guides Hannah over to

<b>                           HANNAH
</b>               Thanks for seeing me today, Alan.

<b>                           ALAN

</b>               You're already smart, Hannah.

     Hannah gives Henry's hand a playful squeeze: Thank you.
     Alan and Hannah sit down opposite from each other. Henry
     pulls up a chair to the side. Alan selects a pair. Puts them
     on Hannah.

Hannah shrugs her blase reaction.

<b>                         HANNAH
</b>          Mmmmmmm.

Alan removes the brown-colored frames.   Studies them for a
second. Then -- inspiration arrives.

<b>                       ALAN
</b>          Excuse me.   One sec.

He reaches inside his coat pocket for his RECORDER. Speaks
into it.

<b>                      ALAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Ah. Name for character. Alexander
          Brown. Wears brown-colored glasses.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          Of course he would.

Henry nods, agreeing. Satisfied, Alan puts the recorder
away and reaches for another pair of glasses.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          You know this great idea for a novel
          hit me this morning. It's called
          Unleashed.

Alan tries the second pair on Hannah. She checks herself in
the mirror. Then she shows Henry. They both shake their head:
No. It is a funny moment between friends. They laugh as Alan
reaches for pair #3.

<b>                      ALAN (CONT'D)
</b>          It's about a dog who becomes human
          for 24 hours in order to rescue his
          kidnapped owner. I love this idea,
          Hannah.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          Could be a winner.

Alan puts the third pair of glasses on Hannah. She checks
herself in the mirror, finally liking what she sees. She
looks over towards Henry.

<b>                      HANNAH (CONT'D)
</b>          What do you think?

Poor Henry. She does look good. He's falling even harder for
her by the moment.

<b>                           HENRY

     Hannah can't decide. She studies herself in the mirror as
     Henry studies her. Henry reaches for his ANDROID and snaps
     a photo of her. Alan brings them back to real time.

<b>                           ALAN
</b>               Question: You think your agent might
               be interested in this idea? Does he
               have a dog?

<b>                           HANNAH

               Oh. I don't know--

<b>                           ALAN
</b>               How about a cat? It could be a cat.

<b>                            HANNAH
</b>               Um. Sure.   Probably could be.

<b>                           ALAN
</b>               Think about mentioning it to your
               agent, OK? Unleashed. Dog -- or cat --
               becomes human.

     Alan beams with pride at his imagination on display. Hannah
     fidgets. Avoids Alan. Henry jumps in to save the moment.

<b>                           HENRY
</b>               I'll help you develop the idea, Alan.

     Alan looks pleased. Hannah looks grateful.

</b>
     The TWO MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN (CUSTOMER #1 AND CUSTOMER #2) sit
     across from each other in the nearly-deserted restaurant.

     Body language suggests an intense, passionate, personal chat.

<b>                           WILLIAM (V.O.)
</b>               A writer has to hear everything. On
               the streets. In the restaurants.

     But something's amiss. Customer #1 stops abruptly, glancing
     at the table next to them: William has suddenly materialized.
     Sitting with a cup of coffee and a legal pad, scribbling.

<b>                           WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>               My dialogue has to be real so I'm

</b>
Customer #1 resumes conversation, but looks sharply back at
William. His head is tilted towards them. Listening.

<b>                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Peeing next to you at the urinal. I
          watch. I listen.

Customer #1 says something to Customer #2. Looks back at
William. His head is still cocked as he makes notes.

<b>                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Writing down scraps of conversation.

Customer #1 grows more agitated. Customer #2 tries to calm
her down. Finally, Customer #1 shoots up and marches over
to William, her finger jabbing in the air towards the
notebook. William shrugs, playing dumb.

<b>                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          That's right. I eavesdrop.

Customer #1 reaches down and grabs the notebook from William.
He tries to stop her, but too late.

<b>                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          How else do you accurately capture
          the misery of the human condition?

She reads the page and shows it to Cutomer #2 who reads the
notes and is equally shocked.

<b>                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Now Bukowski says "An intellectual
          says a simple thing in a hard way."

The two women start yelling at William. He keeps shaking his
head. Customer #1 tears the page into shreds.

<b>                       WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          "An artist says a hard thing in a

Waitress #2 comes over. The women talk to her and she starts
yelling at William. Customer #1 poking her finger in his
chest. Escalates to a push. The COOK comes out and starts
yelling at William.

<b>                      WILLIAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Gotta love it. That's me. Simple.
          Real.

Surrounded by yelling people, William breaks through the
circle and moves towards the door. The BUS BOY yells, too.

     John grins for the camera. The reason why sits next to him
     in the matching LAWN CHAIRS.

     The WOMAN is clearly younger than John. Plainly dressed in a
     faded sweat shirt. Little makeup. Nervous in front of the
     camera, but she looks more at us than she does at John. He

</b>                Herr Simon Cowell. Very rich. Very

               Butzin has some news to announce, as

     John holds up a BROCHURE.

               moment forever. Finally, a Butzin
               is going to be a published author.

     A voice drifts in from another room.

<b>                           SIGRID (O.S.)

     motion with his finger across the neck.

     Henry's turn to host the group meeting. Alan, William,
     Colette, and John share the lumpy couch and the folding metal
     chairs. Open PIZZA STARZ BOXES in the background.

     Everyone is enjoying a single slice of pizza off a paper
     plate--except for John, who is inhaling two pieces at once.
     The mood is somber. Quiet.

<b>                           WILLIAM
</b>               Hannah's just lucky. That's all.

     John tries to agree, but his mouth is too stuffed with pizza.
     Cheap FLOWERS from Ralph's and BALLOONS in full display on
     the coffee table. Henry stands--listening--by the front
     door.

     Henry opens the door. Hannah floats in.

     The serious expressions suddenly, magically, turn to broad
     smiles. Henry is the first to offer a hug.

Hannah notices the balloons and flowers.

extra long hug.

     reads from Roaring Lion.

               Gunner stared out over the bleak
               horizon, seeing one dead Viet Cong
               after another lay scattered on the
               bloody hillside. He had won this
               time, but Gunner knew Charlie would
               be back in the morning. By god, he

               General Purpose Machine Gun and Mark

     himself.

John points towards Hannah.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          We'll hear from everybody.

<b>                      JOHN

          She has a book coming out. John K.
          Butzin has a book coming out. I want
          to hear from Hannah, author to author.

</b>          Oh, screw you.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          This is really going against the
          spirit of the group, John. Everyone's
          opinion is valid.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>          Hers is more valid. What'd you think,

Hannah struggles to speak. Clearly uncomfortable.

William thunders away from the group. Colette watches him
go.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          I'll go talk to him.

Colette follows, calling after William.

     Embarrassed, Hannah excuses herself. Henry trails along after
     her, leaving a muttering John and calm Alan alone. Alan
     reaches for his recorder. Talks into it.

     Camera goes to Dr. Xiroman. Somber, expressionless. Does he
     even have a pulse?

     Dr. Xiroman walks over to small fire pit and meditates as he
     places his hands over the rising flames. Colette begins a
     New Age chant for added support.

     THREE YOUNG MEN in the corner booth. Jeans and baseball caps.
     Very animated conversation. Loud, punctuated by laughter.
     They think they're the only people in the joint. The WAITRESS--
     EUDORA (20's)--with the purple streaks in her hair and
     matching purple glasses, refills their cups.

     William sits alone at the counter, impossible to hide his
     disdain. He talks to the camera with the three men in the

     William glances over his shoulder, shaking his head in
     disgust. Another table catches his eye. TWO ATTRACTIVE WOMEN
     engage in friendly banter over coffee. William stares them
     down, making friendly eye contact.

     The woman facing him returns eye contact. She smiles.   William
     smiles, watching them as he continues.

               dollar.

     The two women stand up. William is stoked. This is too easy.

     Standard examination room. Alan guides David into the chair.

<b>                           ALAN
</b>               Great. Let's start out with a basic
               eye examination.

     Alan flips a couple SWITCHES. Eye reading CHART appears on
     the wall. Alan turns off the lights.

<b>                           ALAN (CONT'D)

          Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed
          oh-so-slowly, consumed totally,
          completely, absolutely, by endless
          thoughts of Yuri.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          Oh. Very nice. Very nice. Now the

David looks rather puzzled, but complies.

          "I never, ever thought I could feel
          this way," Natasha said excitedly.
          "Nor could I," Yuri said happily,
          his body dripping with enormous beads
          of sweat.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          Man. Wow. Gee. Isn't that great

A loud KNOCK on the examination room door. David is saved by
the bell.

<b>                      ALAN (CONT'D)
</b>          My, I wonder who that could be.

He walks over to the door, opens it and feigns surprise to
see Colette. She moves right in.

<b>                       COLETTE
</b>          Hi, honey.   So sorry to intrude.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          Colette? Gee, this is an incredible
          coincidence. We were just talking
          about you. And here you are!

Colette is locked like a laser beam on David Keller.

<b>                      COLETTE

<b>                           DAVID

</b>               Actually, Colette wrote this beautiful
               prose you've been reading, David.
               Honey, I can't believe this
               coincidence.

<b>                           COLETTE
</b>               Well, I was just dropping off--

               Oh, of course. Thanks for bringing
               it by. Say, honey, David's been
               reading that first page of yours.
               You don't happen to have any more of
               that opening chapter, do you?

     Colette thinks for a second.

<b>                           COLETTE
</b>               As a matter of fact, I think I do. I
               think I do.

     Colette searches her large PURSE and produces a manila folder.

<b>                           ALAN
</b>               Say, how about that?

     Colette hands the manila folder to David, who accepts it
     reluctantly. He's been had.

<b>                           DAVID

     Colette sits in the chair, Alan stands behind her, massaging
     her shoulders. Both share that smirk of satisfaction.

<b>                           COLETTE
</b>               That went very well.

<b>                           COLETTE
</b>               Though David Keller did seem in a
               hurry to leave.

<b>                           ALAN
</b>               The sooner he can begin reading.

     Colette buys that.    Of course.

<b>                           COLETTE
</b>               I bet he calls tomorrow with an offer.

<b>                           ALAN
</b>               I bet he calls tonight.

     Alan's left hand starts to slide down towards Colette's chest.
     She doesn't notice--her mind is elsewhere.

     her new glasses, reading typed pages. Henry sits close to

</b>               Yeah. Sure wish I knew what was going

     Hannah gives Henry a friendly tap on the knee for
     encouragement.

<b>                           HANNAH
</b>               You'll figure it out, Henry. It'll

               distractions. The writing comes first.

     Henry lets it sink in.   Changes the subject.

<b>                           HENRY
</b>               Say, um, remember I offered to drive

     Henry and Hannah stand on the sidewalk in front of the North
     Hayworth home. Henry seems barely able to contain his
     excitement.

Hannah stares blankly at the house.

<b>                      HENRY (CONT'D)
</b>          North Hayworth Avenue. Hollywood,
          California.

Hannah smiles politely, but it's clear she doesn't recognize
the house.

<b>                      HENRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Big clue time. Sheila Graham.

Still nothing registers with Hannah.

<b>                      HENRY (CONT'D)
</b>          OK. Give up? Writer Sheila Graham
          lived here. Fitzgerald was her lover.
          This is where he died on December

Hannah lets it all sink in.

<b>                      HANNAH

          himself, right?

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          No. Fitzgerald. F. Scott Fitzgerald.
          He wrote The Great Gatsby.

The name doesn't register with Hannah.

<b>                      HENRY (CONT'D)
</b>              (Reciting from heart)
          Gatsby believed in the green light,
          the orgiastic future that year by

          then, but that's--

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>              (Interjecting)
          I've never read it.

Henry can't hide his surprise.

<b>                         HENRY
</b>          What?

Hannah stops, cognizant of the ever-present camera.
<b>                                                           47.

          minutes, please?

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          You know they can't. What's wrong?

Hannah hesitates.   Counts to three. Lowers her voice.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          I've never read The Great Gatsby.

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          You're kidding.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          Henry. I never went to college.
          I've heard of Hemingway. A little.
          Fitzgerald. Somewhere. But I don't
          have your education. Your smarts. I
          haven't read all these great novels.
          My stories come from my heart.

Henry lets it all sink in.    Hannah looks at the house.

<b>                      HANNAH (CONT'D)
</b>          Tell me about the book.

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          Gatsby is about social position and
          the American Dream and . . .

Henry stops. Rethinks his explanation.

<b>                      HENRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Actually, it's quite simple. Boy
          meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy
          moves heaven and earth to win the
          girl back.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          And it's your favorite?

Henry nods with his heart.

<b>                      HANNAH (CONT'D)
</b>          So how does it end? Does boy get the
          girl?

Long beat. Then Henry reaches into the back seat of his car
for his KNAPSACK. Puts it on his lap, unzips it. Pulls out
his personal copy of Gatsby.
<b>                                                                  48.

               is finally a published author.

     But catch Sigrid's expression. She is quiet.     More than a
     little concerned at what she is hearing.

     Henry and Hannah at a table, sharing coffee. Eudora the
     waitress swings by with a refill, hair purple as ever. Hannah
     thumbs through her copy of Gatsby, looking interested. And
     pleased. Eudora notices the book.

<b>                             EUDORA
</b>               Great book.    Classic.

     Henry nods in agreement.   Eudora moves on.

<b>                           HANNAH
</b>               It's just that I'm starting to feel
               the pressure, you know? There is so
               much riding on this first book.

<b>                           HENRY
</b>               Don't be silly. Sleeping on the
               Moon will hit the bestseller list.
               You'll be the toast of the literary
               world. And I'll come over to Beverly
               Hills and deliver a pizza to you.

     Parked on the street in front of Hannah's apartment. Henry
     and Hannah, this mutual admiration society, stand by the
     car. Hannah still has her copy of Gatsby. Short beat.

<b>                           HANNAH
</b>               What a dear, sweet friend you are.

     Hannah graces Henry with another hug. Another quick peck on
     the lips. But wait--Henry wants more. He kisses her back.
     More than a peck. Too much more. Hannah, surprised, pulls
     back--her hand on his chest: Stop.

               No distractions. The writing comes
               first, 'kay?

     Henry nods reluctantly: Understood. One last hug from Hannah
     before she heads for her front door, smiling back over her
     shoulder at Henry. Henry watches her leave, knowing that
     this was absolutely, positively, the best day of his life.

     Maureen, trying not to be in the way, goes from writer to

          have anything new ready tonight.

Concerned looks all around.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          It's been weeks, Henry.

<b>                       HENRY
</b>          I know.   Still can't focus.

</b>          Writer's block can be very serious,

John scoffs in disbelief. Maureen offers William some veggies.
He helps himself and checks out Maureen as she moves on to
Alan.

<b>                      WILLIAM
</b>          What's so hard, bro'? I mean, you've

          Tell their story.

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          That's the problem. I think the
          story's changing.

<b>                       ALAN
</b>          Changing?   How so?

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          Lately I'm feeling something much
          deeper, much richer. Scott and
          Christy, um, growing closer.

The other group members appear puzzled.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          Christy's a beautiful, wealthy author
          in Beverly Hills. How close can they
          get?

<b>                      HENRY

Henry does everything he can not to look at Hannah. Short
beat.

<b>                        WILLIAM
</b>          Nah.    Don't buy it.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>          They're friends. Why muck it up?
          Don't put 'em in the same foxhole.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          Is this Scott wanting to go beyond
          the friendship? There's no way
          Christy would suggest it. What do
          you think, Hannah?

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          Yes. Hannah, what do you think?

All eyes go back to Hannah.     She does not want to answer.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          Gee, I-I guess...I really never
          thought of them that way.

<b>                        HENRY
</b>          Never?

Hannah shakes her head.   Chooses her words carefully.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          No. It's always been a friendship.

Henry takes a moment.   Thinking.

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          You don't see anything possibly
          happening between them?

</b>          No.    Friends. Nothing more.

<b>                        WILLIAM
</b>          Exactly.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          I'd be uncomfortable with any changes
          in the relationship.

Message received. All eyes on Henry. Defeated.

     Meeting over. Writing group starts breaking up. William
     leans in close by Hannah.

</b>                   (Lowered voice)
               Got a sec?

     William motions Hannah over to the corner of the living room,
     away from the others. She follows, looking puzzled. Henry
     watches with curiosity. William starts speaking to Hannah in
     hushed tones, trying not to let anyone else overhear the
     conversation.

<b>                           HANNAH
</b>               How much?

     More hushed tones from William. Hannah shakes her head.

<b>                           HANNAH (CONT'D)
</b>               But if I loaned you money, then I
               wouldn't have it.

<b>                           WILLIAM
</b>               Hey, I just figured, you know. You
               got that big advance. Help out a
               fellow writer. I'm good for it,
               Hannah.

<b>                           HANNAH
</b>               Sorry. It's bad luck to loan money.

<b>                           WILLIAM
</b>               OK, then, just give it to me.

     Henry makes a point of moving in and standing directly by
     Hannah, staring William down. Henry and Hannah make eye
     contact. Henry looks to her: Are we OK? Hannah looks away.

     Colette comes up next to William.

     Nervous, Sigrid takes a deep breath and taps away on the
     computer keys. She waits, focused intently on the screen.

     uncomfortable. Sigrid types away on the computer keys again.
     Reads off the screen.

     Full meeting of the writing group, all crammed around the
     dining table. Henry and Hannah sit apart.

     A single BOWL OF PRETZELS has been placed before them. Hannah
     reads from her typed pages. Alan, William, Colette, and Henry
     hang on her every word.

     John is half-listening at best, more interested in the
     MAGAZINE he's thumbing through.

     William REACHES UNDER THE TABLE and gently squeezes Colette's
     hand. Surprised, she pulls her hand away.

<b>                           HANNAH

               "Please come home, Michael." "Why
               would you want to marry me, Kyra? I
               barely graduated high school."
               "Michael, I don't care about some
               silly college degree. You're the
               most intelligent person I've ever
               known. You are my shining star."

     Then Colette puts it back and squeezes William's hand. It's
     his turn to be surprised.

     Hannah slides off her new reading glasses, waiting for someone
     to react. The room falls silent. Alan steps in.

<b>                            ALAN
</b>               OK.   Comments. Anyone?

     No response. Group members look at the pages.      At each other.
     No one steps forward.

<b>                           HANNAH
</b>               I value your feedback.    We're all in

</b>               Colette--Did the new scene work for
               you?

     Colette seems thrown by the direct question.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          Oh...Gee...Hannah. What? I mean,
          you're being published. This is
          being published.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          But my editor wants rewrites.      Am I
          on track?

Colette punts.   Alan jumps in to save his wife.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          Of course you are, Hannah.

<b>                      WILLIAM
</b>          You got the deal. You got the check.
          First one to be published.

John CLEARS HIS THROAT rather loudly: What about me, butthead?
William ignores him.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          I think what I'm hearing from the
          group is...is...you're fine. We all
          love it. Nothing here to critique.
          You don't need us--well, it's not
          that you don't need us, but, you
          know...

Alan's voice trails off before he can dig himself any deeper.
More silence as Hannah wrestles with this unexpected reaction.
Finally looks to Henry for help.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          What do you think, Henry?

All eyes on Henry. He hesitates.   Then --

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          Yes. Actually, it is really good,
          but there are a couple things--little
          things--I'd point out. For example--

All eyes on John. Finally holds up magazine to reveal that
he's been reading VARIETY.

     John keeps reading. Various reactions, mostly muted, around
     the table. Can Hannah's face turn any redder?

     Members of the writing group struggle to deal with Hannah's
     latest success:

     Alan and Colette sit on their living room couch together,
     wearing matching pajamas, staring straight ahead like zombies.
     His tape recorder sits on the coffee table. Alan reaches
     for it. She grabs it from his hand and throws it.

     William sits at the counter of Restaurant #2, drumming his
     fingers on the legal pad, half-heartedly trying to write.
     WAITRESS #3 pours him some more coffee, trying to make eye
     contact with him. William ignores her.

     John sits in front of his computer screen, but he can't
     concentrate. Gives up. Shuts down computer. Flips on TV.
     Another war movie.

     Henry stares absent-mindedly at his wall of rejection letters.

     Hannah sits at her computer--the only one actually working
     at the moment--but she stops long enough to take a deep,
     deep sigh. A lot weighs on her mind.

     Alan arrives home. Steps out of his Lexus. Whistling. Happy-

     William is plopped on the living room couch. Shirt half
     unbuttoned. Smoking. He freezes mid-puff.

</b>                Hey.   Alan.

     SOUND OF SHOWER AND COLETTE SINGING OFF-KEY echoes throughout
     the house. Alan turns quiet as he makes the connection.

<b>                            WILLIAM (CONT'D)
</b>                Just, um. Just stopped by to...read

     There are no pages on the coffee table in front of William.

     Alan steps outside. Somber. Focused. Acts like the
     Terminator in his scanning of the area. Man on a mission.
     What is he looking for? He finds it almost immediately,
     zeroing in on Colette's bench. Alan marches over and grabs
     Colette's prized framed photo of Oprah. Clutching it in his
     hand, Alan looks at Oprah's smiling face, then back towards
     the house. Then he takes the frame and smashes it down on
     the ground as hard as he can. Next he jumps up and down on
     the smashed frame multiple times. Not satisfied, Alan bends
     down, picks up the photo and rips it to shreds with his hands.
     There. That felt good.

     Pool Guy and Gardener have witnessed the whole scene.    What
     the hell? They exchange puzzled looks.

</b>               Yes. You noticed. I replaced the

               things around here soon...I was just
               using William...for research.

               offered him a massage. How much
               more rejection can I take?

     Smoke rises from the fire pit, burning what's left of the
     letters. Colette sits cross-legged, devoting her full energy
     to chanting and beating her hands on a small DRUM.

     It isn't enough today. Watch as Colette's solemn chant
     dissolves into tears of frustration.

     Sitting outside in the cheap lawn chairs with Sigrid, John
     addresses the camera. He cleans up pretty good.

     Sigrid holds up a copy of Roaring Lion. The dog on the cover
     has had an image of a lion slapped over it. Sigrid beams
     with pride.

               going to let her favorite author
               sign a few books there.

     John sits at his card table in the corner. Alone. A stack of
     books sit piled in front of him. CUSTOMERS walk all around,
     ignoring John completely. John tries to stay relaxed, smiling
     and nodding at people, not being too forceful.

     Sigrid, wearing her little red work vest and glasses, stands
     off to the side, beaming with pride. She hurries over to a
     cash register, takes the telephone out of her surprised boss'
     hand, and jumps on the store's PA SYSTEM, blasting throughout
     the store.

     John looks past Sigrid. His face brightens. A smiling Alan
     has arrived, flanked by Colette, Henry and Hannah. Hannah
     holds a cupcake. Alan has a bottle of champagne and some
     plastic cups. But there is no touching, no direct
     interaction, between Colette and Alan.

     Hannah presents John with the cupcake and leans in for a
     friendly peck on the cheek. Colette aims her cell phone
     camera at John.

     Awkward silence as the group members exchange puzzled looks.

<b>                           ALAN
</b>               Maybe you should.

     What's that about? Henry studies John's book.       Flips to the
     back cover. Surprised.

     All eyes on John. Squirming, he looks over to Sigrid: Help
     me. She thinks for a second.

     John addresses the camera.

           frickin' hilarious coming from you.
           When's the last time you wrote
           anything?

That hits a nerve. William and Henry stare each other down.
Enough. William flips off the group with his middle finger.
Mumbling, grumbling under his breath, he starts to leave.
Pauses at the WRITERS AT WORK sign. Picks it up.

     Too late. William RIPS it in two. And a second time for
     good measure. Throwing the pieces on the ground. Stomps out
     of the house, slamming the front door.

     The group turns quiet for a long beat. Everyone calming down.

     Alan takes control again -- eyes still darting over to what's
     left of his beloved sign.

     Large bookstore. Long line. Why? Because Richard Benedict
     is in the building, doing a signing of his new novel The
     Pineapple Man.

     Hannah, Henry, Alan, and Colette stand in line together,
     waiting. Colette is holding one copy of the BOOK. Hannah
     has one. Henry has one.

     Alan reaches inside his coat pocket for his RECORDER. Snaps
     it on.

     his neck to see what's happening.

               No. Hi. I'm Henry. I just think you're
               the greatest...

     Colette puts a friendly hand on Henry's shoulder.

     John is bent over his PRINTER, jiggling the front end, trying
     to open it. Tapping it on the side. No luck.

</b>               Nope. Not going to see Richard

               every minute, every dollar, on
               promoting Roaring Lion.

     Try as he might, John can't open up his printer. Sigrid
     appears. Leans in. Effortlessly opens up the printer. Takes
     the cartridge from John. Snaps it in. Shuts the lid. Done.
     John grunts his thanks.

     at the screen.

               already.

     Sigrid types again. Reads off the screen.

</b>               John Grisham. 12.

     Forget about John for the moment. Watch Sigrid as her eyes
     dart around--from the screen, to John in the chair, out the
     window. Back again. This is the moment. Sigrid gets it
     now: John K. Butzin is not the author he pretends to be.
     Very quiet in the mobile home.

     The AUTHOR (50's) sits at the signing table, obliging, but
     not outgoing, grunting hello to people and smiling (somewhat)
     for photos as he signs BOOKS. He is not here by choice today.

<b>     CAPTION: RICHARD BENEDICT
</b>
     The young CLERK hovers nearby, assisting with books and trying
     to keep the line moving.

     Henry is first, followed by Alan and Colette, then Hannah.
     Henry clutches his copy. Good luck trying to rip it from
     his hands. The four get nearer to Benedict.

<b>                           ALAN
</b>               He's older than I thought.

               novel.

     Closer...Closer...Closer they get to the table. Richard signs
     away. Henry seems transfixed by him. Now it's his turn to
     have his book signed.

<b>                           CLERK
</b>               Next, please.

     The moment has arrived. Henry stands directly in front of
     Richard Benedict. Henry seems nervous. Too nervous to speak.
     Richard looks up and for the slightest, milli-second their
     eyes meet.

     At that exact moment, RICHARD'S CELL PHONE GOES OFF. He
     answers.

<b>                           RICHARD

     Henry stands there, unable to move, staring at Richard while
     he speaks on the phone.

          Sir?

Alan intervenes. He takes Henry's copy of the novel and slides
it over to Benedict. Benedict scribbles his name quickly and
slides it back with no eye contact, yelling on the phone.

<b>                      RICHARD
</b>              (On phone)
          Absolutely not! I'll sue that bastard

Alan grabs the book and gives it back to Henry, nudging him
again.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          We need to move, Henry.

Alan and Colette slide their book over to Richard.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          Hi there.

Richard looks up at her for a split second and decides to
ignore her. Another scribbled signature as he remains on
the phone.

Colette takes the book, trying not to look hurt. Alan grabs
Henry and they leave the area. Hannah is next up. She puts
her book down on the table.

<b>                      RICHARD

Richard glances up. Sees Hannah standing there. He stops in
mid-sentence. Smiles.

</b>          Hi.

<b>                      HANNAH
</b>          Hello.

Richard hangs up the phone.

The two start chatting. Camera goes over to the shell-shocked
Henry, still clutching his book, watching as Hannah and
Richard carry on. Henry is so disconcerted by what he sees
that he fails to notice Eudora, still with purple hair and
matching glasses, the very next person in line behind Hannah,
waving at him.

Henry inches closer to Hannah, forcing Hannah to move back,
creating an uneasy dance between the two. She turns her
back on Henry.

               to Richard Benedict. She has every
               intention of seeing him.

     There. On the discount table up by the cash register lies a
     pile of Roaring Lion books under another handmade SIGN: 50%
     OFF! Sigrid stares at the pile of unwanted books in quiet
     contemplation. Heavy sigh.

     Sigrid glances up. Her boss watches her from the cash
     register with a certain longing. He smiles. Sigrid returns
     the smile.

     Back to business. Sigrid pulls a wad of DOLLAR BILLS from
     her hip pocket. Counts quickly. Then picks up John's books,
     one by one.

     John looks like the proverbial kid in a candy store.   In
     total shock as he clutches a handful of TWENTIES.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>               Wow! All the books sold at the
               hardware store?

<b>                            SIGRID
</b>               Ja.   Every one.

     John claps his hands together. There is a certain spring in
     his feet.

<b>                           JOHN
</b>               Didn't I tell you, Strudel?   Write
               it and they will read.

     John can't contain his enthusiasm as he paces the mobile
     home, his mind racing. Sigrid is more composed.

<b>                           JOHN (CONT'D)

</b>
     And he's off, leaving the frame, already planning his big
     adventure, leaving Sigrid alone.

     Facing the camera, she nods slightly. Then offers us a small
     wave.

<b>                             SIGRID
</b>               Bye.   Bye.

</b>
     The small reception area for The Lois Piper Agency. Tastefully
     decorated. PHONES constantly chirping.

     The young MALE ASSISTANT behind the counter, obviously paid
     to be patient, points to the framed sign on the counter, in
     large letters: NO UNSOLICITED MANUSCRIPTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

     Colette and Dr. Xiroman will not be deterred. She holds a
     thick MANILA ENVELOPE.

<b>                            COLETTE
</b>               I have to see Ms. Piper. We just
               need five minutes. 1-2-3-4-5 minutes
               of her time.

     The assistant points back to the sign.

<b>                           COLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>               Can you just please stick your head
               in her office, tell her that Colette
               Mooney is here. I know she's busy,
               but she'll certainly want to see my
               manuscript.

     The assistant ignores her.

<b>                           COLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>                   (Flustered)
               I'm a graduate of Mills College.

     Behind them, coming from the inner office, we hear LOIS PIPER
<b>     YELLING.
</b>
<b>                           LOIS (O.S.)

               story, I swear I'll drive a stake
               through my own goddamn heart.

     MANUSCRIPT comes flying out of her office. Loose pages
     splatter everywhere in the main office. Lois Piper quickly
     follows. Older. Tired. Needs a drink. Now.

<b>     CAPTION: LOIS PIPER
</b><b>                                                               76.

               their dogs! Just shoot me now!

     It is at that moment when Lois first notices the camera.
     Caught off-guard. What the hell??? Colette cranes her neck
     over the assistant.

<b>                            COLETTE
</b>               Ms. Piper?   Ms. Piper?

     Lois turns her attention to Colette. Who are you? Then--
     magically--Lois changes. A big smile replaces the scowl.
     She marches towards Colette, who is clearly not expecting a
     warm reception.

     Lois walks right past Colette and instead warmly shakes hands
     with Dr. Xiroman.

<b>                           LOIS
</b>               Dr. Xiroman. I can't believe you're
               here. How lovely to see you again.

     Dr. Xiroman nods his head in greeting.

<b>                           LOIS (CONT'D)
</b>               Just in the neighborhood? Please
               come in for a minute.

     Another glance at the camera. Then, taking Dr. Xiroman by
     the elbow, Lois guides him back towards her office, completely
     snubbing a bewildered Colette.

<b>                           LOIS (CONT'D)
</b>               My family talks about you all the
               time. You were so helpful to my
               sister. She's doing much better.

     Colette stands there helplessly, watching her future walk
     away. The assistant points in their direction: Get in there!

<b>96   INT. PIPER OFFICE - DAY                                          96
</b>
     Lois plops down behind her desk. Stacks of MANUSCRIPTS cover
     her desk. Dr. Xiroman sits quietly in one chair. Colette
     sits next to him.

<b>                           LOIS

               Look at my desk, Dr. Xiroman. Look
               at all this. Do you know what it is?
               Crap. It's all crap. Crap. Crap.
               Crap. I hate my job. I hate my life.

Dr. Xiroman nods: I understand.

<b>                      LOIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Know what I feel like doing?

She looks at the camera.

<b>                      LOIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Come in closer. I want you to get
          this. Closer. C'mon. More. Closer.

Satisfied, Lois takes her free hand and SHOVES ALL THE
MANUSCRIPTS off her desk, sending them flying on the floor.

<b>                        LOIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Wheeeeee!

Colette looks aghast.   Lois seems free at last.

<b>                      LOIS (CONT'D)
</b>          That was so...liberating. I haven't
          felt this good since that night in
          Paris with Salman Rushdie.

Lois growls like a tiger at the memory.

<b>                      LOIS (CONT'D)
</b>          I envy you, Dr. Xiroman. Know that?
          Look at your life. Your work. You
          helped my sister. You've helped so
          many people. You have such a positive
          message to share.

The camera picks up on Lois as the light goes on, the wheels
start turning in her head.

<b>                      LOIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a
          minute. A positive message to share.

          What?

<b>                      LOIS
</b>          Of course. Dr. Xiroman, you should
          write a book. This could be a whole
          series.

<b>                            COLETTE
</b>               But--

     Dr. Xiroman has no reaction. Colette can't believe what she
     is hearing.

</b>               Getting from Xiro to One by Doctor

<b>                            COLETTE
</b>               But--But.   What about me?

     Lois shoots her a look: What about you? Colette backs down--
     not wanting to spoil the moment. Lois yells for her assistant.
     Finally a slight smile crosses Dr. Xiroman's face.

<b>97   INT. PIPER OFFICE - DAY                                            97

     Dr. Xiroman beams as he signs the standard agency contract
     so quickly drawn up for him. Lois and her Assistant appear
     equally excited.

     COLETTE fidgets off to the side. Then Lois hands her the pen
     and points her towards the contract.

      Henry delivers another pizza. Pockets the money as he walks
      back to his car, whistling. Checks his delivery list. Stares
      at the next address in sudden disbelief.

<b>                              HENRY
</b>                Shit!

<b>100   EXT. RICHARD BENEDICT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                              100

      Henry stands in the doorway, glumly clutching the PIZZA BOX.
      Hesitates. Finally rings doorbell. Pause. Followed by LOUD
      LAUGHTER. Door swings open. Richard stands there, wearing
      only his jeans. His hair is a mess.

<b>                            RICHARD
</b>                You're late, Pizza Boy.

      Richard finally notices the camera.

<b>                              RICHARD (CONT'D)
</b>                What the --

                They're with me. Your total comes to
                nineteen dollars and sixty-five cents.

      Richard pulls a crumpled twenty from his jean pocket. He
      hands it to Henry. Then reconsiders, calling inside.

<b>                            RICHARD
</b>                Babe, I need a single.

      No response.

<b>                              WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>                Coming!

      Richard gives a last glance to the camera. He's got better
      things to do. Off he goes.

      Short beat. Hannah comes to the door wearing Richard's shirt
      and little else, carrying a single dollar bill.

<b>                              HANNAH
</b>                Here you--

      Her words freeze up as she recognizes Henry. Henry and Hannah
      lock eyes for a long beat. Poor kid. This is the moment.

Reality smacks him in the face. Hard.

Hannah starts to hand Henry the money. He puts his hands up:
No thanks. Hannah doesn't press. Henry can't hold back any
longer.

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          No distractions. The writing comes
          first.

<b>                      HANNAH

<b>                        HENRY
</b>          Yeah.    I bet he is.

Quietly seething, Henry nods towards the camera.

<b>                      HENRY (CONT'D)
</b>          How much better are you, Hannah?
          Show us. Who wrote Slaughterhouse

      She hesitates.   Not for long.

</b>                I'm not the one delivering pizzas

                but my book is being published. Is
                yours?

      Henry has no comeback. Hannah stares him down. The dollar
      bill drops from her hand on to the ground. She retreats
      back inside the house, firmly closing the front door, leaving
      Henry alone.

      Only then do we notice the number of the house: 4441.

<b>101   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                   101
</b>
      We've never seen Henry like this. He rips down all his Richard
      Benedict photos from the wall. Collects all his Benedict
      books. Stuffs everything in a CARDBOARD BOX. Next he turns
      his attention to all the rejection letters on the wall. Lot
      of rejection. Gives them a long look. Then he snaps up the
      photo of Hannah from near his computer. He takes the photo
      and tacks it dead center in the middle of all his rejection
      letters.

      Henry stares at the photo, oblivious to the camera, consumed
      by Hannah's radiant smile. His latest, and most painful,
      rejection. It's over.

      Henry understands what must be done. He goes over to his
      desk. Sits down at his laptop. One last glance over at
      Hannah's photo as he turns the computer on.

      He contemplates for a second. Then begins typing.

      Back to the two lawn chairs--with one prime difference.
      Sigrid's chair is empty. John sits by himself. This is a
      softer, more reflective, John talking to the camera.

                 of my second wife. Thank god she
                 wasn't anything like my third wife.
                 I did the right thing. Yes, sir.

      Good acting, John. He looks back to the empty chair. Can't
      avoid reaching over and giving the arm rest a little love
      tap.

      John packs COPIES OF HIS BOOK ever-so-carefully into an old

      John gazes over at his photo on the wall. Salutes himself.

<b>105   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               105

      Meeting of the writing group. Not yet started. John, Alan,
      and Hannah sit around the table. No refreshments being
      served. No small talk. Everyone is quiet.

      Hannah looks fantastic. More makeup. Nicer clothes. Fidgets
      in her chair. Seems anxious. Stares at her new KINDLE.

      FRONT DOOR opens and closes. FOOTSTEPS approaching. It's
      Henry. Looks determined. Man on a mission. Carries a satchel.

<b>                             HENRY

John grunts something. Hannah remains quiet. Avoids eye
contact with Henry. Henry reaches into his satchel and pulls
out stapled, typed pages. Multiple copies. Hands one to
each of the three group members. Puts another down where
Colette will sit.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>          Wutch you got here, Obert?

<b>                       HENRY
</b>          New pages.   I'm ready to read.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          Way to go, Henry.

Even Hannah looks surprised. She and Alan thumb through their
copies. John sniffs at the front page. Henry slides in across
from Hannah. Looks satisfied. FRONT DOOR opens again. MORE
FOOTSTEPS. Colette arrives with Dr. Xiroman in tow. Xiroman?
The others exchange puzzled glances.

<b>                       JOHN
</b>          Christ.   What's he doing here?

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          I've invited Doctor Xiroman to join
          our writing group.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          You must be joking, Colette.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          I am not joking. And, as a matter
          of fact, I'll have all of you know
          that the doctor and I are soon to be
          published authors. We've signed with
          The Lois Piper Agency.

Colette stands there, waiting for the applause and
congratulations, but all she receives is stunned silence.

<b>                      HENRY
</b>          You can't do this.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          Why not? With William gone, we have
          an opening.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          Henry's right. We all have to agree
          on new members.

Hannah can't take it any longer. She throws up her hands.

</b>              (Yelling)
<b>          STOP!

The room turns quiet. All eyes on Hannah. She composes
herself.

<b>                         HANNAH (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm leaving.

Surprise all around.    Hannah avoids looking at Henry.

<b>                      HANNAH (CONT'D)
</b>          It's time. Richard is going to mentor
          me. Today's the 22nd. Two plus two
          equals four and we all know four's...

Her voice trails off.    Why bother explaining.   Just do it.

<b>                      HANNAH (CONT'D)
</b>          Anyway, I'm quitting.

There. She said it. Hannah looks so relieved. She's done.
Indignant, Colette stares her up and down.
<b>                                                            85.

Points to Dr.    Xiroman.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          Well, in this case one plus one equals
          one very successful writing team. I
          can't believe you, Hannah. You're
          doing this just to upstage our news
          about landing an agent.

<b>                        ALAN
</b>          Stop it...

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          No, this is what it's all about.
          The spotlight always has to be on
          Little Miss Sunshine. Her agent. Her
          book deal. Her movie deal.

John shoots to his feet.

          I'm done with you pussies.

John snatches up his folder and marches out of the house.
Silence. Colette starts to sit down at the table--motions
for Xiroman to join her. Final straw for Alan. Stares
directly at Colette.

<b>                        ALAN
</b>          Get out.    Now.

Colette can't believe what she's hearing.

<b>                      ALAN (CONT'D)
</b>          As the leader of this writing group,
          I've determined your actions are
          contrary to our stated purpose. Get
          out.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          You can't kick me out.    I live here.

She's right.    Alan considers his options.
<b>                                                               86.
</b>
<b>                       ALAN

Points to Xiroman.

<b>                      ALAN (CONT'D)
</b>          And take him with you. Won't be the
          first guy.

Alan means business.   Colette stands up straight.   Gathers
up her materials.

<b>                      COLETTE
</b>          We'll certainly have plenty to discuss
          in therapy.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          Go by yourself. I'm done.

<b>                     COLETTE
</b>          Oh. Just like always--Alan finishes
          first.

She grabs Dr. Xiroman's arm.

<b>                      COLETTE (CONT'D)
</b>          Come, Dr. Xiroman. I'm looking forward
          to working with a real doctor. On
          our new book.

Colette and Dr. Xiroman disappear. Frustrated, Alan takes a
deep breath. Reaches inside his coat pocket for his recorder.
Turns it on.

<b>                      ALAN
</b>          Idea for novel.

Alan hesitates. Thinks for a second. Turns off the recorder.
Slides it across the table to Henry.

<b>                      ALAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Here. Take it. Maybe you can use
          some of my ideas in your novel.

Alan flashes a "thumbs up" sign to Henry and to Hannah.    He
starts to leave, but remembers the camera.

<b>                      ALAN (CONT'D)
</b>              (To camera)
          This was supposed to be a reality
          series.

That's off his chest. Alan leaves Henry and Hannah alone at
the table. Awkward silence.

      He stands up. Calmly puts his typed pages back in his
      satchel. Leaves Alan's recorder on the table, walks away
      without looking back.

      Hannah's book release party. Great turnout. Her professional
      PHOTO adorns a POSTER announcing the publication of Sleeping
      on the Moon. Boy, Hannah looks terrific in that photo.
      Richard hovers around the makeshift bar, drink in hand.
      Maureen, looking radiant, accepts the congratulations of
      well-wishers. TABLE prominently centered has piles of Hannah's
      novel, waiting to be signed.

      Hannah talks to the camera, looking especially radiant. This
      is her day and she is more than ready for her close-up.
      Totally different in wardrobe and appearance.

<b>                            HANNAH

      Hannah waves to Richard. He waves back. Hannah glances around
      the room, as if looking for someone in particular.

      Hannah sits behind the table, signing books. Maureen stands
      behind her helping to orchestrate the line of people.

      Hannah acts very gracious. Signing a book, smiling and
      chatting up the guests. She seems at ease. Everything is
      going her way. She looks past the line. Her eyes light up
      and she jumps to her feet.

<b>                         HANNAH

Hannah bolts from the table, cuts through the line and finds
Henry standing alone.

<b>                         HENRY
</b>          Hi, Hannah.

</b>          Henry. Ohhhhh. Thank you. Thank
          you. Thank you so much for coming.

Hannah throws her arms around Henry, giving him a long
heartfelt hug, almost smothering the poor guy--not that he
complains. She lets go and gives Henry a friendly once-over.

<b>                      HANNAH (CONT'D)

scribbles something inside. She brings the book back over to
Henry.

                of.

      has written, For Henry, My Forever Friend xoxoxo Hannah.

                to sign Mr. Henry Obert and get Pizza
                to Go out there. I predict a best
                seller. Probably a movie, too.
                I'll call him with the good news. Or
                maybe I'll just order a pizza.

      Henry taking down the rejection letters from his walls and
      packing them in a cardboard BOX.

                rename it A Slice of LA. I did it.
                I sold my novel.

      Henry puts the last of the rejection letters away. Finally,
      he picks up a FRAMED PHOTO. INSERT shows the six members of
      the writing group from happier times--the photo snapped in

WAITRESS stops by the table, refilling Henry's cup. Then
setting the pot on the table, she reaches over and snatches
the copy of Gatsby.

Surprised, Henry glances up.

It's her again. That young waitress with purple streaks in
her hair and matching purple glasses thumbs through the book.
Henry finally checks out her name tag: Eudora.

Clutching the book, Eudora recites from memory:

</b>          Gatsby believed in the green light,

Eudora nods. Henry is amazed.

Eudora smiles, glad for the positive reinforcement.

      Henry bites his tongue.   Eudora nods towards the camera.

             A published author.

She smiles.

</b>             I knew him when.

She likes her answer.    But then hesitates.

<b>                         HANNAH (CONT'D)
</b>             Probably shouldn't tell him I said
             that, 'kay?

She winks.

<b>                         HANNAH (CONT'D)
</b>             Keep it between us.

Goodbye Hannah.    Good luck.

                Seems to be doing OK.

      Henry looks more confident. More poised. Better clothes.
      The frog has become the prince.

      He glances back at the building.

<b>                            HENRY
</b>                You know Fitzgerald said that all
                good writing is swimming under water
                and holding your breath. He was right.
                But after all I've been through, I
                think I'm finally ready to exhale.

      He looks at his watch.

<b>                            HENRY (CONT'D)
</b>                Oops. I'm late. Gotta go.

      SHOPPERS coming in and out of the store. POSTER in front
      window announces book signing for Henry Obert, author of
      Slice of LA.

      Right next to BANNER announcing GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. And
      next to the banner--a YOUNG MAN leans up against the wall,
      waiting, passing time reading his KINDLE.

      We jump to the woman clutching FOUR COPIES of Henry's novel.
      Wait a minute--we recognize those trendy glasses. It's Eudora,
      a rather pregnant Eudora.

<b>                            EUDORA
</b>                    (Laughing)
                Yes, I'm totally busted. I'm buying
                four copies of A Slice of LA. One
                for each member of my writing group.
                Also because I think Henry Wayne
                Obert is the greatest new writer of
                the decade! Sexiest, too!

      Eudora is having way too much fun.

<b>                            EUDORA (CONT'D)
</b>                OK. So he's my husband. I'm biased.
                But I still think the kid can write.

      Henry sits at the table in the bookstore, graciously and
      happily signing copies of his book for the SHORT LINE OF
      PEOPLE waiting.

      This is his moment, the one that brought him all the way
      from Illinois. He has arrived. As a person. As a writer.

      Henry looks up. Eudora is nestled comfortably in a nearby
      leather chair, reading away. She looks up.

      They make eye contact. Her smile is all the encouragement
      Henry needs. All that he will ever need.

      He reaches for the next book to sign.
