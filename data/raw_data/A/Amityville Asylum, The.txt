          We slowly pan through a suburban neighbourhood located on
          the south shore of Long Island. The still shroud of night
          blankets the village of Amityville in the early morning
          hours.

          Stray house pets are the only signs of life as families and
          neighbours slumber. We reach 112 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch
          Colonial house. The home is a classic piece of Americana,
          two stories plus an attic, several rooms, and a boathouse on
          the Amityville River. There are quarter round windows on the
          top floor that give the appearance of eyes staring back at
          us.
                         
          A signpost in the front yard reads "HIGH HOPES", a testament
          to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there.

          We move slowly through the basement, past various crushed
          beer cans and a table full of drug paraphernalia, until we
          reach a bearded man in his early twenties. RONALD DEFEO
          JUNIOR, known to his family and friends as BUTCH. He sits on
          a ragged sofa, dozing off in front of a small Television
          that displays white static.
                         
          There is a digital clock on a small table by the side of the
          sofa. It reads 3:14am. We hold on the clock and the time
          changes to 3:15am. We can see DeFeo's breath drift from his

          lips as cold air sweeps through the room. His eyes snap
          open.
          A hooded figure, face shrouded in darkness, steps from the
          shadows. The figure carries a .35 caliber lever action
          Marlin 336C rifle. Hands clad in black leather gloves, the
          mysterious person holds the rifle out in front of Butch. A
          voice emerges from beneath the hood that is so deep as to be

          Butch stands and takes the rifle. The figure retreats back
          into the shadows.

          The house is silent. Butch quietly stalks the hallways, the
          rifle grasped tightly in his hands.

</b>                         
          Butch quietly pushes the door aside and observes his parents
          as they sleep. RONALD DEFEO SENIOR, age forty three, is a
          heavy set Italian American man and his wife LOUISE DEFEO is
          a slender woman, aged forty two, with flowing blonde hair.
          Both are lying flat on their stomachs. Without hesitation,
          Butch raises the rifle to his shoulder and pulls the
          trigger. The BLAST is deafening. The first shot rips into
          his fathers back, tearing through his kidney and exiting
          through his chest. Butch fires another round, again hitting
          his father in the back. This shot pierces the base of Ronald
          Senior's spine, and lodges in his neck.Louise DeFeo's eyes
          open, but she barely has a few seconds to react. Butch aims
          the weapon at his mother as she lays prone on the bed, and
          fires two shots in quick succession. The bullets shatter her
          rib cage and collapse her right lung. Both bodies now lay
          silently in fresh pools of their own blood.

          Butch, in an almost trance like state, walks down the hall
          and quietly nudges the door to another bedroom.

          Butch enters the bedroom that his two brothers MARK, aged
          twelve, and JOHN, aged nine, share. He walks between their
          two beds as they lie on their stomachs, sleeping soundly.
          Standing directly above his two helpless brothers, Butch
          fires one shot into each of the boys as they lay sleeping.
                         
          The bullets tear through their young bodies, ravaging their
          internal organs, laying waste to the lives that lay ahead of
          them. Mark lays motionless, while John, whose spinal cord
          has been severed by his brother's heartless attack, twitches
          spasmodically for a few moments after the shooting.

          Stangely, the loud shots have not roused the remaining
          members of the DeFeo family, and Butch skulks unchallenged
          to his final destination-the bedroom shared by his sisters
          DAWN, eighteen years old, and ALLISON, aged thirteen.

          As Butch enters the room, Allison stirs. She looks up just
          as Butch lowers the rifle to her face and pulls the trigger.
          Butch then aims his weapon at Dawn's head and squeezes the
          trigger again, literally blowing the left side of her face
          off. Both girls die instantly. The white sheets and walls
          are splattered with blood and brain matter. Butch is unmoved
          and expressionless. He surveys the carnage for a moment,
          then calmly walks out of the room.

          Butch walks past a photograph hanging on the wall in a red
          frame. It shows all seven members of the DeFeo family in a
          group, hugging each other with smiles on their faces. The
          sound of children singing the nursery rhyme "Ring Around a
          Rosie" in a slow, haunting manner echoes through the house.

          that area. I would clean my mother
          when she lost control of her bodily
          functions during her illness. It's
          something I got used to very
          quickly. It became routine.

</b>          I'm sorry to hear that. So... it's
          important to me that every employee
          here, whether they are a
          psychiatrist, an orderly or a
          cleaner, needs to fully understand
          what our mission statement at this
          hospital is.

<b>                          MIXTER
</b>          High Hopes was only built two years
          ago and as an institution we have
          only been running for just over a
          year now. So we're still building
          our reputation. But I am very clear
          on what I want that reputation to
          be. I intend to make this
          institution one of the foremost
          centres for mental health treatment
          in the country. If you look into my
          history you'll know that I have a
          stellar reputation in the field of
          psychiatry and I want to use that
          to help others. That is why I have
          put my own money into the creation
          of this institution. We are only
          just starting out but we have a
          long term ambition to be considered
          the best. So what I require is that
          every person who works at this
          institution, in any capacity, must
          be professional and sensitive to
          the needs of the patients. Unlike
          other institutions, the welfare and
          care of our patients comes first
          here.

          Lisa's face quickly contorts. Mixter looks puzzled. Suddenly
          Lisa sneezes. It shoots out so rapidly she has no time to
          cover her mouth and nose. She sneezes all over Mixter. Lisa
          looks horrified.

          Lisa rushes to Mixter's side and grabs a tissue from a
          Kleenex box on his desk. She frantically wipes the saliva
          and snot from his face.

          Lisa, completely mortified, sits back down. An unimpressed
          Mixter wipes the spittle off his face with a tissue. When
          he's done he stares at Lisa.

</b>          Delaney opens the cupboard door and for a moment he and Lisa
          are silhouetted in the doorway. Delaney pulls a string
          hanging near the door and a light comes on. The cupboard is
          packed with various cleaning products.

</b>          The most obvious task is hoovering.
          This is our hoover here, it's
          straight forward. You'll be
          surprised that although it's
          powerful it's very quiet, because
          we are working when everyone's in
          bed so obviously we don't want to
          wake them up! It has a Telescopic
          suction tube and six stage filter
          system. So a lot more powerful than
          you may be used to.
                         
<b>                          LISA

<b>                          DELANEY
</b>          The mop and bucket is here, we
          usually use standard bleach to mix
          with the water so that's straight
          forward. But there is this
          specialist stain remover that you
          must use if there are any stains on
          the floor or carpet. It needs to be
          sprayed and left to set for twenty
          minutes before scrubbing or
          mopping. It's a special formula for
          tea, coffee, water marks and other
          yellow and brown discolourations on
          the carpets or floors. It's pretty
          strong so wash your hands after you
          use it!

          is we have to remove chewing gum
          from lots of surfaces. They don't
          just stick it underneath the
          tables, it ends up everywhere!

</b>           Yes! I think a lot of the time it's
           the staff doing it, not the
           patients! But we have this GumCart,
           which is a bit complicated but it's
           easier than just scraping the gum.
           The steam is super heated to one
           hundred eighty degrees and
           delivered at seven point zero bar
           pressure. It can produce a hundred
           and fifteen litres of superheated
           steam per minute.

<b>                          DELANEY
</b>           This is for cleaning and descaling
           brick, stone and concrete and for
           metal de-rusting. For concrete you
           must mix it one part to four parts
           water. Brush or spray it on with
           the equipment here then leave it
           five to ten minutes to set, then
           rinse it off. But for those
           stubborn son-of-a-bitch marks use
           it neat!

<b>                          DELANEY
</b>           Don't worry if anything seems
           complicated, you'll get used to it.

          Lisa follows Delaney into the communal area of Ward B. The
          walls are white and clinical. Various patients are scattered
          across the room, each with a look of resignation in their
          eyes. Many stare blankly out of the window.

           you'll be responsible for cleaning
           each evening. Essentially the main
           duties will be emptying the bins,
           hoovering the carpeted areas and
           mopping the hallways. The patients
           in here are Category B. They're
           mainly people who have had nervous
           breakdowns and those who are
           catatonic. They're harmless. Like

          Delaney and Lisa walk over to an old woman who is sat still
          in the chair. Her eyes are open yet she appears lifeless.

          a hatch on the door. Delaney slowly slides it open and
          beckons Lisa over. She peers inside. The cell is very basic,
          white walls with the only furniture being an uncomfortable
          looking bed and a toilet without a seat. There are thick
          iron bars on one small window. A skinny man in his thirties
          sits on a basic bed in a white vest, rocking back and forth.
          He has wild hair and a scraggly beard.
                         
<b>                          DELANEY

           and sexually assaulting a woman
           before smothering her four-year-old
           daughter. They call him the Green
           Chain Rapist. He was in Sing Sing
           but was certified insane and his
           lawyer got him transferred here. He
           doesn't make any noise or fuss, but
           he is a dangerous man. Especially
           towards women. This next inmate is
           even worse.
          Delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next
          door. He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside.
          Another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet. A man
          stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his
          back. His hair is slicked back, as jet black as the eyes
          that stare at Lisa. He smiles. Delaney slides the hatch
          shut.

</b>           That's Dennis Palmer. Also known as
           The Long Island Cannibal. He was
           abused as a child so his targets
           were always paedophiles and
           rapists. He'd track them down and
           torture them. He would eat parts of
           their body while they were still
           alive.

          legged on her bed. She has long flowing black hair, intense
          eyes and a pentagram carved into her forehead. She looks up

           the cult. She turned her trial into
           a circus, talking about lots of

           but she got certified insane by the

</b>           They first brought him in about six
           months ago. No one knows where he
           came from, he literally just turned
           up late one night. An orderly found
           him wandering the grounds. First of
           all he was like Missus Hardesty
           upstairs-catatonic. Then a few
           weeks later he started to respond
           to Doctor Mixter and the nurses
           through facial expressions and
           gestures. But soon, he got violent.
           Very violent. He'd have bursts of
           rage and beat other patients. One
           day he appeared to have a seizure
           and collapsed. A young doctor tried
           to take his vital signs. Patient X
           here throttled him so hard he
           crushed his larynx. It took six
           orderlies to restrain him. Now they
           won't even let him out for the
           obligatory hour a day exercise. We
           still don't know who he is.

          peers inside. In the centre of the floor she sees a needle,
          a piece of paper and a piece of red wool surrounded by Six
          lit candles. She looks around and nobody seems to be in the

          Suddenly SADIE jumps up right in front of the hatch! Lisa
          FALLS backwards, letting out an involuntary SCREAM! She
          stumbles to her feet as Sadie laughs. Lisa slams the hatch

          before replacing it with a new bag. With her task complete,
          Lisa's curiosity gets the better of her. She looks around
          the office. There is a shelf full of psychology books and a
          filing cabinet. Lisa touches the top drawer of the filing
          cabinet and it opens.

          marked 'Patient X'. She reaches for it and suddenly a HAND

          Lisa is stood on a step ladder dusting in the hallway. She
          steps down and walks past a clock on the wall. The time hits
          3:15am.
                         
          Lisa walks into the day room and is STARTLED to see Mrs

          Lisa slowly walks down the hallway, passing the cell doors.
          She can hear whispering. Lisa is drawn to the last door on
          the left. She approaches with caution. Stood in front of the
          door she slowly slides the hatch open and peers inside. John
          Doe sits in the corner, cloaked in shadow. Lisa peers down
          and in the centre of the floor, illuminated by a single
          shaft of light from the small window, is a TEDDY BEAR. Lisa
          slides the hatch shut and walks backwards. She is seriously
          unnerved. As she steps back from the door she hears a
          whispering from Kimble's cell. She edges closer to his cell
          door and listens.

          in stark comparison to Kimble's which sounds extremely

          Kimble starts to chuckle. Then he stops suddenly. Lisa leans
          closer to the cell door and she hears Kimble sniffing. THUD!
          Lisa jumps back as Kimble kicks the cell door.

          Kimble bangs the door continuously. The racket echoes
          through the corridor. Sadie soon joins in, her and Kimble
          laugh maniacally as they thump on the doors. A horrified

          filling the room with an orange hue. Lisa shuts the curtains

          of the clock by her bedside table.
                         
          Suddenly her EYES snap open. We pull back and see that Lisa
          is now stood in front of LARGE WOODEN DOORS. The doors open

          Lisa enters a Church full of powerful religious imagery. On
          the right side of the entrance she notices a Font. A drop of
          blood pierces the blessed water. As Lisa walks down the
          aisle we realise that everything has slowed to a crawl and
          she is moving in slow motion. White feathers cover the
          aisle, bouncing around her bare feet. An open Bible rests on
          the Lectern, the pages fluttering as if there is a strong
          breeze blowing them. Lisa looks up at a crucifix on the

          wall, the contorted face of a crucified Jesus Christ stares
          at her. Blood seeps from the crown of thorns and runs down
          Christ's face. As Lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a
          female figure sat in the front pew. Lisa ebbs closer. The
          figure turns. It's LISA'S MOTHER.

</b>           Of course I do.
          Suddenly tears of BLOOD run down Lisa's cheeks.
          Lisa's mother reaches out a hand. Lisa stretches her arm out
          to grab her mother's hand. Everything is in slow motion, it
          seems to take Lisa forever to reach her mother's hand.
          Suddenly a BLACK GLOVED HAND grabs her outstretched arm. She
          turns to see a HOODED FIGURE, face shrouded in darkness,
          standing next to her. A deep voice echoes around the church:

          Lisa's eyes OPEN and she sits bolt upright. She is pale and
          soaked with sweat. It takes her a few moments to compose

          The door creaks open. Lisa looks nervous. She walks in with
          her mop and bucket and heads to the end of the corridor. She
          begins mopping the floor. As she mops past Sadie's cell she
          hears a knock on the inside of the cell door.

          the surface and she sobs into her hands. After a few moments
          the tears subside and she takes a deep inhalation of breath,
          desperately trying to compose herself. Lisa walks over to
          one of the sinks. She looks at her tear stained face in the
          mirror above it. Lisa turns the tap on and water rushes out.
          She leans down and splashes the water on her face.
          Lisa looks up and is STARTLED to see her face reflected in
          the mirror as an OLD HAG! Lisa clutches her decrepit face in
          horror! She closes her eyes and opens them again. Her
          reflection has returned to normal. Lisa hears Sadie's
          maniacal chuckle echo around the bathroom. She rushes out.

          A nervous Pemberton fumbles at his belt, trying to unhook a
          pair of handcuffs. Palmer slowly starts to back into him.

          Palmer moves faster. Pemberton swings for him but Palmer
          ducks it and spins around, pushing Pemberton into the wall
          knocking him to the floor. Palmer aims a swift and savage
          stamp at Pemberton's head. His skull crushes against the
          cold hard floor. Blood spatters all over the white cell.

          slams a large red button on the wall next to the entrance.
          Hardcastle takes out his truncheon and cautiously approaches
          Palmer' cell. Looking inside he sees Pemberton crumpled on

          Lisa is walking down the hallway. She hears a SCREAM emerge
          from one of the rooms. She puts her ear to the door and
          hears the SCREAM again. Lisa kneels down and peers through

          down on a table. His face is severely cut and bruised but he
          is conscious. Four orderlies hold his arms and legs while a

          The orderly places electrodes either side of Palmer' head.
          He then turns the dial on the ECT device up to full power.
          Palmer SCREAMS as he violently convulses, salivating heavily
          from his mouth. Suddenly the saliva turns to blood as he
          bites his own tongue off. Lisa is horrified as she watches
          the orderlies laugh as Palmer experiences a severe seizure.

          That's why the recent owners sold

</b>          I vaguely remember hearing some
          stuff a while ago, but I never
          really took it in. I honestly
          didn't realise that the hospital
          was on the same land.

          house was demolished. You really
          think the place is haunted?

</b>          Well you're not crazy, hun. Perhaps
          the stories about hauntings at the
          house were true. Maybe the house is
          gone but the spirits stuck around.

           Or that the Devil is a red demon

           are within all of us. God is our
           human side. Satan is our animal
           side. Whether we become good or
           evil depends which side of us we
           feed.

           of the house himself.

           doctor, they don't usually believe
           in those things. Amityville is full
           of local legends, going back even
           before the DeFeos.

</b>           I don't think that's true. If I've

           on Ward X, it's that some people
           have a mind that works in a
           different way to other people.
           Those people who do bad things have
           fed the evil within them more than
           the good. It's not possession, it's
           sickness. Sickness of the soul.

<b>                          GLORIA
</b>           Ah yes, here it is. (Reading) In
           the 18th Century there existed a
           group of Native Americans in
           Amityville known as "The Satchem
           Tribe" led by Satchem Takapausha,
           the Chief. The tribe had fled Salem
           in Massachusetts to escape
           persecution by the Christians who
           were persecuting members of the
           tribe because of their Witchcraft
           practices. These practices included
           a ritualistic human sacrifice of
           six people (The significance of Six
           being related to the biblical
           number of man and creation) in
           order to induce the spirit of their
           God, The Dark Master, who they
           believed manifested his powers
           through his devoted followers,
           giving them immortality. The
           hundred strong tribe settled in
           Amityville but were later chased
           off the land by local Christians.
           Satchem accused the Christians of
           not properly compensating his tribe
           for the land. A war started and the
           Christians hired a hunter called
           John Underhill from Salem. At the
           site where One Twelve Oceans Avenue
           was later built in Amityville,
           Underhill killed all of the tribe.
           The Indians were buried in a mass
           grave on the site. Before he died
           Satchem vowed revenge. According to
           local legend, Chief Satchem is
           believed to have subsequently
           haunted the land. Various
           parapsychologists and mediums have
<b>           65.

           claimed that Satchem's vengeful
           spirit influenced the 1974 DeFeo
           murders at One Twelve Oceans Avenue
           and the haunting of the subsequent
           owners. Although such assertions
           are widely disputed.

          "The Satchem Tribe was a tribe of Native American origin
          that existed in the 18th Century. They fled Massachusetts and

          over a land dispute. The Tribe was renowned for practices in
          line with Witchcraft and worshipped a God called The Dark
          Master. In 2009, it emerged that a modern cult incarnation
          of the tribe existed. They have adopted the traditional
          beliefs of the Satchem tribe but the modern followers are

          Dennison Drive where they subsequently tortured and murdered
          five individuals. One potential victim managed to escape and
          lead police to Krenwinkel. At her trial in 2010, Krenwinkel
          outlined the beliefs of the Satchem Cult, claiming the human
          sacrifice of six individuals would have given them
          immortality. As a result her lawyer submitted a plea of

          Just check out her cell and speak

          it's all just her delusions then
          fine. I'll accept that. But I had

</b>          Yes, I understand how dangerous she
          is and I appreciate you coming to
          express your concerns. One thing
          you need to bear in mind Lisa is
          that there are some very sick
          patients at this institution. We do
          our best to help those who can be
          helped but unfortunately the
          patients on Ward X are beyond help.
          Their personality disorders are too
          advanced, their delusions are too
          grandiose. I worry that perhaps you
          have been rather taken in by one of
          those delusions.

          Mixter exits. Lisa leans forward and a file on the desk
          catches her eye. She stands up and reaches over for it. Her
          NAME is on it. Lisa opens it up. Inside is a form Committing
          her to the hospital as a PATIENT. Lisa looks down and the
          reason stated is PARANOID DELUSION. The date on the form is
          November 13th. Today. Lisa slams the file shut and the office

          Lisa has her ear pressed to the door. She can hear GUN SHOTS
          and SCREAMING. She starts to panic and rushes over to the
          small window. She slams her hand into the window but the
          glass doesn't break. The lock on the door snaps. Lisa slides
          down the wall, terrified. The door opens and DELANEY walks
          in. Lisa breathes a huge sigh of relief and rushes over,
          throwing her arms around him.

          stumbling backwards into the staff room. Patient X clasps
          his hands to his eye which is now gushing with blood. Lisa

          Mixter is very calm. Lisa is trembling, the rifle visibly
          shaking in her hands as she aims it at Mixter's head.

          Suddenly SIRENS can be heard outside. The screeching of car
          wheels. Mixter smiles. Lisa, still holding the gun at
          Mixter, shuffles over to the window and peers through the
          blinds. The car park is full of police cars. A dozen armed
          police officers rush towards the building. Lisa looks back
          to see Mixter chuckling.

          Lisa, her teeth clenched, moves forward and places the

</b>           And we're back with our next guest.
           A year ago he was a survivor of the
           High Hopes Hospital mass murder
           when cleaner Lisa Templeton ran
           amok with a rifle, claiming six
           victims and injuring many others.
           Doctor Elliot Mixter has written a
           new book entitled 'Shattered Hopes'
           which provides an account of that
           fateful night as well as some
           background into the mind of the
           murderer. Doctor Mixter, good
           morning.
                         
          Mixter is sat opposite, in a very expensive suit.
                         
<b>                          MIXTER

</b>           I'm good thank you. So Doctor, can
           you tell us a little more about the
           book?

</b>           Well, it features a blow by blow
           account of the evening. It was
           obviously a very harrowing
           experience and for me it was rather
           therapeutic to deal with my
           feelings about what happened in
           writing.
                         
<b>                          PRESENTER
</b>           How has it affected the hospital
           Doctor?
                         
<b>                          MIXTER
</b>           Obviously we were all left very
           numb by events for a long time and
           I know a lot of people in the town
           felt we should close the
           institution. But that never
           occurred to me. I feel that people
           should be brought closer by tragedy
           and the Staff and I have definitely
           become closer, both as colleagues
           and friends, since the incident.
           That bond makes for a better

           institution in my opinion, so we
           will continue to go from strength
           to strength.
                         
<b>                          PRESENTER
</b>           You mentioned there that some
           people wanted the place to close. I
           know many were also resistant to
           the opening of the institution in
           the first place given that it was
           built on the site of the infamous
           house, where Ronald DeFeo murdered
           his family in the seventies. I know
           a lot of people associated with
           that case were accused of
           exploiting it for their own ends.
           You've also faced some criticism
           for that, particularly as we heard
           last week that you have sold the
           movie rights to this book. How do
           you respond to that criticism?
                         
<b>                          MIXTER
</b>           Well I know that some people accuse
           me of hurting the memory of the
           victims but I feel I'm helping the
           memories of those involved live on.
           Granted, some victims were
           criminally insane but other victims
           were loyal staff who had families
           and I'm determined that they not be
           forgotten. Each staff member gets
           their own chapter in the book so
           that the readers can get a full
           picture of what wonderful people
           they were. I always say that all
           forms of media, whether it be
           books, newspapers, TV or movies,
           are a preservation of life. Our
           physical bodies may die but our
           images live on when we are famous.
           Our work and our passion is
           preserved, therefore it's as if our
           souls are preserved. Through all of
           these forms of media we are, in
           effect, immortal.
                         
                         
          Mixter looks straight into the camera and smiles.
