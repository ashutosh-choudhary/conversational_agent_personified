                            Jason Hall



                        Based on the book by

                            Chris Kyle
                                        with Scott McEwen
                                        and Jim DeFelice





All gave some. Some gave all.

</b>
    The groan of tank treads drowns out THE CALL TO PRAYER as
    an entire MARINE COMPANY advances over the top of us.


<b>2   EXT. STREET, FALLUJAH, IRAQ - DAY                           2
</b>
    The sun melts over squat residences on a narrow street.
    MARINE COMPANY creeps toward us like a cautious Goliath.
    FOOT SOLDIERS walk alongside Humvees and tanks.

<b>                              COMMANDING OFFICER (OS)

                 Charlie Bravo-3, we got eyes on you from
                 the east. Clear to proceed, over.


<b>3   EXT. ROOFTOP, "OVERWATCH" - SAME                            3
</b>
    Sun glints off a slab of corrugated steel. Beneath it--

    CHRIS KYLE lays prone, dick in the dirt, eye to the glass
    of a .300 Win-Mag sniper rifle. He's Texas stock with a
    boyish grin, blondish goatee and vital blue eyes. Both
    those eyes are open as he tracks the scene below,
    sweating his ass off in the shade of steel.

<b>                              CHRIS KYLE
</b>                 Fucking hot box.

    GOAT (24, Arkansas Marine) lies beside him, woodsy and
    outspoken, watching dirt-devils swirl in the street.

<b>                              GOAT
</b>                 Dirt over here tastes like dog shit.

<b>                              CHRIS KYLE
</b>                 I guess you'd know.

    Goat balks and fixes his M4 on the rooftop door.

<b>    CHRIS SCOPE POV
</b>
    TRACK ACROSS bombed-out buildings, twisted metal and
    golden-domed mosques. Ragged curtains flutter out a
    window. Cat-tails on the river sway the same direction.
    We see him studying windage; we see what he's thinking--

    SFX: A LOW FREQUENCY BUZZ escalates over picture as his
    concentration deepens. Cross-hairs land on--

    A MAN ON CELL PHONE watches the convoy from a rooftop.
<b>                        (03.18.14)                          2.

<b>                       CHRIS KYLE
</b>                 (keys mike)
          I got a military-aged male, on a cell
          phone, watching the convoy. Over.

<b>                       COMMANDING OFFICER (OS)
</b>          If you think he's reporting troop
          movement you have a green-light. Your
          call. Over.

<b>                       GOAT (OC)
</b>          He could be calling his old lady.

MAN ON CELL studies the convoy, his hair tossed by wind.
CROSS-HAIR push left of target, compensating for windage.

SFX: Chris takes a deep inhale, holds it, then expels.

His finger is taking up trigger-slack when the man dips
his shoulder slightly. Chris holds off as--

MAN ON CELL hangs up and steps away.

<b>                       CHRIS KYLE
</b>                 (keys mike)
          He stepped off.

Chris sucks air. Close. The ambient world floods back in.
Barked orders, diesel engines and--

A WOMAN AND KID exit the same structure. They're headed
up the sidewalk but cut sharply into the street.

<b>                       CHRIS KYLE
</b>                 (keys mike)
          Hold up. I got a woman and a kid, 200
          yards out, moving toward the convoy.

(ECU)-- The woman cradles something beneath her robes.

<b>                       CHRIS KYLE
</b>          Her arms aren't swinging. She's carrying
          something.

CROSS-HAIRS ON WOMAN as she pulls a cylindrical object
from her robes. His vision obscured but--

<b>                       CHRIS KYLE
</b>          She just pulled a grenade. An RKG Russian
          grenade. I think she gave it to the kid.

<b>                       COMMANDING OFFICER (OS)
</b>          --you say a woman and kid?
<b>                               (03.18.14)                       3.
</b>

    SFX: his heart-beat, THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP.

<b>                              CHRIS KYLE
</b>                 You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?

<b>                              COMMANDING OFFICER (OS)
</b>                 Negative. You know the ROEs. Your call.

<b>                              GOAT (OC)
</b>                 They fry you if you're wrong. Send your
                 ass to Leavenworth.

    THE KID moves toward the convoy with the grenade.

<b>                             CHRIS KYLE (OC)
</b>                 Fuck--

    MOTHER motions the Kid to hurry along (ECU)-- her robes
    flutter, trash blows in the street, the dust off her
    son's footsteps; all blowing the same direction.

    THE KID sprints toward the Marines.

<b>    IN THE STREET
</b>
    YOUNG MARINES. Wading into war. Boots scuffing dirt.

<b>    CLOSE ON CHRIS
</b>
    His exhale hisses from tobacco-stained teeth. Breathe it
    down. He struggles to get calm, fighting for control.
<b>    SFX: THUMP-THUMP THUMP-THUMP THUMP--
</b>
    CROSS-HAIRS left of the running target, leading him,
    compensating for a dozen different considerations as--

    He pauses upon exhale. The world goes quiet. Landscape
    pulses with color and focus. He stokes the trigger and--

<b>    THE BULLET
</b>
    Leaps from the barrel. Cracks like a whip. The .300 round
    hurls forward, glinting as it enters the flesh of--

<b>    A WHITE-TAIL BUCK
</b>
    It staggers, draws and topples to the ground. We are--


<b>4   EXT. HILLS, WEST TEXAS - PRE-DAWN                           4
</b>
    A field shrouded in fog. CHRIS KYLE(8) jumps from a deer
    blind, innocent and excited, running toward the buck.
<b>                             (03.18.14)                          4.
</b>

<b>                            MAN'S VOICE
</b>               Get back here.

    Chris stops, turns back. WAYNE KYLE, his father, is
    sturdy and earnest with mutton chops and Texas calm.

<b>                            WAYNE
</b>               Don't ever leave your gun in the dirt.

<b>                            CHRIS
</b>               Yes, sir.

<b>                            WAYNE
</b>               Helluva shot, son. You got a gift. You're
               gonna make a fine hunter someday.

    Chris nods, clear-eyed, as if hearing the whisper of
    destiny. He grabs the .30-06, running again, bounding to--

<b>    THE BUCK
</b>
    Glassy brown eyes look up at Chris. It's still alive.

<b>                            WAYNE
</b>               Everything dies to give life.

<b>                            CHRIS
</b>               Can it see me?

<b>                            WAYNE
</b>               It's a deer, son.

    Chris processes his first kill, watching as-- (ECU) a
    flea crawls around the animal's inner-ear.

<b>                            WAYNE KYLE
</b>                      (hands him hunting knife)
               You shot it, you deal with it.

    Chris straddles the deer. It tries to gouge him. He looks
    frightened but drags the blade across its neck.

    A Protestant church. CHRIS is dressed in Sunday best,
    shuffling pages of a LITTLE BLUE BIBLE to create breeze.
<b>                             (03.18.14)                          5.

<b>                            PASTOR
</b>               We don't see with his eyes so we don't
               know the glory of his plan. Our lives
               unfold before us like puzzling
               reflections in a mirror. But on the day
               we rise, we will see with clarity and
               understand the mystery of his ways--

     JEFF(6), his reedy little brother, watches Chris slip the
     Bible in his pocket. Jeff laughs and gets smacked by--

     DEBBIE, their mother. She wears big oval glasses and runs
     a wayward-boys home with that same steady hand.

     Dust motes drift across a dresser, settling on a Pop-
     Warner football, that BLUE BIBLE, and METALLIC TOY
     SOLDIERS guarding the bullet casing from his first buck.

<b>                            WAYNE KYLE (VO)
</b>               There are three types of people in this
               world. Sheep, wolves and sheepdogs.

     PUSH THROUGH the modest ranch house into--


<b>9    INT. DINING ROOM                                            9

     WAYNE lectures his boys over venison.

<b>                            WAYNE KYLE
</b>               Some people prefer to believe that evil
               doesn't exist in the world, and if it
               ever darkened their doorstep they
               wouldn't know how to protect
               themselves... those are the sheep.

     Jeff bites back tears. Chris looks troubled.


<b>10   EXT. SCHOOLYARD                                             10

     FROM THE BACK, we watch a BIG BULLY pummel a KID ON THE
     GROUND. His meaty fists coming down repeatedly as--

<b>                            WAYNE KYLE (VO)
</b>               Then you got predators who use violence
               to prey on the weak. They're the wolves.

     KID ON THE GROUND is JEFF, his nose bloody. PUSH TOWARD
     the fight--(ECU) blood flecks fly from the Bully's fist.

<b>                               WAYNE KYLE (VO)
</b>                  Then there are those blessed with the
                  gift of aggression and an overpowering
                  need to protect the flock.

     his palms and it plumes out across the land.

</b>                  They are the sheepdog.

</b>                  Now we're not raising any sheep in this

                  your brother, you have my permission to
                  finish it.

<b>                               CHRIS

     Chris shows the swollen knuckles of his hand, and nods.

     the horse, its nostrils steaming, eyes shock wide. (ECU)--
     a hair-line crack along its right front hoof.

     BUZZER SOUNDS. GATE OPENS. The bronco leaps out. Empty
     stands blur past. The Bronc and Chris united in a futile
     struggle. He leans right, the bronc circles right,
     staying off that bad hoof. Chris makes the buzzer but--

     He gets tossed on dismount. The bronco stomps his hand.
     He scrambles out of the ring as RODEO CLOWNS distract it.

     OF MARINES to watch their backs. CHRIS tucks the little
     blue Bible and American flag and into his webbing then
     removes his wedding band, hanging it from his necklace.

     MARC LEE AO2 (26) is a poster-boy Navy Seal, soulful and
     handsome. He glows like a halo in a river full of shit.

          Big Giggles is making the coffee.

Biggles is flipping him off when the FATHER SPEAKS:

<b>                       TERP
</b>                 (translates)
          He invites you to join him for Eid al-
          Adha supper. He says -on this day
          everyone has a seat at my table-.

Chris nods dubious gratitude, meeting the Father's eyes.

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>          Tell him that's very generous of him.

<b>DINING ROOM - LATER
</b>
A braised head of lamb eaten clean. TEAM 3 are chowing
down, in good spirits, as Chris watches THE FATHER teach
his SON to read. He is moved by their connection and
acutely aware of what this war is costing him.

That's when he sees-- (ECU) "SHOOTERS STRAWBERRIES" on
father's elbows. They're red and calloused, like his own.

Chris darkens, stands and slips down the hall--

     CHRIS searches the closet, ripping through clothes,
     pressing wall panels. He's crossing to the bed when--

     FLOORBOARDS CREAK beneath the rug underfoot. He stands
     there, shifting his weight, floor creaking.

<b>     DINING ROOM/HALLWAY
</b>
     BIGGLES is shoveling food in his mouth when a hand stops
     him. Chris signals, no more. FATHER'S eyes flick up as--

     CHRIS RIPS THE FATHER out of his chair, dragging him down
     the hall by his hair. WIFE and KIDS screaming. "D" holds
     them off as-- Chris dumps the father at a STASH HOLE in
     the floor. Inside, a CACHE OF AKs, RPGs, IED components.

<b>                            CHRIS

               what to do with him-- or he can help us
               get inside that restaurant down there.

<b>                            CHRIS

     The Terp translates. Father reacts, pale with defiance.

     GUNFIRE FROM INSIDE shreds him. He folds forward, dead.

     TWO MEN in robes (TONY &amp; BIGGLES) rush the door tossing
     grenades, pulling the father out as the GRENADES EXPLODE.

      METALLICA, "Master of Puppets" blasts as an M1A2 ABRAMS
      TANK speeds 45 mph down a street, bad as fuck. TWO
      BRADLEY TRANSPORT vehicles follow.

      A CAR pulls into the road ahead. INSURGENT PASSENGER
      leans out, FIRING AN RPG. It explodes across the tank but
      does no damage. Tank still coming, Insurgents pull away--

      But the tank catches them. Treads climbing the back of
      the car, overtaking it. INSURGENTS are trying to get out,
      screaming, as steel folds around them and flattens them.

      And the ABRAMS vaults off the other side--

Ominously still. Sunlight spills through grated windows
facing the street. Chris and Marc move to the first door--

      steps into the same window, BLASTING FIRE.

<b>ON THE ROOFTOP
</b>
TWO DOZEN insurgents surround them on the rooftop. CHRIS
waits till a guy gets right up on him and-- BAM!

<b>                        "D"
</b>          You're up--

"D" trades the SATELLITE PHONE for Chris' Springfield.

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>          --you got four rounds.

In their exchange, an unspoken goodbye. Then--

Chris struggles to dial, hands shaking. IT RINGS. He
squints north. RINGS AGAIN. F-18 rocketing toward him--

<b>                        TAYA (OS)
</b>          Hello?

Chris is stunned. She answered. He's speechless.

<b>                        TAYA
</b>          Hello?

<b>                       CHRIS

Wind howls. F-18 closing.

</b>          I can't hear you--

<b>                       CHRIS

</b>          What's happening--

<b>                       CHRIS

<b>THE SANDSTORM
</b>

<b>F-18 RAPTOR
</b>
THE PILOT flying into the storm. Sensors screaming. He
can't hold his line. 4, 3, 2-- He pulls up early.

<b>ROOFTOP
</b>
HELLFIRE MISSILES scream over the Banana factory and
EXPLODE INTO the next building. Fire and dirt engulf
them. The blast recedes but the sand-storm escalates.

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>          Go, go, let's move--

He leads "D", RANGER ONE and FOUR OTHERS across the roof.
They stumble past INSURGENTS, blinded by sand.

<b>STREET BELOW
</b>
CHRIS and SQUAD stagger into HOWLING CHAOS, clinging to
each other, trailing Chris as GUNFIRE POPS behind them.

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>                 (choking, into mike)
          Stryker-3, what's your location--

AN INSURGENT is blown right into them. "D" wrestles his
gun away and beats him with it.

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>          Hold there! We are 30 seconds out--
                 (pointing ahead)
          Go. Straight ahead. Go--

They run for their lives. Unable to see two feet ahead.
Sand shredding their skin. Chris is struggling--

Squad passing him. Knees failing him. He can't keep up.

<b>INT. STRYKER
</b>
THE GUNNER stares at REMOTE WEAPONS SCREEN when SIX
FIGURES EMERGE from the dust. He's about to fire--

<b>                       GUNNER
</b>          BDUs-- That's them! Drop the ramp.

The ramp drops. STORM HOWLING. RANGER-ONE dives in,
MARINES follow, then "D" rolls in. The rig pulls off.

<b>      IN THE STREET
</b>
      Chris falters forward. Insurgents pursuing. The Stryker
      just visible ahead-- pulling away.

<b>      IN THE STRYKER

      M2 GUNNER can't see shit on his monitor.

<b>                               "D"

<b>      IN THE STREET
</b>
      Chris is   ten feet behind the rig, sprinting. Bullets sing
      past. He   sheds flack-jacket and webbing, Bible and flag.
      He drops   his gun in the dirt and dives. His hand clutches
      the last   rung of slat-armor and--

      Chris Kyle is dragged off the battlefield.

<b>      IN THE STREET
</b>
      Sand buries the METALLIC TOY SOLDIER that followed him
      since childhood. Wind whips pages of the Bible and pulls
      at the flag until it flaps unfolded. WE'RE BLOWN AWAY
      with it, twisting and clapping into an otherworldy beige.

<b>      IN THE STORM
</b>
      We catch glimpses of the city below: graffiti'd T-walls,
      a cracked expanse of desert floor and the lanky body of
      an enemy sniper splayed across a rooftop.

      Wind rips the Hefty bag away and sand pocks the DEAD FACE
      OF MUSTAFA-- before we're swept up into the howling rage.

       CLOSE ON- the back of Chris' head. He watches a WAR MOVIE
       on TV. As CAMERA CIRCLES the room, we glimpse THE MOVIE;
       an injured soldier calls for help amid shocking gunfire.

       TRACKING BEHIND THE TV, we see Chris' wrought face and a
       household bustling around him. COLTON carries party
       plates outside, MCKENNA fights to get cowboy boots on and-

       TAYA CALLS to him from the kitchen but we can't hear her
       until the CAMERA TRACKS to HER POV-- the gunfire is gone,
       the TV IS OFF. That war movie is playing in his head.

       Streamers twist against gunmetal sky. COLTON and MCKENNA
       set up birthday decorations. The family dog, A PYRENEES
       SHEEPDOG, bounds about. TAYA AND CHRIS, on back steps.

                 be six-four. I can't wait for you to see

                 She said she'd let you pull it. But only
                 you.

       His head falls. When he looks up--

</b>                I just feel this dark space between us
                and I don't know how to reach you.

      THE SHEEPDOG jumps on the back of COLTON'S FRIEND. The
      boy goes down hard, gets up crying, running from the dog.

      The Sheepdog does it again. THE BOY FALLS AND HIS CRYING
      is cuts into scene. THE BOY'S MOM runs over. His back
      clawed up.

<b>                             BOY'S MOM

      Chris rips the dog off by its collar. The dog snaps at
      him and in an instant he whips out his .45 to shoot it.

<b>                             TAYA (OC)
</b>                No! He's a puppy. He doesn't know!

      Chris looks up, bent with animus, and he's looking at the
      face of his children, their friends, and their parents--

      They look at him, terrified. He releases the dog. Lost.

       Chris is showering when Taya sneaks in and flushes the
       toilet. He howls at the scalding water and she's
       laughing, rushing for the door when-- he lunges out and
       grabs her, pulling her in with all her clothes on.

       Under a watercolor dawn, CHRIS leads COLTON across a
       prairie, hunting rifle on shoulder, teaching as they go.
       THE SCORE BUILDS and follows them into morning.

       Dust motes drift across blades of light falling through
       blinds onto CHRIS. He wears the BELT BUCKLE he won long
       ago, pleated Levis, and twirls an antique six-shooter.

<b>                              CHRIS
</b>                 Get `em up, lil' lady. Hands in the air.

       TAYA is at the window gazing at their kids in the yard.

<b>                              TAYA
</b>                 Can I tell you something.

<b>                              CHRIS
</b>                 Tell it to the judge.

<b>                              TAYA
</b>                 I'm proud of you and I don't say it
                 enough. I feel blessed. You're an
                 incredible father and-- I feel lucky to
                 have my husband back.

<b>                              CHRIS
</b>                 We could lock the doors. They can't get
                 out of the yard.

<b>                              TAYA
</b>                 I know how hard you fought to get here.
<b>                        (03.18.14)                    115.
</b>

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>          You're worth fighting for.

She crosses to him, running a hand up his leg.

<b>                       TAYA
</b>          Did you pleat those jeans?

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>          Yes, ma'am. Right up the middle.

<b>                       TAYA
</b>          Well, you're just a regular old cowboy
          again, aren't you?

He kisses her, lifting her--

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>          I meant what I said about locking the
          doors.

<b>                       TAYA
</b>          Aren't you and Chad going to the range?

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>                 (checks watch)
          Not for four minutes.

<b>                       TAYA
</b>          Is that all it takes.

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>          It'll take half that. Then I got two
          minutes leftover just to look at you.

He sways with her, dancing a little two-step.

<b>                       TAYA
</b>          Who are you taking out?

<b>                       CHRIS
</b>          This Marine. His mom does parking at
          school and she asked for my help.

<b>                       TAYA
</b>          Well don't be late for dinner.

COLTON and McKENNA race in, hugging on their dad.

<b>                       COLTON
</b>          Dad, you want to play Skylander? Please--
<b>                               (03.18.14)                         116.
</b>

<b>                              CHRIS
</b>                 I gotta go do something but when I get
                 back, okay? But you have to let me win.

<b>                              COLTON
</b>                 No way.

<b>                              MCKENNA
</b>                 Poke the bear--

       McKENNA pokes Chris and he BARKS like a dog.

<b>                              MCKENNA
</b>                 No. You're supposed to roar. Like Grrr.

       She pokes him again and Chris emits a RUMBLING ROAR. She
       giggles and hugs him so he'll save her.

<b>                              CHRIS
</b>                 I should get going...

       He kisses his daughter and tosses his son's hair.

<b>                              CHRIS
</b>                 Look after our women, Bubba.
                        (turns to Taya)
                 Love you, babe.

<b>                              TAYA
</b>                 Love you too.

       Chris kisses Taya and lingers, worshiping her. Dust motes
       drift past and he appears immortal in the bladed light.

       Then--

       He walks out the door for the last time. The house grows
       quiet. Colton plays video games. McKenna colors. The dog
       lays by the door. And Taya stands in the golden light.

ACTUAL FOOTAGE: A funeral procession appears over a
distant ridge. Police escorts lead a white hearse and 300
vehicles down a highway lined with people waving flags.

The last car finally passes. An UNKNOWN CIVILIAN stands
alone in a muddy field saluting a fallen hero.
