<b>          JANUARY 31, 1981
</b>          Over black we hear the opening of a garage door. The light
          spills in and we see.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. UPPER MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, QUEENS NYC -

          Open on ABEL MORALES. It is early morning and still almost
          dark out. He has a rugged yet prosperously-handsome face and
          is in his mid-thirties. He is struggling to get started with
          his morning jog.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. SHIP GRAVEYARD, STATEN ISLAND NYC - DAY
</b>                         
          It is early morning. A large bulk fuel oil transport truck
          sits idling next to a decrepit old dock. The dock sticks into
          a backwater section of New York harbor that is filled with
          the decaying remains of half-sunken abandoned barges and tug
          boats.
                         
          JULIAN, the young driver of the truck sits and nervously
          scans the horizon. Eventually a large fuel barge appears in
          the distance being pushed by a tug boat. The barge is steered
          past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its
          way to the dock in front of the tanker truck.
                         
          JULIAN gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting
          hose. He looks around nervously. JULIAN steps across the
          broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to
          the barge. He hands it to the BARGE OPERATOR with a nod of
          the head and no words.
                         
          They connect the hose and start a large generator as it
          begins to pump fuel into the truck. They both scan the
          horizon again as the sun begins to come up.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. MORE INDUSTRIAL QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD- SAME TIME
</b>                         
          ABEL is still jogging as the light begins to increase. It is
          freezing out. He is a very serious guy. He is not happy that
          he is out of shape. Finally he stops and bends over to catch
          his breath. We have run with him from the nicer part of the
          neighborhood to a rougher section. As he catches his breath
          he stands up and looks around. He is unsure of his feelings.

<b>          INT. ANNA'S DRESSING AREA
</b>          The camera slowly moves in as ANNA sits in a slip at her make
          up table putting on her face for the day ahead. She looks
          into the mirror as if she is putting on a coat of armor.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. DRIVER'S CAB OF A BULK OIL TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY
</b>                         
          STANDARD HEATING OIL, "We set the Standard" is written in
          logo form on the side of the tank.
                         
          The truck idles in traffic waiting to pay the toll to cross
          the Verrazano bridge that spans the mouth of New York harbor.
                         
          JULIAN, the young driver from the dock, cautiously looks
          around as the traffic inches along. He finally approaches the
          toll booth and pays.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Good morning.
                         
          JULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. Is it
          Central American or Mexican? The female collector gives him a
          smile.
          He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the
          other side as the lanes merge together. Just as the traffic
          is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we
          see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the
          cab. Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps.
                         
          The GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and
          very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. He
          shatters the glass side window with his elbow. Unlocks the
          door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the
          passenger side, but he is holding a gun. They are not wearing
          masks. It's very brazen.
                         
          Before THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS
          SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then
          pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway.
                         
          LOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with
          the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road
          staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. PARKING YARD OF STANDARD HEATING OIL- SAME TIME
</b>                         
          Two almost-matching late model Mercedes pull up to a chain-
          link gate with a small sign that says "STANDARD HEATING OIL:
          WE SET THE STANDARD". The DISPATCHER opens the gate.
<b>                          4
</b>                         
                         
          They both pull into reserved parking spaces next to each
          other. ABEL is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit.
          ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. She is a
          beautiful, tall, blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a
          streak in her eye that this is all business. You would not
          want to cross this woman.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Ready?
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           Yes.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           You look very nice.
                         
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           Thank you.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           You sure?
                         
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           Yes.
                         
          ABEL walks around and opens his trunk. He takes out two large
          empty briefcases.
                         
          He carries the briefcases as they both walk over to a large,
          unmarked, armored van that is idling in the middle of the
          parking lot. Two ARMED GUARDS get out of the van. One is
          holding a clipboard. He walks up to ANNA and ABEL. He hands
          them the clipboard. They look at each other one last time and
          then both sign the document.
                         
          The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. ABEL hands
          him the briefcases and the guard begins to fill them with
          cash. Lots of cash. ABEL and ANNA stand at the open back of
          the van and just watch. Finally he finishes and hands the now-
          heavy cases to ABEL.
                         
          ABEL picks up the two cases and walks a bit away from the
          truck. He turns to ANNA.
                         
<b>                          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>           Don't do anything stupid.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           We don't have any more money so
           what else could I do.
                         
          She gives a small smile. He looks at his watch. They kiss.
<b>                          5
</b>                         
                         
          ABEL turns and begins walking with the cases. He gives a nod
          to the DISPATCHER, who we now see, is in a small gatehouse,
          and he begins to open the front gate.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE FRONT GATE- SAME TIME
</b>                         
          ABEL walks out through the gate and down the abandoned
          industrial street about 25 yards, then looks to his right. He
          looks down at the cases in his hands, turns, and stands
          looking into the neighboring site.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM: BROOKLYN NY WATERFRONT - DAY
</b>                         
          ABEL comes walking across the parking lot and sees ANDREW
          WALSH standing in the middle of the dusty parking lot. ANDREW
          is their longtime LAWYER/RIGHT-HAND MAN and is in his mid
          fifties. He is smart but tired. The oversized briefcase in
          his left hand seems to have permanently tilted his posture
          that direction. The large oil-holding tanks loom above them.
          The place is rusting and could use some work.
                         
          As they wait, the setting has the look and choreography of an
          illegal transaction about to go down.
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           So how are we this morning?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           (gives a smile and nod)
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Well I woke up feeling very good
           about this.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Really?
                         
          They both take a look at their watches.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           You've been telling me not to do
           this for a year.
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Well we are going all in... so now
           I love it.
                         
          Gives him another slight smile. They stand around in awkward
          silence. Finally a late-model Ford Ltd. station wagon pulls
          into the lot.

<b>           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
</b>           Here we go.
          And a group of FIVE HASIDIC JEWS gets out. There are two guys
          in their twenties, two in their fifties, and one in his mid-
          to-late seventies. They all shake each other's hands then
          stand around for a beat.
                         
<b>           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
</b>           Should we head inside?
                         
<b>          INT. SMALL TEMPORARY OFFICE TRAILER - DAY
</b>                         
          The group is now jammed around a folding table inside the
          trailer. ABEL and his lawyer sit at one end facing the rest
          of them. Finally, the senior member of the group, JOSEPH
          MENDELSOHN, eyes up ABEL and leans forward. His accent is
          strong yet you can understand every word.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           So why is it you want this land?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I'm sorry?
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           It has been difficult for you to
           get me here, no? Over a year?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Almost two.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           There are many like it around? And
           thanks to all these tests you paid
           for, we now know it is as much of a
           mess below the ground as it is
           above. My people have looked at
           your books, I know this is a lot of
           money for you, so why have you kept
           on us so... just for this ugly and
           polluted little piece of the earth.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I have been looking over my fence
           at this property for a very long
           time.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           So it is just proximity?
<b>                          7

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           No... I imagine I want it for the
           same reason you did.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           And what's that?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           To grow.
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           Well, I am in the garment business
           so I appreciate that sentiment. But
           I inherited this land from my
           uncle. Sadly he had no children of
           his own. He was the one that let
           them build these tanks here. So
           this place can do little for me...
           in fact thanks to all those tests
           you've done it may be a liability.
           As you know I offered to lease the
           site to you at a fair price, but
           you were not interested?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           No.
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           Why not?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I like to own the things I use.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           I can see that.
                         
          Long pause.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           So.

           fulfill your end of this contract
           and the property is yours. If you
           can't we will keep your money and
           will sell it to your competitor who
           has been chasing us almost as badly
           as you have. I like you, but know
           that the only reason I am choosing
           you is because of the favorable
           terms of this contract. So this is
           business... and when you sign
           this....

</b>           Well then, let's see this money,
           and then I will sign these papers.
                         
          ABEL turns to ANDREW and gives a slight nod. ANDREW pulls the
          black briefcase onto the table and opens it. It has seven
          hundred thousand dollars in cash in it. He slides it over to
          their side. The old man signs the contract and they shake
          hands.

          decides to go for a little walk.

          He heads out towards the tanks and walks among them. They
          tower seven stories above him. As he walks, he is cut off
          like a maze from any other visual input. (Similar to being
          inside a Richard Serra sculpture) Finally he emerges into
          some light and as ABEL looks up the camera reveals his view.
          It's midtown Manhattan in all its glory, just across the East
          River from the site. He stares at the city and we see the
          true depths of his ambition lock on his face. He looks to his
          watch.

          ABEL's car drives into a long driveway through the woods.
          Then an architect-designed, 80's modern house, still under
          construction, appears. He pulls up in front.
                         
          He gets out of the car and stands there looking at the large
          house. He walks into the house and we see more clearly that
          it is nearing completion. It is empty.

          from the house. As he stares out his CONTRACTOR comes quietly
          walking in behind him.

          ABEL reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a thick

          ABEL stands, surrounded by massive trees in the thick forest,
          looking across the ridge back at his house. He is a little
          out of breath after climbing the hill but he looks strangely
          comfortable even though he is standing in the woods in a
          suit, tie, and dress shoes. He takes a nice cigar out of his
          pocket, lights it and has a real moment of joy. He looks up
          to the tops of the trees, then back at the new house. He
          exhales a long deep breath. Then we hear a large truck come
          rumbling in the driveway. He hears it. His face shows that he
          knows the sound immediately.

          great news.

          ABEL comes down a hallway and then turns through a curtain
          into a treatment area. Sitting on the table is the young
          driver of the truck, JULIAN.
                         
          He has a contraption on his head that is holding his jaw shut
          in place. His eye is black. ABEL goes over and gives him a
          tight hug. But then he ever so slightly checks himself and
          places him back down on the table.
                         
          ABEL looks up and sees ANNA, standing in the corner. She is

          They look each other over. She then finally leans in and
          gives him a caring kiss, she walks off.

          They stare at each other, then the truck. ABEL then climbs up
          and we see he knows his way around the truck. He goes up top
          and opens and looks into a valve, the tank is empty.

           was in it.
                         
          The cop leaves. ABEL is left standing on top of the truck in
          the parking lot alone with his battered truck. He looks down
          at the open loading valve and begins to come up with an idea.

           around in this city, just trying to
           do their jobs. And I... I have done
           everything you have asked of me.
           It's been two years since you first
           started investigating my company
           and I have spent thousands of
           dollars hiring lawyers for this and
           that to provide you with every
           piece of information your office
           has requested. And I expect that
           you have been asking the same from
           my competitors. So with all this
           information that you have gained...
           We are just asking if you have any
           idea who has been doing this to us?
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I don't.

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
</b>           I understand your frustration. And
           although everyone else seems to
           have given up and left this city
           for dead, I haven't. And as you
           know we have been investigating
           industry-wide corruption in your
           business that seems to have been
           going on for years. And the simple
           fact is that the only person who
           could do anything with 8000 gallons
           of heating oil in a matter of
           minutes after stealing a truck is
           someone from within that industry.
           And almost certainly someone with
           local storage capacity. So you're
           right. That means you all are
           stealing from each other. Which is,
           as far as I can tell, just a
           refreshing new take on what you've
           been doing to your customers and
           fellow taxpayers for the last
           fifteen years.
                         
          This sits in the room for a long beat.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           First, please know that we respect
           the work you are doing to try to
           help our business and the city. But
           also know I have never taken
           anything I haven't earned from
           anyone so when you say you've...

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           Well yes and no. See, all that I
           can do is to try and put people
           away in the simplest and most
           economical way possible with the
           limited resources at my disposal.
           It doesn't really matter to us who
           it is or how we do it as long as
           it's progress.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Well, it makes a difference to me.

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I know it does. This city is a very
           difficult place to do business
           right now.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes.
                         
          This more conciliatory tone makes LAWRENCE think through his
          next reply for a long beat.
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           You know... Mr. Morales you seem
           like a decent man, and because of
           that I'm really not comfortable
           just sitting here with you
           pretending that the elephant
           perched on the corner of my desk
           isn't there.
                         
          LAWRENCE looks over at DEPUTY LANGE whose body language says
          `don't go down this road'. But he does.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
</b>           I can't go into specifics at this
           moment but we believe that you and
           your company have broken the law
           and that we have enough evidence to
           prove that. So next week, Monday
           actually, we will be bringing a

          This drops like a bomb. ABEL and LAWRENCE stare at each
          other. Then ABEL glances to the corner of the desk. We see
          that a large draft copy of the case is actually sitting
          there. ABEL looks back up.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm sorry to do this in person.
           It's awkward, obviously, but I
           didn't want to have this happen on
           Monday not having said something
           here in person today, out of
           respect.

          ABEL stands up to leave and ANDREW is still a little stunned
          but stands.

          stops and turns around as we see a large truck coming towards
          him.

          ABEL walks up to his house, and we see the moving trucks
          preparing to unload. ANNA gets out of her car with the kids,
          and they run around and check out the house as ANNA directs
          the movers.
          ABEL comes up and stands next to her. They smile a protected
          smile at their new home. ABEL gives her a kiss.

</b>                         
          The whole family sits around the table in candlelight. They
          are eating takeout, but with a mismatch of formal and
          everyday tableware that has been unpacked. There are boxes
          all around them.
                         
<b>                          ANNA

           this, but thank you. For me...
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           A toast.
                         
          All six raise a glass.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           A toast to our new home. It's as
           beautiful as my wife and daughters
           and as strong as me...(kids laugh)
           May we be happy, prosperous and
           safe here. Cheers.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. GYMNASIUM GIRLS YOUTH SOCCER GAME - NEXT MORNING
</b>                         
          ABEL is standing watching the game as he waits for his coffee
          to come out of the snack bar. Over his shoulder we hear...
                         
<b>                          PETER FORENTE

          ABEL turns and sees PETER FORENTE standing there. He's in his
          mid-forties, very well-dressed, and handsomely bald.
                         
<b>                          ABEL

</b>           Sir.
          ABEL picks up his coffee, and they both walk back over to the
          sideline together. Although they are standing a bit off to
          the side from everyone else.
                         
<b>                          PETER FORENTE
</b>           So I heard about your rig getting
           picked off again.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes.
                         
<b>                          PETER FORENTE
</b>           We should probably get together to
           discuss this and go over some of
           the preventative measures that
           we've been taking. We haven't had
           an incident since November. It
           doesn't do any of us any good to
           have this kind of attention brought
           to us.
                         
          They both stare out at the court for beat.

          They look at each other.

</b>           He's from Ohio. Played football. I

          PETER gives a bit of a stronger look. Then finally turns back
          towards the field.

<b>          INT. GARAGE OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY
</b>                         
          The garage is filled with boxes. ABEL stands in the middle of
          a few that are partially unpacked. He has set up an old radio
          in the corner of the garage, and it is playing a New York
          Giants football game. ABEL takes an object out of one of the
          boxes and looks at it with significance.
                         
          Coming from the main house we hear the doorbell ring. ABEL'S
          oldest daughter, ANNIE, comes to the door of the garage.
                         
<b>                          ANNIE
</b>           Dad. Mr. Walsh is here.
                         
          ABEL looks around behind ANNIE to see ANDREW standing there.
          He waves him into the garage. The boxes are stacked almost
          to the ceiling around them.

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           It's not set up yet... So I am
           guessing this isn't good news here
           on a Sunday night.
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           No... It looks like they are coming
           after us.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           That describes many people at this
           point.
                         
          Slight smile.

<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           I still haven't seen it yet. But my
           guy in his office just gave me a
           heads up an hour ago. It's not
           good.

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           A couple places?
                         
          This hits ABEL. He thinks for a beat than goes over to the
          door to the house and calls for his wife.

          They wait. She enters, she is a bit surprised to see ANDREW
          in her garage.

          He is making light of the situation, but as she looks at
          their faces she knows there is a problem.

          They all give each other a long look, as this means they have
          been bending the rules in several places, as do all their
          competitors.

<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           It means we may have some
           accounting exposure where we have
           pushed things a little too far.

           I just wanted to make sure you had
           all the information I do. This is a

           enough to give a shit about now.

          ABEL reaches into his pocket and takes out a remote for the
          automatic garage door opener. As it opens you can see the
          pride in his face as this remote is a fairly high-tech new
          item. They all sit and watch as it opens the whole way then
          stops in silence.
                         
          ANDREW is now standing outside in the driveway.

<b>          INT. ABEL AND ANNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>                         
          ABEL is lying in bed, awake. ANNA is as well. He is staring
          at the ceiling. Their dog is lying at the foot of the bed
          asleep as well. Eventually the dog wakes up and looks out
          towards the doorway. He growls ever so lightly. Then he
          stops, listens, and starts growling a little more.
                         
          ANNA looks up ever so slightly.
                         
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           What's he doing?

          ABEL is now standing up to go look.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Quiet... don't worry. It's nothing.
                         
          ANNA tries to go back to sleep.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. HALLWAYS/KID'S ROOMS - NIGHT
</b>          ABEL walks out of the bedroom and slowly heads down the hall
          to his kids' rooms. He looks in each room and the CHILD is
          sleeping soundly with nothing out of place.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. KIDS' ROOMS/HALLWAY- SAME TIME
</b>                         
          As he comes out of the last bedroom back into the hallway he
          sees his dog standing at the top of the stairs looking down
          over the balcony into the living room. The dog is starting to
          quietly growl once again.
                         
          ABEL'S face goes from total comfort that his kids are safe to
          total paranoia. He slowly walks down the hall. He stops off
          in his bedroom closet and grabs a mid-size baseball bat/billy
          club. Now he is heading down the stairs with the club trying
          not to freak himself out.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. OPEN LIVING ROOM/ENTRY HALL/FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</b>                         
          ABEL walks down the stairs and the dog just stands at the
          top, still growling every now and then. ABEL comes into the
          living room and everything seems perfectly normal. He then
          relaxes and turns towards the dog.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Quiet. It's nothing. Come down
           here.
                         
          He snaps his fingers and calls the dog. The dog finally comes
          down the stairs.
                         
          ABEL now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state, but
          then the dog starts growling again and looking out the
          windows next to the front door. ABEL comes over, he opens the
          front door but the dog refuses to go out.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           Go. Oh come on. Go.
                         
          ABEL thinks he hears something. He clicks on the lights and
          pulls his bat back up into position. He heads outside.

<b>          EXT. FRONT DOOR TO ABEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>          ABEL comes to the end of the front walk and there is nothing.
          The dog has now followed him outside and is slowly heading
          over to a area where a small exterior hallway leads to a side
          entrance. It is dark. The dog starts barking and going crazy.
          ABEL slowly heads over to the covered passageway.
                         
          All hell now breaks lose. A BURGLAR, in all black, comes
          blasting out of the shadows. The dog tries to bite him as he
          goes by. ABEL swings his club and hits BURGLAR square on the
          shoulder but he keeps coming. He knocks ABEL over and runs
          towards the driveway. ABEL is up and chasing after him faster
          than we expect.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. BASE OF THE RAVINE DEEP IN WOODS- CONTINUOUS
</b>                         
          There is a pretty good moon out so we can see them running
          full throttle through the very thick woods. ABEL is keeping
          up with him and in fact may be gaining on him.
                         
          ABEL is still in his pajamas. He has a rage that has been
          building up inside him for a good two weeks that is now
          pouring out of him in the energy to chase this guy down.
          They come to the top of a small ravine which ABEL seems to
          know from his runs through the woods and ABEL takes a bit of
          an easier/quicker path down.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. WOODS BEHIND ABEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>                         
          ABEL now cuts him off at an angle and swings the bat at his
          legs. BURGLAR trips and goes flying. ABEL falls as he swings
          at him. They both sit on the ground for a beat. ABEL is
          exhausted. They stare at each other.
                         
          A brief look of panic comes across BURGLAR's face. Then he is
          up again and running off into the woods.
                         
          ABEL gets himself up and chases after him.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. ROAD NEXT TO THE WOODS - NIGHT
</b>                         
          ABEL comes out of the woods into the middle of the road, and
          in the distance we see BURGLAR run up to a waiting van with
          its lights and engine on. The guy gets into the passenger
          side of the van, and it peels out.
                         
          ABEL is left standing in the middle of the road, barely able
          to breathe and holding the bat.

<b>          EXT. ABEL FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</b>          ABEL comes walking back towards his front door. ANNA is
          standing with all the lights on and with the dog sitting next
          to her. She looks at him in shock.
                         
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           Where were you?

</b>           Abel?
                         
          They both look down at his bare feet. He has been in some
          kind of shock and hasn't even noticed that his bare feet are
          cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice.
          His feet are bleeding all over the walkway.

</b>                         
          ANNA is in warrior mode. Any panic in her voice has
          disappeared, and she is speaking with a calm yet deadly
          seriousness. She is cleaning the cuts on his feet and putting
          bandages on them as they talk.

</b>           Please. Don't get going on this. We

           wanted the TV. He didn't have a
           gun, he had nothing. The alarm will
           be in on Monday. It was some kid.
           They aren't coming back.
                         
          She looks at him with considerable concern.
                         
          He leans in and starts kissing her. She holds still at first
          then gives in.

          ABEL is in a suit but is kneeling and almost lying on his
          back showing three SALES RECRUITS what they should be looking
          for. Another INSTRUCTOR looks on. We see ABEL in his element.
          He is a salesman.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           What you are looking for here is
           the opening to the burn chamber.
           Now at this point you have not
           tipped your hat in anyway. From the
           minute you walked in the house you
           should have been working to create
           an impression of total
           impartiality. But now...
                         
          He reaches over and opens the small door. A fire is burning
          inside. On cue the instructor hands ABEL a crisp clean white
          handkerchief.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           When this door opens you begin to
           close. It must always be spotless.
           If they see you have ever done this
           before it is over.
                         
          He takes it and reaches up into a small exhaust chimney.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           Now, you do this and only this...
           You look down at the cloth and
           don't say a word... You just keep
           staring at the cloth and then you
           slowly just start shaking your
           head. Very very slowly and small.

           cloth.
          Then ABEL makes a small clicking noise.
                         
<b>                          INSTRUCTOR
</b>           Do you hear that noise... that's

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           It means you are close... Then
           after sitting in silence way longer
           than is comfortable, you turn. And
           say "I'd love to run a few numbers
           for you. Is there somewhere more
           comfortable we could sit." They
           will almost always take you to the
           dining room table and will offer
           you something. And whatever it is
           you always take the fancy option.
                         
<b>                          INSTRUCTOR

<b>                          INSTRUCTOR
</b>           We have some homemade lemonade or a

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I'd love a lemonade, thank you.
                         
<b>           SALES STUDENT ALEX
</b>           Why?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Because, we are never going to be
           the cheapest option, so we have to
           be the best. And they want... no,
           need... to feel that you want the
           best too. That's why our trucks are
           the newest or cleanest, and our
           drivers are approachable.
                         
          Just then the woman who works behind the front desk (STANDARD
          FRONT DESK) comes to the door.
                         
<b>           STANDARD FRONT DESK

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I gotta go, but the final point I
           will make is the hardest one. Once
           you have done the math and shown
           them what we can save them over the
           long haul through proper
           maintenance, you need them to sign.
           And the problem is by hiring you
           that means they are firing someone
           else. And that's never easy. So to
           get them over the line you need to
           close them. So when you show them
           the number look up at them both...
           and just stare at them...
                         
          ABEL begins staring at the recruits. He continues to stare.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           You stare longer than you should.
           Because this is not a joke. You
           will only keep this job if you
           close. And that's not funny to you.
           And I am only interested in this
           company growing, and when it isn't
           I don't think it's funny at all.
           These people work very hard for
           their money and these other guys
           are ripping them off, treating them
           poorly, because they don't know...
           so when you look them in the eye
           you have to believe that we are
           better, and we are, but you will
           never do anything as hard as
           staring a person straight in the
           eye and telling the truth.
                         
          ABEL then does exactly that to them. And he holds it for a
          long beat.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           Well... it was great to meet you.
           Welcome and I wish you luck.

          There is a great high/low nature to the way ABEL runs the
          company. While he wears great suits and his trucks are
          impeccable, he does not waste money. So this room where the
          drivers have company meetings is very basic.

          The room is filled with all of the drivers. There is a bit
          of a nervous energy in the room. It quiets as ABEL comes in.
          He stands aside.

          As STANDARD FRONT DESK sees ABEL standing behind her, she
          stops. ABEL walks forward a few steps.

</b>           Good morning. First off, I picked
           up Julian yesterday and he is back
           home and doing much better. And I
           just wanted to make sure you are
           all aware that we are doing
           everything we can to deal with this
           situation. We are working with law
           enforcement, and they seem to be
           closing in on these guys. But,
           sadly these are the times we are
           living in and we must rise above
           them. So, on that front we have
           these.
          He puts one of the new radios on the dais. ANDREW comes into
          the room behind ABEL and stands.

          ANNA is walking back from the mailbox looking through the
          day's mail. As she approaches the house she looks up and sees
          the two younger daughters, ELIZABETH (6 years old) and
          CATHERINE (4 years old), playing in front of the house.
          CATHERINE comes out from under a bush near the side door with
          something in her hand.
                         
          ANNA looks back down at the mail. As she gets closer to the
          house we see a look of concern come across her face. The look
          then turns to one of complete horror but as she gets closer
          to CATHERINE she tries to control her emotions.

</b>           Catherine... Catherine. Katie!
                         
          She drops the mail. And goes right up to her daughter.

</b>           Mommy.
                         
          As ANNA comes up to CATHERINE we now see that the little girl
          is holding a large very real looking handgun in her little
          hands. ANNA is besides herself.

          door where LOUIS SERVIDIO was hiding and got hit the night
          before.

<b>                          BILL O'LEARY

<b>                          BILL O'LEARY
</b>           They are picking on your men
           because they are just sitting
           there... weak.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           They are taking shots at me because
           I am growing, expanding, getting
           stronger not weaker.
                         
          This frustrates Bill because he knows ABEL is right. He tries
          a new tack.
<b>                          BILL O'LEARY
</b>           It's quite simple for me: I can't
           have my drivers getting hit like
           this. It looks like I can't protect
           them.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Well, it appears that you can't.
                         
          This is a little too sharp for the head of the NYC teamster's
          taste.
                         
<b>                          BILL O'LEARY
</b>           I can. And will. Because of all my
           job descriptions that is the one I
           consider most sacred.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I agree. But these are truck
           drivers, not soldiers, this will
           lead to chaos.
                         
<b>                          BILL O'LEARY
</b>           It will stop immediately.

          He resets, again.
<b>                          BILL O'LEARY
</b>           You seem to be under pressure from
           many sides right now... which I
           understand. Trust me I understand.
           So let me think this through. But
           whatever decision I make on this,
           it stands. Those men show up every
           morning for you because I tell them
           to. It's important for you to
           realize that these are very
           dangerous times, and we need to
           adapt. It's not like when we were
           driving.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes.
                         
<b>                          BILL O'LEARY
</b>           Sometimes the weak man is the
           stronger man if he has the right
           tools.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           It may seem that way... but if you
           are weak eventually it will show...
           it always does. And if you want
           this to all be behind us, help me
           find out who is doing this. You
           know a lot of people, and that
           would be the most help to me.
                         
<b>                          BILL O'LEARY
</b>           It's not always as simple as it
           appears.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I'm sure that's true.
                         
<b>                          BILL O'LEARY

</b>           That depends what they do with it.
           If they kill their wife with them,
           then no. Then that is a very fake
           permit, and I'll walk away very
           quickly. But they just need to show
           that they are defending themselves,

           If they kill their wife with them,
           then no. Then that is a very fake
           permit, and I'll walk away very

           comfortable capital on hand.
                         
          ABEL jumps in taking some offense.

</b>           But you should know Arthur that
           this man has been digging through
           our industry for over two years
           looking for anything he can find.
           And as you know probably better
           than anyone, having worked with
           some of our competitors the thought
           that he would have singled us out
           is ridiculous. It reeks of
           everything that is wrong with this
           city right now. We run a fair and
           clean business and follow every
           standard industry practice and I
           will fight `til my last day to
           prove that...
          This silences the table for a long beat.

          ABEL holds up his finger and points at ARTHUR across the
          table to make his point.

          ABEL is a little taken aback by this comment. It goes against
          everything that comes naturally to him as a person. ANNA and
          ANDREW know this and are concerned he might go off.

           firstly direct access to the river.
           So I can bring in fuel directly
           from any provider in the world
           straight to my tanks, then it has
           over 10 million gallons of storage
           capacity, so I can buy in the
           summers when my price is low and
           sell to my customers and most
           importantly some of my competitors
           when the price is high. I won't
           just drive trucks anymore... I will
           control my fate... but the real
           answer to your question...
                         
          Now ABEL stares right at IAN THOMPSON.

           you must jump... or you risk ending

           whole life... and that I can't do.
          IAN THOMPSON awkwardly laughs a bit as ABEL just stays deadly
          serious staring right at him. Finally.

          ABEL is driving, and ANNA sits in silence looking out the
          passenger window. They are heading along the main backwoods
          road to their house.

          Just as he says this a deer comes running out in front of
          them. ABEL tries to slam on the brakes but isn't able to stop
          in time. The car hits the deer and it careens over the
          windshield and on to the road behind the car.
                         
          He continues to slam on the brakes and comes to a complete
          stop.
                         
          They both catch their breath and look around to make sure
          they are both okay. Then they look back at the deer. It is
          laying on the road but is still breathing.

          ABEL gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood. He
          then walks back and approaches the animal. It is laying on
          the side of the road.
                         
          He comes right up to it and stares into its eyes. It stares
          back at him. ABEL walks back to the car.

          edge.
                         
          ABEL goes to the trunk and gets out the large wrench. He
          walks back over to the deer. He bends down next to it and
          stares into its eye again. ABEL is thinking back on
          something, or many things.
          He makes a small starting movement like he is going to hit it
          over the head but he stops himself. He can't quite do it.
          Then he sits with the animal a beat longer.
                         
          We come in very close to ABEL and see his hand is struggling
          to deliver the blow. Just as he grips the tire iron
          waiting... BANG! BANG!
                         
          Two very loud GUNSHOTS go off from right over his shoulder.
          He ducks for cover then slowly turns behind him. ANNA stands
          there holding a small-yet-powerful Saturday Night Special-
          style handgun. Smoke is still rising from the end of the
          pistol. The deer is dead.
                         
          He looks at her dumbfounded... where did she get this gun?
          She gives him a look. Then turns and walks back to the car.
          He stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road.

          as he approaches the open driver's side door. He gets in
          without saying a word. We stay with them as they drive on in
          silence.

          NANNY MARIA comes around the corner and passes ABEL who is
          just standing in the living room. He only gives her a nod.
          ANNA is standing on the other side of the room just waiting
          in silence as well. NANNY MARIA goes over to the closet and
          gets her coat out and puts it on. The tension is building
          like a kettle. Finally NANNY MARIA gets herself together and
          walks out and as the door shuts they come immediately at each
          other.

          ABEL is slightly stammering at this point, not quite sure
          what to do. They are still standing on opposite sides of the
          room from each other. He just waits... finally.

          she doesn't let on. He takes the purse from her. He opens it
          and takes out the small gun.

          leads the POLICE OFFICER back over to the front door. The
          PARENTS certainly notice and start stirring.

          ABEL leads the OFFICER outside, and as he looks up he sees
          that his driveway is packed with four police cars, some
          unmarked and there are about five OFFICERS waiting to come
          into the house.

           this is a terrible time for us. I
           am having my daughter's birthday
           party.

          They stare at each other just as ANNA comes to the door. She
          sees the scene in her driveway.

          As they look across the driveway they see the OFFICER talking
          to someone. The officer shifts out of the way and they see he
          is talking to ASSISTANT D.A. LAWRENCE.

          SALES STUDENT ALEX gets out of his car and walks up to the

          Just then he brings out the white cloth and wipes the inside

          JULIAN is close to getting off the bridge and is starting to
          feel better. Just as the traffic in front of him starts to
          clear up, out of the corner of his eye he sees something.
          In his side-view mirror he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO getting out of
          a random car behind him. His heart starts racing. He looks
          over in the other mirror and there is THUG #2 walking up.
          Again.
                         
          JULIAN thinks for a second then reaches for the CB RADIO.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Cathy! They are coming again. Over.
           Help. Help. On Bridge.
                         
          He then fumbles the CB and it drops to the floor of the cab.
          He looks up into the mirrors again and sees that they are
          still coming for him.
                         
          The camera now comes in tight on his face and he pauses for a
          long second, and he then makes his decision. He reaches under
          his seat and takes out a handgun. He doesn't really seem to
          know what he is doing with it.
                         
          But he opens the door of the truck and gets out. He aims the
          gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO walking towards him. LOUIS SERVIDIO
          sees him and is very surprised and stops.
                         
<b>                          LOUIS SERVIDIO
</b>           Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Get the fuck away from me!

</b>           Okay, man.
                         
          People in the cars behind the truck are starting to honk.
          Then LOUIS SERVIDIO gives a nod signal to THUG #2 who is on
          the other side of the truck, and JULIAN'S gun fires by
          mistake. It totally misses THUG #2. He jumps out of the way
          and is hiding behind the wheel.
                         
<b>           LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D)
</b>           Watch it now, man. You're going to
           hurt someone.
                         
          JULIAN is now in a total state of panic. He is hiding back in
          front of the truck. The three men are basically doing a slow-
          motion, very stressful hide-and-seek around the truck. The
          two THUGS now have their guns out.
                         
          The honking has now reached a total insane level as traffic
          is backing up.
          Then THUG #2 makes one last play to take the truck. He tries
          to climb into the cab and JULIAN goes into a rage. He quickly
          fires three shots, missing THUG #2 with each one, but that
          forces LOUIS SERVIDIO to shoot two shots of his own at JULIAN
          to protect THUG #2. They miss as well, but one hits the main
          section of the tank and a small but steady stream of heating
          oil starts pouring out onto the roadway.
                         
          Just then we hear sirens starting to come closer in the
          background. This adds a new element.

</b>           Over here.
                         
          JULIAN is just trying to decide what to do next. The sirens
          are now getting much closer.

</b>           Get the car!
          THUG #2 takes off. This now leaves JULIAN and LOUIS SERVIDIO
          all alone with the police coming. As JULIAN is hiding, trying
          to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by
          him. As he does:
                         
<b>           LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D)
</b>           Run for it!

<b>          EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DAY

          JULIAN runs all along the bridge and then sees LOUIS SERVIDIO
          run through a small door into the body of one of the four
          massive stone anchor structures that hold up the bridge.

          Once he is inside, there's another set of stairs. He locks
          the door behind him and starts racing down the stairs. As he
          heads down he hears someone just in front of him.
          He stops and looks down the center column of the stairs and
          looking up at him about three flights away is LOUIS SERVIDIO.

          Then LOUIS SERVIDIO's head disappears and we can hear his
          feet flying down the steps again.
                         
          JULIAN thinks for a beat, then he starts off down the stairs
          again as well. The camera stays right where it was as JULIAN
          heads down out of sight. We just hear the sounds of his feet
          getting lower and lower.

          sirens in the distance on the other side of the door. He
          keeps going.
                         
          Down two more flights, just as he said, there is another
          doorway. JULIAN walks up to that door very carefully. He
          listens on the other side but doesn't hear anything but his

          quietly opens the door in front of him and right in front of
          his face is a woman in full jogging clothes running by him.
          He looks around, and after a second to get himself
          orientated, we see he's on a riverfront esplanade where there

          gun out in the open. He puts it away and then looks up at the

          We now see that SALES STUDENT ALEX is inside a massive, empty
          construction dumpster. And as he looks around, we realize it
          is on the back of a truck that is currently driving pretty
          fast. With each bump that the truck goes over the noise
          inside the dumpster is deafening. As the KID comes to his
          senses he tries to stand up. As he does, we see that the
          sides of the dumpster are at least eight feet tall and the
          interior is very slick without anything to grab or stand on.
          He is trapped.
                         
          Just then the truck goes over another huge bump and comes to
          a stop. It idles for a minute then begins backing up. It
          stops. A warning, beeping alarm is heard, and finally one end
          of the dumpster begins rising. As it gets higher and higher
          our KID tries to hold himself back, but he begins to slide
          towards the low end. As he does he sees that the end that he
          is heading towards is on a hinge and it is starting to swing
          open. Finally the thing is at such an angle that he can't
          hold on any longer and he slides towards the opening.
                         
          As he falls out he/we see that he's being dumped over the
          edge of a cliff of some sort. He falls probably 10-12 feet,
          into a pile of garbage. As he gathers himself and tries to
          stand, we see he is standing in a massive landfill. He looks
          around as the truck pulls away. He's left totally alone.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. TENNIS COURT OF SUBURBAN MANSION - DAY
</b>                         
          ABEL is led by a MAID into an indoor tennis court. The house
          is massive and designed like an English Country Estate.
                         
          As ABEL walks up we see PETER FORENTE on the court playing
          against an automatic tennis ball machine. He is in full
          tennis whites as he hammers the balls back at the machine.
                         
          ABEL approaches the court and watches for a beat.

           it?
                         
          ABEL nods.
                         
<b>           PETER FORENTE (CONT'D)
</b>           I was paying a guy five bucks an

</b>           Peter.
                         
          This causes PETER to look up and see the serious look on
          ABEL's face. He hits one last shot and walks a little closer
          to ABEL. The machine is still hitting balls behind PETER.
                         
<b>                          PETER FORENTE

<b>                          PETER FORENTE
</b>           I see that.
          PETER walks over to the machine and unplugs it. He points
          over towards the chairs courtside. He and ABEL sit down.

           house.
                         
          ABEL lets this sit for a minute, and he is intently reading
          PETER's face. He hopes not, but he is judging to see if PETER
          had anything to do with all these attacks. PETER just looks
          back at him with a very strong poker face.

          and as he gets nearer to his car he starts to hear the mayhem
          that is coming from the CB radio in the front seat. As he
          gets closer he gets more and more details.

          The camera now comes around to the outside of the car looking
          back at ABEL through the windshield. The mansion is looming
          in the background. We see ABEL'S face react as he hears the
          news of the incident on the bridge. The camera pulls back as
          ABEL'S face goes totally cold.

          each others eye. ABEL makes his way forward as everyone else
          leaves. They look at each other for a beat.

           saying you had armed your entire
           fleet of drivers which led to a
           shoot-out on the 59th Street

          The banker gets into his car and backs out. The gate opens
          and he drives out. Just as it is about to close it starts
          opening again. SALES STUDENT ALEX drives in with his car
          trashed. He pulls up and gets out of the car looking at ABEL.
          He knows what has happened and is crushed. Neither of them
          say a word, finally ABEL gives the kid a cautious but
          meaningful hug around the shoulder and leads him inside.

</b>           No... I'm not... They're out.
                         
          This gets her attention.

          With that ABEL walks out of the room and heads up the stairs
          to his bedroom. When he's halfway up the stairs she stops
          him.

           somewhere else.

</b>                         
          ABEL is driving ANNA'S car towards the city. ANNA is in the
          passenger seat and the three DAUGHTERS are in the back. ANNA
          and ABEL do not look any better. In fact there is now a tinge
          of anger mixed into the sadness.
                         
          The DAUGHTERS are arguing about who's taking up too much room
          in the back seat.

          ANNA turns and snaps at them a bit.
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           Stop. I've told you guys not to
           push it this morning, this is not
           the morning to be doing this... but
           since the second you all woke up.
           It's this, it's that. Just stop.
           The world does not revolve around
           you!
          This shuts them up for a beat. ABEL is seething. But then
          ELIZABETH (middle) nudges ANNIE (oldest) so she gives
          CATHERINE (youngest) a good hit. ANNA sees it and freaks.
                         
<b>                          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>           That's it Annie we've told you...
                         
          Before ANNA can get the full sentence out ABEL suddenly pulls
          the car off the side of the highway into the grass. Everyone
          in the car is taken aback. The road is a smaller scenic
          highway not some eight lane affair but this whole sequence
          still plays out with the menacing roar of the cars going by
          right next to them.
                         
<b>          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>                         
          ABEL gets out of the car and slams the door. He walks around
          the back of the car as the cars fly by them on the highway.
          He goes around to his oldest daughter's door and pulls ANNIE
          from the car. They stand behind the car and go at it with the
          traffic flying by. ABEL is louder than he has been in the
          entire film. He is losing it from all the pressure but his
          daughter bears the brunt.
                         
<b>                          ABEL

           an hour ago to help her get out of

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           What? What? What are you talking
           about?
                         
          ABEL is looking around for someone to help him and witness
          this. He then switches, he has had enough and gets right up
          in her face.

           you are, but you don't talk to me
           that way... You are in serious
           danger of becoming a rich little
           spoiled brat and I can tell you
           from experience there is nothing
           worse in the world than a rich
           little girl who thinks the whole
           world revolves around her.
          ANNIE is yelling back over the traffic.
                         
<b>                          ANNIE
</b>           The world revolves around me? Me!
           What about her? And what about you?
           You're both so totally obsessed
           with your stupid business. You
           walk around like you are saving the
           world but what are you doing...
           nothing!
                         
          This stings. He now changes his tone to a quiet low roar. But
          he can't keep quiet and by the end of the line he is yelling
          again.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           First off I don't walk around like
           I am saving anything. I chose this
           business because I looked at the
           world and said `What's the last
           bill people stop paying every month
           when they are low on cash?' `Cause
           that's a business I want to be in.
           `Cause failure wasn't much of an
           option for me. I lived in
           reality... not whatever this world
           is you are living in. And we help
           people stay warm... which isn't all
           that bad.
           (now he is yelling again)
           Maybe you've got grander ambitions
           but for now this is how you eat,
           sleep, and get all dressed up... So
           you better shape the fuck up and
           NEVER speak to me like this again!

          The camera moves slowly across a dark hallway. We hear the
          sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away. As we come
          through the doorway we see ANNA MORALES sitting at her desk
          in a pool of light from the desk lamp. She is deep in it
          crunching numbers. Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he
          looks exhausted.

          support that claim.

          A sense of caring and resolve comes over them. At least now
          they know what needs to be done.

          ANDREW stands in the hallway about to knock, but he waits for
          a beat. He knocks.
                         
          The door opens to a young woman, presumably JULIAN'S wife,
<b>          LUISA.
</b>                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH

</b>           Abel would like to speak with him.
           To help him.
                         
<b>                          LUISA
</b>           I will tell him.
          JULIAN steps into the frame from behind her.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT./INT. LARGE LATE-MODEL AMERICAN CAR, PARKED - DAY
</b>                         
          A DRIVER is sitting in the driver's seat. ANDREW walks up and
          gets in the front seat. JULIAN gets into the back and looks
          over at ABEL who is sitting next to him. They drive off and
          nobody says a word for a very, very long time.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. EMPTY PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>                         
          The car finally pulls into a large empty parking lot. For a
          couple beats JULIAN has a look on his face that he may be
          getting rubbed out.
          Then off in the distance we see two cop cars. The car pulls
          up to them and stops. ABEL and the DRIVER get out of the car
          without a word, but ANDREW stays and turns around and now
          gives him a total debrief.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           He's turning me in?
                         
          ANDREW looks at him without much remorse.
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Of course we are turning you in.
           You have put everything that man
           has worked for for the last 20
           years at risk. If it was up to me
           we would be dealing with this in a
           very different way.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           But I know things...
                         
          This causes ANDREW to turn quickly back to him with as sharp
          a look as he has.
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Really?

<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Yes.
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           And what things do you know?
                         
          JULIAN looks back at him.
                         
<b>           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
</b>           I strongly suggest you think that
           through before you answer it.
           Because even if you did, what does
           it do for you? Nothing. There is
           nothing there for you to gain.
           Nothing.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I'm sorry.
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           I am too.
                         
          ANDREW now changes his tone.
                         
<b>           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
</b>           They say they have you firing four
           shots, is that right?
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I don't know.
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Where's the gun?
                         
          JULIAN stutters for a moment, then.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I threw it in the river.
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Good. Your background check with us
           says you have never been arrested,
           is that true?
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Why is this putting everything at
           risk?
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Have you ever been arrested?
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           No.

</b>                         
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Because no bank will touch us right
           now. So we can't close on the new
           property. And he's going to lose
           everything on his deposit.
                         
          This sits heavily on JULIAN. ANDREW hands him a card.
                         
<b>           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
</b>           This is a lawyer who will meet you
           when they bring you to the station.
           You no longer work for us. You've
           been fired. But Abel wants to pay
           for the lawyer. So... this guy
           should be able to help you. Good
           luck.
                         
          With that JULIAN gets out of the car. ABEL is standing there.
          They meet.

</b>           I know.
<b>                          JULIAN

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Sometimes.

</b>           What do you do?
                         
          ABEL thinks this through long and hard.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I have always been much more scared
           of failure than anything else.

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Not today... but by the end of the
           week... maybe.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           I'm sorry.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Good...
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           No... I am not strong.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           That does not have to be true.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Trust me... I am not... I'm sorry.
                         
          With that JULIAN walks across the parking lot towards the
          POLICE to turn himself in. ANDREW walks up behind ABEL and
          stands there looking.
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           I'm late. I will meet you at four.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I'm gonna try to get us a little
           more time.
                         
          The three COPS are standing waiting as JULIAN walks towards
          them. ABEL turns around, facing the camera, and closes his
          eyes in sadness.
                         
          With ABEL in the foreground we see JULIAN make it halfway to
          the COPS, then he stops.
                         
<b>                          COP 1
</b>           Hey.
                         
          ABEL'S face tells us he knows what is coming.
                         
          JULIAN sets off running. Before the COPS can get close to him
          he is off. ABEL turns and sees what is happening. He does not
          follow chase. His head just drops.

<b>          EXT. VARIOUS 1980'S URBAN DECAY LANDSCAPES
</b>          We are now with JULIAN again, running. But as this chase
          continues we see his face turn from fear, to desperation, to
          a creeping sense of evil. He does not know how it has come to
          this, but as he jumps down from fences and runs across
          deserted lots we see that his weakness is turning.
                         
          As he runs through some of the most bombed-out, destroyed
          sections of Queens, he just never stops. With each step his
          fear turns to... anger.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. BLOWN-OUT BUILDING

          He stops, collapses, and hides behind a blown-out building
          wall just as a COP CAR drives by. He starts to almost cry,
          but then it again becomes something else. His survival
          instinct is taking over and we are not sure what will become
          of it. Anger.

          They slide the offer across the table. ANDREW opens it and
          gives it a once over.

          ANDREW gets up and prepares to leave. LAWRENCE stands with
          him and walks him out into the hallway.

          LAWRENCE turns and walks back into his office. ANDREW walks
          down the hallway all alone then stops. He reaches into his
          briefcase and takes out the offer. He looks it over again.
          Then he looks towards the ground and almost looks like he
          might cry. There is a distinct sense of responsibility for
          the situation that ABEL finds himself in that is starting to
          bring ANDREW to the edge.

          He hands him the plea deal from the DA. ABEL looks it over

          stares at her for a beat. Then for the first time we hear him
          speak Spanish. (This whole conversation is in Spanish)

          ABEL moves his chair closer. It's meant to be, and is a bit
          threatening.

          where he was hiding and knocks over ABEL. JULIAN runs to the

          He starts flying down the stairs at top panic speed. ABEL
          follows him down half the flight and realizes it is useless.

          20's, LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ who's overweight, but confident. The

           of respect for the business he had

          looking around at an office that is similar to his. A phone
          on the receptionist's desk rings. She picks it up.

          Finally they come through a door and into a small back
          private dining room where fifteen of their COMPETITORS, a
          couple of whom we have already met (Including LORRAINE and
          SAUL LEFKOWITZ, and ARNOLD KLINE), are sitting around the
          table meeting and waiting for them to arrive. The whole room
          looks up at them.
                         
          O'LEARY is at the head of the table at the far end of the
          room. He stands up to greet them and then so does the rest of
          the room.

          speak.

          ABEL is deadly serious. He just lets this sit and looks
          around the room at each person. They all seem to be waiting
          for him to continue. But he doesn't. He just lets this sit.
          Finally PETER FORENTE, who is across from ABEL, shifts in his
          seat and leans forward.
                         
<b>                          PETER FORENTE

           got here and... of course everyone
           in this room is fully capable of
           lying to their own mothers on their
           deathbeds, but... the conclusion we
           have come to... I should say we are
           fairly convinced after a very frank
           conversation... that these guys who
           are doing this... that they don't
           actually work for anyone in this
           room. As you know there are many
           other smaller providers in the area
           that might be responsible who are
           not here tonight.
                         
          This sits in the room for a long beat. Everyone then shifts
          back their attention to ABEL waiting for his response.
          Finally.
<b>                          ABEL

           110,000 gallons of fuel has been
           stolen from my family and I. Now
           the reason we asked Bill to get you
           all here is because the people in
           this room are the only people
           within two hundred miles of here
           who have the ability to purchase
           and store that kind of quantity.

           have been telling each other one of
           you... or two... or three... has
           been allowing this to happen by
           buying this from these cowards or
           worse yet hiring these guys just to
           do it. And profiting from it. So

</b>          ABEL is driving towards the office and is listening to the
          idle chatter on the radio between the dispatcher and the
          drivers who are out. They are underneath the Brooklyn Queens
          Expressway in stop and go traffic.
                         
          Suddenly a panic stricken VOICE blasts through on the radio.

</b>           Where are you?
                         
          We now hear the driver yell at the TWO GUYS coming at him.

<b>           RADIO DISPATCHER V.O.
</b>           Eddy? Eddy?
                         
          ABEL looks up at the street where they are and realizes this
          is going down right down the street from them. He's had
          enough.
                         
          He pulls across the intersection and heads down a street. He
          comes to the next intersection and right in front of him the
          truck comes flying by.
                         
          He looks to his right and sees EDDY standing at the side of
          the road. But he wants to end this. So he pulls out and
          starts following the truck leaving EDDY behind.
                         
          ABEL follows the truck for several blocks through the
          industrial neighborhood. He is tempted to pull up alongside
          of it to see who is driving but doesn't. He continues to
          follow him.

</b>                         
                         
          They get to a light and the truck makes a right hand turn
          and, as they are turning, LOUIS SERVIDIO who is sitting in
          the passenger seat looks behind him and sees that ABEL is
          following him. It now turns into a high speed chase as the
          driver steps on it.
                         
          They race down a ramp into a railyard. ABEL chases the truck
          as it crosses the tracks and heads towards an abandoned
          tunnel. The truck races into the tunnel and ABEL follows. The
          truck is throwing up a dust storm and ABEL has a difficult
          time seeing where he is going but he keeps up.
                         
          The roadway is very bumpy and both the truck and ABEL'S car
          are thrown around and the truck almost hits the sides of the
          tunnel.
                         
          The light at the end of the tunnel starts to appear through
          the dust but we can't see the truck. As ABEL comes into the
          light he has to SLAM on his brakes because the TRUCK has
          flipped over in front of him.
                         
          As he gets out of his car he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO jumping down
          from the overturned cab and run off into the train yard. ABEL
          looks at the crushed cab of the truck and sees the DRIVER has
          been killed. There is a gun sitting on the dash of the truck
          and ABEL looks and thinks. He then picks up the gun and
          chases after LOUIS SERVIDIO.
                         
          In the distance he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO leave the yard and
          head up into an elevated subway station.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY
</b>                         
          ABEL runs up the stairs of the station and hops onto a
          leaving train just as the doors shut. ABEL looks around.
          There are three people in his car. It is covered in graffiti.
          He starts making his way down to the end of the train where
          the guy is.
                         
          He looks into the last car and sees LOUIS SERVIDIO and just
          bull rushes him to the ground. He starts beating on him very,
          very badly with the pistol. All the rage comes out of him. He
          then aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO.
                         
<b>                          LOUIS SERVIDIO
</b>           Please. Please.
                         
          They stare at each other.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Your friend is dead... who do you

<b>                          LOUIS SERVIDIO
</b>           This was it anyway. Okay... Okay.
          ABEL looks right through him and then finally lowers the gun
          and releases his hands from around his jacket and he gets up
          and looks back at ABEL.
                         
<b>           LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D)
</b>           Thank you.
                         
          LOUIS SERVIDIO then runs out of the car as the door opens.
          ABEL sits up and slows his breathing down. Finally he looks
          around the trashed car and sees that a woman has been in the
          car with them the whole time and she is just staring at him.

          but is worse for the wear. ARNOLD KLINE is sitting in one of

           the load of fuel off a friend's
           tanker straight from Texas. As I'm
           sure you know Texas #4 is marked.
           But that was just one load, so
           every truck that has left my lot
           for the last two weeks has been
           marked with dye that I've put in...
           And luckily four more of my trucks
           got jacked since.... My guess is
           there are at least 4600 gallons of
           marked fuel in your small tank
           right now.

           this money and keep it right where
           it is... because I'm going to
           pretend that we never had this

          ABEL and the rest are left totally in shock. They are beside
          themselves. But out of the corner of his eye ABEL notices
          that the bullet has also pierced through the tank and amid
          the red spray a flow of black heating oil is pouring out
          through the bullet hole onto the ground.
                         
          ABEL steps around JULIAN'S body and goes over to the hole. He
          picks up an old rag from the ground and stuffs it into the

</b>           So... I should tell you that I
           won't be able to take that deal you
           offered. There is no way I would
           ever accept a felony charge for
           anything we've done.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I know.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I am not a felon.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           That's probably true.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           But I also can't have you digging
           around my life and keeping this
           hanging around my neck for the next
           ten years. I love fighting a good
           battle but this... it's very bad
           for my business.
                         
          This gets Lawrence's attention.
<b>                          130

<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           So, we need to come to some sort of
           conclusion.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           We can probably do that.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Good.
          They both look out for a beat.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I hear you closed on this terminal
           today?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           It looks that way.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I didn't realize that you had that
           in the works.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           For a very long time.
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           That will put you in quite a
           powerful position.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Within my business it has that
           potential.
                         
          LAWRENCE shifts his tone ever so slightly.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           If you get this place up and
           running again it will have
           significant influence...
           politically speaking.
                         
          ABEL picks up on the word POLITICALLY and stares down
<b>          LAWRENCE.
</b>                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
</b>           We all have our ambitions.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes.
                         
          LAWRENCE gives a slight smile and then pauses.
<b>                          131
</b>                         
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           And sometimes we need help to get
           there... You've come a very long
           way.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes, I have.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           In a very short time.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           It doesn't feel that way... But
           please know that I have always
           chosen the path that was the most
           right.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           The most right?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           That one makes my head hurt a
           little.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           The result is never in question for
           me. Just what path do I take to get
           there. And I have never questioned
           my path. There is always one that
           is most right. And that is what
           this is.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I hope so.
                         
          They look at each other and then out over the city.
                         
                         
                         
<b>                          THE END
