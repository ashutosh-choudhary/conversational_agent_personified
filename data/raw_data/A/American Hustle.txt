<b>    TITLE CARD: SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED
</b>
<b>    OVER BLACK: APRIL 26, 1978, PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK
</b>
<b>1   FADE IN:

<b>2   INT. PLAZA HOTEL WINDOW NYC - DAY                               
</b>
    IRVING ROSENFELD, not a small man, gets dressed and
    meticulously constructs his combover. Camera WRAPS AROUND,
    see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit, up to
    his face, serious, concentrated, intense, he is composing
    himself before a performance.

    Irving is now dressed, ready, and walks down the hall to
    another room.

<b>3   SECOND PLAZA HOTEL ROOM
</b>
    Irving composes himself -- looks     
    into cramped surveillance closet, there are FBI Agents -- we
    only see their hands and arms -- he looks at monitors -- sees
    a BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF ANOTHER ROOM ON MONITOR: MAYOR
    CARMINE POLITO, swath of salt and pepper hair, cream suit,
    pinky ring, Rotary Club pin -- ALONG WITH CARL ELWAY, preppie
    shady businessman.

    He exhales pressure, turns as CAMERA PANS TO: SYDNEY PROSSER
    (who will also be known for some time as EDITH GREENSLY),
    stylish crafty smart. They stare at each other intensely --
    they have a deep and emotional relationship. A DOOR BANGS
    OPEN, and in walks RICHIE DIMASO, Bronx-born. He stands
    there.

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>               What are you doing, going behind my
               back? Telling people I'm screwing
               up this operation? I got you a
               suite at the fuckin' Plaza Hotel!

</b>               The shittiest suite at the Plaza

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>
               What?!

<b>                         IRV ROSENFELD
</b>               The shittiest fuckin' suite.

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO

<b>                         IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>
               And the food is wrong, and--What is
               this? You, like, went in my closet
               or something?

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>               No

<b>                         IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>               Are you dressing him like you're
               dressing me now?

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>                   (shakes her head)
               No, what are you thinking? This
               isn't all about you, you know that.

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>               What, did you try to dress me so I
               would look like him?

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>               No, you're not dressed like him,
               all right?

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>               But I do, I look like him.

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>               No, he's in like, velvet. Come on.

<b>                         IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>               You asked me to show you how this
               was done, you wanna fuck it up be
               my guest.

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>               What is your problem?


<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>               Hey, look, I never laid a hand on
               her, all right? Is that what this
               is about?

<b>                         EDITH GREENSLY
</b>                        (British accent)
               Well technically, that's not true.

<b>                         RICHIE DIMASO
</b>               Look, we never had sex ok? I just --
<b>                                                            3.
</b>

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)
</b>               What'd I do? I put my hand like
               this --

    Richie reaches out and puts his hand on Irving's face very
    carefully, not forcefully.

    Irving swipes it away violently the second it touches his
    face.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          Don't you fucking touch me. That
          bothers me --

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          Oh it does?

<b>                     IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          Oh yeah.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          That bothers you?

<b>                     IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          Yes.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          You know, a lot of shit bothers me
          too, but I was trying to help you.
          If I wanted to bother you, if I
          really wanted to fucking bother
          you, this is what I'd do.


    Richie takes his hand and destroys the combover Irving spent
    so much time creating. Irving just stands there, hair ruined,
    staring at Richie.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          You shouldn't have done that.

    Irving just stands there staring at Richie, hair all wild and
    messed up looking very angry.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          How's that? You bothered now? (no
          answer) Alright, don't make a thing
          of it.

<b>                     EDITH GREENSLY
</b>          You shouldn't touch him. He doesn't
          like that.
<b>                                                                4.
</b>

<b>                        RICHIE DIMASO
</b>              Oh my god, fix his hair. Don't make
              a thing of it.

<b>                        EDITH GREENSLY
</b>              It takes some time, ok.

    Edith walks over to Irving who is still standing there in
    silence with his hair all over the place. She carefully
    starts helping him put it back together.

<b>                        RICHIE DIMASO
</b>              Big fucking deal. We got to get in
              the other room, come on. The
              mayor's in there.

<b>                        EDITH GREENSLY
</b>              Yes I know that.

<b>                        RICHIE DIMASO
</b>              Should we go to the beauty parlor?
              Is that what we should do?

    Richie walks over and opens up a briefcase that's sitting on
    the dresser. Inside are stacks of cash.

    Edith is still helping Irving put his hair back together.

<b>                        IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>              How's it look.

<b>                        EDITH GREENSLY
</b>              You look fine.

    Richie slams the briefcase shut looking very nervous and
    intense.

<b>                          RICHIE DIMASO
</b>              Let's go.

</b>
<b>                        CARMINE POLITO
</b>              I thought he was going to be here.
              I do business face to face, person
              to person. That's just who I am.


    Richie reaches down and awkwardly slides the briefcase over
    to Carmine unprompted. LEAVE MONITOR'S POV AND RETURN BACK TO
<b>    THE SCENE.
</b>
<b>    IRV'S EYES WIDEN AS IN `NO! DON'T DO THAT!' WHILE HE AND
</b><b>    RICHIE STARE AT EACH OTHER, EDITH TENSE, CARMINE LOOKS
</b><b>    DISTURBED AT THE CASE COMING HIS WAY. HE STANDS ABRUPTLY.
</b>
<b>                        CARL ELWAY
</b>              Whoa, excuse me, excuse me. I'll
              handle that for the Mayor.

<b>                        RICHIE DIMASO
</b>              No, it's for the Mayor. It would be
              a sign of disrespect to the sheik
              if the mayor didn't take it
              himself. It's for you Mayor.

    Carmine looks angry and confused. He looks over to Carl.

<b>                        CARMINE POLITO
</b>              What are you doing? What-- (to
              Carl) Carl, what the fuck? What is
              this?

<b>                        CARL ELWAY
</b>              No, I'll handle it. I'm gonna take

              got everything under control. (TO
              RICHIE) That's for me. I handle all
              that for mayor.

<b>                        CARMINE POLITO
</b>              What is this?

    Irving looks over and says nothing. Not surprised at all how
    badly this is all going.
<b>                                                         6.

Edith whispers to Richie.

<b>                    EDITH GREENSLY
</b>          (whispers to Richie)
          Just stop it, ok

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          (whispers to Edith)
          He's gotta take it himself, okay?

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO
</b>          I don't know what the fuck that is
          but it's weird you understand?

<b>                    CARL ELWAY
</b>          Misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO
</b>          I came here to meet a sheik, that's
          all I know. I'm very interested in
          that but he's not here apparently.
          Carl?!

Carmine turns and starts to walk out of the room.

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm very interested in meeting the
          Sheik. You let me know when THAT
          could happen! Thank you, have a
          good day.

Carmine leaves the room.

Irving looks over and shrugs his shoulders. Not surprised at
all the way this is going and horrified that Richie has
ruined it.

<b>                    CARL ELWAY
</b>              (leaving)
          Irving! You better come get him.


<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>              (stares at Irv)
          Go out there and get him right now.

<b>                    CARL ELWAY
</b>          Help me get him back!

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          Go get him. He needs to take the
          fuckin' briefcase, Irving.
<b>                                                            7.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          I didn't wanna do it in the first
          place. This is your show, YOU go
          get him.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          No, you have no choice. You have
          to go get him. Now, go get him, so
          he takes the briefcase by himself!
          That's the whole plan, Irving!

Irving stands up angry and gets in Richie's face.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          What were you doing pushing the
          fucking briefcase, dummy? Huh?

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          The whole fuckin' thing was falling
          apart. You know how much I paid
          for this goddamn hotel that you
          fucking asked for?!

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          Now I gotta go mop up your mess.
          I'm gonna go fucking mop up your
          mess!

Irving storms out of the hotel suite towards the Elevators to
get Carmine.

          in divorces. Women get the
          children, and then the fathers
          never see them. My mother never got
          divorced. My grandmother never got
          divorced. There are NO divorces in

               people that do what you do.
               Fraudulent investments. Fake
               certificates of deposit. Stolen

     A NICE UPPER EAST SIDE apartment. Sydney has finally changed
     her clothing from when she wore the same dress at the holding

lovingly which quickly turns into a slap as she continues on.

<b>          EDITH GREENSLY
</b>Oh no, I said we shouldn't do any

He's got vision. Do it heavy or
don't do it.

<b>          IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>I mean, he's the one ruining
America, not me.

<b>          RICHIE DIMASO
</b>How the hell am I ruining America?

<b>           IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>Because people just got over
Watergate and Vietnam, alright?
And you're gonna shit all over
politicians again? And just because
you want to be a big shot and get a
promotion.

<b>          RICHIE DIMASO
</b>No I'm thinking big. This is gonna
be fantastic. We're doing video
surveillance. I'm doing this from
the feet up.

<b>          IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>You will never do it properly

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Speaker of the State Assembly --
          you gotta knock him off of his
          fucking feet. He's gotta feel like
          he's out of his league. What you're
          offering, this deal, I mean, this
          is unheard of in the state of New
          Jersey, maybe even the whole
          fucking country. A sheik with
          hundreds of millions of dollars to
          rebuild Atlantic City -- are you
          fuckin' kidding me? That's
          gigantic. And the Mayor, he's going
          to want to see cash, he's going to
          want to see it in an account, he's
          going to want to see it right now,
          and he will check. And that's why
          this meeting isn't happening,
          because to get millions, you need
          millions.

Edith listens intently.

Richie stands very close to Edith - between her legs as she
sits on the counter. He puts his hands on her hips, pulls
her into him. He takes her hand -- puts it on his face,
makes her feel his cheek and forehead with her hand. It is
intense. She prepares for him to kiss her but he steps back.
They are both excited. They stare at each other. The air is
thick with tension, Richie exhales and leaves.

          my obsession -- Moving, re-
          decorating, it makes me feel better
          like exercise. There's this top
          coat that you can only get from
          Switzerland and I don't know what
          I'm going to do because I'm running
          out of it but I LOVE the smell of
          it.

<b>                    DOLLY POLITO
</b>          I can get that for you, of course.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          There's something, the topcoat,
          (sniffs nails) it's like perfumey
          but there's also something rotten?
          I know that sounds crazy, but I
          can't get enough of it.

Dolly laughs.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)
</b>          No, smell it. It's true. Dolly,
          historically the best perfumes in

          something nasty and foul. It's
          true!

She puts it under Irv's nose as he talks to Carmine, he
sniffs, closes his eyes, nods without even looking.

She leans across the table and puts them under Carmine's
nose.

</b>          Smells like flowers.

</b>          Flowers, but with garbage.

</b>          You know what that is for me? It's
          coriander for me.

</b>          Irving loves it. He can't get
          enough. That's what hooks you. He
          always comes back for it.

      in the middle as Carmine ENTHUSIASTICALLY CONTINUES HIS

</b>                So this is the lobby. Now mind you,
                a week ago this place was a mess,
                but what existed was this
                plasterwork. Look at the detail.
                This is beautiful. My sons are
                craftsmen. (to son, Dominic)
                Please, tell them what you did.

<b>                          CARMINE POLITO
</b>                We can restore all of this, you
                see? You save 50 million -- look at
                me -- fifty million right off the
                bat -- I waive the law I helped
                write. It said casino construction

      Carmine leads all of them through the very crowded lobby as
      he talks.

      Irving listens intently, moved.

</b>                There are some gentlemen over there
                at the bar. That's a hundred and

                them. They run the biggest casinos
                in the United States. We have to

</b>          Yes, but they're businessmen, okay?
          Now, spend as much or as little
          time with them as you like, but we
          do have to deal with them. All
          we've got to do is go say hello.
          We just gotta say hi, that's all.

Edith looks on, calm, as Richie -- WILD EYED WITH COCAINE AND
<b>ADRENALINE --
</b>
<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          Carmine, maybe -- I'm not sure

          about? They're casino guys.

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO

<b>                     RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          We came all this way, Irving. We
          should be here. What's everybody
          scared of? There's nothing to be
          scared of.

Richie stares down Irv, Edith pulls Richie back -- Rosalyn is
starting to go down a SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION as she looks
increasingly uncomfortable.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          They don't scare me.

She glares at Edith and Irv and pivots to walk to the bar.

But she's already on her way over to the MAFIA MEN at the bar
who GREET HER WARMLY as Irv, Edith, Richie, and Carmine
watch.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          I love this!

Rosalyn walks up to PETE MUSANE, CHARISMATIC, 30 and sits
down in between all the Mafia guys.. THE OTHER THREE SALT AND
PEPPER MAFIA GUYS LAUGH AND TALK WITH Rosalyn - who gulps a
glass of PROSECCO and IS REFILLED BY PETE MUSANE.

<b>                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD

Carmine whispers to Irv as he watches Rosalyn talk to the
Mafia guys.

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO
</b>          Irving, this is not a good idea.

</b>          How you guys doing? Everybody over
          there is really scared of you guys,
          you know that?

She knocks back the prosecco. She seems relieved.

Dolly ushers her kids to the door.

</b>          Kids, I want you to go up and get
          some pizza and soda, please.

Irving and Edith watch in horror at Rosalyn.

</b>          It's a disaster.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          because she's so beautiful --

He touches the front of her huge Farrah overhang bangs.
Richie, Irving, Carmine, and the Sheik walk up to them.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO

Irving takes the glass of prosecco out of Rosalyn's hand and
puts it on table.

<b>                    PETE MUSANE AND GUYS

<b>                    ROSALYN
</b>          It's because he's a party pooper.
          He's so boring.

Irving stares fuming at Rosalyn and the guys, he nods and
forces a smile good naturedly as they put prosecco glass in
his hand. He knows how to fake it.

The Sheik acknowledges them with a nod. Irv is extremely
uncomfortable.

<b>                    PETE MUSANE
</b>          Mr. Sheik, as a sign of our

<b>                    PETE MUSANE
</b>          He's in the back room.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD
</b>          It's a sign of disrespect to do
          business on the first meeting.

<b>                    RICHIE DIMASO
</b>          That's not true. I don't know what

</b>          Well, don't leave him back there in
          the back room waiting. Come on,

Rosalyn reaches to have her glass refilled by Dick Helsing
when one of the other guys NUDGES her hip in her tight dress
and she drops into Pete Musane's lap.

       Irving turns and heads with dread towards the back door with
       Carmine, Richie, and the Sheik. Sydney, worried about Rosalyn

Busboys whip open a white table cloth for the table.

Everyone sits down. Tellegio looks at the Sheik, then over to
Richie.

<b>                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
</b>          Tell him I speak for our friends in

          been our lifelong dream to build

Richie pretends to translate in the Sheik's ear.

<b>                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
</b>          You told him that? They didn't want
          the Jews to make money, they didn't
          want the Italians to make money,
          definitely don't want the blacks to
          make money. After the oil embargo --
          the gasoline crisis -- the
          hijackings, the Olympics, they
          don't want to see Arabs make money,
          trust me, not on our soil. You can
          tell him this in your own way: I've
          been in the casino business forty
          years. It's scrutinized more
          carefully than any other business.
          Carmine made this legal, but we
          must be careful or they'll take it
          away.

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO

<b>                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
</b>          Don't get your balls in an uproar.
          Everything's fine, everything's
          good. It's all good. It's all good.
          I just hope the other part of this
          is all good. And real. Because
          we're real. You know that. You deal
          with us. We're a real organization.
          We deal with you, we don't know
          what we're dealing with.

Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence.
This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to
Richie and points to the Sheik.

Irving watches in horror as --

<b>                    VICTOR TALLEGIO
</b>          Where's he from?

<b>                     RICHIE DIMASO

<b>                     VICTOR TELLEGIO
</b>              (in subtitled Arabic)
          (Can I count on you? You gotta be
          honest about this. Do you
          understand me? Good means good. No

</b>          (to Sheik)
          (Did you hear what I said? Do you

Irving looks ill, as does everyone else at the table.

<b>                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
</b>          (What do you think now? Tell me.

<b>                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
</b>          No, let him speak for himself.

Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense
moment for everyone at the table.

Tellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie
share a look -- what is he doing?

A DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor
BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys
jump in and grab him and start to pull him away.

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO
</b>          No, I know him.

<b>                    AL KOWALSKI
</b>          You guys are way too serious for a
          party!(to Tellegio) Hey, what are
          you drinking? You got a drink?

<b>TELLEGIO GLARES BACK AT THE INTRUSION.
</b>

<b>                    CARMINE
</b>              (to Al)
          We're in a very serious meeting.
          (to Tellegio) I apologize.

<b>TELLEGIO DOES NOT LOOK AMUSED.
</b>
<b>                    AL KALOWSKI
</b>          I understand, you're in conference.
          You gotta come with me now. You got
          a speech to give. Everyone's
          waiting for you.

<b>                    CARMINE POLITO
</b>          Al, I'll be right behind you, okay?
          Trust me.

Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio
to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASS
<b>INTRO OF "WHITE RABBIT" FADES UP ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
</b>
<b>                    SHEIK ABDULLAH
</b>              (In Arabic)
          It is great doing business with
          you. The investment is real. It was
          a pleasure to meet you.

Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything
passable in Arabic.
<b>                                                        96.

<b>                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)
</b>          What are the odds of an Italian guy
          from Miami knowing Arabic? But it
          turns out he's got casino
          investments in the Mideast and he
          spent two years learning it to keep
          the upper hand.

Victor leans over to talk to Carmine.

<b>                    VICTOR TELLEGIO
</b>          Listen to me carefully. If you're
          real, you put ten million in the
          bank of our choice in the next two
          weeks.

Carmine nods.

<b>                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)
</b>          Carmine, listen to me carefully, if
          you're real, you put ten million in
          the bank of our choice in the next
          two weeks or not only will the
          Sheik feel insulted, but our
          friends in Florida will feel deeply
          disrespected and so will I.

Irving looks at Victor, who stares back at him. This is bad.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          I knew it. I have always said,
          Irving, that you are very, very
          hard to motivate properly. And I
          knew that Pete was gonna go over
          there and knock some sense into
          you. I've been reading this book,
          Irving. It's by Wayne Dyer, about

Irving can't believe what he's hearing right now.

Rosalyn, very satisfied, reaches over the bed and grabs a

himself to say gently --

          and all of that. You're gonna say
          how you were wrong, you were wrong
          about that.

<b>                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD
</b>          I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but
          you know that in real life, I was
          right for saying all that stuff
          because then that spurred on the
          actions that made you come up with
          this plan. So I will tell Pete.
