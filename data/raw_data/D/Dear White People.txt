</b>               A "race war" has erupted at one of
               the nation's oldest and most
               prestigious institutions.

     Glued to this are our story's subjects, who we meet in...

     TROY FAIRBANKS, 21, Black. He drags a brush through his
     finger waves anxiously. The look of guilt is the only mark
     of imperfection in his privileged and chiseled demeanor.

</b>               Outrage over an "African American
               Themed" party organized by
               predominately white students of
               Manchester University has resulted
               in rioting and property damages.

2A   KURT FLETCHER, 21, white. No sympathy in his jaded blue      2A
     eyes as he watches on an iPad in a lavish parlor room.

</b>               Guests were invited to "liberate
               their inner Negro, fry up chicken,
               enjoy a sugar water concoction
               known as Purple drank and wear
               oversized Barack Obama T-shirts."

2B   COLANDREA CONNERS (COCO), 20, Black with blue contacts    2B

     small TV in her dorm. A smirk on her glossy pink lips.            *

<b>                         ANCHOR (CONT'D)
</b>               Officials claim an investigation is
               underway to find those responsible
               for the event and subsequent riot.

2C   SAMANTHA WHITE (SAM) 21, records the broadcast in an       2C
     edit bay. Despite her light skin, the Afro pick in her fro
     pompadour leaves little doubt she identifies as Black.

<b>                         ANCHOR (CONT'D)
</b>               In an effort to address diversity
               issues, the school appointed
               African American scholar Dr. Walter
               Fairbanks as Dean of Students.

<b>                         ANCHOR (CONT'D)
</b>               Last year the Dean's office
               celebrated slight gains in diverse
               applicants but with many now
               calling for Fairbanks' resignation,
               that may have been pre-mature.

2E   DEAN WALTER FAIRBANKS, a well adorned Black man in his       2E
     50's fights a panic as he watches in a stately office.

     She fades in JAZZ on her control board and leans back to

     "EBONY AND IVY: A SURVIVAL GUIDE." One by one she scribbles
     her autograph on the books.

     STUDENTS shove past him - one even slaps a flyer into his
     already full hands. Lionel's a guppy. The kind that gets
     eaten alive in a tank of sharks.

     As Lionel gets to the door of a large Colonial style home he
     checks his pockets. He's missing something. Shit.

               Kurt! You home?

     Lionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from
     inside. Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel's.

<b>                         ANSWERING MACHINE
</b>               Hey boyssss, you've reached Lionel

               the bigger the dick the less you'll
               have to pay me to ssssuck it.

     The beep sounds. Lionel's in shock. Should he hang up? Or...

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               Kurt. It's Lionel. I'm locked out.

     As Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he
     unfolds the flyer he was just handed. It's a rendering of Sam
     White on a carton of milk with the caption:

     Signs scream out "ORIENTATION" as jazz music wafts from the
     laptops of a group of NEO BEATNIKS. As the music fades...

</b>               Dear White People, apparently
               Morgan Freeman in "Deep Impact"
               wasn't enough. Despite two terms
               Obama could cure Cancer and
               somewhere White folks will be
               embroiled in protest. And he's only
               half Black.

     GABE, 24, white and ruggedly handsome in spite of his shaggy
     hair and "laundry day" flip flop clad ensemble, catches the
     end of this as he passes - grabs his cell phone and dials...

     right at us from a Youtube page pulled up on an iPad. She's

     The video ends with a click. Looking up is HELMUT WEST, a
     30's something Black man in dark rimmed glasses and trendy
     everything. Too stylish for this place. If he's impressed,
     it's barely perceptible.

          She's new to the house.

<b>                    TROY

</b>          Nice to meet you. I should get
          settled. Thanks Sof!

Sofia and Troy smile as Coco turns to go - and continue down
the hallway. Coco sneaks one last glance at Troy's ass.

<b>                    TROY
</b>          Think I got time for a quick cut?

<b>                    SOFIA
</b>          You got it cut last week.

<b>                    TROY
</b>          It's a Black thing babe.

<b>                    SOFIA
</b>          Since when is OCD a Black thang?

<b>                    TROY
</b>          Don't say "thang" like that.

<b>                    SOFIA

          Politicos booth, then a shift at
          Orientation, then your advisor --

<b>                         TROY

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Election night. Babe, come on.

     Sofia holds her tongue. Troy ignores this as he spots...

<b>                         TROY (CONT'D)
</b>               Yo, Kurt my man.

     ...Kurt Fletcher - flanked by guys who share his cynical
     knowing glare. We recognize them from the "Pastiche" portrait
     from before.

     As they chow down on Mac &amp; Cheese in the Dining Hall - Kurt's
     glare burns particularly hot towards Troy who waves at him.

<b>                         KURT
</b>               Sis.

     Sofia smiles at her brother Kurt. Troy covers the sting of
     his dismissal.

     They both spot Sam's "Missing: Black culture" flyers.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Is she kidding with this?

<b>                         SOFIA
</b>               You don't have to run again. Just
               because it's her doesn't mean --

<b>                         TROY
</b>               -- I can't let Sam and her wannabe
               Black Panthers take the House. The
               House needs me. This is who I am.

<b>                         SOFIA
</b>               It's who he wants you to be.

     Troy smiles over his irritation. This is an old fight.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Oh so you pick up a Psych class you
               think you Freud or something? Huh?

<b>                         SOFIA

               Fine Beck, Jung, Maslow...

     Troy gets a kiss out of her as they pass a booth featuring
     stacks of Sam's "EBONY &amp; IVY." The booth is manned by REGGIE,
     21, Black - his fro top and preppy punk attire is both
     bohemian and radical.

     Troy glares at Sam's picture on the book. It's on. There's a
     history between Sam and Troy. Off Reggie's laptop we hear...

<b>                         SAM (O.S.)

               Dating a Black person to piss off
               your parents is a form of racism.

     Sofia walks off as Troy hears snickers from around him.

<b>                         REGGIE
</b>               Yo Troy I forget. Is your major in

     Troy walks off as Reggie and Kurt watch him join Sofia.

     Water runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over
     the toilet. He blows the smoke out an open window through a
     paper towel tube with a dryer sheet attached to its end. He
     jots something down on a notepad as he whispers...

The audience is in STITCHES at this last line. Everyone
except Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro'd bohemian
disciples (who we'll call the BOFROS). Sam records the
proceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera.

<b>                    REGGIE
</b>          That's his platform? Haircuts?

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Oofta is as Oofta does.

Coco, sneaks through the door. She's got the eyes of Helmut
on her. What is he doing here? As Coco breaks eye contact she
sits in the only open spot next to...

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Just because we're colored don't
          mean we run on colored people time.

</b>          Boycotting hot combs don't make you
          an expert on "colored people" boo.

Coco wafts her silky hair over her shoulders and sits.

<b>                    TROY
</b>          No but seriously, I care about you
          guys. I care about this house. We
          had a great year last year and if
          it ain't broke...

Troy basks in his applause. Coco eats him up with her eyes.

Sam doesn't want to get up - her breathing gets heavier.

<b>                    REGGIE
</b>          Just pretend like you're in the
          booth. Just you and the mic.

<b>                    SAM

As Sam gets up and passes Troy --

<b>                    TROY

          from me?

Sam grabs the mic. Her voice shakes before the silent crowd.

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Troy my brother, it's broke.

The BoFros cheer and make noise on each line.

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Troy's a legacy kid. And yet it's
          under his watch that Armstrong /
          Parker, the bastion of Black
          culture here was gutted. By the
          Randomization of Housing Act.
          Second years of color no longer
          have a say in where they go. The
          culture that's been fostered in
          this house for two decades will be
          wiped out in two years.

Troy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up --

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          This wasn't motivated by a desire
          to mix things up. Bring about
          racial and socioeconomic harmony.
          No, the Black kids are sitting
          together in the proverbial
          cafeteria and they must be up to no
          good.

Coco's eyes are in the back of her head.

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          We sit together to protect
          ourselves. Over a century of houses
          grouped by sports affiliations,
          political leanings, majors, you
          name it. Black folks get their own
          house, suddenly we got a problem?

Students look at each other stunned. Are they turning? Sam
delivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy.

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          This Act doesn't affect the other
          houses like it does ours. There are
          plenty of trustees, former coaches,
          and presidents watching out for the
          others. All we have is a Dean who'd
          rather please his massa --

</b>          -- Yo that's enough of that Sam --
<b>                                                             14.
</b>

<b>                         SAM
</b>               -- then stand up for his own. Look,
               I know ya'll ain't voting for me.
               Ya'll ain't ready and I didn't come
               here for that. The Black Student
               Union and I have brought a petition
               to repeal the Randomization of
               Housing Act. I plan on bringing it
               to the President and together we
               can bring Black back to Manchester.
               It'll be by the door.

     Sam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. The BoFros go crazy
     - give her daps and all sorts of praise.

     MARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with
     neat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand.

<b>                         MARTIN

<b>                         MARTIN
</b>               Good. Voting may commence.

     Everyone takes out smart phones. Reggie hides his from view
     as he punches something in.

     Troy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who
     give him a head nod. Troy's got this. After a moment...

<b>                          MARTIN (CONT'D)
</b>               Okay. Looks like we've got
               ourselves a winner.
                   (devastated)
               Sam White?

     The blood drains from Sam's face and Troy's smile plummets
     into the floor as the two turn to look at each other.

<b>                            TROY &amp; SAM

     Reggie's grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and
     slips a card to a still stunned Sam. Coco watches him go.

     trades "No Homo's" with the others.

George holds up Sam's "Ebony &amp; Ivy." Lionel takes it.

Lionel shakes his head "yes" and "no" at the same time.

</b>          You come up with a good angle? I

know he's never heard these words. Never belonged any place.
Doesn't hurt there's a handsome boy smiling at him either.

     Troy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their

     between them.

     Troy gets up to leave as Reggie sits - suspicious. Sam's

     Lionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights
     with a notepad. He flips through Sam's "EBONY &amp; IVY" book...

               and discuss everything from Kanye
               West lyrics to theoretical

               actually do your hair.

<b>     ARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Lionel enters and takes a place in a line. He absorbs this
     lively and somewhat alien dining hall.

     Troy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or
     so friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean
     art major.

<b>                         MARTIN
</b>               "We wuz robbed." That election was
               suspect man.

     Martin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. Sam
     breaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               You call me the minute there's an
               update. Love you too mom.

     Sam hangs up. The call's really put her in a bad place. She
     sits at a table of her Bofros - who we'll name by their hair.

Reggie glances over at Martin's Mac Air.

<b>                    REGGIE
</b>          Cute. You get that at Toys R Us?

Sam pulls out her Mac and her student ID card.

</b>          Good thing the one evil techno-

Sam pushes aside all the paperwork on her table.

</b>          So this is what the revolution
          looks like? Office hours and

Sam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room.

Sam feels the heat of her disciples' eyes on her as the topic
of the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with
a group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white
and Black.

          one. Never ran into any lynch mobs.

Lionel takes a seat alone facing the action.

Kurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in
the heart of the conversation. Lionel avoids eye contact.

<b>                    SAM

Kurt chuckles - a bit turned on by the argument.

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          You get lost? Bechet is that way.

<b>                    KURT

A flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco.

Kurt eyes this new adversary. Enjoys a good challenge.

          doing things my way.

Sam shoots this last one to Martin. Kurt rolls his eyes to
which Sam slams his tray to the ground.

Lionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad.

<b>                    KURT

          start a rebellion on the

     Kurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight
     snicker from Lionel which draws Sam's eyes right to him.

     Something sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts
     to GEORGE: "I've got the angle. I'm in."

     Lionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him.

     Sam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady
     applause. Troy and his table look around baffled.

     By the caution on Sam's face it seems the first time she's
     ever heard this sound directed at her.

     A slight envy boils in Coco.

     One last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out.
     Locked out again.

H) Dialogue Card: "FIN"

PROFESSOR BODKIN, late 40s, with a "seen it all before"
demeanor hides a grin and lets the room settle.

<b>                    PROFESSOR BODKIN
</b>          Okay. Does anyone have any comments
          for Sam's "Rebirth of a Nation?"

All of the kids are too scared to comment. Except...

<b>                    PROFESSOR BODKIN (CONT'D)
</b>          Gabe, go ahead.

<b>                    GABE

          it's a little self-congratulatory.
          Light on story and frankly
          thematically dubious.

          remind you that I sat through Birth

          and Tarantino week without protest.

<b>                    PROFESSOR BODKIN

          all fifteen pages of your
          unsolicited essay on why Gremlins
          is actually about suburban white
          fear of Black culture.

<b>                    SAM

</b>               My dad. He's sick. Had to go home.

<b>                         PROFESSOR BODKIN
</b>               If you need some time off, take it.
               But if you want to make it to next

</b>                We had a very enlightening

      Kurt and his crew cross over to Lionel's table. Kurt unzips
      his pants silently.

<b>                          KURT (CONT'D)
</b>                Do you accept?

      Lionel removes the headphones and turns to Kurt, just as he
      starts flopping his dick around off screen. Lionel quickly
      looks in the other direction. Kurt's friends crack up.

<b>                          GORDON

</b>                You got to talk to these people in
                a language they'll understand.

      Lionel shoves his headphones back on over his fro.

<b>                            LIONEL

      Lionel drowns them out. He flips through Sam's "Ebony &amp; Ivy"
      book to a section called...

WAITRESS, over it, crosses frame and glares coldly at us.

Lionel takes a seat at a booth with Sam across from him.

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)

Waitress huffs her way over to Lionel.

A wall-clock advances forty, before the food and check come.

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          Forty minutes? Man she's lucky I
          leave her forty cents. You do a

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          I reject the stereotype that

     Dean Fairbanks and PRESIDENT HERBERT FLETCHER, 50's in an

     Fairbanks eyeballs Fletcher - tension between the two.

<b>                         SAM (O.S.)
</b>               Turns out if you're too worried
               about Political Correctness to say
               "Black", odds are you secretly just
               want to call us niggers anyway and
               truth be told I'd rather you just

<b>                         DEAN FAIRBANKS
</b>               I'm sorry, was I supposed to take
               "Free speech my ass" as a

<b>                         PRESIDENT FLETCHER
</b>               This is your office's issue Walter.
               Especially after that episode with

</b>               Every race issue is my issue.

<b>                         PRESIDENT FLETCHER
</b>               It's a student issue. You are the

</b>          The Times has been watching us like
          a hawk. Last thing we need is some
          "race war" on newspapers across the
          country. How do you think our donor
          base will feel about that? Our fund-
          raiser is four weeks away.

<b>                    DEAN FAIRBANKS
</b>          How bad is this deficit of yours?

<b>                    PRESIDENT FLETCHER
</b>          Worse. But let me tell you
          something. If this blows up any
          further? It's on you Walter. Racism
          is over in America. And if anyone's
          still dealing with it, it's the --
          I don't know Mexicans probably.

Troy pokes his head in. Fairbanks cuts the radio off.

</b>          President Fletcher tells me his son

      Game Night and Kurt's house is filled with smoke, music, and
      rich kids who play cards at various tables.

      Coco, in a banging jumpsuit scans the room for prospects. A
      few eyes from the WHITE BOYS start to flicker her way. This
      perks her up, as she arches her back slightly...

      ...only to see their eyes follow the WHITE BRUNETTE HIPSTER
      GIRL who has entered behind her.

      Coco catches herself in the mirror. What don't they see?

     Sam's chic dorm surrounded by other street art. The BoFros

     Underground hip hop permeates the room. Sam refuses a joint
     coldly from Reggie - her eyes fixed on "SCHOOL DAZE" which

     Reggie puts his hands on Sam's belt and pulls her in to a
     kiss as a group walks by. Over Reggie's shoulder Sam sees...

     to be affected and sinks into a kiss from Reggie.

      Salt meet wound. She wants to go, but something nags at her.

<b>                           SOFIA
</b>                 What do you do in the bathroom?
                 When you leave the shower running?
                 Was it just to get away from me?

      Troy wagers his answer and decides to confess.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 I smoke weed and write jokes.

      Puzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia
      just turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as...

      ...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before
      Troy turns to enter the house.

</b>
      Lionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He
      turns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other's gaze.

      As they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that
      they're headed in the same direction.

<b>53A   UPSTAIRS                                                 53A

      Lionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it
      with a key. Troy's already at the door when he looks up and
      realizes Lionel's just entered his apartment.

</b>                 The Dean said it was the only
                 opening.

</b>

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               But you're not Head of House.

     Still stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door
     leaving Lionel alone in the living room.

<b>57   INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY                      57
</b>
     Lionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the
     different cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past
     and shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back.

<b>                         DREADS
</b>               Stay Black, my brother.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               Sure thing?

     Lionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the
     entrance - suddenly chums. Troy's getting good news and
     gladly shakes Kurt's hand.

<b>                         KURT
</b>               Need your submission by Thursday.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               You got it bro.

     The two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG
     in the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining
     hall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt.

<b>                           KURT
</b>               The fuck?

     Sam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her
     other support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed.

<b>                           TROY
</b>               Yo!

     Troy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the
     humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall.

     Lionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the
     other side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam
     briefly who shares the same smirk.

     He realizes Sam's actually looking at Reggie, perched behind
     him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.

          decide if you are friend or foe.

Reggie pulls a folded copy of the Bugle from under his arm.
Sam's on the front page with the headline "WHITE STUDENTS
<b>TOLD TO `GET OUT' BY LIONEL HIGGINS."
</b>
<b>                    REGGIE (CONT'D)
</b>          We got to protect our girl.

Reggie motions over to a stressed out Sam as she argues over
something with Martin at another table.

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          I'm not on staff. Not until I make

<b>                    REGGIE
</b>          Of which you are so clearly an

Shame floods Lionel's face.

<b>                    REGGIE (CONT'D)
</b>          So what's harder man? Being Black
          enough for the Black kids or the
          white ones?

<b>                    LIONEL

Another GONG sounds with another shower of paper balls. This
time it's for...

...Gabe, who's stuck outside. He makes eye contact with...

<b>                    GABE

She just looks away. Reggie eyes him coolly.

      Professor Bodkin watches over a small class as the students
      fill in essay questions. Sam's eyes are glued to a window...

      Outside below the Brofros pull up in an SUV. They hop out and
      start pulling out rally signs and bullhorns.

      Sam's eyes dart back to the clock as Gabe watches her watch
      the time.

      Sam bounds out of a building on her way to the parking lot.
      From behind her...

<b>                          DEAN FAIRBANKS
</b>                Running late.

      Sam pauses and turns to see him.

<b>                          SAM
</b>                The role of the counter culture is
                to wake up the mainstream to --

<b>                          DEAN FAIRBANKS
</b>                -- I've got furniture older than

<b>                          SAM

<b>                          DEAN FAIRBANKS
</b>                Your show is racist.

<b>                          SAM
</b>                Black people can't be racist.

      The Dean is rendered speechless at this statement.
<b>                                                              65.
</b>

<b>                          SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                Prejudice? Yes. But not racist.
                Racism describes a system of
                disadvantage based on race. Black
                people can't be racist since they
                don't benefit from such a system.

<b>                          DEAN FAIRBANKS
</b>                Your antics are making press Sam

<b>                          SAM
</b>                It's not my fault your son couldn't
                beat me in an election.

<b>                          DEAN FAIRBANKS
</b>                I'm sure it was hard growing up.
                Wondering which side you fit into.
                Feeling like you have to
                overcompensate perhaps?

<b>                          SAM
</b>                If that's true, I'm not the only
                one Dean.

      Sam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank's last words resonate
      more than she'd like.

      Gabe, making his way outside just catches her exit.

      Huge canvas signs with the words "WHITES ONLY" are strewn
      about the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs.

There's a vibration in Sam's pocket. Her phone says "MOM."
She cuts it off and picks up a "white's only" sign.

<b>                    REGGIE
</b>          Those are going up on Gillespie.
          Good right?

Sam shrugs in the affirmative but it's too much. Reggie sees
a doubt in her eyes.

</b>          Yo. What's that? You're not getting

<b>                    REGGIE
</b>          -- They came to hear you Sam. Grab

Sam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse
and comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to
her phone. Sam checks: "IT'S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME"

Sam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe
who's just happened upon the parking lot.

      Tears well up in Sam's eyes as she shakes her head no and
      heads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe.

      When Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted
      look of indignation asks her what she's doing.

<b>                          REGGIE

      Sam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie's

     Kurt is there. He stands and the two silently stare the other
     down as Kurt enters his father's office.

     A SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit
     the room. Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through

     Lionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over
     hears...

<b>                         GEORGE (O.S.)
</b>               Lionel's story on the would-be
               protest outside of Gillespie is
               running tomorrow and I'm also
               having Lionel work on a profile
               piece of Armstrong/Parker like you
               suggested. Really break down what's
               going on.

     Lionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a
     phone call.

<b>                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>               Right. It's almost like they
               recycle so much from their past -
               Music, food, fashion, and now
               turbulence.

     This leaves a bitter taste in Lionel's mouth.

<b>                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>               Thank you so much. Okay, take care.

     George can't fight his grin as he looks to Annie.

<b>                          ANNIE
</b>               Well?

<b>                         GEORGE
</b>               That was our Times advisor. He said
               it's stories like these that get
               editors recommendation letters.

     Lionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but
     reassured when they see who it is.

<b>                    ANNIE
</b>          Lionel please. You're only
          technically Black. G, going to

          seat?

<b>                    GEORGE
</b>          Thanks.

Annie smiles and walks out.

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          You need something? Saw your e-
          mail.

<b>                    GEORGE
</b>          Yeah, I need someone to do the
          Donor's function on Saturday. Small
          dinner for the school's big givers.

          coverage.

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          That's Halloween night.

<b>                    GEORGE
</b>          Right, which is why no one else
          will take it.

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          Ah. Thus the new guy.

George gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. Gets
close.

<b>                    GEORGE
</b>          On my way to class, but you can
          stay and check out last year's
          piece. You'll do fine.

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          I don't know. Are there going to be
          any racially fueled outbursts at
          this thing?

<b>                    GEORGE
</b>          Never know right?
<b>                                                              79.

     It's clear Lionel wants to say something else. George too.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               Am I a good writer?

<b>                          GEORGE
</b>               You'll get better. And we need you
               right now.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               You're just a big recommendation
               away from landing the Times.

<b>                         GEORGE
</b>               God I hope so.

     Lionel looks down. He is being used. Turns to go, just as --

<b>                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>               Hey.

     -- George grabs Lionel unsure what he wants to say. So
     instead he just kisses him.

<b>                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>               I'm glad we finally got that Bugle

     Lionel's all mixed up.

<b>                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>               There's a big party the night of

               maybe we can hang?

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               Yeah. Sounds good.

     George heads out - leaving Lionel perplexed.

     Troy stares at his reflection in a mirror as he lifts his du-

     costume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as
     pimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack
     Obama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.

      Coco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. She's
      feeling herself as she's handed a drink.

      She's got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a
      party. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw.

      Her confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath
      her party face. She switches her iPhone to video mode...

                Why are white folks so obsessed

                folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie
                doll weaves? Honeys it's a strange
                symbiosis we're here to explore...

      Coco's voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her
      iPhone. She pauses it and takes a breath.

      Lionel's lips. Runs his fingers through Lionel's hair.

<b>                         GEORGE
</b>               Don't you dare.

     George plunges his fingers into Lionel's fro once again.
     Pulls a touch too hard.

<b>                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>               I could eat you like a Hershey's.

     This sets something off in Lionel.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               I'll be right back.

     Lionel breaks George's grasp and heads out the bathroom...

     ...and back out into the party. He's trapped in a nightmare
     of caricatures and reveling students. Can't breathe.

     Lionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his
     head as he starts walking away from the party.

     Just then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some
     friends. Looks at Lionel then at the house.

     dining hall. Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense.

     A turntable is uncovered and rolled out - as a DUDE DRESSED
     LIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record.

     The crowd starts to get live now.

     Coco continues to make her way through the party - her face
     visibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. She
     continues out back...

      Sam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out.

      Sam's focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and
      then to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks.

      Lionel exits and paces down the hall. He walks by the dining
      room - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other
      students mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER.

      Lionel gingerly walks in the room. He's still an outsider
      here - but something's changed in him.

Lionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi.

Lionel smiles shyly. He should've known that.

Reggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front.

<b>                    DREADS
</b>          Your call then man.

          Alright ya'll - thanks for coming
          out tonight. Looks like Sam's not
          making it so...let's just call it.

The crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and
leave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think...

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          Uh. Excuse me. Hi. I'm Lionel. Some
          of you...none of you probably know
          me. I've never been to a meeting.
          But I just came back from a party
          on campus and I think you should
          know about it.

Lionel's nerves can be heard in his voice now. He's got the
judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an
open laptop on a desk.

<b>                    LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>          Anybody mind if I?

Reggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up
the party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel
browses through the photos.

<b>                    LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>          I mean...I don't know. This is
          fucked up right?

<b>                    REGGIE
</b>          Alright brother. What's the plan?

</b>

     Lionel realizes the eyes aren't judging. They're mobilizing.
     Readying for action. Lionel steels himself.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               We go over there. Now.

<b>                         CURLS

               on being a pissed off minority.
               Latino's United is meeting across
               the hall. Asian American League
               too.

     Troy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads
     from the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses.

     Shoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table
     covered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to

      ...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. But right
      behind George is...

      ...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed
      at the rap battle. She winks at Lionel.

      Lionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of

          I'd rather you think I'm white,

With that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He
then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over.

Sparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock.

Lionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground.
Lionel's off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes
Kurt away in his defense.

Gordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT.

More equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the
party disintegrates into chaos.

Sam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera.

Art is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on
the ground. Arguments come to physical blows.

The steel in Sam's gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak?

And then she spots...

Sam's camera and mic stay trained on Coco.

               not about to go out into the
               streets in protest of a Halloween
               party.

     Sam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco
     realizes it's herself she's trying to convince.

     Coco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is
     new for her. Keeping her mouth shut.

     Coco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her
     lashes, her bling - shedding the shame of the night.

     Kurt hustles Lionel out into the yard. Kurt shoves him to the
     ground.

<b>                         KURT
</b>               Dude. I know you can't help it...

     Lionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down.

<b>                         KURT (CONT'D)
</b>               ...but why are you such a fag dude?

     Lionel spits in Kurt's face and pops right back up again. We
     see it in his eyes - he'll never give up.

     Kurt's hand is on Lionel's collar. He pushes him down again.
     Kids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche -
     some from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back.

     Lionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt's eyes.
     Lionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               Finally got me where you want me.

     Kurt's in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him.

     Lionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as
     well. No time to soak this in though. Kurt's let up. For a
     moment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the
     face. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support.

     The shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out.

     The world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort
     of makes out that Kurt is yanked off him.

      Kids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard -
      One is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a
      couple POLICE OFFICERS surround him.

      The motor on Sam's Super 8 ticks away. The party is at a
      complete standstill.

      Troy enters and looks around in disbelief. Makes eye contact
      with Kurt who is being held by a Campus Safety Officer.

      Dean Fairbanks enters and stands in the middle of the chaos.

                Eleven numbers. Just like our

                and outrage. Instead, a hundred
                people showed up and they pulled
                out posters and decorations and
                costumes they'd made for just such
                an occasion.

      Sam and Dean Fairbanks at a stalemate.

      Silence falls in the room. The Dean's mind ticks.

<b>95    EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY                          95

      A pack of EMERALD BUGLE newspapers hit the stand with the
      headline: "INVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE! FLETCHER GOES FREE. NO

     Next to it is another stack of papers from the INDEPENDENT
     OBSERVER. The headline reads: "EBONY &amp; IVY: CAN THERE BE

</b>
     George picks up a copy of the Observer and starts to read...

     Lionel flips through his own article as well. A satisfied
     grin on his face as a razor makes its way through his hair.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               2 Chainz? Shaft? While endless

               aren't that many versions of us in
               the culture.

     His locks waft towards the ground as Troy styles a fresh and
     fearless fro-hawk atop Lionel's head.

<b>                         LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>               Culture has a powerful way of

               options are rather limited.

<b>                    GABE
</b>          Sam going against the grain?
          Shocked. How's papa White?

<b>                    SAM
</b>          He's recovering.

<b>                    GABE
</b>          Good. Well...

Gabe fights the urge to hug her.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          We were actually on the phone last
          night for hours. First time we
          talked since the bypass. He was
          putting up a strong front. Teasing
          me about being so worried. Then
          came the stories about me as a
          little girl I'd heard a thousand
          times. About how independent I was.

Gabe smiles politely. Senses she needs a moment.

<b>                    GABE
</b>          Want to talk about it?

<b>                    SAM
</b>          My mother worked nights so he would
          take me to school. And it pissed me
          off because he would follow me all
          the way to homeroom. Every time he
          tried to hold my hand I'd scream
          and pull away. He thought I was
          just being...difficult.

A hint of recognition in Gabe. Is this about them?

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          But it was the kids. And the
          parents and the teachers. They'd
          see this Black girl and this white
          man and wonder what we were doing
          together. Even at nine I could feel
          their eyes on me. Especially at
          nine. It brought tears to my eyes.

Gabe's stone face melts at this.

               of losing him-- You know? I just
               feel so bad. How awful am I to do
               that to him? To anyone I love?

     Gabe gets it. This is an explanation. An apology, to him. His
     arm is on her shoulder now.

<b>                         GABE
</b>               I'm sure he forgives you.

<b>                           SAM
</b>               Think so?

     Gabe nods. Sam's normal defenses come back up lest she cries.

<b>                         SAM (CONT'D)
</b>               So anyway. I didn't mean to say all
               of that. I don't know why I did.

</b>               Think they'll let you in?

     Gabe smiles. They walk a bit. Then he grabs her hand. Sam
     lets the moment happen. Squeezes his back. They look into
     each others' eyes.

     Don't even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by.
