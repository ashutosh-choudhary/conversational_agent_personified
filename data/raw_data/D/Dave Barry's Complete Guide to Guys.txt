<b>                         FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          EXT. MIAMI - OCEAN AVE, SOUTH BEACH - DAY
</b>
          Blazing sun. MUSIC everywhere. Everybody's living la vida.

<b>          LEOPOLD (V.0.)
</b>          And we're good to go.
          TWO MEN come out of the BEACON HOTEL. Loud Hawaiian shirts,
          walking a Chihuahua. They pause; take in the scene on Ocean.
          Adjust their EARPIECES.

<b>          LEOPOLD (V.0.)
</b>          Proceed to first checkpoint and hold.
          They thread their way to the corner... across the street.. .onto
          the Promenade. Under fat shady palm trees, to a CLEARING --

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. THE ROOF OF THE BEACON HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          AGENT STEARNS has a RIFLE with a kick-ass scope. AGENT LEOPOLD
          watches through binoculars; talks through a collar mike.

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>          Okay sit tight. Company's coming.
          THROUGH BINOCULARS NOW, as TWO DEADLY MEN approach like
          barracudas. A THIRD GUY, BEHIND THEM, the KINGPIN they're
          protecting. Then as TREETOPS BLOCK THE VIEW --

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>          Shit. Hang on.
          Leopold scans, looking for them. Searching, until he FINDS --

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>
<b>                         WHOA --
</b>          The Hawaiian Shirt Guys hear that. The SEE the Barracudas,
          getting nearer; steal a look at the roof...

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          POV FROM ROOFTOP - THROUGH BINOCULARS - A FANTASTIC BLONDE
</b>          rinses off at an outdoor shower. Beads of spray skip off
          her like diamonds in the sunlight.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>
<b>                         STEARNS
</b>          Oh, mama.
          She bends, twists; water streams down every delicious curve.

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>          She sure is taking her time...

<b>                         STEARNS
</b>          She must be really salty...

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>          (shakes his head)
          It's not just the salt. She's got
          sunscreen on. Then the sand gets on
          that, and it sticks...
          (then still watching)
          Hell, one time I was in Hawaii? And
          these three models --

<b>                         STEARNS
</b>          Wait a minute.
          (looks at him)
          Hawaii.

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>          -- Shit!
          He WHIPS THE BINOCULARS back: but all that's left is the
          Chihuahua. Then, walking into the spot --

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Hi, I'm Dave Barry. Has something
          like this ever happened to you?
          (bends down to pet

<b>                         THE CHIHUAHUA)
</b>          Because if you're a guy - or if you
          know someone who is - then what you've
          just seen should look pretty familiar.
          He picks up the Chihuahua, starts walking with it.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Scientists call this condition "Lust
          Induced Brain Freeze." It affects
          millions of guys, every day, in all
          walks of life -- causing anything
          from a mild embarrassment, to an
          international incident.
          He stops. Finds LEOPOLD and STEARNS and SEVERAL OTHER AGENTS
          pointing GUNS at him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.

<b>                         LEOPOLD
</b>          Hand over the dog.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Hey. I didn't even know it was a
          dog.
          They take it from him; rush it away. Dave turns to CAMERA.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Notice I didn't say it's a condition
          that affects men every day -- only
          guys. And that subtle but important
          difference is one of the things this
          movie is about.

</b>
          A HUSBAND and his WIFE. He has suitcases by the front door.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          You'll never get away with this.
          I'll sue you down to your last penny.

<b>                         HUSBAND
</b>          Good luck - I transferred everything
          we own into private accounts, where
          you can't touch it. In fact, as of
          now, you're broke.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          But...why?

<b>                         HUSBAND
</b>          I've fallen in love with another
          woman. A younger woman. Prettier,
          with no cellulite. Actually, I think
          you'd like her.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          You bastard.
          The IMAGE FREEZES. Dave walks into the room.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Now clearly, this woman is dealing
          with a Man.

          doing anything like what you just
          saw. Guys are more like this:

<b>          INT. A BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
          A DIFFERENT HUSBAND sits across from his WIFE. Above and
          behind her is a TV with SportsCenter on.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          I just want you to know, I've thought
          about this a lot.

<b>                         GUY HUSBAND
</b>          Mm.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          And I've talked it over with everyone
          I know.

</b>
<b>                         (NODS)
</b>          Good.
          She looks down; stirs her soda.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          So there's nothing left to do now,
          but leave you, forever, and only see
          you from across a shiny conference
          table with bloodthirsty lawyers all
          around it.

<b>                         GUY HUSBAND

          -- Okay.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          "Okay?" That's all you have to say?
          (then watching him)
          Well then I guess this is it.
          She pushes back from the table, starts off.

<b>                         GUY HUSBAND
</b>          Wait a minute.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          This can't be happening...
          The words she's waited for. She turns, relieved.

          How can you dQ that? How can you
          trade Lupenza?
          (then to the BARTENDER)
          What's the matter with these people?

<b>                         BARTENDER

          o'clock.

<b>                         GUY HUSBAND
</b>          He's the backbone of the whole team!
          They're pikers without Lupenza!

</b>          -- I gotta call Lenny.
          He takes out his cell phone. She levels a look.

<b>                         WIFE
</b>          Maybe you should call your lawyer
          too.

<b>                         LENORE
</b>          Well when I met him, I didn't know
          so much. About guys, or men or what
          have you -- we just didn't talk about
          such things then. In fact, I didn't
          see him naked until quite well into
          our marriage. When was it Albert?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          6.

<b>                         ALBERT
</b>          A year ago. By accident.

<b>                         LENORE
</b>          Anyway. I thought I was marrying a
          man, but didn't know that in his
          heart, he was a guy.

<b>          DAVE (O.S.)
</b>          When did you first suspect?

<b>                         LENORE
</b>          Not long after the wedding. But it
          didn't bother me. I just didn't
          know how to recognize the signs.
          But we've learned to live with it.
          Haven't we, Albert?
          (then after a beat)
          Albert.

<b>                         ALBERT
</b>          It's twelve hundred and thirty-one
          miles from this spot right here, to
          Cleveland.

<b>                         LENORE
</b>          What does that have to do with
          anything?
          He holds up the device - handheld GPS.

<b>                         ALBERT
</b>          Six hundred fifty-one from Atlanta.

<b>                         LENORE
</b>          Who cares how far we are from Atlanta?

<b>                         ALBERT
</b>          You have a cousin there.

<b>                         LENORE
</b>          Albert. There's a person here asking
          us questions. There's a film crew
          here.
          He looks up at the CAMERA, as if just noticing someone there.
          Then holding up the GPS --

<b>                         ALBERT
</b>          You. Where do you live.

<b>          DAVE (O.S.)
</b>          Here in Miami.

</b>          Like a lot of big cities, Miami is
          known for its sizeable population of
          guys. So we came here to take the
          city's pulse on the subject.

          A young, pretty, single SECRETARY.

<b>                         SECRETARY
</b>          Let me put it this way. Everyone I
          ever dated was a male. I mean they
          were all men. But only some of them
          were guys. You know?

<b>          DAVE (O.S.)
</b>          I see.

<b>                         SECRETARY
</b>          (thinks about it)
          -- The guys were funnier. But the
          men were more responsible. You could
          almost half-believe them when they
          told you something sometimes.

<b>          DAVE (O.S.)
</b>          So, if you were to meet someone that
          was funny and responsible...

<b>                         SECRETARY
</b>          That would be a woman.

          your dad.

<b>          DAVE (O.S.)
</b>          In what way?

<b>                         HORSE GROOMER
</b>          Your older brother doesn't have to

<b>                         (CLICKING SLIDES)
</b>          For example, all women have a gene
          that makes them have the need for
          meaningful conversations. Likewise,
          all men have a gene in them that we
          scientists believe is directly related
          to violence.

<b>                         SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
</b>          well, some of my esteemed colleagues
          are quite keen on the idea of
          tampering with the DNA itself - an
          idea with which I heartily disagree.

          a reason to think you might be lookin'
          at him in a public bathroom. For
          reasons that oughtta be pretty darn
          obvious.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Obvious indeed. Now here comes Guy
          Number Two --
          The SECOND GUY comes in; John diagrams the call.

<b>                         JOHN MADDEN
</b>          Now Guy Number Two, what he's gonna
          do is, he's gonna come in, see the
          first guy in position along the wall
          and right away he's gonna line up
          wide on the opposite side. This is
          a best case scenario here, something
          both these guys can appreciate.
          Plus they've opened up the middle
          for the third guy --
          The THIRD GUY comes in. John diagrams his path to the middle
          urinal. The Guy goes there.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          What about eye contact in this
          situation.

<b>                         JOHN MADDEN
</b>          Well you're still not likely to
          encounter any, but again if you do,
          that's what that buffer zone on either
          side of him's for. And all three of
          'em are feelin' pretty lucky to have
          it, I can tell you that.

<b>                         DAVE

          commuter airport, y'know late at

          could possibly even be home free.
          But we're talkin' Miami International

          everybody's gonna be next to somebody,
          which is the last thing any of these
          guys want. You're in a critical
          mass situation, and this is where a
          lotta mistakes get made.

          like a mature adult choice to have a
          guy in your life? In spite of
          everything?

<b>                         SIDRA
</b>          Like trying to borrow money from
          you, after you've broken up, so he
          can buy something for his new
          girlfriend? And wondering what the
          problem was with that? I mean like
          really not knowing?
          Dave looks at her. They all do. Until --

<b>                         LILA
</b>          I'll tell you why. There is no good
          reason, that's why.
          The others turn, look her way.

<b>                         LILA
</b>          -- I mean don't get me wrong. They
          really can be fun. You know, like a
          big stupid dog can be fun. I mean
          not everything has to be so serious
          in life. You want to be able to do
          more with someone than just read
          book reviews together - which is
          something a guy would never do anyway.
          (then as the others

<b>                         LISTEN CLOSER)
</b>          But what a guy will do? Is at eleven
          o'clock at night he'll show up at
          your door and bring cheese steaks.
          And he doesn't care that you look
          all rumply and dreadful from not
          expecting anyone. He might not even
          remember that you're a vegetarian
          and don't eat cheese steaks -- but
          that doesn't really matter either.
          Because the point is he wanted one,
          and he can't come out and say it but
          he didn't want to eat it alone.

<b>                         MIA
</b>          And you're the person he thought of.

<b>                         LILA
</b>          (off her look; nods)
          I can't tell you what that feels
          like, when they do that.
          (a beat; and then)
          I swear, if they knew how adorable
          they are sometimes, they'd be
          dangerous. I mean -- more dangerous.
          The other Girls think about that. Considering...

          The rest of them agree and all high-five her. Dave leans
          back from the fray, turns to the CAMERA.

          A SIGN says "UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT." Dave is on top of the

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Well now you know where things stand.
          You've learned a little bit about
          guys, and the critical roles they've
          played in the past and in modern
          society today. And for better or
          worse, they're here with us to stay --
          so the best thing you can do about
          it, is continue to learn about them -
          by coming to see this movie lots and
          lots of times, and bringing more and
          more of your friends back every time
          you do. Because the more people
          that understand guys, the better for
          everyone. And the more people that --

<b>          A PICTURE OF ROGER AND ELAINE, IN ROGER'S CAR
</b>          SUBTITLE: Roger now owns a 104-piece tool set, and he has
          successfully attempted to change his first switchplate.

<b>          A PICTURE OF ELAINE WITH HER HEAD AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          95.
</b>          SUBTITLE: Elaine has an open line of credit with Steve.

<b>          A PICTURE OF GENE AND KELLY, AT A DANCE CLASS
</b>          SUBTITLE: Gene and Kelly won the Fred and Ginger Award in
          three straight ballroom competitions. Gene was right; they
          belong together.

<b>          A PICTURE OF SHERYL CROW, IN CONCERT
</b>          SUBTITLE: Sheryl Crow gave a concert in Central Park for
          half a million people a while back. We weren't there, but
          we have it on CD.

<b>          A PICTURE OF RICHARD M. NIXON WAVING GOODBYE
</b>           SUBTITLE: Richard M. Nixon was finally elected President in
          1968. He held that position until August, 1974, when he
          resigned in disgrace.

<b>          A PICTURE OF AGENTS LEOPOLD AND STEARNS
</b>          SUBTITLE: Agent Leopold and Agent Stearns were fired by the
          FBI for gross incompetence. They now work in network
          television.

<b>          A PICTURE OF THE BRITISH GUY WHO PLAYED EVERY EXPERT
</b>          SUBTITLE: This man is not really an expert. If you see him,
          don't listen to any of his opinions.

<b>          A PICTURE OF A BALLPLAYER, WITH HIS FACE BLURRED OUT
</b>          SUBTITLE: Rufino Lupenza is an imaginary ballplayer, created
          by the filmmakers to prove a point. However, if he did exist,
          and if he were any good, the Yankees probably would get him.
          And that would suck.

          update thing goin', where you find
          out how all the characters you've
          been watchin' are gonna turn out.
          You got good music, a lively kinda
          feel, and maybe most of all, the
          movie itself isn't too long --
          He reacts now, looking down at the TAIL CREDITS as they start
          speeding up.

</b>          -- that's how you know it's a real
          movie, in my book. That's how you
          know it's not some boring kinda art
          piece made by these tortured head
          case kids fresh outta film school --
          you're not gonna come outta this
          theater talkin' about symbolism, or
          the use of darkness and light or any
          kinda mumbo-jumbo like that -- you
          come out of this movie and you're
          laughin'. And that's what I like in
          a movie - a movie that's funny but
          it doesn't take forever, you know?
          You still got some time to do
          somethin' after, maybe go get
          somethin' to eat, y'know? Because

          not to drag on and on and --
