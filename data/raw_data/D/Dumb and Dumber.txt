<b>EXT. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND - WINTER MORNING
</b>
A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting
for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate.

A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past,
SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at
her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all
about.

Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD
CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a
little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit.

<b>                       LLOYD
</b>           Excuse me, can you tell me how to
           get to the medical school? I'm
           supposed to be giving a lecture in
           twenty minutes and my driver's a bit
           lost.

<b>                       YOUNG WOMAN
</b>               (heavy European accent)
           Go straight aheads and makes a left
           over za bridge.

Lloyd checks out her body.

<b>                       LLOYD
</b>           I couldn't help noticing the accent.
           You from Jersey?

<b>                       YOUNG WOMAN
</b>               (unimpressed)
           Austria.

<b>                       LLOYD
</b>           Austria? You're kidding.
               (mock-Australian accent)
           Well, g'day, mate. What do you say
           we get together later and throw a
           few shrimp on the barbie.

The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away.

<b>                       LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>               (to self)
           Guess I won't be going Down Under
           tonight...

He SIGHS and zips the window back up.

</b><b>                                                            2.

<b>INT. LIMO
</b>
Lloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front
seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives
away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER!

The dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE:

<b>                        DISPATCHER
</b>                (v.o.)
            Carr 22, come in, car 22...

Lloyd grabs his CB mike.

<b>                          LLOYD
</b>            This is 22.

<b>                        DISPATCHER
</b>            22, where the hell are you, Lloyd?
            You're running late on the East Side
            pick-up.

<b>                        LLOYD
</b>            Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my
            way.

<b>                        DISPATCHER
</b>                (v.o.)
            Well hurry it up. And make sure you
            park legally. One more ticket and
            your ass is history.

</b>
<b>EXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY
</b>This building is white with black spots on it, like a
DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a
DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.

The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs
hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout
on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.

HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in
a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY
EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm
of DOGS pile out.

<b>                        HARRY
</b>            Okay, gang, single file. You know
            the rules: No pushing, no humping,
            and no sniffing heinies...
<b>
</b><b>                                                           3.
</b>
The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR.
PALMER, sticks his head out.

<b>                      PALMER
</b>          Hey, why aren't those mutts on
          leashes?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          The same reason you're not on a leash,
          sir because it's demeaning and it
          chafes like hell.

<b>                      PALMER
</b>          Just get them in here now! They all
          have to be bathed and clipped in an
          hour.

Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but
they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from
wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits
them on a wall.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          You kids stay right here...

As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall
isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away,
taking the two dogs with it.

<b>                      HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>              (at truck)
          Hey, wait a minute!

Harry chases after the vehicle.

<b>                                                     CUT TO:
</b><b>EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY
</b>
Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined
driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE
STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the
front oor and RINGS THE BELL.

The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON
appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when
he lays eyes on her.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          Hello.
              (beat)
          I'll be just a minute...
<b>
</b><b>                                                          4.
</b>
As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of
Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind
his ears...

<b>                                                     CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. LIMO - DAY
</b>
Lloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the
window, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on
her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps
glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he
is speechless. Then:

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Why you going to the airport? Flying
          somewhere?

<b>                      MARY
</b>              (dead-pan)
          How'd you guess?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Well, I saw your luggage, then when
          I noticed the airline ticket, I put
          two and two together.
              (beat)
          So where you heading?

<b>                      MARY
</b>          Aspen.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear
          California's beautiful this time of
          year.
Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another
glance.

<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          I'm Mary.

ON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperate
to impress her.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Uh, this isn't my real job, you know.
          It's only temporary.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         5.
</b>
<b>                         MARY
</b>          Oh?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I
          are saving up our money so we can
          open our own pet store.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          That's nice.

<b>                       LLOYD
</b>              (smiling)
          I got worms.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          I beg your pardon?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          That's what we're gonna call it: I
          Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in
          selling worm farms you know, like
          ant farms. A lot of people don't
          realize that worms make much better
          pets than ants. They're quiet,
          affectionate, they don't bite, and
          they're super with the kids.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          Aren't ants quiet, too?

Lloyd realizes she has a point.

<b>                        LLOYD
</b>          Uh... well, sure but they aren't half
          as affectionate. And if you cut an
          ant's head off, it won't grow back.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          I see.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          And best of all, worm farming is a
          seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year
          industry. I wouldn't mind having a
          piece of that pie, if you know what
          I mean.

To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks
at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's
concerned about something.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            6.
</b>
<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          What's the matter? Little tense about
          the flight?

<b>                      MARY
</b>              (beat)
          Something like that.

Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          It's really nothing to worry about,
          Mary. Statistically, they say you're
          more likely to get killed on the way
          to the airport. You know, like in a
          head-on crash, or something.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          Um, Lloyd, could please keep your
          eyes on the road.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Good thinking. There's a lot of bad
          rivers out there.

Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.

<b>                                                     CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
Lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk
and turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she
reaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Here you go.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Keep it. It was my pleasure.

For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. This
makes her more lovely than ever.

<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and
          pass out. You'll be there before you
          know it.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          Thanks Lloyd.
              (beat)
          And good luck with your worms.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            7.
</b>
Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal,
followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her,
ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.

Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo,  LOVESICK. For a
moment he doesn't even have the energy to  turn the key. He
just drops his head against the steering  wheel, DEVASTATED.
There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks  up to see a POLICE
OFFICER standing there.

<b>                      POLICE OFFICER
</b>          Come on, move it, you're in a red
          zone.

Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.

</b>
<b>INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
</b>
Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of
travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are
focused straight ahead.

She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in
an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.

<b>                       ARMANI SUIT
</b>          She's gonna leave the briefcase at
          the foot of the escalator. You make
          the pick-up.

<b>                      PLAID SPORTCOAT
</b>          Piece of cake.

<b>EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
</b>As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport
window and SEES MARY

<b>WALKING ALONG.
</b>
When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.
She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for
her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He
turns to see a car irectly behind him.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>              (to car's driver)
          Drive around me, you pinhead!

When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees
that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF
THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           8.
</b>
He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He
starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police
Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and
dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.

<b>INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL
</b>
The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to
approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching
for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP
THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at
each other, dumbstruck.

<b>INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE
</b>
Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post
the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion
of numbers.

<b>                        LLOYD
</b>          Damn!

QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he
watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away.

<b>EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
</b>
Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who
FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk
when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

HIS POV - his limo is being towed away    under the supervision
of the Police Officer.

He takes off after it, but to no avail.
<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          You can't do this! I'll lose my job!

As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his
fingers through his hair.

</b>
<b>EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON
</b>
We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A
dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up
and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's
briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building.
They disappear inside without acknowledging each other.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            9.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up
and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat.
They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE

<b>MENTAL).
</b>
<b>                        MENTAL
</b>           Who the hell do you figure this guy's
           working for?

</b>           I don't know, but we'd better find
           out...

Mental takes some PILLS and starts CHOMPING them.

<b>                         SHAY (CONT'D)
</b>           Your ulcer?

<b>                       MENTAL

<b>INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR
</b>
Lloyd and Harry trudge up the stairs and proceed silently
toward the door of their apartment.

<b>INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
</b>
Lloyd and Harry ENTER and   pass each other quietly as they
both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs. (Lloyd still
has the briefcase in his   lap.) Harry's caged parakeet, PETEY,
tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there SILENTLY.

The place is a mess. Wallpaper's peeling off the walls. The
carpet is threadbare and filthy. In the corner we see a
miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt
and worms. Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture
with stuffing spilling out of the gashes.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>           I got fired again.

Lloyd shakes his head.

<b>                       LLOYD
</b>           I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but
           let's face it, you are one pathetic
           loser. No offense.

<b>                       HARRY

              (beat)
          I quit.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Why'd you quit?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire
          me.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Why didn't you wait and see if your
          suspicions were well-founded?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Winners control their own destiny,
          Har.

Lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one
to him.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          You know, the thing that really chaps
          my ass is that I just spent my life
          savings turning my van into a poodle.
              (beat)
          The alarm alone cost me two hundred.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Big deal. That car's an old bomb
          anyway.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          What are you talking about? It's
          only six years old.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          That's forty-two in dog years.

They open their beers and drink simultaneously. Then Harry
notices the briefcase.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          What's with the briefcase?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          It's a love memento.

</b>            The most beautiful woman alive. Her
            name was Mary. I drove her to the

Lloyd comes out of the store with his arms full of groceries.
He stops at a newspaper machine, pulls out his WALLET and
removes a quarter.

He drops the quarter in the machine, opens it, and realizes
that he DOESN'T HAVE A FREE HAND to pick up the newspaper.
He puts his wallet inside the machine, picks up the newspaper,
and as he does so THE MACHINE SLAMS SHUT WITH HIS WALLET
<b>STILL INSIDE.

Lloyd SIGHS, puts his grocery bags on the machine, and checks
his pockets. NO MORE CHANGE. Just then, an ELDERLY WOMAN
struggles by using a WALKER.

Lloyd runs back into the store. We HOLD ON THE STORE DOOR as
Lloyd EXITS a few seconds later with a handful of quarters.

          down on a Dear Abby column, with a

              (dawning realization)
          Wait a second, I know what you're up

          saving money for the worm store. I'm
          getting a little sick and tired of

cityscape.

There's a deadly SILENCE as they both think about this. Then
Harry tries to lighten the mood. He opens his arms wide.

<b>                      LLOYD

          try our luck in bankruptcy court.
          With all those lawsuits against us,
          I'm sure we'll win at least one. It

Harry's behind the wheel and Lloyd's in the passenger seat.
The Animal's "We've Got to Get Out of This Place" is BLASTING
on the radio and the guys are SINGING ALONG:

curious.

on. Lloyd opens a bag of Doritos and fiddles with the radio.

At the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a

Lloyd and Harry are sitting at a booth, surrounded by tables

the boys and starts to walk away.

Before Harry knows it he's holding the full BOTTLE OF URINE.

</b>
As the Mutt Cutts van travels down the highway, it passes a
STATE TROOPER on a motorcycle hidden in the bushes. The
Trooper takes off after them.

Harry is doing his best to steer while now holding FIVE FULL
BOTTLES AND Lloyd is still going at it in the passenger seat.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          What are you, a goddamn camel?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Hey, I haven't gone all day.

Just then they hear a LOUDSPEAKER:

<b>                       STATE TROOPER
</b>              (o.s.)
          Pull over!

They turn to see the POLICE MOTORCYCLE cruising right beside
then. Harry rolls down his window and CALLS OUT:

<b>                       HARRY
</b>          Huh?

</b><b>                                                        31.

Harry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at
the Trooper.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>              (calling out)
          No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for
          noticing!

He rolls his window back up and turns to an equally baffled
Lloyd.

He points to the OPEN, FULL BEER BOTTLES hidden in the seat
between them.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>           Oh, that's nothing, sir.

</b>           But, your honor, he's telling the

The officer smirks.

<b>                       STATE TROOPER
</b>           Is that right?

The Trooper reaches in and picks up one of the bottles. He
inspects the beer label, then MOVES

<b>THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS.
</b>
<b>                       HARRY

Harry shoots Lloyd a look as the Trooper begins GULPING down
the piss. He pauses uncertainly and a SICK LOOK COMES OVER
HIS FACE. He takes a DEEP BREATH. Then:

Lloyd is driving now while Harry sleeps in the passenger

play as Lloyd FANTASIZES about his future in Aspen.

<b>LLOYD'S FANTASY:
</b>
Lloyd is walking up the steps of a luxurious, snow-covered
chalet, carrying Mary's briefcase. The sky is absurdly blue
and children are making a snowman on the lawn. It's all out
of a dream world. He KNOCKS on the door, tentatively. Mary
opens it. She looks at him, then at the briefcase, and breaks
into the BIGGEST, SWEETEST SMILE he's ever seen. Then she
slowly backs into the house, gesturing for him to follow...

Lloyd follows Mary down a hallway. As he trails after her,
she pulls off her shirt, revealing her bare back, and glances
over her shoulder at him.

CAMERA MOVES around a corner and now we're in a STEAMY
BATHROOM. The shower is running and we see the silhouette of
two people behind the curtain.

CLOSE ON LLOYD - we see he's taking the TEGRIN CHALLENGE,
with different shampoos on either side of his head and a
noticeable part down the middle.

<b>                          MARY

            Lloyd, will you wash my nipples...?

ON MARY - her   hair is slicked back, making her look better
than ever. As   the CAMERA PANS DOWN toward her breasts, we
are surprised   to see not breasts but a SET OF HEADLIGHTS
SUPERIMPOSED   OVER HER CHEST AREA. The headlights FLASH ONCE.
Then TWICE.

ON LLOYD - he blinks, confused at what's happening.

JUMP CUT   TO - an eighteen-wheeler is ROARING RIGHT TOWARD
THE MUTT   CUTTS VAN on the highway. Lloyd quickly veers back
into his   lane and avoids tragedy by a whisker. A shaken Lloyd
lets out   a SIGH OF RELIEF, and we

Lloyd and Harry are sitting in a large, HEART-SHAPED JACUZZI.
Lloyd is sipping a beer and Harry is absorbed in the Enquirer
as the water swirls around them.

<b>                          LLOYD
</b>            Yep, this sure is the life. Cold
            beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink

            thing that could make this moment
            any better.

</b>          What's that?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          That's two things, Lloyd.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Right now I'd settle for one.

Lloyd takes a swig of beer. Harry puts down the paper and
looks around at the romantic decor.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          I don't know, Lloyd, these places
          just don't do it for me. Brings back
          too many memories.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Felcher? You mean the babe who worked
          for the tractor company?

Harry nods.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          The same. We had this incredibly
          romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd
          be together forever.

</b>          Then about a week later, right out
          of the blue, she sends me a John

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          I called her up and she gave me some
          crap about me not listening to her
          enough or something like that. I

Harry reaches for a beer and busts it open. He takes a big
gulp.

<b>                      HARRY (CONT'D)

We see that the black Cadillac is   parked a few cars over
from the Mutt Cutts van with J.P.   Shay in the passenger seat.
PAN OVER to a payphone. Inside is   Joe Mental. Outside the
booth, an ANXIOUS MAN impatiently   paces back and forth as he
waits for the phone.

<b>                      MENTAL
</b>              (into phone)
          The boys are holed-up in a little
          love nest for the night. I think
          they're a couple of fucking weirdos.

<b>INT. NICHOLAS ANDRE'S STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
NICHOLAS ANDRE is pacing around the room with a cordless
phone. He's in his late 30s, wears a ponytail, and dresses
in Aspen/Rodeo Drive chic.

<b>                      ANDRE
</b>          What in hell are those guys up to?

The ANXIOUS MAN taps on the phone booth and motions for Mental
to hang up.

<b>                      ANDRE
</b>          I don't like this one goddamn bit,
          Mental. You and Shay were supposed
          to grab that bag so we could end
          this shit. Now I don't know what the
          hell's going on.

Andre SIGHS and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip.
The Anxious Man KNOCKS on the booth again.

<b>                      MENTAL
</b>          Hold on a second, Mr. Andre...

Mental puts the phone down and motions the    Anxious Man closer
to the booth. The Man moves forward a few    inches. Mental
motions him even closer. When he's about a    foot away, Mental
punches his hand through the glass of the    booth and knocks
the Anxious Man out cold. Then

Mental picks up the phone again.

<b>                      MENTAL (CONT'D)
</b>          Sorry, boss. You were saying...?

<b>                      ANDRE
</b>          Look, Mental, just find out what

          these guys are.

<b>                      MENTAL
</b>          Don't worry. I'm on it.

Mental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's
not being watched, then approaches the parked Mutt Cutt van.
He's joined by J.P. Shay.

As they get within five feet of the vehicle, we hear a LOW
GROWL. They stop in their tracks and turn, expecting to see
a dog but there isn't one. They both take another step
forward, and the GROWL GETS LOUDER AND MEANER. Again, Mental
and Shay stop. He peeks under the car. Nothing.

<b>                      SHAY
</b>          What the fuck...?

Finally, Shay reaches for the door handle. As soon as he
touches it, though, the car alarm goes off but instead of a
siren, it's the incredibly annoying sound of a POODLE YAPPING.
Mental jumps back and pulls his gun.

<b>                      MENTAL
</b>          Where's the goddamn dog?

Shay shrugs, nervous. The YAPPING grows EVEN LOUDER now,
forcing a flustered Shay and Mental to retreat from the scene.

Just then the living room door opens and the pony tailed
Nicholas Andre ENTERS. He looks appropriately solemn.

<b>                      ANDRE
</b>          Has there been any word, Mr. Swanson?

Andre looks upset.

Lloyd rolls his eyes.

Lloyd looks at Harry. Harry remembers that he's driving. He
pulls the car to the side of the road. Mental approaches the

</b>          Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet:
          Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables?

Mental grits his teeth as he pops a few antacid pills in his
mouth. He reaches into his coat pocket and we see a GLINT OF
STEEL. Just when he's about to pull the gun out, though,
Lloyd hits the breaks and SKIDS to a stop beside a bunch of
hitchhiking MIGRANT WORKERS.

Harry lifts a cheer and lets out a LOUD FART. Lloyd SNIFFS a

nostrils, as if it was the aroma of a fine wine.

glasses of water from a pitcher.

some pills out and hands them to        Mental, who tosses them in

The Mutt Cutts van cruises down the lonely interstate.

<b>INT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT
</b>
Lloyd is now FAST ASLEEP in the passenger seat as Harry drives
on. A roadsign reading DENVER - 602 MILES whizzes by. Todd
Rundgren's "Too Far Gone" begins to play while Harry peers
at the empty highway INTROSPECTIVELY. As the song plays we
see a series of quick shots:

A new sign says DENVER - 421 MILES. Lloyd is still asleep
with his feet now on Harry's lap.

Another sign reads DENVER - 201 MILES. Harry stares straight
ahead, practically catatonic. Lloyd's feet are out the window
and his head is on Harry's lap.

The next roadsign says DENVER - 157 MILES. Lloyd's feet are
now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet
should be. Harry looks on the verge of blacking out.

Finally, a sign reads COLORADO STATE LINE - 25 MILES/FOOD,
<b>GAS NEXT EXIT.
</b>
<b>EXT. TRUCK STOP - 2:10 IN THE MORNING
</b>
The Mutt Cutts van pulls up to a gas pump. In the background
are several tractor-trailer rigs and a café. Harry climbs
out, thoroughly exhausted, walks around and opens the
passenger door.

Lloyd tumbles to the asphalt, STILL ASLEEP. Harry nudges him
with his foot.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump.

Lloyd comes to and grudgingly pulls himself up to his feet.

<b>EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Harry moves to the back of the poodle van. He has to LIFT
ONE OF THE CAR'S REAR LEGS to unscrew the gas cap. Then he
sticks the nozzle in and starts to fill her up.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          55.

<b>EXT. GAS STATION MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Lloyd comes around the   corner, dragging a BATHROOM KEY
ATTACHED BY A CHAIN TO   A CAR ENGINE toward the Men's Room.
When he gets it to the   door, he struggles to lift the engine
on it's side, finally   managing to slip the key into the lock.

<b>EXT. MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT
</b>
Harry is yawning as he pumps the gas. Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee
pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs
out. This seems to wake Harry up.

The Athletic Beauty   smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and
starts to fill her   jeep. Harry makes a feeble attempt to
brush his hair into   place, then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods
to the skis on her   roof-rack.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>          Skis, huh?

<b>                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
</b>          That's right.

She continues to pump gas.

Harry turns to see the gas GUSHING ALL OVER HIS SHOES. He
immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump
as she smiles to herself.

Lloyd is standing in a stall urinating. He starts to read
the graffiti scrawled on the wall. Finally, he comes to one
that says: FOR A GOOD TIME, MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8, 1993,
<b>2:15
</b>
<b>A.M. SHARP.
</b>
He frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch.

CLOSE UP OF DIAL - the date reads NOVEMBER 8.

ZOOM IN on the minute hand as it CLICKS TO EXACTLY 2:15.

Just as a concerned look crosses Lloyd's face, we hear the
BATHROOM DOOR SQUEAK OPEN AND SLAM SHUT! Terrified, Lloyd
quickly locks the stall door, then crouches on the toilet
bowl so his feet aren't visible. The sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS
approaches the stall and then stops. Lloyd looks down to see
a pair of SIZE 16 WORKBOOTS beneath the door. We can barely
hear a LOW GROWL. Then the stall handle JIGGLES. Lloyd holds
his breath. The ominous boots MOVE AWAY and Lloyd lets out a
<b>SIGH OF RELIEF.
</b>
All of a sudden the DOOR IS KICKED IN, AND A TOWERING FIGURE
STEPS INTO FRAME. Lloyd looks up and GASPS.

HIS POV - it's the Redneck trucker, Sea Bass.

The Athletic Beauty is back in her Jeep now and Harry has
sidled up to the driver's side. He leans against her side-
view mirror.

          got to get away from my boyfriend.

He's such a klutz. My astrologer told me I should avoid
accident-prone guys.

Just then, the side-view mirror Harry has been leaning on
<b>SNAPS OFF THE CAR. HE CRACKS

She throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a
cigarette.

<b>                        HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Allow me...

He pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish.
The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks. Harry tosses the match
to the ground, and we hear an O.S. WHOOSH! Wisps of smokes
rise around him and we hear the LOW CRACKLE OF SOMETHING
BURNING. (Neither of them notice this.)

<b>                      HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Look, um, maybe when I get to Aspen
          we can meet up... you know, for hot
          chocolate or something.

She looks him over and smiles.

<b>                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
</b>          Why not? You seem pretty harmless.
          I'll give you my number. Just let me
          find a pen.

As she starts to rummage through her purse, Harry SMELLS THE
SMOKE. He looks down and sees that his RIGHT SHOE IS ABLAZE!
He shakes it, then tries to put it out with the other shoe,
but to no avail. Meanwhile, the Athletic Beauty is still
searching for a pen.

Harry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames.
This only helps to fan them.

He begins hopping around violently.

<b>                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from
screaming.

Sea Bass pushes Lloyd to his knees. Then the trucker steps
back and UNDOES HIS FLY. The sound of the zipper brings a
green color to Lloyd's face.

ON THE MEN'S ROOM DOOR - it bursts open and a FLAME-FOOTED
Harry rushes into the bathroom, panic-stricken. In his
desperation he PLOWS THROUGH THE STALL DOOR KNOCKING SEA
BASS ON THE HEAD and thrusts his flaming foot into the
toilet,

Harry breathes a DEEP SIGH of relief. Only then does he notice

Lloyd starts the engine and    pulls out of the parking lot to
the nearby freeway entrance.    As he enters the on-ramp, we
ZOOM IN on a sign that says:    ROUTE 80 - EAST. He's unwittingly
headed BACK IN THE DIRECTION    THEY JUST CAME FROM!

It's bright daylight now. Harry is sleeping peacefully in
the passenger seat while Lloyd sips a coffee. The van hits a
bump which causes Harry's eyes to flutter open.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back.

<b>                       HARRY

          How long have I been out?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          I'd say a good five hours, anyway.

Harry yawns and stretches.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Great. We must be getting real close,
          huh?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Should be. I've been averaging about
          ninety miles an hour all night.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>          Good man.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Boy, I'll tell you, this is one
          angerous highway. You wouldn't believe
          all the road pizza two dead ogs, a
          couple of rabbits, a snake and some
          big thing I couldn't even recognize.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          That's awful. Did you see them get
          hit or were they already lying there?

<b>                       LLOYD
</b>          I hit 'em.

Harry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing FLATLANDS.

<b>                      HARRY

          to be a little rockier than this.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          I was thinking the same thing. That
          John Denver's some full of shit,
          huh?

They both stare out the window.

<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          I must say, Des Moines sure is a
          pretty little town.

<b>                      HARRY

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          What are you talking about? You were
          snoring like a baby when we went
          through Des Moines.

Lloyd shakes his head in amusement, then SNAPS HIS FINGERS
in Harry's face.

</b>          You were the one who was asleep,

numbskull. Here, take a sip of coffee. You're delirious.

A confused Harry sips the coffee and checks out the passing
terrain. Then something starts to awn on him. Slowly.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't
          the sun rise in the east and set in

          why the sun is in our face at 7:30
          in the morning when we're heading

Lloyd thinks about this and then looks SICKENED.

</b>          I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can

But Harry just sits there, practically catatonic.

          goodbye to your ugly mug forever.

          You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo.

</b>          Oh yeah? Why not?
<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          You don't have a passport.

Harry lets out a defeated SIGH.

<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on, stop being a baby about
          this. Okay, so we back-tracked a

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a
          sixth of the way across the country
          in the wrong direction. Now we don't
          have enough money to get to Aspen,

          about it. If we're gonna get out of

Harry thinks about this.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          You know, you're absolutely right,
          Lloyd.

He stands up, brushes off his pants, and starts to walk toward
the highway.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Where you going?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Home. I'm walking home.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          You can't be serious.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>              (sarcastic)
          Why not? We're probably only five
          miles away.

Harry starts resolutely toward the road while Lloyd watches.

</b><b>              (CALLING OUT)
</b>          Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you
          never screwed up.
Harry suddenly STOPS IN HIS TRACKS and turns back to his
friend. He seems completely rained.

<b>                        HARRY
</b>          Look, man... I'm sorry.
              (beat)
          I never should have let you talk me
          into this in the first place. You've
          got a good reason to goo a beautiful
          girl's waiting for you. But let's
          face it, Lloyd, there's nothing
          waiting for me in Aspen.

Lloyd just stands there, SPEECHLESS, as Harry turns and walks
away. Out of frustration, he BANGS the snout of the car,
causing it to BARK.

Harry is walking down the highway, his thumb stuck out
unenthusiastically. A few cars WHIZ by, the cold wind whipping
at his clothes.

A station wagon blows by and throws a BAG  OF GARBAGE out the
window. It lands at Harry's feet. EXTREME  CLOSE-UP OF HARRY'S
FACE - a TEAR slowly rolls down his cheek  (like the Indian
in the commercial). PAN DOWN to the bag of  garbage. We see
it's a BAG OF ONIONS that's ripped open.

Suddenly a HEARSE pulls up and stops. It's an ominous-looking
vehicle and Harry hesitates. Then the passenger window rolls
down, revealing a contrite Lloyd at the wheel.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Well let me put it this way, Lloyd:
          Do you remember when we were Cub
          Scouts and we got lost in the woods
          uring that blizzard? We huddled
          together all night, and we made an
          oath that if we ever got out of there
          alive we'd never ever leave each
          other's side again. Do you remember
          that?

Lloyd thinks hard about this.

Just then several COP CARS whiz by them in the opposite
direction with SIRENS BLARING and LIGHTS FLASHING. When Harry
glances back at the cop cars, he notices that there's a COFFIN
in the rear of the vehicle.

          front teeth.
Lloyd picks a small speck out of his mouth and studies it.

<b>                        LLOYD
</b>          Hmmm... looks like an old piece of
          Beef Jerky.

<b>HARRY STARES AT IT. THEN:
</b>
<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Wanna split it?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          You're pathetic. Get your own.

Loyd puts the floss-meat back in his mouth and chews it.
Another gust of wind swirls around them.

</b>          Roll up your window.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          It is rolled up.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Then I guess the damn anti-cold system
          isn't working. You really should get
          it fixed if we're gonna live here
          all winter.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          What anti-cold system?

Lloyd points to the dash.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Right here the A/C button. I put it
          on full blast about an hour ago and,
          if anything, the car's getting colder.

Harry stares at Lloyd and then throws down his cup, disgusted.
He opens the car door and starts to climb out.

<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          What are you going out there for?

<b>                        HARRY
</b>          To warm up.

<b>EXT. HEARSE - NIGHT
</b>Harry gets out and leans against the car with his arms
crossed. Lloyd comes from around the other side.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          What are you worrying about now?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          I'm worried about how you're gonna
          survive the pummeling I'm about to
          give you.

<b>                        LLOYD
</b>          Huh?

Suddenly Harry LUNGES at Lloyd, who takes off around the
other side of the car. Harry leaps across the hood, but Lloyd
manages to evade his grasp.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           72.

<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)

<b>                      HARRY

</b>          Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine.
          I'm a Christian Scientist!

Lloyd continues to outrun him around the car. Frustrated,
Harry opens the car and PULLS THE

<b>BRIEFCASE OUT.
</b>
<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          What are you doing?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Something I should've done a long
          time ago. This stupid thing has been
          the root of our problems all along.

Harry starts walking toward the bridge spanning a river.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Don't do anything foolish, Harry.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Foolish? This is the most sensible
          thing I've done in years. I'm gonna
          toss this goddamn curse right into
          that river.
Lloyd starts to follow after Harry.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          You're making a big mistake, Harry!
          I'll never forgive you for this!

Harry keeps marching toward the bridge, determined to dispose
of the briefcase.

<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          Harry, hold up! Things are gonna get
          better, I promise! In fact, I think

I feel another piece of Beef Jerky in my left molar! It's
yours, Harry, all yours!

Harry stops in his tracks, intrigued.

</b><b>                                                           73.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          You're bluffing.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          No I'm not, man look.

Lloyd pulls his cheek back, revealing a molar. Harry squints
at it.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          That's a filling, you liar!

Just then, Lloyd makes a dash at Harry. Harry turns and runs,
but Lloyd TACKLES HIM as they reach the bridge. The briefcase
GOES FLYING, and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another
in the snow, rolling over and over.

Finally, Harry manages to get the upper hand. He climbs on
top and CLASPS HIS HANDS

<b>AROUND LLOYD'S THROAT.
</b>
<b>                      HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          I used to have a life! A miserable
          one, but a life, nonetheless!

Suddenly Lloyd's EYES LIGHT UP as he sees something O.S.
behind his friend.

<b>                       LLOYD
</b><b>              (CHOKED VOICE)

Harry turns and HIS EYES LIGHT UP, TOO. He lets go of Lloyd

Harry and Lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching

<b>                       LLOYD
</b>          Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a

A tuxedoed Bell Captain, BARNARD, is showing the guys around
an ENORMOUS AND LUXURIOUS SUITE. The place is big enough to
throw a touchdown bomb in.

<b>                        BARNARD
</b>          ...This is the Hotel Danbury's

          normally reserved for royalty,

          stars of stage and take it.

The Bell Captain is a bit taken aback, but pleased.

<b>                      BARNARD (CONT'D)
</b>          Very good, sir. Are there any bags

Barnard SIGHS.

<b>                        BARNARD
</b>            Sir, I meant your luggage.

Harry forces a. embarrassed half-smile.

</b>            Tell you what you can send up, my
            friend how about some chow?

The Bell Captain nods.

</b>            I'll bring you a menu.

<b>                        LLOYD
</b>            Don't bother. Just order us one of
            everything.

At this, Harry serves Lloyd a reproachful look.

<b>                        HARRY
</b>            One of everything? Lloyd...

Lloyd looks guilty.

<b>                        LLOYD
</b>            Oh, sorry.
                (beat)
            Make that two of everything.
Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of HUNDRED DOLLAR
BILLS out of his pocket. He rips one off and tucks it in
Barnard's top pocket.

<b>                        LLOYD (CONT'D)

The Bell Captain, Barnard, is energized by this tip.

<b>                         BARNARD
</b>            Yes, sir!

He bows and leaves the room. Then Lloyd cracks open the

Mary smiles.

<b>                          MARY

Helen pulls out a joint and torches it up. She takes a hit.

thumbing through the newspaper.

          Harry, it's her.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Mary with the briefcase. This is
          her...

He shoves the newspaper at Harry.

CLOSE ON THE HEADLINE - it reads: SWANSONS TO HOST
PRESERVATION GALA TONIGHT; CITY'S ELITE EXPECTED. Underneath
this is a photograph of Mary with her parents.

-The boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed.

-Harry and Lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. The
ATTENDANTS lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both
guys' hair in curlers.

-Lloyd's getting shaved by an ATTENDANT with a straight-razor.
Suddenly Lloyd grabs his neck

as if he's been nicked. BLOOD SQUIRTS OUT from between his
fingers. The other CUSTOMERS stare in horror at this. Lloyd
LAUGHS and shows everyone a SQUEEZE KETCHUP BOTTLE hidden in
his hand. Only Harry and Lloyd seem to find this joke amusing.

-We see them getting their nose hairs clipped. PAN DOWN to
the floor to reveal a PILE OF

<b>NOSE HAIR CLIPPINGS.
</b>
-Then a   shot of a MAN next to them getting a pedicure. PAN
OVER to   Lloyd's bare feet  he has toe nails like Howard
Hughes.   Sparks are flying as an ATTENDANT wearing safety
goggles   tries to sand down Lloyd's toenails with an electric
sander.

-Harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a
massage from a beautiful ORIENTAL MASSEUSE. He pulls a hundred
dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and
WHISPERS in her ear. She smiles.

-Next we see the Oriental Masseuse lying on her stomach with
her shirt off, while Harry happily massages her back.

-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery. Harry comes out
of the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO. He
couldn't look any more suave. The SALEMAN nods, impressed,
but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in.

-Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO. The Salesman
looks on hopefully, but Lloyd again disapproves.

-This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE
TUXEDO, complete with TACKY FRILLS. The Salesman looks
sickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up.

PAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensive
J.P. Shay is sitting in a parked car, WATCHING HARRY AND
<b>LLOYD.

<b>EXT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY - NIGHT
</b>
Throngs of GUESTS in black-tie and elegant gowns are entering
the building. Suddenly the hearse pulls up with Harry and
Lloyd BUMPER SURFING BEHIND IT. Harry's wearing his blue
tuxedo. Lloyd's tux isn't any better it's pumpkin orange.
(THEY'VE GOT MATCHING TOP HATS AND CANES.) When the hearse
stops, the boys hand the driver Barnard a couple hundred
dollars.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Thanks for the lift, Barney.

<b>INT. ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY
</b>
Nicholas Andre is greeting people at the door. However, when
Harry and Lloyd try to enter, he stops them and gives them
the once over.

<b>                      ANDRE
</b>          Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a
          five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.

Harry and Lloyd look at each other and shrug. Then Lloyd
takes out a WAD OF BILLS and peels

off TEN HUNDREDS, much to the amazement of Andre.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          This should cover a couple plates.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if
          we want seconds?

Lloyd thinks about this. Then he peels off another thou.
<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Put us down for four plates, my good
          man.

They ENTER the party. As Andre watches them go, his associate
J.P. Shay comes up beside him, an alarmed look on his face.

<b>                      J.P. SHAY

</b>          Jesus Christ, boss... it's them.

BACK ON HARRY AND LLOYD - the guys make their way through
the affluent crowd.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          I'm getting nervous, Harry.
<b>
</b><b>                                                        83.
</b>
<b>                      HARRY
</b>          relax, Lloyd. These people are just
          like you and me.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          What are you talking about? They're
          educated, well-bred, charming, and
          sophisticated.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          So what? We can be sophistica holy
          shit, would you look at the fun bags
          on that hose hound.

He points out a busty BLONDE BOMBSHELL entering the party.
Lloyd rolls his eyes.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm
          already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't
          like me?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Look, let's just go saddle up to the
          bar and down a couple bowls of
          loudmouth soup. A little booze'll
          bring back that old Lloyd Christmas
          over-confidence.

The guys stand out at the glittering social scene as they
make their way to the bar.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>              (to BARTENDER)
          Two martinis, straight up.
As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party, a BEAUTIFUL
RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin, then
walks away.

<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          Shut up, Harry.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          I didn't say anything.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Yeah, well I know what you were gonna
          say and I'm telling you to shut up
          in advance.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          How do you know what I was gonna
          say?
<b>
</b><b>                                                        84.
</b>
<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          I read you like a book.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Okay, if you read me like a book
          then what was I gonna say?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          You were gonna say:
              (in Harry's looped
<b>               VOICE)
</b>          'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't
          mind roasting my weenie in.'

Harry raises his eyebrows, IMPRESSED.

<b>                       LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          And I would say 'shut up', because
          this is our chance to get in with
          the rich and powerful and you don't
          ingratiate yourself to the kind of
          people by acting like Ron Jeremy on
          Spanish Fly.

The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the o.s.
CLINKING of a glass. The guys turns to

see Nicholas Andre standing at a podium. Next to him is a
LARGE, COVERED DISPLAY. On his other side are Karl and
Elizabeth Swanson.

<b>                      ANDRE
</b>          If I could have your attention,
          please...

The crowd QUIETS.
<b>                      ANDRE (CONT'D)
</b>          I'd like to thank you all for coming
          to this very special event. As you

<b>KNOW, THE ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY -
</b>
founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors, Karl
and Helen Swanson - is the world's foremost efender of
endangered species. Our

<b>SPRAWLING GROUNDS ARE HOME TO TWENTY-
</b>
three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed
on the United Nation's charter of protected species. Tonight,
we are deeply honored to have Mr. Karl Swanson welcome our
twenty-fourth.

The crowd CLAPS as Mr. Swanson takes Andre's place at the
podium.

<b>                      MR. SWANSON
</b>          Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the
          Icelandic Snow Owl.

He pulls the cover off, revealing TWO MAJESTIC, FLUFFY WHITE
OWLS IN A CAGE. Everyone OOHS and AHHS.

<b>                      MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)
</b>          These magnificent specimens were

<b>RESCUED RECENTLY, CULMINATING A FIVE-
</b>
year, two-million-dollar effort on our part. Together, they
constitute one-seventh of the snow owl population left on
the planet.

ON ANDRE - he's nervously eyeing Harry and Lloyd. He looks
pale.

<b>                      MR. SWANSON
</b>          Here these lovely birds will be
          allowed to breed in a natural but
          protected habitat. And, God willing,
          with your help and that of the
          Society's, we will see these wonderful
          creatures flourish once more.

More APPLAUSE.

<b>                      MR. SWANSON (CONT'D)
</b>          Again, thank you, and enjoy your
          evening. Oh, and feel free to take a
          closer look at our new friends here.
          Enjoy.

The crowd APPLAUDS and begins to mingle again. Lloyd turns
back to the Bartender and holds up his empty glass.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Two more, please.

Harry stares at Lloyd with concern.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Lloyd, I've never seen you this
          uptight. You've gotta chill out.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          I can't help it. This is a very
          important night for me.

</b>
<b>                       LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>              (beat)
          Harry, have you ever wondered why
          you and I never have long-term
          girlfriends?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          What are you talking about? I went
          out with Fraida Felcher for two and
          a half weeks.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          That was a fluke.
              (beat)
          The reason we never have long-term
          girlfriends is because of one thing:
          We're afraid of the C word.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          That's crazy. We live for the C word.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          I'm talking bout commitment.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>                (beat)
          Oh.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry.
          The first time I laid eyes on Mary
          Swanson, I knew she was the one.
              (beat)
          Some things you feel in your heart,
          other things you feel in your groin.
          This girl makes me feel it all in
          the heart.

Suddenly Lloyd notices something across the room.

<b>HIS POV - A BEGUILING MARY SWANSON IS TALKING WITH A COUPLE
</b><b>OF GUESTS. SHE'S WEARING A
</b>
spectacular black cocktail dress.

Lloyd quickly turns toward the bar.

<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh shit, there she is.
<b>
</b><b>                                                   87.
</b>
<b>                      HARRY
</b>              (checking her out)
          Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd.
          She's an angel.
              (beat)
          Well, what are you waiting for? Get
          over there and talk to her.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          She's gonna think I'm some kind of
          psycho when she realizes how far I
          came just to see her.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          You have her briefcase she's gonna
          be thrilled to see you.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          And then what? She'll take it back
          and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.

Harry thinks about this a moment.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Look, man, you just drove two thousand
          miles to see this girl. Don't quit
          on the last fifty feet.

<b>                       LLOYD
</b>               (brightening)
          Wait a second, I have an idea. You
          go over and introduce yourself. That
          way you can build me up so when I
          come along I won't have to brag about
          myself. Tell her I'm good-looking
          and I'm rich and I have a rapist's
          wit.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          I can't tell her you're good looking,
          Lloyd she's got eyes.

Lloyd takes a big gulp of his new martini.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Please Harry, I'm appealing to you
          as one loser to another. Just build
          me up and then give me a signal to
          come over. Please.

Harry SIGHS.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          All right. But you're gonna owe me a
          big one for this.

Harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie, then APPROACHES
Mary, who is now standing alone, admiring the owls.

<b>                      HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Nice set of hooters you got there.

Mary turns to Harry, stunned.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          I beg your pardon?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          The owls. They're beautiful.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          Oh. Yeah.
              (beat)
          Are you a bird lover?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Well, I used to have a parakeet, but
          my main area of expertise is canines
          that's dogs to the layperson.

She smiles at this.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          Thanks. I love dogs, too. So how

are you involved with them?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Oh, I've trained them, bathed them,
          clipped them; I've even bred them.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          Really? Any unusual breeding?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But
          one time we successfully mated a
          Bulldog and a Shitzu.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          Really? That's weird.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Yeah. We called it a Bullshit.
              (breaks out LAUGHING)
          Just a little breeder joke.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           89.
</b>
She seems strangely charmed by this.

<b>                      HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Anyway, the real reason I came over
          is because I want to introduce you
          to a friend of mine.

Just then, Mary's stepmother approaches. She's holding a
martini and looking a little sloshed.

<b>                      HELEN
</b>          Mary, I don't believe I've met your
          friend.

<b>                       MARY
</b>          Actually, we haven't been introduced
          yet.
               (holds out hand)
          I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my
          stepmother, Helen.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you
          both.

<b>                      HELEN
</b>          I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne.
          I was hoping we'd get a chance to
          meet.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>              (taken aback)
          You were?

<b>                      HELEN
</b>          That tuxedo I love a man with a
          sense of humor. So does Mary.

Mary shoots Helen a look, then smiles at Harry.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Really?

For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages
to snap out of it.

<b>                      HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Anyway, about my friend you doing
          anything tomorrow, Mr. Dunne? Because
          I believe Mary's looking for somebody
          to hit the slopes with. Whuh?

<b>                      MARY
</b>          Helen, you're embarrassing me.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           90.
</b>
<b>                      HELEN
</b>          Well you are, aren't you?
              (to Harry)
          Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So
          what do you say, Harry? Are you
          available?

Harry thinks about this, then looks across the room at a
hopeful Lloyd.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend
          your friends for one day. You and
          Mary will have a ball.

Mary's captivating eyes meet his, waiting for an answer.

<b>                          HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Um... well... I don't know. You see, the
          thing is... sure.

ON LLOYD - he waits impatiently at the bar as Harry returns.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          How come you didn't call me over?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Relax, you're golden. I got you a
          ate with her tomorrow.

Lloyd falls back against the bar and grabs his chest. He's

Suddenly Harry appears in the room, dressed ridiculously. As
he begins to clumsily make his way through the lodge toward
Mary, we see that he ALREADY HAS HIS SKIS ON. He kicks over
a row of skis and gets glares from all sides. Finally he
reaches her, OUT OF BREATH.

The chair swings around, comes up behind them, and makes a
smooth pick up of Mary, that is. An embarrassed Harry is
STILL IN THE CROUCHING POSITION, having missed the ride.
Mary looks back at him, confused. Suddenly he pretends to be

Harry BARKS OUT A LAUGH at their stupidity.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          I knew there was an explanation. And
          here I thought she was standing me
          up.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>          That'll teach you to jump to
          conclusions.
              (beat)
          Anyway, since you have your night
          all

planned, I think I'll run out and catch a flick.

As Harry walks into the closet to change, Lloyd clenches his
fist and glares after him. Then he regains his composure and
moves to the bar.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Will you join me in a good luck toast
          before you head out?

          Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think
          will help your chances.

Lloyd BITES HIS LIP at this. He fills two mugs with coffee
and throws a splash of Bailey's in each. He check to make
sure Harry is still in the closet, then pulls out a BOX OF
<b>EX-LAX.
</b>
<b>LLOYD DUMPS THE ENTIRE PACK INTO ONE MUG AND MIXES IT IN.

<b>                        HARRY
</b>          Uh... it's for mature audiences. I

          away at the door.

Lloyd hands him the mug with the Ex-Lax. Then he lifts his
own glass.

<b>                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
</b>          To my friend Harry the matchmaker.

Harry feels a pang of guilt but drinks up anyway.

He GULPS DOWN THE DRINK.

Harry's driving along, WHISTLING happily to himself in
anticipation of the night. Suddenly we hear a LOW, INTESTINAL
RUMBLE. He reacts and rubs his stomach.

The hearse parks on the street and Harry gets out. He's
walking up the steps to the house when we hear more GASEOUS
THUNDER from his stomach. Harry stops in his tracks, gets
his insides under control, and continues to the front porch,
where he RINGS the bell.

Mary answers the door, fiddling with her earrings.

<b>                      MARY

          ready. Just give me one more minute.

As she disappears down a hallway, we hear Harry's UPSET
STOMACH again. He notices a bathroom off the hallway and
rushes inside.

<b>INT. BATHROOM
</b>
HOLD ON Harry's face as he quickly pulls his pants down and
nestles onto the throne. He lets out a SIGH OF RELIEF as he
does his business, then leans over and SLIDES OPEN THE WINDOW
to air the room out. He's still glued to the toilet when he
hears a KNOCK on the door.

<b>                      MARY

          I hope you're not using the toilet.
          It's broken.

ZOOM IN TIGHT on Harry's face - his EYES GO WIDE and a visible
SWEAT breaks out on his forehead.

Harry's got his pants back on and is lifting the lid off the

Mary's sitting patiently on the couch with her legs crossed.
She looks at her watch, then flips on the TV.
ON THE TUBE - the news is on. A WOMAN REPORTER is addressing
the CAMERA gravely:

We see Billy the blind boy from apartment 4-C sitting in
his wheelchair, holding up Petey the parakeet with its head
Scotch taped on its body.

The Reporter shakes her head and they go to a commercial.
Mary SHIVERS at this and turns off the television. Suddenly
the DOORBELL RINGS. She gets up and opens the front door.

HER POV - a dapper Lloyd is standing there in his new Aspen-
chic clothes.

Lloyd is thrilled at this.

</b>          I brought you your briefcase You

Mary's MOUTH DROPS OPEN.

She goes to the bathroom door. Inside we hear the LOUD
CLANKING of metal against metal.

Harry's got the eintire toilet completely DISASSEMBLED now.
Various pieces of the commode litter the floor, including

some pipes coming out of the wall.

</b>          You're fucking dead!

</b>
Harry gets out of the elevator and lets himself into the
Presidential Suite.

<b>INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE
</b>
Harry ENTERS looking contrite and CALLS OUT:

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Lloyd, are you home? We've gotta
          talk, man. I have a serious confession
          to make.

Harry comes around the corner and STOPS COLD.

HIS POV - Lloyd and Mary are lying on the bed, their arms
handcuffed to the bedpost.

<b>                      HARRY (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh good, you found her. I'll just
          leave you two kids alone.

Harry turns to go, but bumps into the MUZZLE OF ANDRE'S GUN.

<b>                      ANDRE
</b>          Why don't you stay and join the party?

</b>
<b>INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>Harry is sitting beside Lloyd and Mary on the bed. Nicholas
Andre keeps his gun trained on them while he SPEAKS on the
phone:

<b>                      ANDRE
</b>          ..I want a one-way ticket to Rio De
          Janerio departing as soon as
          possible...

ON THE BED - Harry and Lloyd can't look each other in the
eye.

<b>                      MARY
</b>          You mean you two know each other?
<b>
</b><b>                                                  112.
</b>
<b>                      LLOYD
</b>              (cutting)
          Yeah, we used to be best friends.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Until he turned into a backstabber.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Me a backstabber? You got a lot of
          nerve. I saw her first.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Hey, I couldn't help it if she found
          me irresistable.

Mary ROLLS HER EYES at this.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          But you knew how crazy I was about
          her.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Yeah, and you knew how crazy I was
          about Fraida Felcher, but that didn't
          stop you, did it?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>              (waning righteousness)
          What are you talking about?

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Don't deny it, Lloyd. Fraida told me
          the whole sordid story.

Lloyd can't muster a defense.
<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Look... I was gonna tell you about
          that. It was gonna be mentioned at
          the reading of my will. I swear, you
          can ask my lawyer.

Harry glares at him.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Well I guess we both learned a little
          something about each other, didn't
          we?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          You said it, pal. Maybe we're not as
          good friends as we thought we were.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       113.
</b>
<b>                         HARRY
</b>          Guess not.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          I mean, if one beautiful girl   could
          rip us apart like this, then   it seems
          our friendship isn't worth a   damn.
              (beat)
          Maybe we should call it quits   right
          here.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Just tell me where to sign, bud.

Suddenly they hear the metallic CLICK-CLACK OF A GUN BEING
<b>COCKED.
</b>
<b>                      ANDRE
</b>          Okay, which one of you losers wants
          to die first?

The guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          I wouldn't pull that trigger if I
          were you.

<b>                      ANDRE
</b>          Why not? It'll look like just another
          Aspen love triangle. You caught the
          two of them in bed, handcuffed them
          to the post, murdered them, and killed
          yourself.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>              (smug)
          Except you're forgetting one minor
          etail.

<b>                         ANDRE
</b>          What's that?

Lloyd and Mary look at Harry, hopeful.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          If you kill us, you'd be killing
          yourself.

<b>                         ANDRE
</b>                 (puzzled)
          Huh?
<b>
</b><b>                                                   114.
</b>
<b>                       HARRY
</b>           You see, philosophers believe that
           we're all really just tiny pieces of
           one huge universal being. In other
           words, I am you and you are me, so
           if you were to kill us you'd be
           committing suicide, you unenlightened

idiot --

<b>                        ANDRE
</b>           --Shut up!

Mary sees that they're in deep shit now.

<b>                       MARY
</b>           What about my husband? Did you kill
           him, too?

<b>                       HARRY
</b>           Husband? What husband?

<b>                       LLOYD
</b>           Mary's married, Harry.

<b>                       ANDRE
</b>           No need to worry about Melvin.
               (beat)
           Now this is the last time I'll ask:
           Who wants to die first?

Harry gestures with his head at Mary.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>           Kill her. The bitch should've told
           him she was married back at the
           airport. It would've saved us a lot
           of trouble.

Andre points the gun at Mary.

<b>                       LLOYD
</b>           No, I'll go first, Harry. I was the
           one who got you into this mess.

Andre points the gun at Lloyd.

<b>                       HARRY
</b>           No, wait, do me first. I'm the one
           who stole your girl, Lloyd. I eserve
           it.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          115.
</b>
Andre SIGHS and points the gun at Harry. Then, as Mary and
Lloyd look on in horror, he FIRES TWICE. Harry grabs his
stomach and falls off the bed to the floor.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Jesus Christ! You killed my best
          friend, you bastard!

Andre smiles.

<b>                      ANDRE
</b>          If it's any consolation, you're about
          to be reunited.

He aims the gun at Lloyd, COCKS THE TRIGGER. Suddenly, a
SHOT RINGS OUT and the gun is blown out of Andre's hand.

ON THE FLOOR - Harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol
at the stunned Nicholas Andre.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Harry! You're alive!

Just them, the door BURSTS OPEN and SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS
storm in with their weapons drawn.

<b>                      COP #1
</b>          Get your hands up, asshole!

Lloyd and Harry throw their hands into the air. A stunned
Andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. He
reluctantly raises his hands. Mary and Lloyd are flabbergasted
by the turn of events.

There's a sudden commotion in the room. Pushing her way
through the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty. She
flashes an ID.

<b>                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
</b>          Special Officer Kathryn Frick. Federal
          Bureau of Investigation.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>              (dumbstruck)
          You gotta be kidding.

<b>                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
</b>          Good work, Harry.

Lloyd looks to his friend, confused. Harry opens his shirt,
revealing a BULLET-PROOF VEST.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       116.
</b>
<b>                      HARRY
</b>          She grabbed me down in the lobby and
          explained what was up. They slapped
          this on me and gave me a gun.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>              (to Athletic Beauty)
          But how did you...?

<b>                      ATHLETIC   BEAUTY
</b>          We've been following   you two all the
          way from Providence.   Mr. and Mrs.
          Swanson had a homing   device plated
          in the briefcase.

The guys glance guiltily at one another.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Yeah, about that dough...

<b>                      ATHLETIC BEAUTY
</b>          Every bill was counterfeit and marked.

Harry and Lloyd EXHALE A SIGH OF RELIEF.

</b>
<b>EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - NIGHT
</b>
There's a swarm of ONLOOKERS as Andre and J.P. Shay are
hustled into a police car and driven away. While Mary TALKS
to the police, Harry and Lloyd stare at her lovingly.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          She's something, ain't she, Har?
<b>                      HARRY
</b>          You were right, Lloyd. She was
          efinitely worth the trip.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Guess we have to admit it, she was
          too good for us.

Just then, a cruiser pulls up and Mary's husband jumps out.

<b>                      MELVIN
</b>          Oh god, baby, I missed you!

Harry and Lloyd stare in wonder as MEL GIBSON climbs out of
the car. Mary and Mel embrace, then Mel turns to the guys.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         117.
</b>
<b>                      MELVIN (CONT'D)
</b>          I can't thank you enough, fellas. It
          was so darn dank in that well, I
          really thought it would be the death
          of me.

Harry and Lloyd are too stunned to respond. They look at
each other, and we

</b>
<b>INT. LOBBY - HOTEL DANBURY - THE NEXT DAY
</b>
Lloyd and Harry come out of the elevator with their meager
luggage, but this time nobody rushes to their aid.

<b>EXT. HOTEL DANBURY - DAY
</b>
The guys EXIT the hotel and approach the Bell Captain,
Barnard.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Hey, Barney...

<b>                      BELL CAPTAIN
</b>          Yes, gentlemen?

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Look, we just wanted to say that we
          appreciate all you did for us during
          our stay.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          And we're, um, sorry about the money
          we gave you turning out to be phony.
<b>                      BELL CAPTAIN
</b>          Don't worry about it, gentlemen. The
          Swanson family has promised to
          reimburse everyone.

This seems to please Lloyd and Harry. The hearse is delivered
to the front door.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          Well, anyway, thanks again for
          everything.

They turn to go, but Barnard CALLS TO THEM:

<b>                      BARNARD
</b>          Where are you two headed?
<b>
</b><b>                                                       118.
</b>
<b>                      HARRY
</b>          I dunno. I'm sure we'll find a trailer
          camp somewhere to call home.

<b>                      BARNARD
</b>          Why not right here?

Harry and Lloyd look at each other, confused.

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          This joint is a little out of our
          budget, Barney.

<b>                      BARNARD
</b>              (smiling)
          Oh, I think we might be able to find
          you a free room somewhere -- after
          all, like you once told me, we're
          all from the same mold.
              (winks)
          You just don't have any dough right
          now.

The guys are STUNNED by Barnard's generous offer.

<b>                      HARRY
</b>          Are you on the level?

<b>                      BARNARD
</b>          Absolutely. We'll just slide you
          into one of the employee rooms...

The guys beam at this.

<b>                      BARNARD (CONT'D)
</b>          ...Provided, of course, you don't
          mind working one or two afternoons a
          week.

Harry and Lloyd lock eyes. Then:

<b>                      LLOYD
</b>          You know what, Barney, I think we'll
          take out chances down the road.

Barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their
hearse and drive off.

<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

As the hearse drives down the road, we hear V.O.:
