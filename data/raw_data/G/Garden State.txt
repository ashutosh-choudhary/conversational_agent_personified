          The RADIO NOISE is drowned out by the A CAPELLA, SOPRANO
          VOICE of a young Indian boy as he sings a melodic Hindi
          prayer.

<b>          INT. AIRPLANE CABIN --- NIGHT
</b>

<b>          THE WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINABLE:
</b>          SLOW MOTION: The plane is going down fasts Everyone panics
          and screams in SLOW MOTION as the oxygen masks away like
          plastic pendulums. The SOPRANO VOICE continues the prayer.

          ANDREW LARGEMAN (LARGE), 25, is the only passenger who
          remains unfazed. Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery
          reflections on his cheeks, even as the young mother seated
          next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God, even
          as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and
          the beverage cart slides down the aisle, Andrew Largeman sits
          peacefully; unaffected.

          He calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows
          directly on him. He looks up to

<b>          THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN
</b>
          it BINGS as the light flashes on and off. The BINGING
          continues more and more frequently; at first in rhythm with
          the prayer and then it dissolves into the RING of an

<b>          ELECTRONIC TELEPHONE.

          Whiteness. Morning sun streams through a palatial picture
          window. THE PHONE continues to RING. A ceiling fan spins
          above stacks of scripts, a cell phone charging, bare walls
          and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in
          which he sleeps.

          HIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams
          like they're chasing each other in a game of tag.
          THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine. Large's eyes
          stop moving.

          BEEP. The machine cuts the voice off.
          LARGE'S EYES processing.

          They elide slowly left, then back right as if scanning in
          data. He blinks. He blinks again slowly. His eyelids float
          closed. He falls back to sleep.

<b>          INT. BATHROOM -- MORNING
</b>
          Large appears to stare directly at us. He's dazed. His body
          is there, but his mind seems absent. He reaches to the middle
          of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the
          mirror he's been staring into.

          His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two
          dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately
          line the shelves of his medicine cabinet.

          He closes the mirror doors and stares at himself.

<b>          EXT. CENTURY CITY PAVILION -- LATER
</b>
          Large rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break.
          He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries
          to find an address while checking a piece of paper.
          He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL-
          stairs.

</b>          After a moment he looks to his right through a window into a
          gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him.
          Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere.

          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the
          down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way
          down, where he moves to the "Up" one and rises towards the
          next level. His expression never changes.

<b>          INT. CASTING OFFICE -- DAY
</b>
          A casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and
          manilla envelopes while the PHONE RINGS constantly. Large
          sits next to another actor that looks exactly like him;
          they're even dressed alike.

          WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL: they are sitting beneath an eight
          foot photograph of "Urkel" wagging his finger at the camera.
          A slow 360 degree pan around the room reveals ten other
          actors identical to Large aggressively rehearsing their lines
          to themselves.

          The ACTOR seated next to Large leans over to him.

<b>                         ACTOR
</b>          We're whores.
          Large looks at him.

          We hold on Large as he swings his gaze to the actor on his
          other side aggressively running his lines to the air.

<b>          INT. LARGE' S CAR -- DAY
</b>
          Hazy and claustrophobic in stopped traffic on the 405
          freeway. Large stares absently out the window as BLARING
          SIRENS. compete with the obnoxious ramblings of L.A. TALK

<b>          RADIO.
</b>          Large suddenly squints his eyes and clutches his neck in
          pain.

<b>          EXT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
          Large pulls his car into a parking spot, throws "The Club" on
          his steering wheel and heads towards the back door of the
          restaurant. But something catches his eye on the side of his
          car.
          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL: a gasoline pump nozzle
          sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped
          off at the end. He stares at it, trying to remember the last
          time he bought gas. He looks both ways and covertly pulls the
          nozzle from his tank.
          He walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws
          the nozzle in an open dumpater.

<b>          INT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
          Large flings open the door and enters a long, dark corridor
          lined with stacked chairs. He passes a WAITER in a black
          TUNIC wearing eye make-up to make him look Asian.

</b>          Large glides through the chaotic environment unfazed by any
          of the stress. He rounds a corner to a time card machine and
          swipes his card. The machine BEEPS and displays the word,
          "LATE" in red. He crosses to a locker and quickly changes
          into a black tunic and pants.
          He moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over
          thirty people in white: chopping, frying, sauteing, YELLING.
          The Vietnamese chef wears a headset and BARKS ORDERS down the
          line. Large is met by a FRENCH WOMAN MANAGER. She walks with
          him as he weaves his way through the kitchen.

          or Milwaukee and do you know what
          they want even more than a guest
          spot on "Everybody Loves Raymond"?
          They want your job. This will not
          happen again. This will never
          happen again. You have two tables.

          revealing a headshot on the other side.

</b>          Todd Slauson from Duluth,
          Minnesota.
          During all this, Large remains calm and unphased. He takes a
          stick of eye make-up from the pocket of the tunic and paints
          his eyes to appear Asian. (As do all the white, good-looking,
          male waiters.)
          He takes a small radio transceiver device from the pocket of
          the tunic and turns it on. He unwinds the ear piece, pulls it
          through the back of his jacket, out the neck and into his
          ear. Immediately we hear a VIETNAMESE MAN'S VOICE giving
          orders over the ear piece.

          Waiter number fifteen, your table

          Large takes a deep breath and pushes open the door into:

</b>
          A very fancy Hollywood Vietnamese restaurant filled to
          capacity with a Friday evening crowd. The energy is
          completely different from the other side of the door. SOFT

          THE RUSH OF WATER as Large washes his hands at the last Oink
          in a very long row. He grabs his neck while SQUINTING his
          eyes closed in pain for a brief second.
          A moment later he picks up his bag and heads down the line of
          sinks. As he passes each sink, he unknowingly activates their
          motion sensors and each faucet SHOOTS a tiny burst of water.
          The NASALLY VOICE of a WOMAN SINGING an off key version of

<b>          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
          A large group of people are gathered around a steel coffin.
          Atop the coffin site a framed picture of a tired looking
          woman in a wheelchair. This is SARAH LARGEMAN.
          We find SYLVIA LARGEMAN, the source of the music. CLOSE ON
          HER FACE as the assorted palette of colored make-up on her
          cheeks swirls together with tears until it collects on the
          tip of her chin and drips like a leaky faucet onto:
          HER LYRICS SHEET as a rainbow of tears splatter the words
          "ONCE and "TWICE".
          The song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of Hebrew
          prayers. Large squints through the mourners to see his father
          GIDEON LARGEMAN shovel a handful of dirt onto the casket.
          Behind him stands CYNTHIA DILLARD, 25, a beautiful young
          Black woman.

          crowd and approaches the two men. We see now they are HA-RKs
          26, good looking in a dirty way. And DAVE, 26. They are quite
          filthy, but each sports expensive jewelry and black
          yarmulkes.
          They look up as Large approaches.

          done in the same floral pattern; everything: wallpaper,
          towels, curtains. He looks down at the shirt; it's the same

          motorcycle with a sidecar. The corner of hie mouth raises and
          holds the idea of a smile.

          roads. He's going really fast. He closes his eyes, flying by
          a COP CAR doing eighty before he opens them again. LIGHTS
          FLASH behind him as he pulls over.

</b>          Yeah... So I definitely wanna come
          by and check out your new pad. You
          gotta tell me what happened.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Basically, "The Man bought my
          silent Velcro patent.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          What?

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Well you knew I was an inventor
          right?

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          No. But I haven't seen you since we

<b>                         WERE SIXTEEN-

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Oh well yeah... I wasn't really an
          inventor yet. Anyway I developed
          this little item that's just like
          Velcro but doesn't make that
          annoying Velcro noise.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          now much did they buy it for?

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          A lot.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          Wow. So what are you doing now?

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Nothing.
          They laugh.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          Seriously.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Seriously. Absolutely nothing. I've
          never been so bored in all my life.
          The first month I bought a whole
          bunch of shit, but then that got
          boring. But I... nothing.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          That's so crazy. But I mean like,
          are you gonna travel or like what
          are you gonna do? Shouldn't you
          like help starving kids or
          something?

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          I'm not really motivated to do much
          at all. It's kind of funny, I guess
          I had kind of planned on my whole
          life being about struggling to get
          money. But now that I've got more
          than I ever dreamed, I'm really not
          sure what to do with myself. I
          stare at walls a lot.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Can you believe that shit, Large?
          This guy has one idea and he's a
          trillionaire. I got a thousand
          ideas, but I gotta sit around and
          wait for all my relatives to die.
          They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book.
          Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that
          the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty
          young; 17-19.
          As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
          GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the
          stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone
          has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Here, bro.
          He passes Large the golf book.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          Oh no thanks, man.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Really? But you're like a movie
          star and shit.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          No, no thanks.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Well then here. Eat this.
          Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of E with a SMILEY
          FACE on it.

<b>                         25
</b>          Large takes it in his hand and thinks about it. He looks
          around at everyone else in the room eating them; including
          the cute girls.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          I guess I'll see youguyslater.
          He eats the hit. They laugh.

<b>                         DANA
</b>          Should we play a game?

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          other than golf?
          They laugh.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          No, let's play Spin The Bottle.
          The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>
<b>                         (TO JESSE)
</b>          I'm not playing Spin The Bottle;
          how old are we? or more
          importantly, how old are they?
          Jesse passes Large the joint.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          They're all legal. I think.
          He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy
          voice takes control.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          Well we just ate all this fuckin'
          ex, what the hell else are we gonna
          do?

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          The girl has a point.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Okay, how 'bout this.
          He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to
          neck.

<b>                         MARK (CONT'D}
</b>          First let's finish Daddy's golf
          tequila. Then we can use this
          bottle.
          The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa.ERA
          FINDS ITS WAY to Large's face as he feels the weed and the
          beginning of his trip. His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv
          start.

</b>
<b>          THE REST OF THIS SCENE WILL VACILLATE BETWEEN REGULAR, SPED-
</b>
<b>          UP AND SLOW MOTION.
</b>          The party seems to fast forward around Large; the MUSIC FADES
          TO ONE LOW NOTE until it breaks with people calling his name.

<b>                         ALL
</b>          Large!
          He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed
          directly at him.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Largeman, this is Dana.
          Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes
          with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room.

<b>                         DANA
</b>          Hi.

<b>                         LARGE

          Oh, who's up?
          They all laugh. She gets up and slowly walks over to the
          couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in
          his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She
          stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her
          knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap.
          The MUSIC PLAYS.
          Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact.
          They kiss softly enjoying every second. Its incredibly sexy.

<b>          HIS FINGERS CLUTCH HER THIGH
</b>          They stop and look at each other. She kisses him on the cheek
          and gets up. Everyone reacts and some clap.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          This is gonna be a good night.
          Everything SPEEDS-UP and SLOWS DOWN. A barrage of images:
          people hooking up, girls kissing girls, guys feeling girls
          up, joints being passed, one girl crying, Mark showing off
          his golf swing, Large trying to take deep breaths, Jesse and
          Dave hugging, two-figures moving quickly under a blanket.
          Kenny in full riot gear letting people take turns hitting him
          in his helmet.
          FASTER : hands gripping each other, a nose on a neck, hands
          gripping a waist.
          Ecu s Largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end the
          corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile..

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         27
</b>          The motion of the room is sped to a blur until finally:

<b>          BLACKNESS.
</b>          A BLARING LIGHT comes out of the darkness. Morning sun
          streams through a window revealing Large's face, full frame,
          eyes still closed. Across his forehead in thick black marker
          the word "BALLS" is written.
          His eyes open wide. He has no idea where he is. His eyeballs
          swing left, then right. As Large site up
          THE CAMERA pulls back to reveal we are

<b>          INT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- MORNING
</b>
          Large site on the sofa covered in an afghan. White morning
          sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to
          highlight the duet in the air.
          A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open. He has no idea
          where he is.
          Large's POV into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a
          person walking around; like a hunter's amateur video of his
          Bigfoot sighting.
          He can only make out pieces: a sword, boots, then a cereal
          box.
          Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view: a medieval
          Knight in full regalia. They make eye contact for a second
          and Large slams his eyes shut. When he opens them again the
          knight is gone.

<b>          INT. KITCHEN -- LATER
</b>
          Large and Mark sit with CAROL, mark's mother and TIN PAYTON,
          25. Carol is mid-forties and always looks like she's got a
          cold or has just been crying. Tim is dressed as a Medieval
          Knight.
          Large and mark stare at Tim as he SLURPS down his cereal.
          Carol smokes a thin cigarette. Mark is shirtless. No one
          addresses the fact that it says "Balls" in black marker On
          Large's forehead.
          Silence but for the CLANKING of SILVERWARE and TIM'S

          the time I'm gonna save at least
          one.

<b>                         TIM
</b>          Three years. But I've only been a
          knight for two. You have to pay
          your dues. I worked in the stables
          and helped in the kitchen.

<b>                         CAROL
</b>          When I started he was making the

          since you got knighted.

</b>          I really just stirred it.

          Silence. Large stares at Mark in disbelief, then starts to
          LAUGH. They all start to join him except Mark. They stop
          laughing.

<b>                         CAROL

          He gets up to leave. But his sword gets caught between his
          chair and the table. They all watch as he fumbles to undo
          himself. He's like John Ritter at his finest. Large and Mark
          just laugh.

          Mark leans forward to pull a bong hit from a blackened,
          colored tube. He coughs out his hit and reclines his bare
          back against the torn pleather couch. Carol enters and stands
          next to them watching the TV.

<b>                         CAROL

          He passes the bong to his Mom. She smokes it, then sits down,

<b>                         RECEPTIONIST

          She site. Large turns back to his paperwork. He fills out a
          line before he notices the "seeing-eye-dog" has wandered over
          to him. Large looks at him.

          proceeds to thrust his groin to and fro.
          Large tries to shove him off. He looks back at the blind
          woman who stares off in the other direction. Large is about
          to say something to her but he stops himself.

<b>                         LARGE (CONT'D)

           Finally Large gives up and decides to just let it hump away-
           He tries to return to his paperwork. Someone BURSTS OUT
          LAUGHING. Large turns to see a cute 20 year old GIRL he
          hadn't seen sitting in the corner. She wears really big
          headphones.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          E)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad.
          So uh... he... I think he'd prefer
          me to stay on it. He likes to think
          it makes me happy. And I let him
          think that because he's sort of
          consumed by the idea of making
          everyone happy.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          Well look, I'll examine you and
          give you a Catscan just so you
          won't worry that it's anything
          serious. But to be honest, I think
          the headaches are something else.
          Our bodies do very funny things
          when they're consumed with stress
          and anxiety. Things you'd never
          expect. I found my ex-best friend's
          cuff links in my wife's puree and I
          couldn't get an erection for a year
          and a half.

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          But that doesn't really feel like
          it. I mean I don't feel stressed or
          really anxious at all.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          Well with all the Lithium he's had
          you on it's amazing you can even
          hear me right now_

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          Oh, right.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          First of all, I do think you need
          to find a psychiatrist that isn't
          your father. That just's something
          that should have been remedied
          years ago. He knows better.
          Secondly, I'm not in a position to
          comment on whether or not you
          should stay on the meds or not; I
          don't know your story. But my
          opinion, since you're paying for
          it, is that those drugs may help as
          a means to an end. But if you're
          not In any sort of therapy, sooner
          or later what's ever going on in
          your mind will find a way to peek
          it's little head out of the water.
          Just something to think about.

          REGULAR MOTION: They arrive at the end of the hall where a

          projected onto the wall opposite the peep hole. An old camera
          lens has been ducked taped to the peep hole causing the image
          to appear in perfect focus.

          from behind by an OLDER GREASEBALL. Her face is no more than

          The three of them reach the top of a small hill to reveal...

<b>          AN ENORMOUS ABANDONED QUARRY
</b>          Colossal old cranes and construction trucks loom in the
          distance like ancient dinosaurs frozen in rust and graffiti.
          The center of the quarry goes so deep they can't see the
          bottom. They stand on the edge. Rain clouds rapidly drift
          overhead. This glace is surreal.

          alongside the abyss.

</b>
          Further down the path. Sam looks to Large. He uses an old mop
          handle he's found as a walking stick.
          As they continue along the path it begins to get continually
          cluttered with rusty junk. An old bedframe, a porcelain tub,
          remnants of a "Jungle-Gym", dirty broken toys.
          Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a THIRTY
          FOOT DILAPIDATED SOUSE BOAT perched on cement blocks that
          sits right on the edge of the cliff. It's windows glow warm
          and welcoming.
          Mark stands in front of the boat. This isn't what he
          expected. Rain begins to fall.

<b>                         MARK

          They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat. Mark
          steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull.

</b>          After a moment, ALBERT, a very gentle looking man in his mid-
          thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears
          on the deck. He smiles warmly-

          They step inside and the door closes behind them. It's very
          cozy and warm. GREAT MUSIC PLAYS. A wood burning stove heats
          the room and throws warm amber light onto a small LIVING ROOM
          with deep cushy couches.

          The three of them huddle by the fire. They speak in quiet
          whispers.

          speed.
          Large leads them to an old yellow crane that's rusty arm
          hangs out over the 'edge. He climbs up onto it's base.
          REGULAR MOTION; Large SCREAMS as loud as he can, with

          Sam and Mark look up at him and climb up alongside Large to
          join hint.
          The three of them, in their black parkas, with their hair
          drenched against their heads, SCREAM as loud as they can,
          with everything they have in the POURING RAIN.
          FREEZE FRAME: The three of them smiling. A release. A perfect
          moment.
          UNFREEZE: Sam locks eyes on Large. He stares back at her.
          They kiss. He wraps his hands around the back of her head and
          they kiss, in the pouring rain, on the edge of something.

          Mark pulls out the bag. It practically falls apart it's 80
          wet from the rain. He pulls out an ANTIQUE NECKLACE with a
          square pendant on it. He puts it in Large's wet hand.

          Large wears the necklace around his neck. He plays with the

          EXTREME CLOSE-UP INSIDE TEE PENDANT: It's an antique game
          where you try to get three tiny lead balls to sit in three

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          It's funny; this thing reminds me
          of this really random memory of my
          mother. Its so weird, I haven't
          thought about this in so long, but
          this great memory I have where I
          was a little kid and I was crying
          for one reason or another and she
          was kind of holding me and rocking
          me back and forth. And I could see
          the little balls in this thing just
          rolling back and forth. And there
          was just snot dripping down my
          nose.

<b>                         (HE LAUGHS)
</b>          And she just handed me her sleeve
          and told me to just blow my nose
          into it. And I remember thinking,
          even as a very little kid, "Wow.
          This is love."
          More tears start to well and overflow from his eyes. He tries
          to stifle them with a LAUGH. He cradles the pendant.

<b>                         LARGE (CONT'D)
</b>          This is love. And it just felt
          so... good to be there. So safe.
          And I didn't feel safe very often,
          but at that moment...
          Tears are now streaming down his face as well as Sam's. She
          holds the plastic cup in her hand.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          oh, Large I'm never gonna be able
          to get all these.

          waist to hug him close. She kisses his-'wet cheeks.

<b>                         SAM (CONT'D)

<b>                         LARGE
</b>          It's so funny isn't it? But I
          think that's the single most
          amazing moment I remember of my
          Mother. 'Cause she wasn't sad and
          she wasn't being prodded to be
          happy, she was just there.

          that his eyes have become; a monumental release. He almost
          looks like a different person. They stare directly into each
          other's eyes. He turns away; it's too vulnerable a place for
          him.
