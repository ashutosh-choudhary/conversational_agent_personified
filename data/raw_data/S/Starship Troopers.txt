<b>				NET CORRESPONDENT
</b>		We 've just landes here on whar cap troopres are calling 
		"Big K" with the 6th Mobile Infantery division...
		It 's an ugly planet, a bug planet, a planet hostile to 
		life as we iGKKKKKK !

	Blood hits the lens as the Correspondent is cut in half.
	The CAMERA catches a glimpse of HUGE CLAWS as Cap Trooper
	JOHNNY RICO , 18, blows away SOMETHING BIG big with his pulse cannon.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Com'on, let's go !	ON THE BOUNCE

	The cap troopers move out, among them DIZZY FLORES, 18, ACE
	LEVY, 19, and KITTEN SMITH, 18. The CAMERA pauses, unsure.

<b>				FED NET CENTRAL (O.S.)
</b><b>		FOLLOW THEM...! GO ! GO !
</b>
	The CAMERA follows. The PULSE of BUG BATTERIES is blinding.
	Cap Troopers scream as they are torn apart right and left by an enemy
	seen only in disorientating glimpses.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b><b>		THIS WAY !
</b>
	The group splits into two, and the CAMERA follows Johnny.
	Something slices Kitten Smith, and he goes down screaming.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b><b>		KITTEN !
</b>
	Johnny stops to help his comrade. A CLAW slashes into him.

<b>	
</b><b>				JOHNNY
</b><b>		AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
	Now something grabs the CAMERA, spinning it around. 
	We glimpse the hideous jaws of an ARACHNID WARRIOR.

<b>				CAMERAMAN (O.S.)
</b><b>		AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
	The CAMERA hits the ground. Johnny, badly wounded, bleeding
	from the mouth, crawls into CAMERA, trying to get away from the
	dark INSECT SHAPES that close in on him.

</b>		Oh, God... Oh, God, help me...
		please help me...

	His eyes glaze over as he remembers

<b>								FLASHBACK:
</b>
<b>6	INT	NEW UNI HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY - CARMEN IBANEZ
</b>
	is beautiful, just 18, and quite pleased with herself  because
	Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her.

<b>				RASCZAK (O.S.)
</b>		The end of another school year, and for 
		me no doubt another failure...
		Rico, pay attention !

	The teacher JEAN RASCZAK, 38, a rugged veteran who proudly
	displays his missing hand, scowls at Johnny, bemused.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.

	But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class, Johnny begins to sketch
	a cartoon on his desk's touch screen.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Here in History and Moral Philosophy
		we've explored the decline of 
		Democracy when social scientists brought
		the world to the brink of chaos, and how the	
		veterans took control and imposed a stability 
		that has lasted for generations since...
		You know these facts but have I taught you
		anything of value ? You.
		Why are only citizens allowed to vote ?

	Rasczak points at LANNY, 17, with his stump
<b>.
</b><b>				LANNY
</b>		It's a reward... what the Federation gives you
		for doing Federal Service.

	Rasczak is crestfallen, makes a big show of patience.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		No. Something given has no value !
		Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ?
		I guess they ought to revoke my 
		teaching credential...

	Laughter. Johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, is taking shape:
	Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		When you vote, you're exercising political
		authority. You're using force. And force, my
		friends, is violence, the supreme authority
		from which all other authority derives.

	CARL JENKINS, 18, a superintelligent geek, jumps in.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Gee, we always thought you were the
		supreme authority, Mr. Rasczak.

	Laughter. Rasczak grins.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		In my classroom, you bet. Whether it's 
		exerted by ten or ten billion, political 
		authority is violence by degree. The 
		people we call citizens have earned
		the right to wield it.

	DIZZY FLORES, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		My mother always says that violence
		never solves anything.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of
		Hiroshima would have to say about that.
		You.

	Rasczak points at Carmen.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		They probably wouldn't say anything.
		Hiroshima was destroyed.

	Johnny presses ´"SEND" on his desk, and the cartoon appears
	across the way on Carmen's screen.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Correct. Naked force has settled more
		issues in history than any other factor.
		The contrary opinion 'violence never
		solves anything' is wishful thinking
		at its worst.

	While Rasczak looks away, Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful
	smile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		People who forget that always pay...
		They pay with their lives and their
		freedom.

	Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face.
	So does Rasczak. He points at him with his stump,
	snaps Johnny to.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		You. Tell me the moral difference,
		if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		The difference lies in the field of civic
		virtue. A citizen accepts personal
		responsibility for the safety of the body politic,
		of which he is a member, defending it,
		if need be, with his life.
		The civilian does not.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		The exact words of the text. But do
		you understand it ?
		Do you believe it ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Uh, I don't know.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Of course you don't. I doubt if any 
		of you here would recognize 'civic virtue'
		if it bit you in the ass.

	A bell rings. Rasczak shrugs, indifferent.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Well, that's it. Have a nice life.

<b>7	EXT	NEW UNI HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN
</b>
	walk with their friends. Several COUPLES hold hands. Johnny
	tries to take Carmen's hand, but she demurs. Johnny broods.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		C'mon, let's see if they've posted the
		math final test yet.

<b>				STUDENT
</b>		Hey, Rico, we gonna take Tesla ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		How should I know ?

<b>				STUDENT
</b>		You're captain of the team !

<b>8	EXT	QUAD - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN
</b>
	join other students around a MULTI-SCREEN KIOSK.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		First thing Fleet Academy looks at
		is your math scores. 
		Wish me luck !

	Carmen enters her name, receives her score:	97% !	She beams.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Good for you.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Your turn...

	Then she spots Carl across the way talking with MARCO, 17.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Hold on... I wanna talk to Marco.
		His sister's at Fleet !

	Carmen rushes off. Johnny checks his score:	35% ! Crushed, he
	makes sure no none else has seen. Carl walks up to him.

<b>				CARL
</b>		You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		What's the hurry ?

<b>				CARL
</b>		Others are waiting.

	Carl points out Dizzy, talking with friends.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Did you read her mind ?

<b>				CARL
</b>		Don't have to... Some mating semaphore
		is pretty hard to miss.

	It's true. You can tell by the way she looks at Johnny.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Yeah, but I want Carmen.

<b>				CARL
</b>		You got it bad.

	Carmen returns to Johnny as Carls heads off.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Don't forget about this afternoon.
			(to Carmen)
		He's always late when he walks you home
		to fish for a kiss.

	Carmen blushes, covers.
<b>	
</b><b>				CARMEN
</b>		She's flying starships !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Who ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Marco's sister. Can you imagine 
		maneuvering half a million tons through
		crwoded space lanes...
		You gotta have nerves of steel !
		Reflexes are critical

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I have good reflexes.

	Carmen notices the way Dizzy's looking at Johnny, doesn't
	like it one bit, takes Johnny's arm.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		C'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology.

<b>9	INT	BIOLOGY LAB  -- DAY - THE BIOLOGY TEACHER
</b>
	is an older woman, very spry, also blind. Johnny, Carmen and
	other students gather around covered lab tables.

<b>				BIOLOGY TEACHER
</b>		For our final today, please identify the mouthparts,
		the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the
		nerve cord and count the ganglia.
		You may begin.

	The students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs, 60
	centimeter ARKELLIAN SAND BEETLES laid out for dissection.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Eeuch !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.

<b>				BIOLOGY TEACHER
</b>		Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are
		Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't 
		true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many
		ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself
		in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and
		mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of 
		society.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Better put your goggles on.

	Johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. Green
	fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill.

<b>				BIOLOGY TEACHER
</b>		Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have
		identified over two billion species so far.
		Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented
		art, mathematics and interstellar travel.

<b>				BIOLOGY TEACHER
</b>		True, we know of no insect society that has
		produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a
		Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your
		head, take the example of the Arachnids, a 
		highly organized, highly evolved insect society.

	She points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a
	common ant and ends with a two meter tall ARACHNID WARRIOR.

<b>				BIOLOGY TEACHER
</b>		They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers
		have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the 
		Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years
		of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the 
		biological means to hurl their spore into space.

	Johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity 
	open with aresounding crack. Bug guts gush out.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric
		caecal...

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Excuse me...!

	She heads for the door, hand over her mouth.

<b>10	EXT	CIVIC PARK - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN
</b>
	walk home from school together.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		35% on the math final !  No one could be
		that dumb with numbers.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch
		over a bug. How embarassing.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere
		if you don't know math.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are
		dumb with numbers.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Then how come you won't hold hands with me
		at school ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		I don't want everyone to see.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		How come that's all you talk about anymore ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		It's all I think about anymore.

	Indeed, they are all alone now. The look in Johnny's eye says how
	about it. Carmen grins, reaches for Johnny's hand.

<b>11	EXT	PUPLIC TRANSPORTATION - DAY - CARMEN
</b>
	and Johnny stand together near a bank of TRANSPORTERS.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		You can't walk me home.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Why not ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		I thought you were going to help Carl.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Carl can wait.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Johnny, my Dad's home today.

	Johnny's face darkens with frustration.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm
		a teenager. You can't be a citizen when
		you're only a teenager !

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich
		they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff
		means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come
		we're such good friends ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?

	Carmen steps into the flux.	ZAPPP!	She's gone.
	Johnny grins, happy to be in love.

<b>12	INT	CARL'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY - JOHNNY
</b>
	is hard-wired to the stacks of processing units that comprise Carl's 
	basement workshop. Carl concentrates on the image of a playing card,
	the six of diamonds, displayed on a monitor.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Don't think about it... go on instinct.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Ace of spades.

	The ace of spades appears, and the computer indicates "no match".
	Carl puts another card up, the jack of diamonds.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Statistically speaking you should've accidentally
guessed right by know.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves 
		I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.

	Wrong again.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Luck is not a factor. No one really knows why 
		some people are sensitive and some aren't.
		Federal studies like this might provide a clue.

	The next card up is the nine of clubs.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I wouldn't want to know what everyone was
		thinking. Four of spades.

	Suddenly, A GIANT YELLOW FROG jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing
	the monitor. Johnny removes the blindfold.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Cyrano, you big yellow turd !

	Johnny knows this frog, scratches him on the neck.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		He just wants attention. You don't play with 
		him like you used to.

	Carl concentrates for a moment.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

	Cyrano's eyes widen. He hops off the table and up the stairs two at
	a time. Carl clears the screen.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		How do you make him do that ?

<b>				CARL
</b>		I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling
		up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.

	From upstairs, CARL'S MOM shrieks.

<b>				MOM (O.S.)
</b>		Get out ! Get out ! CARL...!

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that
		to me.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Don't be afraid. Can't do humans... yet.
		C'mon let's go.

	Carl, puts up more cards, Johnny misses them all.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for
		Starside R&amp;D ?

<b>				CARL
</b>		Passport to the Universe.
		Who wouldn't want that ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I've been thinking about applying for 
		Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Your father will never let you.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd 
		make a pretty good pilot. I've good great
		reflexes. You need that for maneuvering,
		you know.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through
		stellar navigation.
		So what do you think your chances are ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Eight point... no, uh, seven...

<b>				CARL
</b>		If you can't do those numbers, you haven't
		got a chance.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, 
		and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. 
		Now try and pay attention.

	Carl puts a card up.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Queen of hearts.

	The computer indicates a match. Johnny peers around at the monitor.
	It is the Queen of hearts.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Well, what do you know about that !

<b>13	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - STANDS - DAY - CARMEN
</b>
	and other students wearing orange and black sing the "Uni High Song".
	The SCOREBOARD says:	REGIONAL FINAL.
	Across the field, fans wear red and gold and sing another song.

<b>14	INT	LOCKER ROOM - DAY - JOHNNY
</b>
	and other UNI HIGH TIGERS, all exceptionally robust young man and women,
	suit up in their orange and black uniforms.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Tesla's tough. They tumble good and they
		hit HARD.

	Dizzy bounces a JUMP SHOE to Johnny. The spring fires and vaults it high into
	the air. Johnny catches it, puts it on, smiles cocky at the TESLA GIANTS who
	suit up in red and gold.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		We tumble good, too.

<b>15	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY - WHAM ! -- TIGERS AND GIANTS 	
</b>
collide. Powered by jump shoes, the play is gymnastic. Johnny moves the ball ,
flips high in the air over the Giant defensive line, makes ten meters before he is
brought down.

<b>16	EXT	STANDS - DAY - THE CROWD
</b>
	cheers as Johnny runs back to join his team. He sees Carmen waving, glad that
	Johnny has seen her among all the people.

<b>17	EXT	HUDDLE - DAY - JOHNNY
</b><b>	
</b>	and other Tigers listen as quarterback Dizzy calls the plays.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Kick three, fade left. On two.

	They make fists, then breal for thevline of scrimmage.

<b>18	EXT	SCRIMMAGE LINE - DAY - THE TIGERS
</b><b>	
</b>	have the ball. The Giant's QUARTERBACKassigns ZANDER BARCALOW, 18,
	handsome, super-confident, to guard Johnny.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Time's running out.

	Zander points. The SCOREBOARD shows	TIGERS 19,	GIANTS 20,
	three minutes and counting on the clock. Johnny grins.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		A lot can happen in three minutes.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Hut... hut !

	Johnny takes the handoff, flips over a gauntlet of Giant guards. Zander
	hurls himself at Johnny, misses. Johnny scores.
	Zander tumbles into the crowd, loses a jump shoe.

<b>19	EXT	SIDELINES - DAY-ZANDER
</b>
	looks up and sees Carmen, smiling as she offers him a hand. She helps
	him up. He holds her hand longer than necessary.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Are you alright ?

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		I'm getting better.

<b>20	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY - JOHNNY
</b>
	runs back to join his team as the crowd cheers. The Tigers lead 
	21-20. Johnny frowns when he sees Carmen talking to Zander on 
	the sidelines, shaking his head, smiling.

<b>21	EXT	SIDELINE - DAY - ZANDER
</b>
	finds his shoe, straps it on.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		So what are you doing later ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian.
		I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

	Zander heads for the field. Carmen follows, interested.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		You're going to the Academy ?
		That's where I want to go. I'd love
		to talk to you abou that.

	A REFEREE blows his whistle at Zander, signalling impatiently.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		I'm all ears.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Don't you have to finish the game ?

<b>22	EXT	SCRIMMAGE LINE - DAY-THE GIANTS
</b>
	are in possession. Zander lands hard in front of Johnny.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		You can never be sure.

	Johnny scowls at Zander, turns his head to look back at Carmen.
	She waves, smiling. The Giants pull ablitz.

<b>				DIZZY
</b><b>		WATCH THE BLITZ...!
</b>
	Zander knocks Johnny on his ass, and the Giants score. It's
	TIGERS 21, GIANTS 22 and less than a minute to go.

<b>23	EXT	HUDDLE -- DAY -- DIZZY
</b>
	orders up the next play. Johnny keeps looking over his shoulder
	because Zander's back talking to Carmen again.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Flip six, three hole. Rico ?
		Hey !

	Dizzy slams Johnny upside his helmet with her forearm.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		What ?

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		You were drifting. Flip six, three hole.
		On one, got it ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Just throw me the ball, Diz.

	They make fists and break.

<b>24	EXT	SCRIMMAGE LINE -- DAY -- JOHNNY
</b>
	takes position again across the line from Zander who now grins at
	Johnny broadly. Johnny  doesn't grin back. 

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Hut !

	At the snap, Johnny breaks for open field. Dizzy throws, Johnny catches
	it, trips Zander up painfully, and hurls himself into the end zone as a
	horn sounds the game's finish.

<b>25	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY - CHEERING UNI FANS
</b>
	rush onto the field as the school band strikes up a victory march.
	Tigers do flips in the air. Giants look dejected. 
	Zander picks himself up, watches Johnny leave with Carmen.

<b>26	INT	JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - JOHNNY
</b>
	walks throuh rooms filled with elegant furniture. He's all spiffed up
	for the big dance. His MOTHER catches him preening in front of a
	mirror by the TRANSPORTER in the hall.

<b>				MOTHER
</b>		Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time
		I checked you were only five years old. You had
		such a bright little face...

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Aw, don't get mushy.

	Johnny's FATHER enters carrying a FEDERAL SERVICE CATALOGUE.

<b>				FATHER
</b>		This came for you today. I presume on your
		request.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...

<b>				MOTHER
</b>		You aren't thinking of applying...?

	Johnny shrugs.

<b>				FATHER
</b>		Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather
		take ten lashes in Public Square than see you
		ruin your life.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to
		get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a
		couple of years.

<b>				MOTHER
</b>		Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in
		the Federal Service. If something happened 
		to you I don't know what I would do...

<b>				FATHER
</b>		Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher.
		What's his name ? You know the one I
		mean.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Mr. Rasczak.

<b>				FATHER
</b>		Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be
		a law against using a school as a 
		recruiting station !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all.
		He sorta discourages you really.

<b>				FATHER
</b>		Good, because you're going to Harvard,
		and that's the end of it.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I'm eighteen. It's my decision.

<b>				FATHER
</b>Oh, is that how it is ?

<b>				MOTHER
</b>		Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise
		for you that will settle this.
		Can you guess what it is ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Uh, no.

<b>				FATHER
</b>		A trip to the Outer Rings.
		Whad'ya think of that ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've
		always wanted to go there.

<b>				MOTHER		
</b>		Good good, then it's all settled.

<b>				FATHER
</b>		A year at Harvard and you'll  see this
		"Federal Service" is just menial training 
		for inferior people so they can call 
		themselves "citizens" and take airs for 
		the rest of their lives.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal
		and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest 
		kid at school !

<b>				FATHER
</b>		Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...

	Johnny puts on his jacket.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I don't know what they teach at Harvard,
		but I think I'm pretty good enough the
		way I am !
<b>	
</b><b>				MOTHER
</b>		Johnny, please. Calm yourself.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Well, that's what you're saying ! You're
		saying that I'm not good enough the way
		I am now !

	Johnny stomps out, the transporter goes ZAPPP !

<b>				MOTHER
</b>		Why did you go and do that ? He was all
		ready to go Zegema Beach !

<b>				FATHER
</b>		Teenagers !

<b>27	INT	UNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - EVERYONE

<b>				BAND LEADER
</b>		Alright, everybody, this is the last dance, so
		let's turn down the lights and make it a
		slow one.

	The lights go down. Dizzy, dressed pretty, brightens when she sees Johnny
	standing alone near the dance floor.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Too bad for her if she's not around.

	Dizzy pulls him onto the floor, holds him close.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		You know, it's sad... Most of us probably
		won't see each other again after tonight.
<b>	
</b>	There is an invitation here. Johnny doesn't take it.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		You still gonna play for Brazil ?

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		How come we never got together ?

	Dizzy looks at Johnny meaningfully. He's distracted. Carmen crosses
	the room, stunning in her formal.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Can't we just be friends, Diz ?

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Sure.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Uh, look, Diz...

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Guess you gotta go.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		You're the best.

	Johnny heads for Carmen. Dizzy watches jealously as Carmen takes 
	his hand. She looks around for someone to dance with.
	Carl, a nerd in a tux, waves shyly.

	dance. Johnny wants to kiss her, Carmen playfully avoids.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Isn't it great to be in love ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		How do I know if this is love ?
<b>	
</b><b>				JOHNNY
</b>		It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...

<b>				CARL
</b>		Outa the way you two !

	Carl and Dizzy dance by, Dizzy smiling bravely because Carl is a terrible dancer.
	Johnny goes in for the kiss again.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Romance is just a vestigial biological
		response to procreation...

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Aw, you're in love with me... 
		You just dont know it yet.

	Johnny's confidence makes her smile. Johnny moves in to kiss her,
	but the music ends. Everyone applauds. The lights come up and 
	people head for the doors. Johnny sees Rasczak.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		I'll meet you outside.

	Johnny heads over to Rasczak.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Mister Rasczak ?

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		What is it, Rico ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History
		and Moral Philosophy was the best class
		I had this year.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>			(smiling)
		Well, it's not really my job to please.
		Hope you learned something.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I
		have what it take to be a citizen.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Good for you. Go find out.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Well, my parents are against it, and I 
		know it's my choice, but I was
		wondering...
		What would you do if you were me ?

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Figuring things out for yourself is the
		only freedom anyone really has.
		Use that freedom.
		Make your own choice, Rico.

<b>29	EXT	UNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - JOHNNY
</b><b>	
</b>	walks out and finds Carmen talking with Zander. He wears the blue 
	uniform of a Fleet pilot trainee. Carmen examines his FLEET PIN,
	a pair of silver wings.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Johnny, this is Zander.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Yeah, we know each other from the game. 
		No hard feeling, eh, chum ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		None at all... We won.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Good luck at the academy.

	Zander takes back the wings and pins the to his tunic.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Always.

<b>30	EXT	PROMENADE - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN
</b>
	walk together along the river holding hands.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy.
		Isn't that great ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Yeah, sure, I guess.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a
		chance.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		What are you talking about ? We both know
		you're gonna be a pilot.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Zander is going for pilot, too.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		You two have so much in common.

	Carmen pulls Johnny to a stop, looks him in the eye.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Johnny Rico, you're jealous !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I can't help it.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		He's nothing like you.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I don't even know if you're my girl.

	Carmen smiles, leans in close to Johnny.
<b>			
</b><b>				CARMEN
</b>		Are you the boy for me ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign
		up for Federal Service.

	They kiss, tentatively, but the passion grows and they break apart,
	breathless.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Oh, Johnny...

<b>31	EXT	PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Who cares ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		You're right. Let's never stop...

</b>		Hey, you, there's a place for that !

	Without stopping, Johnny pulls Carmen into the flux.	ZAPPP !

	She takes his hand, smiling, puts it under her shirt.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I love you, Carmen.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Shhh...

	She puts her mouth on his and they melt together. The door flies open,
	and CARMEN'S DAD stands there.

<b>				CARMEN'S DAD
</b>		Carmen, it's late. Get inside.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Sorry, Dad. See you, Johnny.

	Carmen ducks inside. Her father looks Johnny over. He carries a terrible
	battle scar oon his face.

<b>				CARMEN'S DAD
</b>		I don't want you around Carmen anymore. Get me ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Maybe Carmen's gonna make her own decisions from
		now on, Mr. Ibanez.

	Carmen's Dad reddens. He'd like to punch Johnny out.
<b> 
</b><b>				CARMEN'S DAD
</b>		Carmen's gonna be a citizen. She don't need you
		and your rich family. The Federation'll give her
		everything she needs.

<b>				CARMEN (O.S.)

<b>				RECRUITING SERGEANT
</b>		Fresh meat for the grinder, eh ?

<b>				CARL
</b>		That's us. Where do we sign ?

	He turns in his chair to grab the forms. Johnny and his friends see that he is also
	missing both legs. The Recruiting Sergeant catches them looking, 
	smiles even wider.

<b>				RECRUITING SERGEANT
</b>		Here and here and here.

	As he signs, Johnny looks at the campaign ribbons on the Recruiting Sergeant's
	chest. We hear MUSIC: 	"The Mobile Infantery Anthem" plays softly in honor
	of distant battles.

<b>				RECRUITING SERGEANT
</b>		Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service.
		Follow the blue line.

<b>35	INT	PROCESSING HALL - DAY - JOHNNY, CARMEN AND CARL

	A COLONEL makes a speech over the loudspeaker.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		There is no guarantee of service. We don't need

</b>
	grimaces as a TECHNICIAN installs an INTERFACE PLATE on

</b>		Oh, this is the part that hurts !

	A PSYCH OFFICER sits down across from each candidate.

<b>				PSYCH OFFICER
</b>		No talking please. I'm going to ask you some 
		questions. Please answer all questions truthfully.
		We'll know if you don't.
		Birthplace ?

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		I'm happy to tell you that you've been

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Wow, that's great.

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		Looks like you're quite an athlete.
		Boy, look at those reaction stats.

	The Major clucks his tongue as he highlights the last category on his list:
<b>	MOBILE INFANTERY.
</b>
<b>				MAJOR
</b>		My job is to dertermine what you're
		best suited for.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I want to be a pilot, sir.

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		Sorry, son, no way. Your school records
		say you don't have the math skills.

	Johnny swallows this. He knew it was coming. The Major deletes
	"Pilot" from the list, then several other items.

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		That rules out the scientific and engineering
		applications, and I'm afraid we reserve
		non-military options for candidates who are
		frankly less able-bodied than you are, son...

	He turns the monitor around and shows Johnny the list.
	The only thing left is MOBILE INFANTERY.

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		It looks like the only thing you're good
		for is cannon fodder.
		I'm putting you down for the
		Mobile Infantery.

<b>40	INT	AUDITORIUM - DAY - CARMEN

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Naw, I made it, Carl made it.

	Just then, Don rushes past, shamefaced, crying.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		He was in the group with me.
		I guess he didn't...

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.

	The Recruiting Sergeant is getting ready to go home. He's got legs now,
	and he takes a prosthetic arm from its case and snaps it on.
	He grins when he sees them staring.

<b>				RECRUITING SERGEANT
</b>		They put me out front to discourage the weak-hearted,
		but at the end of the day I go home.
		How'd you kids do ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		I'm gonna go for pilot.

<b>				RECRUITING SERGEANT
</b>		Good for you. We need every pilot we can get.

	Johnny holds the door for Carmen and the Recruiting Sergeant. 
	Suddenly Carl appears looking a little paler than usual.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Did you get Starside R&amp;D ?

<b>				CARL
</b>		No.

<b>42	EXT	FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	Well, everyone's a little impressed by this.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Games &amp; Theory ? That's Military
		Intelligence... Oh, Carl !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !

<b>				RECRUITING SERGEANT
</b>		Next time we meet, I'll probably have to salute
		you. What about you, son ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Infantery, sir.

	The Recruiting Sergeant beams, offers a prosthetic hand.

<b>				RECRUITING SERGEANT
</b>		Well, good for you. The Mobile Infantery made me
		the man I am today.

	Just what Johnny wanted to hear. They watch the old Sergeant walk
	away.	MUSIC:	"The Mobile Infantery Theme".
	Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the arm as they walk.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always
		be friends no matter what.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I'll go for that.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Well, we're gonna be millions of light years away
		from each other, and chances are we'll never see
		each other again, but sure...

	Johnny turns for the door. His father throws his last shot.

		Alright, THAT'S IT, YOU'RE...

<b>44	INT	JOHNNY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT--JOHNNY

		Does citizenship mean so much to you ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Well, yeah, sure...

	Johnny's face reddens.

</b>		Don't talk about my girl that way.

	Johnny turns on his heel, heads for the transporter.		ZAPPP !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		You're late.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly
		he's afraid he's never gonna see me 
		again or something. It was sweet, but it
		took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready
		to go.

	At the freight station, Carmen enters her Federal I.D. card and gets
	numbered tags for her bags.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Me, too. I'm wearing everything I own.

	Johnny loads them onto a conveyor belt.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything
		I need for the next two years, right ?
<b>	
</b>	Carmen's already moved to the next line. Johnny follows.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		You talk to Carl ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		He left this morning. He couldn't say where.

	Carmen logs in, enters her destination:	LUNA - TERESHKOVA
	FLEET ACADEMY.	The tickets station spits out a pass.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		It's exciting, but it's scary, too isn't it.
		Going someplace new where you don't
know anyone.

	Carmen heads toward a bank of transporters. Johnny stops her,
	takes her by the arms.

	Kitten Smith shake his head  "no" , but he can't stifle himself.

	Shujumi steps up, assumes a fighting stance. Zim looks him over.
	There's not not much to him. Shujumi attacks Zim, counters his

<b>55	INT	MESS HALL - DAY - THE RECRUITES
</b>
	line up for mess piled four-square together on a single plate,
	meat on the bottom, ice cream on top.

<b>				ACE
</b>		I'd like to disable Zim...!

<b>				KATRINA
</b>		Improper Attitude ! They'll kick you out
		for talking like that...

<b>				DJANA'D
</b>		They can kick you out for anything.
		Improper Conduct, Unsatisfactory 
		Performance...

<b>				KITTEN SMITH
</b>		Off you go down Washout Lane, bye-bye !

	Ace cuts into the front off the mess line.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Aw, you either got what it takes
		or you don't.

<b>				DJANA'D
</b>		C'mon Ace, wait your turn !

<b>				ACE
</b>		At ease, soldier. It's all the same muck.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Better get in line like everyone else, Ace.

	Silence. There could be a fight. Zim, standing nearby, watches
	with interest. Ace opens his hand.

<b>				ACE
</b>		You got some guts for a rich kid.
		I guess you and me could be buddies.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		What an honor...

<b>				ACE
</b>		Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have
		a friend like me !

	Ace makes a big friendly show of trading places with Johnny.

<b>				BRECKINRIDGE
</b>		Come on, Ace, back off the line !
		Bacl off the line !

	Now everyone's laughing, pushing Ace to the back of the line.
	Johnny has his grub. Dizzy comes up with her tray.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Hey, amigo, come chow with me.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		No thanks, Diz.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		What's your malfunction, Rico ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		You are. I joined up to get out on my
		own. And you had to tag along.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		What ? You think I joined the Mobile
		Infantery because of you ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		You saying you didn't ?

	Johnny turns away. Dizzy watches him go, hurt.

<b>56	EXT	OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY - THE RECRUITS
</b>
	tumble down the difficult course in their power suits. At the head of
	the pack , breathing hard, Johnny and Ace race.

<b>				ACE
</b>		What makes you think... you'll make...
		squad leader, Rico ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Something... I've got...you don't.

<b>				ACE
</b>		You rich kids... are all the same !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		It isn't about rich... It's about
		who's best...!

	They come to a trap, prepare to leap.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Coming through !

	Dizzy jumps over them from behind. Johnny and Ace tumble into the mud.
	They watch, chagrined, as Dizzy reaches the end of the course effortlessly.

<b>				ZIM
</b>		C'mon, move it, you apes !

<b>57	INT	SHOWERS - NIGHT - DIZZY
</b>
	enters as the recruits scrub down.

<b>				KITTEN SMITH
</b>		We all have one thing in common. We were 
		all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile
		Infanterie. What's your excuse,
		Breckinridge ?

<b>				BRECKINRIDGE
</b>		Well, my family is all farmers. I hate farming.
		Mobile Infantery's pure picnic by comparison.

<b>				KITTEN SMITH
</b>		So the grow 'em big and dumb on the farm
		planet, eh ?	Djana'd ?

<b>				DJANA'D
</b>		I'm going in for politics. You gotta be a
		citizen for that. So here I am.

<b>				KITTEN SMITH
</b>		C'mon, keep it going... Katrina !

<b>				KATRINA
</b>		I wanna be a mom. It's easier to get
		a licence if you've served.

<b>				ACE
</b>		I'm going career... officer's training.
		That's why I wanna be squad leader.
		They look for that.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Wanting it doesn't make you the best
		one for the job.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here
		with the chops to lead.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Well, maybe you better look again.

<b>				SHUJUMI
</b>		Federation's gonna give me a scholarship
		when my hitch is up. I wanna be a
		neurologist, study brain chemisty and
		associated stimulus...

	Dizzy dresses down. Johnny and all the other guys check her out.
	She has a fabulous body. Dizzy cathes Johnny looking. He turns
	his back as she steps into the shower next to him.

<b>				KITTEN SMITH
</b>		Your turn, Rico !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Aw, who asked you to be so nosey ?

<b>				KITTEN SMITH
</b>		Me, I got plans to be writer, and a writer's
		got a right to be nosey. Flores, you know 
		Rico from Buenos Aires... What's his story ?

	Dizzy uses her hand to divert the shower spray towards Johnny's crotch.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Well, some say he turned his back on the family
		fortune to be a citizen, others say he did it for
		a girl... missed a spot there, bucko... which is 
		funny because Johnny says I joined up to be
		with him, but why would I do that ?
		He doesn't even like me.

<b>				BRECKINRIDGE
</b>		Don't look that way to me.

	Everyone look down at Johnny's crotch, laughing. Johnny
	blushes, grabs a towel and exits the shower. 

<b>58	INT BARRACKS - NIGHT - INTO CAMERA - JOHNNY
</b>
	pans the barracks with a little handcam, neat bunks in a row, other recruits
	lounging around in their skivvies.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I know it's not much, but it's home. Over
		there's my bunk where I dream about you
		every night...

Ace, Kitten Smith, Shujumi and Breckinridge dance around and moon the
	camera.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Hey, do you mind ?

	Johnny moves the camera away from the guys. Katrina walks by from the
	shower with Dizzy, mugs into frame.

<b>				KATRINA
</b>		Hey, what's going on ?

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		I bet it's that girl I was talking about...
		Her name's Carmen, I think.

<b>				ACE AND THE OTHERS
</b>		Carmen ! Ooh la la, Carmencita !

<b>				KATRINA
</b>		Hi, Carmen !

	Johnny heads for the door.

<b>				ACE AND THE OTHERS
</b>		Hey, where you going ? Come back...! He's
		getting awy... Grab him...!

	The picture goes all screwy, comes up again on:

<b>59	EXT	BARRACKS - NIGHT - INTO CAMERA - JOHNNY
</b>
	talk quietly now outside the barracks door.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Boot's pretty tough, and sometimes
		I think I won't make it, but then I
		imagine you're watching me, and that
		gives me someting... I try harder.
		Thanks to you, I think I might have 
		a shot at squad leader.

	The barracks lights go out. Taps plays over the public address.
	Johnny lowers his voice.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Uh-oh, I gotta pack it in. I hope you're
		having fun, hope you're careful.
		No training accidents for you, eh ?
			(leaning into camera)
		I want to kiss you so badly. I want
		to feel you next to me, I-

	Behind him , someone begins to sing , badly.

<b>				ACE
</b>		I love you truly, so truly, dear...!

	Ace, the singer, and the other guys peer down from the transom 
	over the door, giggling, delighted with themselves.

<b>							PULLBACK TO REVEAL:
</b>
<b>60	INT	TERESHKOVA FLIGHT ACADEMY - DAY - CARMEN
</b>
	watches the end of Johnny's letter. Ace continues to sing.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Our love will grow, dear, year by year...

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !

	The letter ends. Carmen smiles. A BALD CADET PILOT smacks her on the
	arm as she runs by in a sleek blue pressure suit.

<b>				BALD CADET
</b>		Orbit in five, Ibanez ! First one there gets
		to fly !

	Grinning, Carmen grabs her duffel, takes off after her.

<b>61	INT	BOARDING CORRIDOR - DAY - CARMEN
</b>
	and the bald cadet race for the hatch past other recruits.

<b>62	INT	BOAT - DAY CYCLE-CARMEN
</b>
	gets there first, jumps into the pilot seat. The Bald Pilot takes
	second seat.


<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Looking it down !
<b>		
</b>	Two LATE CADETS duck in through the closing hatch door.

<b>				LATE CADET
</b>		Oh no, not Ibanez again, she's crazy !

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		On my mark, in three, two, one...

<b>63	EXT	LUNAR ORBIT - THE BOAT
</b>
	straeks upward from the lunar floor past orbitting training platforms where
	CADETS in brightly colored pressure suits float against the Earth which
	hangs beyond the horizon.

<b>				CARMEN (O.S.)
</b><b>		...GO !
</b>
<b>64	INT	BOAT - LUNAR ORBIT - CARMEN
</b>
	blasts past a DESTROYER orbiting in dock, zips between CORVETTES
	and other slower fleet traffic in the crowded space lanes of Luna.
	The two late cadets are terrified.

<b>				BALD CADET
</b>		Geez, I thought I liked to fly fast !

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		This is nothing. Today, I get to fly that !

	She points. Now visible from behind a host of smaller ships,
	STARSHIP ATHENA, of older design, but impressive.

<b>65	INT	ATHENA - COMMAND AND CONTROL - DAY CYCLE - CARMEN
</b>
	arrives on the bridge, dark, cramped, all-business. She salutes the instructor,
	CAPTAIN DELADIER, 40s.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.

<b>				DELADIER
</b>		Take the number one chair, Ibanez.
		Follow all instructions of you supervisor.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Yes, ma'am !

	Carmen turns for her station, but stops in her tracks. Her supervisor is
	Zander Barcalow, now a 2nd Lieutenant.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Hey ! What are you doing here ?

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to 
		fly this crate.

	Carmen logs on. The ship recognizes her as a pilot trainee.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Assistant insructor... You must be some
		kind of a hot stick.
		Should I call you "sir" ?

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Only when I give you an order.

<b>				DELADIER
</b>		Prepare for departure.

	Carmen and Zander go to work.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		It's amazing, us running into each other
		like this. Maybe it's fate.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl
		coming through the academy, solid math,
		a little wild on the stick, but a natural.
		When it turned out it was you, I made
		sure we'd run into each other...

<b>				DELADIER
</b>		Alright, take her out, Ibanez.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Yes, ma'am.

	All eyes are on carmen as she grabs the stick. The ship shudders under
	her hand. She winks at Zander.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		In simulation, my supervisors could never
		keep up.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		This isn't simulation anymore.
		Take'er out easy, cadet.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Twenty-five by five, roll seven.
		And don't exceed port speed.

	Carmen rocks the stick, and the view from the bridge spins smoothly
	away from the dense orbiting yards os Luna toward the outer system.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Or...?

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		They revoke our flight status.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Oh, I see... teamwork.

	Carmen jogs past lumbering freighters. Zander's impressed.

<b>				DELADIER
</b>		Steady as she goes, number one.
		Prepare for warp. Number two,
		design for Jupiter orbit.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three...
		two... one...

	Space appears to bend. Zander and Carmen share a smile. They 
	blur together, becoming one, then:	WHAM !

<b>66	EXT	LUNA - STARSHIP ATHENA
</b>
	disappears in a flash of blinding light.

<b>67	EXT	WAR GAMES COURSE - DAY - THE RECRUITS
</b>
	have been divided into two teams. RED TEAM includes Ace, Katrina,
	Breckinridge, and Djana'd. Johnny, Shujumi, Kitten Smith, and Dizzy
	are part of BLUE TEAM.

<b>				ZIM
</b>		The object of this exercise is to capture
		your enemy's flag before your enemy
		captures yours.

	Bronski passes out Morita SmartRifles.

<b>				ZIM
</b>		These weapons have been modified for
		this exercise. If your enemy hits you,
		your suit will fail. You will be unable
		to move. You will be as good as dead.

<b>68	EXT	WAR GAMES COURSE - LATER - DJANA'D
</b><b>	
</b>	bumps the magnification of her heads up display to survey Blue Team's
	flag guarded by two recruits. She jumps down to joining other Red
	Team members on the move.

<b>				DJANA'D
</b>		It's right over the next ridge...
		Only two guards.

	Johnny, Kitten Smith, and Dizzy open fire from athicket as they pass.
	Djana'd and the others collapse as their suits fail, Djana'd laughing
	because playing at war seems funny.

<b>				KITTEN SMITH
</b>		You are now prisoners of the Blue Team.
		Tell us your plans or die !

<b>				DJANA'D
</b>		Oh no ! Name, rank, and mind your own
		business is all you get from me !

<b>69	EXT	RED TEAM FLAG - DAY - RED TEAM
</b>
	opens fire as the Blue Team appears. Shujumi and other Blue Team members
	go down in an ambush led by Breckinridge. Johnny dives for cover, and finds
	himself sharing it with Dizzy.

<b>				KITTEN SMITH
</b>		I'm going in ! Let's go !

	Kitten Smith makes arun for the flag with a rifle team. Ace and Katrina open 
	fire from two new hidden Red Team positions, taking Kitten and his team
	down with a cross fire.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Man, they're defended... no way in.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Flip six, three hole.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		What ?

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		High school... remember ? Run a flip
		six, three hole play, and you might
		score...

	Johnny looks at the course in a new way, nods.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Cover me.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		You got it.

	Johnny tumbles open ground, vaults into the air. Dizzy takes out Breckinridge
	as he rises to fire. Johnny lands, knocks out Katrina, then Ace. He picks up
	Ace's fallen Morita.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Thanks, pal.

<b>70	EXT	OBSERVATION TOWER - DAY - ZIM AND CORPORAL BRONSKI
</b>
	watch Johnny firing both Moritas simultanously and taking out the remaining
	Red Team defenders. He grabs the Red Team flag and hurls it into the air like spear.

<b>				ZIM
</b>		Kid's got some moves...

<b>71	INT	AIRBORNE SKIMMER - DAY - THE RECRUITS
</b>
	line up in the door of a SKIMMER, the military's standard utility aircraft,
	to practice drops from altitude.

		Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Sir, thank you, sir !

<b>				ZIM
</b>		Don't stand there dumb... GO !

	Johnny jumps, plummeting toward the earth.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		YEEEE-Haaaaaaaaaaaaa...!

	Next in line, Ace scowls.

<b>72	INT	BARRACKS - NIGHT - THE RECRUITS
</b>
	have some free time. Johnny makes a big show of polishing the chevrons
	that designate him as Squad Leader.

<b>				KITTEN SMITH
</b>		Look at him. Do you think anyone has
		ever been so pleased with himself ?

<b>				ACE
</b>		Zim hadda choose someone to be
		his brown nose, I guess.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I just want you guys to know that I'll
		never do anything that I haven't asked
		you to do first.

	Johnny approaches Dizzy.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Couldn't've done it without you, Diz.
		Friends ?

	Dizzy smiles, shakes.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Yeah, sure... friends.

	Bronski walks through with the mail.

<b>				BRONSKI
</b>		Levy... Shujumi... Rico.

	Johnny grabs the E-disk, pops it into his handcam. The Fleet Mail logo appears:
<b>	APPROVED MESSAGE
</b>
<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Bet it's from my girl.

	Johnny's pals gather for a look. Carmen appears, dressed down to skivvies, 
	in her quarters aboard starship Athena.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Hi, Johnny, I would've written sooner,
		but they've really got us going every 
		moment here.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Yeow, Rico, you don't deserve that !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Shhhh...!

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		I'm glad you're doing so well. If they 
		haven't made you squad leader by now,
		I'm sure you will.

	Johnny holds up his squad leader chevrons victoriously.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		All it takes is the love of a good woman...

	The image changes abrupltly. Now Carmen's wearing a trim blue flight suit.
	She stands the camera on Athena's gunnery deck. Outside , the rings of
	Saturn sparkle in bright solar light.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Look at that. Isn't it beautiful ? I had 
		to show you. It's great to be out here on
		my own. I'm just not some little girl from
		Buenos Aires anymore. I'm gonna be a
		starship pilot, and I'm gonna see the
		universe...
			(she sighs)
		And that's also the problem because I
		don't really want to get married,
		Johnny. I don't want to have kids.
		I want a command, a ship of my own,
		and you know, I don't think that's 
		gonna leave a lot of room for you and
		me.

	Johnny is stunned. All the other recruits suddenly seem to have 
	something else to do.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		I know that's not what you wanted to hear...
		but I have to follow my heart. I'm sorry.
		I'm afraid you'll hate me, and I couldn't
		stand that. Write me, alright ? Write me,
		so I'll know that we'll always be friends.

	The Fleet Mail logo appears again:	END OF MESSAGE. Johnny
	shuts the handcam off. Ace puts a hand on his shoulder.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Funny how they always want to be your friends
		after they kick your guts out.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		It's what I deserve.
<b>	
</b><b>				ACE
</b>		Whad'ya talkin  about ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I joined up for her. I wouldn't even 
		be here if it wasn't for her.
		I'm a fool.

<b>				ACE
</b>		You made squad leader on your own,
		and, hey, you still got me to kick 
		around.

	Johnny smiles in spite of himself.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Thanks, Ace.

	Johnny turns for the door, flipping the chevrons like a coin.
	Dizzy watches him leave. She'd so like to comfort him.

<b> 73	EXT	LIVE FIRE COMBAT RANGE - DAY - THE RECRUITS
</b>
	arm their Marauder power suits. Zim and Bronski wear Command model suits
	with rank designations. Johnny checks weapons, scans the electronics on 
	each squad member's power suit.

<b>				ZIM
</b>		With the Marauder's visual capabilities,
		all you have to do is look at something
		to hit it, so you will exercise EXTREME
		CARE on my firing line.
		Do you get me ?

<b>				RECRUITS
</b>		Sir, yes, sir !

<b>				ZIM
</b>		The live firing combat range is the 
		closest simulation of actual combat
		we can provide. If you do not hit 
		your target, it will shoot you...

	Fifty blackened AUTOMATED TARGET DRONES fitted with pulse guns
	are presently visible along a gauntlet of low walls, gullies, and three-story
	building facades.

<b>				ZIM
</b>		The Marauder power suit will prevent
		serious injury, but if you are hit, you
		will be non-operational and your team 
		score will suffer accordingly. Rico,
		has each member of your squad completed
		a weapons safety check ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Sir, yes, sir !

	On a signal from Zim, the Live Fire Combat Range comes to life
	as the target drones take cover and disappear from view.

<b>				ZIM
</b>		Perfect score for this exercise is 300.
		B company came through last week
		with 285. I expect you to do better.

<b>74	EXT	LIVE FIRE COMBAT RANGE - DAY - THE RECRUITS
</b>
	take out the target drones as they appear. Halfway through the course,
	a recruit takes a hit and goes down, immobilized. Djana'd has a clear
	shot, but Breckinridge gets in her way.

<b>				DJANA'D
</b>		You're in my line of fire, Breckinridge

	Before the others can react, a second drone appears.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b><b>		CROSSFIRE ! EVERYBODY DOWN !
</b>
	Everyone kisses dirt. Pulses from the two drones fly thick overhead.
	Shujumi rises to fire, a round slams him back to the ground.
	Johnny and Djana'd knock out the two drones.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Alright, no more screw ups. Ace takes
		point. Diz, you and Kitten Smith cover
		the flanks. Djana'd, you're rear guard.
		Move out.

	The squad resumes ist advance. Breckinridge bangs on his helmet.
	There is something wrong with his "head up" display.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		What's the problem ?

<b>				BRECKINRIDGE
</b>		Dunno. Display's fritzed.

<b>				DJANA'D
</b>		Lose another rifle, we're gonna mess up
		our score...
<b>			
</b><b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Let me see.

	Breckinridge takes off helmet, hands it to Johnny. Djana'd turns on
	Breckinridge. Her "head up" zeroes him.

<b>				DJANA'D
</b>		How come when something goes wrong,
		it's always you, Breckinridge ?

	That's when Djana'd trips on a loose stone. She fumbles her rifle and
	it discharges. The round tears the top of Breckinridge's head off.
	The recruits stare in horror.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Oh, God... uh... MEDIC !

	Zim arrives with Bronski on the bounce.

<b>				ZIM
</b>		Rico, you are relieved of squad command.
		Levy, McIntire you will escort private Rico
		to the C.O.'s Office.

	The recruits watch Johnny leave, stare aghast at their dead comrade.
	No one looks at Djana'd, who stands alone sobbing.

<b>75	INT	C.O.'S OFFICE - DAY - JOHNNY
</b>
	stands before the C.O. braced by Katrina and Ace. Zim and the C.O.  are
	both saddened by the proceedings.

<b>				C.O.
</b>		Rico, did you give the recruit permission
		to remove his helmet ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a
		helmet malfunction, and I asked him
		to show it to me, sir.

<b>				C.O.
</b>		Are you rated to repair a Marauder
		power suit, Rico ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Sir, no, sir.

<b>				C.O.
</b>		Then why did you order your man to 
		remove his helmet during a live fire
		exercise ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Sir, I needed everyone in my squad
		operational, sir... I... I wanted to win,
		sir.

<b>				C.O:
</b>			(sigh)
		You disobeyed safety regulation 21-404.
		You may, of course, demand trial by 
		court martial.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Sir, no, sir !

<b>				C.O.
</b>		Do you freely admit to the charges
		made against you ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Sir... I guess I do, sir.

	Zim looks out the window. Djana'd, dressed for travel, in civilian clothes,
	crying as she heads off down Washout Lane.

<b>				C.O.
</b>		Sergeant, we've lost two recruits
		over this incident already...
		is there any possibility of salvaging
		this man ?

				Zim
		I believe so, sir.

<b>				C.O.
</b>		Alright. We'll try administrative
		punishment. Until then you are 
		confined to your quarters, Rico.

<b>76	INT	BARRACKS - SUNSET - JOHNNY
</b>
	looks out the window to the parade ground where a POST has been
	erected. The recruits look up as Zim enters.

<b>				ZIM
</b>		Alright, let's go, Rico.

	Johnny takes off his shirt. Ace who now holds the chevrons of squad
	leader, watches, feels bad for his pal.

<b>77	EXT	PARADE GROUND - SUNSET - THE RECRUITS
</b>
	stand with recruits from other platoons. Johnny is led to the post and 
	strung up as the C.O. reads the charge.

<b>				C.O.
</b>		For incompetence of command, for
		failure to abide by safety regulations
		in a live fire exercise, for negligence 
		which contributed to the death of a
		teammate...

	Zim steps up to Johnny, offers him a red rubber mouthpiece.

<b>				ZIM
</b>		Bite on this. It helps. I know.

<b>				C.O.
</b>		... recruit trainee John Rico is sentenced
		to administrative punishment. Ten lashes.

	Johnny takes it in his mouth. His tear away shirt is torn away. Johnny
	stands at the post alone. Corporal Bronski, a big man with an unhappy
	task, unrolls his whip.

<b>				C.O.
</b>		You may carry out the sentence.

<b>				BRONSKI
</b>		One.
<b>	
</b>	CRACK !	Johnny's face wrenched by pain, spontanous tears, a terrible
	sound stifled by the bright red mouthpiece.

</b>		Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you

	He caresses her hair. She kisses his hand. Zander notices the plot map.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Profile's wrong... there.

</b>		No, I replotted the course. It's more
		efficient this way.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Three weeks aboard a starship and you

</b>		Hey, check it.

	Zander slides into his chair, runs a check.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		You know I was talking to Captain,

</b>		Don't change the subject. Am I right ?

</b>		Well, whad'ya know...

</b>		Carmen... ?

	Johnny remembers himself, snaps to attention, salutes. Dizzy and the others 
	follow suit. Carmen salutes back, sheepish.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Oh... at ease. Guess I oughta lose the hat
		when I'm off duty, eh ?

	Dizzy, disgusted, turns back to Ace and Kitten Smith. Carmen tucks her hat
	under her arm. Her hair is very short.

		we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?

</b>		Zander, you remember Johnny ?

</b>		I get it. This is the part that's best
		for both of us.
		Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?

	Johnny turns to leave.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Johnny, wait...

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery
		does a thankless, dirty job, so they 
		naturally tend to be short-tempered,
		thoughtless and rude.

	Johnny turns back to face Zander.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		You got something to say about the

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		You heard me. Wanna make something
		out of it, private ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Not with an officer, no, sir.

	bleeding. Ace and Kitten Smith grab Johnny.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Whoa, easy there, buddy... Nice punch.

	Zander staggers to his feet, ready to fight, but Fleet Officers pull him
	back. Carmen looks at Johnny, the hate in his eye, the blood on his fist.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		What's wrong with you ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Hey, it's just a vestigal response to 
		procreation... bitch.

	Carmen turns away, stung. Johnny immediately regrets. Dizzy,

		completely lethal. You can blow a limb off...

	Carl picks up apulse gun and blows one of the bugs legs off.
	The insect screams.

<b>				CARL
</b>		... and it's still 86% combat effec-tive.
		But here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem
		and put it down for good.

	Carl fires again. The bug kicks and squeals as it dies.
	Carl tosses the pulse gun aside.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Now while you are out killing bugs,
		we want you to be our eyes and ears.
		The bugs use some kind of plasma burst
		to divert meteors and aim them toward Earth.

	repel the invasion.

</b>		It's a general retreat ! The boats are
		coming down.

	They come to the rear lines where the Net Correspondent and his
	CAMERAMAN are doing live coverage of the invasion.

</b>		We've just landed here on what cap troopers 
		are calling the "Big K" with the 6th Mobile

	A hopper pounces on Kitten Smithm, and he goes down screaming.

	Johnny touches down, stares in horror as Kitten Smith's head rolls past his 
	fee. Johnny opens up with his pulse cannon. The hopper attacks, puts a claw
	right through Johnny's thigh.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b><b>		AAAAAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
	Crushing jaws close around him, crushing, cutting his flesh. Johnny brings the muzzle
	of the pulse gun under the hopper's nerve stem and SPLAT !	blows its head apart.

		JOHNNY !	Johnny...!

	But Dizzy can't find Johnny, and soon she's lost in the smoke. Johnny looks
	down at the terrible hole in his leg where bright arterial blood gushes.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Medic... MEDIC...!

	Now two more Arachnid warriors close in on him through the enveloping
	smoke. He fires his pulse rifle empty, and dropping it, crawls desperately,
	dragging his useless leg.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Oh, God... Oh, God, help me...

	A third Arachnid warrior rears up in front of him, deadly jaws slashing down

	A low underwater KNOCKING wakes him. He opens his eyes and sees
	Ace and Dizzy outside the tank.

	Ace holds up a KIA list, pointing at Johnny's name, laughing: Rico, John V - KIA.
	Their voices are distant and garbled. Dizzy cups her hands against the side of the

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Two more days.

	Johnny's wounds are now mostly scars except for his leg where delicate robotic
	arms culture layers of new tissue. Johnny gives a weak thumbs up. The knocking

	Johnny turns. A STEEL HAND taps the side of the tank. Johnny grins, astonished.
	The man wearing it is his former high school teacher, now a Lieutenant, Jean Rasczak.

	They size up the Roughnecks. There are scars, power prosthetics, and one,

	Dizzy looks her over. Not too big, but she's tough.

<b>				DIZZY

	Ace jumps up, ready to fight, but other Roughnecks block him.

	He points at Johnny's earring with his steel hand.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Get rid of the jewelry. I hate it.
		Welcome to the Roughnecks.

	consumes the landscape.

	Bugs scream as they twist and kick in the wall of flame. Heat melts the dirt into 
	dark glass. Ash turns the sky red. The out of the smoke come Rasczak and his

	fire their gas rounds.

	Johnny drops an H.E. round, and they're in the air when the explosion collapses

	crawling over the dead, and now, trudging up out of the ground, comes a
<b>	TANKER BUG.

	The tanker bug starts to spray, creating a toxic perimeter around the hole.
	Rasczak arrives just as Birdie takes a chemical hit, falling to ground minus
	an arm, screaming.

<b>				BIRDIE
</b><b>		AAAAAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
	Johnny jumps, landing behind the tanker bug in the mouth of the hole. It turns 
	with surprising speed. Johnny flips up onto its back, cracks its armor with his
	pulse cannon.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Sugar, in for pick up !

	Rasczak and Sugar Watkins pull Birdie to safety. Johnny fires a rocket into 
	the hole he's made in the tanker bug's back, and jumps clear. KA-WHAP !
	The big bug explodes.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Gas that hole and close it !

	The Roughnecks fire gas rockets into the bug hole. Johnny touches down
	beside Rasczak.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?

	Rasczak turns away, gives Birdie prosthetic thumps up as she is carried past
	to meet an arriving skimmer.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Don't worry, Birdie, your next arm comes
		with a factory guarantee !

	Dizzy and Ace gather around Johnny, clap him on the back.

	Tac Fighters reel by over head. WOMP ! Suddenly, BUG PLASMA shoots skyward
	from the flatlands below. Several Tac Fighters are blown out of the air.
	Flaming debris rains down.

</b>		Saddle up, Roughnecks. That's

	Roughnecks head out on the bounce.

<b>126	EXT	TANGO URILLA - RIDGE - DAY - JOHNNY

	and the others look down a sheer cliff on the bug battery, a charred circular
	pit some ten meters across. Inside, something is moving.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		What kind of stinkin' bug is that ?

	Johnny jumps the magnification on his "head up". Down in the pit, a giant
	translucent PLASMA BUG rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels
	that ring the battery.

<b>				SUGAR WATKINS
</b>		You never seen how they do it before ?

	Johnny shakes his head. Swollen BREEDER BUGS gather around the 
	plasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Agghh ! It's making me sick...!

	The plasma bug writhes in pain and begins to swell, color changing from
	yellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction.

<b>				SUGAR WATKINS
</b>		It's gonna pop !

	WOMP ! The plasma bug explodes in its cauldron. A blast of bug plasma
	streaks past them towards the heavens. Now a new plasma bug crawls into
	the pit to begin the cycle anew.

<b>				GILLESPIE
</b>		Sir, look !

	Sergeant Gillespie points. A hole opens near the battery and dozens of warriors
	rampage out of the ground and up the cliff face toward the Roughneck position.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		We must be right over the colony.
		Let's get some air support, eh ?

</b>		Heat it up.

	Dizzy activates a tactical nuke. It makes a distinctive HIGHPITCHED SQUEAL.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Roughnecks, you may fire at will.

	The Roughnecks open fire. Bugs are blown to pieces but they keep climbing. A 
	warrior breeches their line. Sugar Watkins torches it. The nuke's ready light flashes.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		I'm hot, sir !

<b>				RASCZAK
</b><b>		FIRE ! BLAST SHIELDS DOWN !
</b>
	Johnny blows a warrior away from the edge. Dizzy leans over and fires. The rocket 
	streaks down toward the battery.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b><b>		HIT THE DIRT !
</b>
	An explosion in the two kiloton range turns the world black and white. When color
	returns Johnny and the others look down on the smoldering crater which was once the 
	bug battery.

<b>				GILLESPIE

	dead cap troopers strewn over the complex.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Jeez, Command really humped the bunk
		on this one...

	Rasczak turns away. Roughnecks engage in the sport of methodically
	killing the workers.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Rico, you're acting Sergeant now.
		My last Sergeant lost the com pack.
		Put together a search team and find
		the radio shack.
		We need retrieval.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Yes, sir.

<b>138	INT	4TH BRIGADE HQ - OFFICE COMPLEX - DAY - JOHNNY

	surveys the aftermath of the last stand with Rasczak, insect and human dead
	everywhere.

<b>				DIZZY (O.S.)
</b>		It's here, sir.

<b>139	INT	COMMINICATIONS - DAY - RASCZAK AND JOHNNY
</b>
	enter the radio room. A DEAD MAJOR is slumped over the console with
	hole in the back of his head. Johnny checks the equipment. 
	It' dead, too.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Diz, see what you can do.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		I'm on it !

	Dizzy goes to work. Rasczak checks the wound in the back of the dead major's
	head.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		What's that look like to you, Rico ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.

<b>				ACE (O.S.)
</b>		Lieutenant, I think you're gonna
		wanna see this, sir.

<b>140	INT	MESS HALL - DAY - A BUG HOLE
</b>
	in the middle of the floor is surrounded by carnage.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Dirty bugs came in right when they 
		were having chow !

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Gas that hole and seal it.

	Then they hear a sound. Tap tap tap. Rasczak signals for quiet. Tap tap tap tap.
	It's coming from the kitchen.

<b>141	INT	KITCHEN - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS
</b>
	enter cautiously. The noise is coming from a freezer. Ace stands ready to fire.
	Johnny levers open the door, jumps back as GENERAL OWEN, 60, tumbles out
	face first.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Officer on the deck, sir.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Pick up the general !

	Roughnecks prop him up. General Owen tries to talk, but no words come out.
	Rasczak bends down to listen.

<b>				GENERAL OWEN
</b>		Get out... you gotta get me out...!

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		General Owen, sir ?

	The old man grins, hugely relieved.

<b>				GENERAL OWEN
</b>		At ease, Lieutenant. Thank God for you,
		for all of you...this is grand...
		so where's the boat ?

<b>142	INT	COMMUNICATIONS - HALLWAY - DAY - JOHNNY AND RASCZAK
</b>
	help the old General, now wrapped in a blanket, rambling.

<b>				GENERAL OWEN
</b>		I was forced to hide, of course. The security
		of the Federation in this theater of operations
		was at stake !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Diz, what's with the uplink ?

	Dizzy lokks up from where she is working on the radio controls.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		Workin on it...!

<b>				GENERAL OWEN
</b>		They get in your mind... they make you do
		things ! Look here... They did it to Farley...!

	He points at the hole of the dead major's head.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		The distress call... The bugs wanted us 
		to rescue you...!

<b>				GENERAL OWEN
</b>		Oh, you can be sure of it ! They were
		biding their time... waiting for the most
		opportune moment !

	Rasczak's lost interest in the general. He's on the com.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		To all Roughnecks, this is Rasczak.
		Prepare for attack. Repeat. We are
		going to be attacked...!

<b>				GENERAL OWEN
</b>		They weren't gonna do it to me.
		Oh no ! I know too many secrets !

	Rasczak looks at General Owen with contempt.

<b>				SUGAR WATKINS (O.S.)
</b>		Fire in the hole !

	An explosion in the mess hall closes the bug hole.

<b>143	EXT	OFFICE COMPLEX - DAY - GENERAL OWEN
</b>
	blinks as he steps out into the light. Roughnecks snap to attention. 
	General Owen looks at the carnage that was once his command and
	begins to keen, collapsing to his knees.

<b>				GENERAL OWEN
</b>		Oh God...! My soldiers...! All of my
		boys and girls...!

	The Roughnecks are shocked. They've never seen a general break down before.
	Lieutenant Rasczak slaps Owen hard.

<b>				LT. RASCZAK
</b>		Shut up ! Your soldier's dead and
		you're not !

<b>				GENERAL OWEN
</b>		I know... I wish you'd shoot me...

<b>				LT. RASCZAK
</b>		I oughta !

	And it looks like Rasczak just might, but just then Ace touches down
	next to Johnny and Rasczak.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Lieutenant, we got trouble !

<b>144	EXT	RAMPARTS - DAY - RASCZAK
</b>
	and Johnny join other stunned Roughnecks to see THOUSANDS OF BUGS on
	the march from every direction. Bug batteries open up in the distance.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Warm it all up ! Everything you got !
		Levy, collect the big guns from the 
		towers. Watkins, put General Owen 
		with the wounded. Rico, where's my 
		communications ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		What's going on, Diz ?

<b>				DIZZY (O.S.)
</b>		I got power ! Gimme a minute !

	Johnny runs for the communications room.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		We don't have a minute !

<b>145	INT	COMMUNICATIONS - DAY - DIZZY
</b>
	has the board up. Outside the battle has begun. Nukes go WOMP ! and
	pulse guns chatter.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>			What frequency ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>			All bands.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>			Roughneck patrol to battle group...
			Roughneck patrol to battle group...

<b>				RODGER YOUNG (O.S.)
</b>			This is Rodger Young... What's going
			on down there ? We're taking plasma !
			We have Orion P-11 as clear !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>			SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !

<b>				RODGER YOUNG (O.S.)
</b>			What is your position ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>			Landing zone is extremely hostile.
			Come down on this transmission !

<b>				RODGER YOUNG (O.S.)
</b>			Inside 4th brigade compound ?
			That's crazy !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>			Then I hope you have a crazy 
			pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !

	Johnny races out the door.

<b>146	EXT	4TH BRIGADE HQ - DAY - THE COMPOUND
</b>
	is white hot as Roughnecks on the walls unload nukes. Johnny crosses 
	the compound, lands next to Rasczak on the wall.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Boat coming down, sir !

	The Roughnecks stop firing as they run out of nukes.

<b>				ROUGHNECKS
</b>		I'm empty...all nuked out... Me, too !

	Johnny scans the battlefield. Nukes have turned the surface into dark glass.
	Now, out of the smoke, come the bugs, steaming glass cracking beneath 
	millions of marching feet.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Not enough, I guess.

	Sugar Watkins sees Genera Owen in the compound below,
	stumbling aimlessly among his dead soldiers.

<b>				SUGAR WATKINS
</b>		General ! GENERAL, stay with the wounded...
		Sir, the general...!

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Ah, the hell with him...

	Hoppers sweep into the compound. The Roughnecks open fire. General Owen
	make easy pickings for ones that get through.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Fall back... form a circle ! If no 
		living bug comes over that wall,
		we cannot be harmed.

	Dizzy arrives on thr bounce as the Roughnecks fall back into the compound.
	Bugs pile in over the walls. The circle affords them 360 degrees of kill zone.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Rico, Flores, Watkins, Levy ! We 
		control the sky until retrieval !

<b>				JOHNNY ET AL
</b>		Yes, sir !

	Rasczak, Sugar Watkins, Johnny and Dizzy stand back-to-back in the center
	of the circle, sweeping the skies with the heavy guns from the towers.
	Hoppers are blown to pieces.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Getting low here, sir !

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		300 rounds and counting, sir !

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Make every shot count !

	Johnny looks up. A RETRIEVAL BOAT hurtles down through bursts of 
	bug plasma, takes a grazing hit, rights itself with retros and lands within 
	the circle. Roughnecks cheer, saved !

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Sergeant, secure the boat !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Yes, sir !

	Roughnecks move to protect the boat. The hatch blows open.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Board the wounded !

	Dead bugs ring the compound walls, forming ramps for living insect
	soldiers to enter the compound in greater numbers.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Move to retrieval on my command !
		First group, now...!

	The circle shrinks as Roughnecks fall back and board the boat.
	More and more bugs pile in over the compound walls.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Alright, Flores ! Levy ! Rico...!

	Suddenly, the ground collapses under Rasczak. He falls in to his waist,
	vomits blood as something chews on him from below.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b><b>		AAAAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Cover us, Ace !

	Ace and the others fire from the boat. Johnny and Dizzy fire at the ground
	around Rasczak. Rasczak stops screaming. They try to pull him free.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Hit your jets, sir !

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		I can't My legs are gone...
		Get on the boat...

	The compund wall collapses. A wave of bugs charges in.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet.
		I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at
		the same time...

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		We're not leaving you here, sir !

	Weakly, Rasczak picks up his pulse gun, checks the power.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		This is my farm. Get on the boat,
		NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Give'em hell, sir !

	Johnny and Dizzy run for the boat. Rasczak opens fire, picking his shots,
	but soon the bugs are all over him.

<b>				RASCZAK
</b>		C'mon you sons of bitches !
		There's no bug alive can kill a
		real mAAAAAAA !

	At the boat, Dizzy turns to look back at Rasczak. A hopper swoops
	down on Dizzy, it's claws ripping into her abdomen.

<b>				DIZZY
</b><b>		AAAAAAA ! GET IT OFF ME 
</b><b>		GET IT OFF GET IT OFF 
</b><b>		GET IT AAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
	Johnny blows the bug off her back. Blood sprays from a deep gash in 
	her neck. Johnny picks her up, tries to stop the blood with his hand.
	The life is leaving her eyes.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Hang on, Diz... don't die on me...

	A TANKER BUG breaches the broken wall. Ace jumps out to help his
	friends. The hatch closes just as the tanker bug sprays. The boat blasts
	off, dripping metal.

<b>147	INT	CARGO BAY - DAY - JOHNNY
</b>
	holds Dizzy in his arms, drenched in her blood, fighting G-forces as the 
	boats heads for orbit.

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		I bought the farm, didn't I,
		Johnny ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !

<b>				DIZZY
</b>		It's alright 'cause I got to have you,
		Johnny...

	MEDICS push Johnny aside, go to work on Dizzy.

<b>148	INT	BOAT - COCKPIT - DAY - JOHNNY
</b>
	slams into the cockpit. Out the front screen, violent bursts of BUG PLASMA
	fill the sky as they break atmosphere.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Get on the com and tell Fleet to
		glass that rock...!

	The co-pilot turns around. It's Zander. His eyes narrow.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		On whose authority, Corporal ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		This would be mine, sir. Acting 
		Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed
		command on this mission.

	The pilot turns around. It's Carmen.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Johnny...! I thought you were dead !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are.
		Glass the planet !

	Johnny leaves. Carmen punches up Fleet Command.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Rodger Young, this is inbound shuttle
		De Ruyter with an official request from
		the Mobile Infantery to bombard
		Planet P-11...

<b>149	INT	BOAT - CARGO BAY - DAY - JOHNNY
</b><b>	
</b>	returns to Dizzy's side as the medics struggle to save her. Blood pours
	out of her mouth. Her body thrashes.

<b>				DIZZY
</b><b>		JOHNNY HEH HEH CAN'T HEH
</b><b>		BREATHE GOD JOHNNY CAN'T
</b><b>		HEH HEH HEH HEH...!
</b>
	Dizzy dies. A Medic slaps her. Her head lolls, mouth open, eyes blank.
	They drop her and move on to the next casualty. Johnny sits there,
	stunned. Carmen enters from the cockpit.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Negative on your request. Fleet 
		Command has the battle group 
		on standby...

		Carmen sees Dizzy lying dead on the deck.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		...I'm sorry.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		We gotta choke on the mud and the
		blood and Fleet can't be bothered to
		spit.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		No, I think something's up. The Sky
		Marshall's here.

	She points out for a viewing port. Johnny looks. Fifteen battle groups, 
	100 ships strong, lay off Planet P, all of them dwarfed by the Sky
	Marshall's flagship, Buenos Aires.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		I thought you were KIA, Johnny...

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		That was just a mix up.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		You look so... I don't know, you 
		look like you've really been in it.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		What happened to your eye ?

	Carmen touches the scar over her eye.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Almost got knocked out of the sky 
		over Big K.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I like it. It's kinda...you.

<b>150	EXT	BATTLE GROUP - ORION SYSTEM - THE BOAT

	mirror, touches thr scar over her eye, smiles.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Where are you going ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		A funeral.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		That girl who died on the way up
		...his girl ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		How do you feel about him now ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		I don't know, Zander.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		I do.

<b>152	INT	RODGER YOUNG - GUNNERY DECK - CARMEN
</b>
	enters as Johnny speaks. Dizzy is laid out in dress gray. The surviving
	Roughnecks have gathered to pay final respects.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Dizzy bought the farm. She was my
		good friend, and friens are the best 
		luck anyone gets... But in war, we must
		go on without our friends. We take
		with us their memory, and we are left
		to wonder if there is meaning in their
		death. Let me tell you what it is:
		Dizzy bough the farm so we can keep
		on fighting.

	Several INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS march into the bay.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Officer on deck !

	Everyone snaps to attention. Colonel Carl Jenkins strides into the room.
	His eyes are hollow, and he looks grim. He returns Johnny's salute, 
	nods to Carmen.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Please continue, Sergeant.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd
		want us to remember her... with a
		vengeance. So go out and kill a bug 
		for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can.
		You are her revenge, and every bug 
		you kill honors her death.

	Johnny nods to the GUNNERY CREW. They load Dizzy's body into a
	tube. Johnny steps back, salutes Dizzy. Everyone salutes.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Womb to tomb, cap trooper !

<b>				ROUGHNECKS
</b>		Womb to tomb !

	The CREW CHIEF fires the tube. Out the viewports, A PULSE OF LIGHT 
	disperses into space. The Roughnecks file out. Carl approaches.
	Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the hand.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Well, look at this. The three of us back
		together again.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		How are you, Carl ?

<b>				CARL
</b>		Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your
		unit on Planet P. That mission had
		a very low survival probability...

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?

<b>				CARL
</b>		Elegant proof of intelligence, 
		isn't it ? We thought there might
		be a brain on P.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		You knew and you sent them
		anyway ?

<b>				CARL
</b>		A colony has to reach a certain size
		before it produces a Brain... we think
		300 generations. Woulda too expensive
		to launch an operation if there wasn't a
		Brain...

	Carl sees the way Carmen is looking at him, like he's a bug.

<b>				CARL
</b>		You don't approve. Well, too bad.
		We're in this for the species, boys
		and girls. It's simple numbers, they
		have more, and everyday I have to
		make decisions that send hundreds of
		people like you to their deaths.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Didn't they tell you, Colonel ?
		That's what cap troopres are good
		for.

	Carl allows himself a tiny smile.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Hope you're ready for more. We're
		going back to P to capture that Brain.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.

<b>				CARL
</b>		I hear they need a new Lieutenant...
		Want the job ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I'll take it... until I get killed
		or you find someone better.

	KLAXONS sound. Suddenly, everyone has someplace to go.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Hope you get your Brain Bug, Carl.

<b>				CARL
</b>		It's good to see you two. It reminds
		me of the way things were before...

	Carl turns abruptly and heads away. His entourage follows.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Take care, wilya Johnny ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		See you on the bounce !

<b>153	INT	RODGER YOUNG - COMMAND &amp; CONTROL - CARMEN
</b>
	steps onto the bridge. There's a new NUMBER 2 sitting in Zander's chair.
	She's right out of Tereshkova, and she looks scared. 
	Carmen turns to Captain Deladier.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?

<b>				DELADIER
</b>		He requested a combat assignment.
		There's always a need for experienced
		pilots on the ground.
		I had no choice but to let him go...
		He said you'd understand.

	Carmen bites her lip, takes first chair. Deladier feels bad for her, knows
	she's made a painful decision.

<b>154	INT	RODGER YOUNG - DROP ROOM - ROUGHNECKS
</b>

<b>				ACE
</b>		Officer on the deck !

	Roughnecks fall in. Johnny steps into the room. There are many new and
	much younger faces.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I only have two rules. Rule one,
		everyone fights. Rule two, no one
		quits. If you don't do your job,
		I'll kill you myself.
		Do you get me ?

<b>				ROUGHNECKS
</b>		We get you, sir !

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>			(to Ace, sotto voce)
		Who're all these kids ?

<b>				ACE
</b>		We got reinforced. Most of'em
		just got outa boot...

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		We're the old men, Ace.

<b>155	EXT	PLANET P - 4TH BRIGADE HQ - DAY - CARGO SHIPS
</b>
	have landed. Cap troopers set fire to huge piles of dead bugs. BULLDOZERS
	push bodies into a mass grave, among them Rasczak. 
	Johnny walks past with his team.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		We'll take this high ground. Lookouts
		there and therte and up there. If the
		bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood,
		we'll be the first to know.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know
		where they can deploy the skimmers.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Down there on the flats, eh ?
		Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our
		primary objective is to assist
		our friends from the Fleet...

	Roughnecks boo.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Alright, cut it out. We will deploy
		from skimmers in teams of six.
		If the bugs open up a battery,
		we put it out of business.
		Any questions ?

	A HERCULES CARGO BOAT hurtles out of the sky and lands on the high
	ground Johnny has intended forb his H.Q. Johnny scowls, marches over
	to the boat and confronts a FLEET OFFICER.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Would'ya mind moving your boat ?

<b>				FLEET OFFICER
</b>		Better talk to the boss.

	The cargo bays open to deploy FLEET SKIMMERS. Zander jumps down
	to oversee the operation.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		You're standing on my H.Q., 
		Lieutenant !

<b>				ZANDER 
</b>		This is a Fleet-driven operation, son,
		and the Fleet thinks my boat will be 
		safer on the high ground.
		You can have everything else, eh ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		You heard the Sky Marshall...
		Move it all down -

	Suddenly, in the distance, bug batteries open fire, not one but twenty.
	Zander and Johnny share a look of concern.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Rodger Young, prepare to receice 
		outgoing fire...!
			(to his crew chief)
		I'll take the first group.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !

<b>156	EXT	SPACE - PLANET P ORBIT - BUG PLASMA

	Carmen dodges other starships, turns to her new number 2.

</b>		Prepare for warp !

<b>				NEW NUMBER 2
</b>		Yes, ma'am ! Warp in 5... 4...
<b>		3...!
</b>
	KA-WHAM ! The Rodger Young takes a direct hit.

</b>		Ibanez...LET'S GO !

<b>160	INT	RODGER YOUNG - ESCAPE CORRIDOR - CARMEN

	Captain Deladier's leg is crushed when an airlock closes on her.

</b><b>		AAAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
	Carmen hits the release, pulls her free. Deladier pushes Carmen away.

<b>				DELADIER
</b>		Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		No way, ma'am !

<b>161	INT	RODGER YOUNG - LIFE POD BAY - CARMEN

</b>		The Rodger Young just burned up...

	Johnny's face falls.

</b>		We've gotta go get her !

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		You know as well as I do she's

	Johnny knows it's true, swallows bitterly, turns away. That's when he sees it. 
	Nearby, the ground shifts, a claw breaks through, a hole opens up and bugs
	boil up out of the ground.

<b>				SUGAR WATKINS
</b>		Here they come !

	They turn and see a second bug hole open up.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		We're outa here. Lieutenant, get

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Hey, just calm down, I'm giving

</b>		Form a perimeter !

	Through the dust, exposed bug tunnels can be seen in the canyon walls and
	piling out of them by the score, deadly Arachnid warriors. Johnny throws
	Zander a pulse cannon.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Make yourself useful, fly boy...
<b>		PREPARE TO REPEL BUGS !
</b>
	The Roughnecks open fire at the charging bug horde. Warriors are blown to 
	pieces. Gas grenades fly and H.E. rounds close tunnels. A maimed warrior 
	gets through and heads for Zander.

<b>				ZANDER
</b><b>		AAAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
	Johnny and Ace team up to blow it away. Zander takes a deep breath,
	loos around, impressed. The Roughnecks have killed a great many bugs.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Ace, get on the com. Tell Fleet we
		need retrieval... Sugar, salvage some
		armor and suit up Lieutenant Barcalow.

	Sugar Watkins tosses a bloody jump boot his way.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Thanks.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Fleet Command says retrieval's no go.
		The battle group's at safe distance...
		and we got another problem.

	Ace points out a Tanker bug that's been brough up to the rim. 
	Johnny sees another.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Looks like they're gonna hose us down...

	Johnny chews on this.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Alright... Listen up, Roughnecks.
		We're gonna head west down through
		bug city, pick up any Rodger Young 
		survivors we run across, and join A
		Company. Get me ?

<b>				ROUGHNECKS
</b>		We get you, sir !

	Zander, awkward in a power suit, confronts Johnny.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		What do you think you're doing ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I'm gonna save Carmen.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		That would mean a comlete disregard
		for the mission objective. They hang
		you for that, Rico.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Yeah, that's right.

	Johnny and Zander stare each other down.

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Let's go.
<b>		
</b><b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Move out.

	Johnny starts for the gaping mouth of an exposed bug tunnel and
	the others fall in behind him.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Bug hunt !

<b>				ROUGHNECKS
</b><b>		BUG HUNT !
</b>
<b>172	INT	TUNNEL - DAY - JOHNNY
</b>
	leads his deadly force through enemy territory. The Roughnecks kill
	everything that gets in their way. Zander lends his inexperienced hand.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't
		waste it on workers...
		Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our
		way...

<b>				ACE
</b>		Yes, sir !

	Warriors appear in the tunnel behind them.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Sugar, close the tunnel...!

<b>				SUGAR
</b>		Fire in the hole !

	Sugar Watkins fires an H.E. round and seals the tunnel.

<b>173	INT	BUG CITY - FEEDING PIT - DAY - CARMEN
</b>
	opens her eyes. She can hear BUGS CLICKING. She's in a pit filled 
	with human dead. A nearby carcass wears a uniform from 4th Brigade
	Off in the dark she hears HUMAN MOANING.

	She crawls over rotting corpses toward the sound. The moaning turns
	to SCREAMING. It's coming from outside the pit. She pulls herself
	up to peer over the edge. 

<b>174	INT	BUG CITY - THE ROYAL COURT - DAY - CARMEN
</b>
	sees hundred of bugs at work, WARRIORS, WORKERS and dozens of 
	small (2 meters) CHARIOT BUGS. Aworker walks pas, stepping on her,
	but pays her no attention.

	She sees the source of the screaming:	Captain Deladier is hold
	between two warriors, and she's screaming because of what she sees,

<b>				DELADIER
</b><b>		NAAAAAAAA...! OH PLEASE...
</b>
	The BRAIN BUG is huge (5 meters) and pulpy. I has vestigial legs that
	cannot support ist weight, and so it must be moved by a shifting carpet of
	chariot bugs.

<b>				DELADIER
</b><b>		...OH GOD AAAAAAAAAAAAA...!
</b>
	A thorn-like PALP unfolds out of the brain bug and strikes, driving deep into
	Deladier's head and sucks her brains out.

<b>				DELADIER
</b><b>		AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
	Carmen watches horrified as Deladier dies. The suddenly a warrior grabs her
	from above and drags her out of the pit. She screams as its claws slice into 
	her limbs.

<b>				CARMEN
</b><b>		AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
	Now the brain bug comes for her. She sees the palp unfold, the thorn-like
	spike coming toward her. Carmen is no longer looking for escape.
	All she wants to do is die.

	Suddenly, every bug in the chamber stops as though to listen. Carmen hears it.
	A HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL, getting louder. 
	Johnny enters the chamber alone.

	The warriors move toward him. He holds up a NUKE, source of the high-pitched
	tone. The ready light flashes. The Brain Bug emits a series of harsh clicks.
	The warriors freeze.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		You know what this is...?

	Johnny makes an explosive sound. The Brain Bug slowly withdraws its palp.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Sure you do... You're a big fat smart
		bug, aren't you ?

	Johnny moves toward Carmen. The Brain Bug's multiple eyes track him.
	The warriors holding Carmen threaten. Johnny turns on the brain bug, 
	his finger on the nuke's trigger. 

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		I'll take you with me.

	The Brain Bug clicks. The warriors back off. Carmen collapses.
	Johnny reaches for her.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Take my hand !

	Chariot bugs move the Brain Bug down a hole. Workers seal the hole
	behind it with amazing speed. Johnny drags Carmen back toward the 
	tunnel he entered from. The warriors charge.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Roughnecks...NOW !

	Johnny throws himself on top of Carmen as the Roughnecks burst into
	the chamber, guns blazing. The fight is furious, point blank, deadly to
	bug and Roughneck alike. 

	Sugar Watkins screams as a warrior rips his arm off. Zander takes a
	claw through the gut.

<b>				ZANDER
</b><b>		AAAAAAAAAAAAA !
</b>
	He blows it away, sees his intestines hanging out of the wound, shoves
	them back inside and keeps on fighting. A warrior rears up over Johnny
	and Carmen.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Weapon !

	Ace throws him a Morita. Johnny catches it, pumps three rounds into the 
	bug's nerve stem. He struggles out from under the dead warrior.
	Every bug in the chamber is dead.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Are you hurt ?

	Carmen throws her arms around Johnny.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Johnny...!

	Zander takes this in. Carmen sees him, then his wound.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Zander...! Oh, you're hurt.

	Ace takes a look at his wound, makes a face.

<b>				ACE
</b>		Ah geez...

	Zander pushes him away, struggles to his feet.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Can you walk ?

<b>				ZANDER
</b>			(clenched teeth)
		Not a problem.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Let's get some armor on her, and
		the we'll get outa this stinkin 
		bug hole !

	Various components are gladly passed forward. Johnny and Ace 
	help her putting it on.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		I thought I was dead. Lucky for
		me you jokers showed up, eh ?

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the
		mission objective to rescue you...

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Is it true ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Yeah, if I live through this, 
		they'll probably hang me.
		Now com'on, let's move out !

<b>175	INT	BUG CITY TUNNELS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS
</b>
	double-time it, racing for the surface. They come to a fork.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Which way ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Up. We gotta be near A Company 
		by now.

	The tunnel floor drops out. FIVE ROUGHNECKS disappear into the hole.
	WARRIORS climb up into the tunnel.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b><b>		FALL BACK !
</b>
	The Roughnecks bachk up fast, shooting. Zander staggers, collapses.
	Johnny drops to his side, rolls him over.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		How bad are you, pal ?

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Been better, buddy.

	Johnny sees warriors coming up into the tunnel by the score.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Alright, we're gonna carry you...

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get 
		upstairs before it's too late...
		Gimmee the nuke.

	Zander checks his pulse cannon's available power.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Don't be a hero...

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		This is my farm. Now c'mon, give
		me what you got and get out of
		here...

	Johnny nods, hands him the nuke. Carmen sees what's happening.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Zander, what are you doing ?

<b>				ZANDER
</b>		Just giving you something to
		remember me by, baby.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Zander, no...!

	He grabs her and kisses her. Johnny drags Carmen away. Zander opens 
	fire as the first warriors reach his position.

<b>176	INT	BUG CITY - INCLINED TUNNEL - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN
</b>
	race desperately for the surface. They hear the chatter of Zander's pulse cannon
	and the screams of dying bugs.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b><b>		GO.GO GO GO GO...!
</b>
	Tears stream down from Carmen's face.

<b>177	EXT	PLANET P - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN
</b>
	and the surviving Roughnecks make it to the surface. 	WOMP !
	A subterrenean nuclear explosion blows a column of earth and stone
	into the air.

<b>178	EXT	PLANET P - A COMPANY BASE CAMP - JOHNNY
</b>
	and the others enter A Company's perimeter. No one notices their arrival
	because everyone's gathered in a big circle watching the Brain Bug.

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		Look... they got it.

	Several of its delicate legs were apparently broken during the capture.
	Carl approaches it without fear, puts his hand on the thing.

<b>				GENERAL
</b>		What's it thinking, Colonel ?

	Carl smiles in a cruel way.

<b>				CARL
</b>		It's afraid.

	Johnny and Carmen approach the General.

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Sir, I'd like to turn myself in.
		Dereliction of duty by an officer
		during wartime.

<b>				GENERAL
</b>		And you freely admit to it ?

<b>				JOHNNY
</b>		Yes, sir.

<b>				GENERAL
</b>		Is what this man says true,
		Lieutenant ?

<b>				CARMEN
</b>		To the best of my understanding,
