                                Stephen Gaghan



                      Based on the book "See No Evil" by

                                  Robert Baer



          Exile is not a material thing, it is a spiritual thing,
          all corners of the earth exactly the same. And anywhere
          one can dream is good, providing the place is obscure,
          and the horizon vast.

</b>
          The minarets of Shi'a mosques dot the skyline. The sun
          rises through the smog. Keening SIRENS call the faithful.
          A GROUP of bearded, turbanned MEN in white robes carrying
          Korans walk down an empty street.

          As the religious men pass a nondescript metal door, a
          THUMPING SOUND rises...

          The door cracks open and THREE MUSLIM WOMEN in full black
          sack emerge. The door shuts quickly behind them.
          Stay with the THREE MUSLIM WOMEN as they walk away. CLICK
          CLICK CLICK on the cobblestone. We hear GIGGLES.

</b>          One of them reaches down and removes stiletto high-heels,
          which disappear under-the black cloth.

<b>          2 INT. PRIVATE NIGHTCLUB - MORNING 2
</b>
          Down two flights of crowded stairs, there's a bar, dance
          floor, low couches, minimal lighting, wasted PEOPLE.
          Wealthy young IRANIANS sit at a table littered with ice-
          buckets and bottles of Absolut and Johnnie Walker.
          And with them is BOB BAER, 40's, professionally
          nondescript, he could be anything, a salesman, a high-
          school teacher. His face is ever-changing and his eyes
          miss nothing. Bob is the only American in the place and
          still you almost wouldn't notice him.

          ARASH AMIRI, 20's, a confident young Iranian, yells over
          the music. Beside him is his BROTHER.

<b>                         ARASH AMIRI
</b>          Have you ever tried liquid MDMA?
          Bob's forehead is sweating and his hair is sticking to
          it, which he wipes away as he sips his scotch.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Liquid MDMA? No, I never tried it.

          The music is louder. Arash proudly shouts over it --

</b>          Tehran is the world capital!

</b>          So, how's the kid?

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Great. He's great.
          Arash just stares. Bob sips his drink.

<b>                         BOB (CONT'D)
</b>          Are we gonna do this?
          A girl begins to dance in front of Arash.

</b>
          DISTANT POV down to the street as TWO CARS pull up. Bob
          gets out of one, walks to the rear, opens the trunk --

<b>          4 EXT. TEHRAN STREET - DAY 4
</b>
          The trunk SLAMS. Bob carries a worn ATTACHE CASE. The
          Amiris get out of their car, oblivious Shiite party boys.
          Bob walks, happy. Dour MEN at cafe tables miss nothing.

<b>          5 INT. KEBAB SHOP - DAY 5
</b>
          Corrugated metal shutters CLOSE, sealing out the light.
          Arash ushers Bob through the gloom toward TWO MILITARY
          CASES. Bob expertly flips one over and opens it.
          Inside: A STINGER MISSILE, neatly disassembled. He finds
          the serial number: 3j16w4921.
          A SMILEY FACE is scratched into the metal of the Stinger.
          Bob tries to activate the Stinger. It's dead. Arash and
          his brother perspire. Bob is perspiring.
          Bob thinks he hears faint MOUTH BREATHING from behind the
          curtain closing off the rear of the shop.
          Bob opens HIS ATTACHE CASE. He removes a pouch. The pouch
          holds a battery. The battery has a serial number.
          Bob finds: 3j16w4921. A perfect match. He removes the
          dead battery and replaces it with the live battery. He
          activates the missile. It works. Everyone is relieved.

</b>          Bob moves to THE NEXT MILITARY CASE. He replaces the next
          battery and activates the second missile.
          Arash and his brother share a celebratory glance. Arash
          suddenly takes ONE CASE and drags it through the curtain.
          Bob hears LOW VOICES. He turns questioningly to Arash's
          brother who just stares and smiles like an idiot.
          Then Arash reappears, passing by Bob.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          You said they were both for you.
          Arash tosses an envelope at Bob --

<b>                         ARASH AMIRI
</b>          What do you care?
          Bob glances in the envelope. Behind him, the Amiris are
          picking up the other case. Bob moves toward the curtain.
          IN THE BACK OF THE SHOP Bob's eyes adjust. Several robed
          shapes, ghosts in grey light, carry the case out a door.
          The BARREL OF A GUN touches the side of Bob's head. The
          SOUND of a SHELL CHAMBERED and a MOUTH BREATHER.
          Bob raises his hands. The barrel slides around to his
          forehead and Bob is staring into the blue eyes of
          MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA, 40's, bearded, and calm.

<b>                          BOB (FARSI)

          MSA seems remarkably serene, then he screams in Arabic.

<b>          BOB (FARSI) (CONT'D)
</b>          You don't speak Farsi, do you, you
          son of a goat?
          MSA screams again, tightening his finger on the trigger,
          then he backs out the door, never losing aim on Bob.

          The HIGH POV down to the street. The Amiris exit the
          kebab shop carrying the REMAINING MILITARY CASE.
          CAMERA ADJUSTS to incorporate SOMEONE'S HAND on the
          rooftop. And next to it, a remote-control TRIGGER DEVICE.

          As the Amiris carry the case toward their car, Bob
          appears in the doorway and heads up the street toward us.
          Behind Bob, in the distance, the Amiris get into the car.
          Bob glances up at the roof and NODS ONCE, continuing to
          walk toward camera as --
          The car EXPLODES. Bob walks on as if nothing happened.

          Tight on the game of Asteroids. The version from the
          70's. Black and white triangle "spaceship" spinning,
          shooting white dots at drifting "rocks," breaking them
          up, only to create more rocks.
          A hand rapidly hits the firing button. ROBBY BAER, 16,
          concentrates, hits hyper space, smiles, remembers he has
          a retainer, hides his smile.
          He glances over at a cafe table where Bob and MARGARET
          BAER, 40's, frank and guarded in a way that is
          compelling, are having morning coffee. We realize that
          all around them are IRANIANS, that a crowd is massing in
          the street outside, and that Bob clearly doesn't want to
          have this conversation.

          They look at each other.

</b>          Well, then here we are.

<b>                         MARGARET
</b>          Here we are.
          In the street it's turning into a full-blown protest.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Let's say, somehow, I get a Branch
          or even a Group, then what? Will
          you come? Will you bring Robby?
          Now, Margaret looks away. A STUDENT-LEADER is up on a
          platform brandishing a Coke bottle, SHOUTING in Farsi
          into a bullhorn.

<b>                         MARGARET

          He says you have to fix your soul,
          which is not something you can put
          on a soft-drink.
          We see the faces of the protesters, silently staring,
          their mouths covered by black tape.

          At a kitchen table, RILEY, almost 3, puts his hand in a

          handful on the floor.

</b>          No. The divide between human
          nature and modern life cannot be
          bridged by free trade. No. It
          cannot be cured with deregulation,
          privatization, openness or lower
          taxes. No.
          THE CLERIC, 40, is a serene man whose beard and glasses
          make him appear older than his age. Wasim watches as he
          talks in hypnotic cadence, making eye contact with each
          boy in turn.

<b>          THE CLERIC (CONT'D)
</b>          The pain of living in the modern
          world will never be solved by a
          liberal society.
          The Cleric's sympathetic gaze falls on Wasim who is
          bruised with black eyes from his beating.

<b>          THE CLERIC (CONT'D)

</b>          The divine and the worldly are but
          a single concept and that concept
          is Koran.
          They walk past bee hives spaced across the desert. Farooq
          and Wasim and two OTHERS are with him.

<b>          THE CLERIC (CONT'D)
</b>          No separation of religion and

          legislating and slaves obeying -
          Koran.
          They stand in a corn field growing in the desert. The

          number. No. No is the answer to

          hands, as her worry has been abating, anger has
          ineluctably filled in behind.

          start a new petroleum exchange in

          speculators out of the business.
          why are the major oil exchanges in
          New York and London anyway? I'll
          put all of our energy up for
          competitive bidding, I'll pipe
          through Iran to Europe like you
          proposed, I'll ship to China,
          anything that achieves efficiency
          and maximizes profits for my

          efficiencies in the form of
          regulation. That's Milton
