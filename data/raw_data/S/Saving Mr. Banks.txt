<b>          EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - AUSTRALIA - DAY (1906)
</b>

<b>                         OVER BLACK:
</b>          MUSIC - string violins treat us to a familiar song opening
          and then a voice - male.

<b>           TRAVERS (V.O.)
</b>
<b>                          (SINGING)
</b>           Winds in the East
           Mist coming in--

<b>                         FADE IN:
</b>          A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning,
          spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst
          white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella)
          dances amongst the nimbus.

<b>           TRAVERS (V.O.)
</b>           --Like something is brewing,
           about to begin--
          The shadow's direction becomes purposeful - taking us down
          through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small
          town in the distance.

<b>           TRAVERS (V.O.)
</b>           --Can't put me finger on what lies

<b>                          IN STORE--
</b>          Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large,
          bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.
          There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts
          the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large
          park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from
          flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.
          She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face
          to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her
          concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we
          will also know as GINTY.)

<b>           TRAVERS (V.O.)
</b>           --But I feel what's to happen, all

<b>                          HAPPENED BEFORE--
</b>          Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of
          a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind
          becomes real.

                         

<b>          INT. SHAWFIELD ST - PAMELA'S OFFICE - LONDON - MORNING (1961)
</b>
          P.L. TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position
          as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the
          sky. Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of
          stiff and steely determination.
          Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha
          smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the
          walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with
          men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit
          on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding.
          Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful,
          white.
          Downstairs the doorbell rings.
          Pamela closes her eyes, breathes.
          It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up,
          smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes.

<b>          INT. SHAWFIELD ST - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING
</b>
          Pamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of
          sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold.
          DIARMUID RUSSELL (45) - bright, youthful - waits to be asked
          inside. Pamela is not pleased to see him.

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           Mrs Travers.

                         

<b>          INT. PAMELA'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
</b>
          Pamela and Diarmuid sit in silence. Diarmuid looks at her,
          she looks out of the window.

<b>                          DIARMUID PAMELA
</b>          You're ready to--? Like pink clouds on sticks.

                         

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           Excuse me?

</b>           The cherry blossoms

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           I was trying to think of what they--
          Diarmuid looks at his watch.

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           The car should be here, may I use--

<b>                          (THE PHONE)
</b>
<b>                          PAMELA

<b>                          (OVER)
</b>           I cancelled it.

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           You--?

<b>                          (PANICKED)
</b>           What? Pamela!

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Mrs Travers.

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           Mrs Travers, please, why--
           (sugaring his tone)
           Why would you cancel the car?

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           I shan't be going.
          Diarmuid buries his face in his hands.

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           We've been through this--

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           I've changed my mind.

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           You can't.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           With all due respect Mr Russell I
           am on very good terms with my own
           faculty and exceedingly confident
           in its decision making
           capabilities.
          Diarmuid's shoulders visibly sag, he lets out a long
          frustrated breath.

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           You made an agreement. Do you
           understand? A verbal agreement.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Why in the world are you speaking
           to me as if I am a neonate?

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>
<b>                          HE'LL--
</b>
<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           He'll what? Sue? He is most welcome
           to every penny I don't have.

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>
<b>                          LOOK--
</b>
<b>                          (HE SIGHS)
</b>           --I've represented you for a long
           time. I like to think of you as a

<b>                          FRIEND--
</b>          Pamela snorts.

<b>                          DIARMUID (CONT'D)
</b>           I like to think of it, believe me I
           know it's not reciprocated.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           I would never suggest you do
           something that would cause you
           anguish but there's no more money
           Pamela-- Mrs Travers. Simply no
           more. Sales have dried up, no more
           royalties. You refuse to write
           further books so--

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Do you understand? I'm frightened
           that you don't understand what that
           means.
          Pamela looks out of the window, the cherry blossom her focus.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           I know what he's going to do to her-
           - she'll be cavorting and
           twinkling! Careening towards a
           happy ending like a kamikaze--

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           --We've been trying to do this deal
           for twenty years! He's agreed to
           both your stipulations. No

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Use her to pay my bills? If I
           believed in a hell I'd be sitting
           in its waiting room--

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>
<b>                          (OVER)
</b>           --script approval! He's never
           granted anything like that before!
           I don't know what else to--
          He looks around.

<b>                          DIARMUID (CONT'D)
</b>           Where is Polly?

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           I fired her.
          Diarmuid shakes his head, sighs.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           It's just as well. It seems I can't
           afford her anymore anyway!
          Pamela looks to the ceiling, breathes.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>                          (MOMENTARILY SOFT)
</b>           You don't know how much she means
           to me.

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           Polly?

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Of course not Polly!
          Pamela huffs, digs her heel into the rug.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

           Los Angeles.

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           You have only to go there and work
           for two weeks. Collaborate. That's
           it. You haven't signed the rights

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Oh I must, must I?

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           You need the money. I don't want
           you to see you-- (broke).

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>
<b>                          (OVER)

           disgusting word!

<b>                          DIARMUID

<b>                          TRAVERS--
</b>          Diarmuid gets up.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           I have final say?

<b>                          DIARMUID

<b>                          DIARMUID
</b>           You don't sign the papers. He
           cannot make the film unless you
           grant the rights.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           It's an exploratory trip--
          Pamela looks at the cherry blossom again, a piece floats away
          from the tree and sticks to her living room window.

<b>                          DIARMUID (CONT'D)
</b>           What do you say?

          A large hand taps Ginty on the shoulder, she looks up and
          smiles. TRAVERS GOFF (35) is handsome and rugged, a wild
          poetic look, like Ted Hughes or Dylan Thomas.

<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>           Excuse me ma'am, have you seen my
           daughter? I was quite sure I had
           left her around here somewhere!
          Ginty giggles.

<b>                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
</b>           Her name is Helen, no, Shirley, erm-
           - goodness! I've quite forgotten!
           Could it be Prunella?

<b>                          TRAVERS

<b>                          GINTY

          Travers puts his nose right up to hers, peering into her
          face.

<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>           Gosh! So it is! Well, thank

          He swings her up onto his shoulders and gallops off through
          the park, neighing like a horse.

<b>          INT. PLANE - DAY
</b>
          Pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle a bulging carpet
          bag into an overhead locker.

<b>                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>           Can I help you?

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           I'm perfectly capable thank you.
          The flight attendant tries to help anyway.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           They've used all the space; so
           greedy.
          She glares at the people around her.

<b>                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>           I'll take it Madam. I can put it
           up here -

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           I don't want it up there. I want it
           here, in the corresponding holding
           area for my assigned seat!

<b>                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>           The flight's closing in just a few
           moments Ma'am. I'll have to take
           it.
          Pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say `I dare
          you.' A woman, with an infant, stands up.

<b>                          WOMAN
</b>
<b>                          (TO ATTENDANT)
</b>           You can put my bag up front
           instead.
          The flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the
          woman's bag with Pamela's.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>
<b>                          (TO WOMAN)

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Jolly good.
          Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to
          the window, she looks out at the tarmac.
          She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes
          again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands
          neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.

<b>                          (TO HERSELF)
</b>           I hope we crash.
          The passenger across the aisle hears her, horrified!

</b>
          BIDDY (3) and MARGARET - the girls mother, delicate, weak -
          stand outside of their lavish red-bricked home. Suitcases
          bulge at their feet. Margaret breathes a sigh of relief as
          she sees Travers hurrying towards them, he swings Ginty from
          his shoulders and plops her on the ground.

<b>                          MARGARET

          heartbroken.

          The family get into line, one behind the other, Travers in
          the lead.

          Ginty takes Andrew's leash, her own case and somehow helps
          her sister too.

          Passersby tut and shake their heads at the noisy display as

          Margaret stays for a beat, longingly taking in and storing a
          picture of the home she leaves behind.

          The procession continues into the bustling downtown.

<b>          EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY
</b>
          It's hectic as tickets are purchased and a CLERK marks a
          chalkboard with destinations and mileage. Ginty stops, looks
          at the list. The last city is--

          The Great Western Queensland train chugs its way Westward
          from the verdant green of Maryborough toward the brown cake
          of Allora.

                         

<b>          EXT. ANGLE ON MARYBOROUGH - DAY
</b>
          As it disappears. Ginty stands on the last train platform,
          watching her home, her past, fade into the distance.
          Ginty's face speaks resignation as it, and the train, recede
          as billowing white smoke and dust fill the frame.

                         

<b>          INT. PLANE - DAY
</b>
          Pamela jolts in her seat, her eyes flit open. She's disturbed
          by her dreams, she flicks her hand in front of her face as if
          somehow batting the memories away. She sighs loudly and digs
          her heel into the carpet of the plane.

                         

<b>          INT. LAX - ARRIVALS - DAY
</b>
          A bleary eyed Pamela carries her two bags into the arrivals
          area. She's immediately hit by dazzling sunlight and a sea of
          signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies:
          she scans Paramount, Warner Brothers, MGM, finally falling
          upon her own name - P.L. Travers - underneath "Walt Disney
          Presents".

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Oh does he indeed?
          She approaches the uniformed driver (RALPH - Mickey Mouse on
          his lapel) who bursts into a beaming smile.

<b>                          RALPH
</b>           Travers? P.L. Travers?

<b>                          PAMELA

          Pamela sneers. He grabs her bags.

          Ralph ushers Pamela through the doors--

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Don't be preposterous.
          Pamela sniffs the air.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           It smells. Like--

<b>                          PAMELA

          Ralph chuckles.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

<b>          EXT. LIMOSINE - DAY
</b>
          The shiny black, tinted windowed limo cruises up La Cienega
          Blvd, passing all kinds of monstrous architecture and garish
          billboard advertising.

                         

<b>          INT. LIMOSINE - DAY

          Pamela is diminutive on the back seat of the sprawling car.
          She eyes the champagne on ice, the flutes clinking in the in-
          car bar.

<b>                          PAMELA

           Travers?

<b>                          RALPH

<b>                          AMAZEMENT)
</b>           Gosh almighty.
          Pamela presses her fingers to her temples. She looks around,
          finds a button, pushes it and the screen rises between
          passenger and driver miraculously relieving her of Ralph's
          natter.

<b>                          RALPH (CONT'D)

</b>
          With its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel
          resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun.
          The limo glides into the forecourt.

                         

<b>          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY
</b>
          A porter opens the door to Pamela's suite and places her
          belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway.

<b>                          PORTER

</b>           Young man, if it is your wish to
           handle ladies garments I suggest
           you take employment in a
           launderette.
          The porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           Yes?
          His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela. She
          closes the door on him.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           Odd.
          She turns and for the first time takes in--

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           Oh my.
          --The LUDICROUS suite she has been assigned; it is opulent
          beyond imagine but it's classy decor has been rather
          diminished by the array of Disney gifts splattered across
          every surface of the room.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           Oh no, no, no.
          Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit
          baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Donald,
          Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the
          BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable. Imagine it. Nope.

<b>          BIGGER!
</b>          Pamela cannot contain her horror. She stares at it in disgust
          for a moment, and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the
          fruit basket. She stops still for a second before rushing
          over and picking them out. She turns them over in her hands
          before an enormous wave of panic washes over her.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           (muttering to the pears)

          She throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is
          greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight--

                         

<b>          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - DAY
</b>
          --Arid heat, dazzling sunlight. Travers, Margaret and the
          children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway. From
          their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling
          red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new
          home. The surrounding land yellow and burnt - unlike the lush
          greens of Maryborough. The house is ramshackle and meagre.
          A swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few
          skinny chickens strut about the porch.

<b>                          TRAVERS

<b>                          OH--

</b>           We'll build beautiful memories here

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Yes.
          Travers takes Ginty and Biddy's hands and they run towards
          their new home. The chickens scatter.

          nothing but barren land and red dust for miles.

          We rise through the water to see Pamela on her balcony
          throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer-free
          swimming pool.

          She gathers up the Disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in
          a closet.
          She picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where
          the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable takes up the
          entire bed. Imagine it. Nope. BIGGER!

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           Good Lord.
          Pamela drops her bags, grabs Mickey and places him on the
          floor, facing the wall.

</b>           And you can stay there until you
           learn the art of subtlety.
          Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack. She takes
          from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night
          stand, followed by another bottle and another and another.
          The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up,
          the bag is endless. Things, things and more things come
          streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses
          windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature
          Buddhas. Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed
          picture of herself. She holds it up, admires it, takes down
          an existing painting and replaces it with her own image.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           There.
          Pamela is restless, she looks around the room, stands in
          front of a full length mirror, admiring herself. She turns
          her face slightly to catch it at its best angle. She leans
          forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly
          unlined for a woman of her years. She smiles, full of vanity.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

<b>                          QUESTION)
</b>           Well, no, I don't suppose I do
           mind.
          She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as
          an ugly snort.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           Now, really! Flatterer!
           (then scolding herself)
           Silly girl.
          She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a
          remote control staring at it with bemusement. She points it
          at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the
          TV bursts into life.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           Oh!
          She clicks again, the TV goes off, again and it's on. A
          housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is
          the greatest thing ever invented.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           Soap for the brains.
          She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a
          black and white screen. It takes a moment before she realizes
          that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly
          face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY (58) on The Wonderful World of
          Disney Show. Pamela raises an eyebrow--

</b>           You know, a little sprinkling of
           fairy dust can make you fly!
          Pamela can't help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then
          just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and
          switches him off.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Off! That's how we deal with you.

          Pamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes
          her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there.
          The moonlight casts a shadow of Mickey on the wall beside her

          not a hair out of place. The limo pulls up to the curb and
          Pamela groans as she sees Ralph jovially jump out of the car
          and rush round to open the passenger door.

          THREE MEN in suits wave at the limo as it drives through the
          enormous gates of Disney's Burbank Studio and pulls up in a
          very twee forecourt.
          They are: DON DAGRADI (45) and the SHERMAN BROTHERS, ROBERT

          a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face.

          on a golf buggy.

</b>           I am perfectly capable of walking.
          A couple of Disney characters (Donald and Goofy) bounce up to
          the golf cart, waving brightly. Goofy opens his arms to
          Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror.

</b>           Shoo! Go away!
          The characters stop bouncing and Di Gradi gives them a nod
          meaning `beat it'.

          Don leads Pamela into the plushly appointed outer office,
          where DOLLY - a young, perky secretary - smiles brightly at

          Dolly loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly and
          picks up the phone.

          We hear a man's cough before a beaming Walt Disney, in the
          flesh, appears at the end of the corridor, his arms
          outstretched.

<b>                          WALT
</b>           Well, there ya are at last!
          Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, and makes her way
          serenely towards the man, who rushes down the corridor to
          greet her.

<b>                          WALT (CONT'D)

</b>           You can't imagine how excited I am
           to finally meet you!
          Pamela doesn't know what to do with this amount of
          enthusiasm. She extends a formal hand before he manages to
          get her in an embrace.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Oh!
          He squeezes her tight and then lets go. Pamela struggles to
          compose herself, she hasn't been that close to a man in
          decades!

          There's a hint of something mournful in the way he says `old

          He links his arm through hers, much to her chagrin, and leads
          her into his interior office past an imposing floor to
          ceiling cabinet bursting with Academy Awards.

          Disney's office is tastefully furnished and filled with
          pictures of his daughters and wife. Framed posters of his
          films provide splashes of color to the cream walls.

          He gestures to a comfy couch in the corner but Pamela takes a
          seat in front of Walt's desk instead, glancing at the sign
          above it: We Can Make Them Live. Walt perches on the edge of
          the desk, close to her, gazing at her.

          smiling away, acting it out with all his heart and soul,
          almost unable to contain himself with glee. Bob occasionally
          joins in for a word or two but is much more serious, eyeing

          Pamela's door opens a crack and another half-eaten room

<b>                         CLOSE ON:
</b>          A tiny park, about half a metre square - it has grass, tiny
          trees made from flowers, a small hole filled with water for a
          pond, park benches made with twigs and miniature wooden
          clothes-peg people. Ginty puts the finishing touches to the
          bandstand and sits back, staring in wonder.
          The moment is broken with the sound of hooves as her father
          appears, atop his horse.

</b>           That's it Albert. Give Ginty a
           smooch. There's a good boy, give
           her a little smooch.
          The velvety muzzle of the horse "smooches" Ginty's neck and
          ear as Travers climbs down from the nag.

<b>                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
</b>           Poor old Albert; he's your secret

</b>           Why did she do that?!

<b>                          TRAVERS

          Travers sighs, let's the words ring in his ears, touches the
          end of daughter's nose.

<b>                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

           like to fly Ginty?
          She nods. He hauls himself onto Albert, leans down and swings
          Ginty up so she is facing him.

<b>                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
</b>           You trust me?
          She nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over
          his shoulder.
          He grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her
          arms.

<b>                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
</b>           Gee up, Albert. Yah!
          Travers kicks the horse into a trot, then into a canter, he
          points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars.

<b>                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)

          Travers and Ginty gallop at great speed. The horse kicking up
          great clods of earth as they hurtle away into the distance.

          Don DaGradi and the Shermans are escorting Pamela along a row
          of storyboard illustrations for the film. Dolly trundles
          along behind, carrying a tray with a cup of tea on it which
          Pamela occasionally picks up and takes a sip from.

<b>                          DON

</b>           No, no, no. Goodness no.

</b>           The Banks house doesn't look like
           that! My house is a terraced house
           with a pink door, white bricked
           with a crack in the gable. The
           window frames are lead-lined and
           the flower boxes grow pink
           nasturtiums to go with the pink

<b>                          DON
</b>           It's all wrong?

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           It's too grand! The Banks family -
           they're normal, everyday sort of
           people. This isn't normal. It isn't
           everyday! They're not aristocrats!

<b>                          DICK
</b>           Interesting.
          Don allows a tiny smile. She is right. Pamela lingers over a
          picture of the parrot head umbrella, a split second of
          something like recognition on her face and then she simply
          moves on.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>
<b>                          (TO HERSELF)
</b>           Okay.
          She stops again in front of a sketch of Mrs Banks wearing a
          suffragette ribbon.

</b>           Um-- yeah?

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Why in the world have you made Mrs

<b>                          BOB
</b>           I wonder if Emmeline P would agree
           with that adjective--

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Quite possibly, looking back.

<b>                          DON

           allows her children to spend all of
           their time with the nanny when she
           has no job to speak of--

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Are you calling Mrs Banks
           neglectful?

</b>           Yep.

<b>                          DON
</b>           No! Of course not! We just felt
           that if she had a job it would go
           some way to explaining--

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Being a mother is a job. A very
           difficult job and one that not
           everybody is up to, that not
           everybody should have taken on in
           the first place!
          The boys see that Pamela is talking about something
          meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief
          moment, until--

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           I will NOT have her called Cynthia!
           Absolutely not. It feels unlucky.
          Dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at Bob.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           No it should be something warm, a
           bit sexy.
          They all nearly choke at the word `sexy' coming out of her
          mouth.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Yes, that's because it's very good.
          She comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of
          it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           I told the illustrator I didn't
           like the facial hair but she chose
           to ignore me. This is MY film and

           Mrs Travers, it was a specific
           request, from Walt.
          Pamela doesn't acknowledge that Dolly has spoken; Dolly
          flushes.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           (to the boys)
           Why?
          Everyone shrugs, they don't know why.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           He didn't, he doesn't, Mr Banks is

          Bob buries his face in his hands and let's out a long, loud,
          unashamed moan.

</b>           You can wait outside!
          She points at the door, ordering him out with her finger. Bob
          is literally stunned. Dick stifles a laugh.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           I shan't say it again Robert.
          Bob storms out of the room (as fast as his limp and cane will
          allow him) slamming the door and from behind it we hear:

          another's company. She takes it in melancholically for a
          second and then jabs the elevator button repeatedly, relieved
          when the doors finally slide open.

          eyes with her.

          Pamela averts her eyes for a split second, embarrassed about

          clasped around her body, her face to the sky. She sits
          perfectly still until the limo pulls up and Ralph gets out,
          patiently waiting beside the car so as not to disturb her.

          the bar again, a few people chatting over cocktails. The
          elevator doors open but she chooses to go and sit at the bar
          instead.

          Pamela looks around at the other women in the bar, all
          glamorous, coiffured, very different to the practical Mrs

          Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come
          and go. The barman talks with another customer further along
          the bar. Nobody notices Pamela. In this setting she looks
          like a little old lady, awkwardly perched on a stool, staring
          into her empty cup.

          Cashiers look up from their posts and nod courteously.
          Ginty and RANDOLPH BELHATCHETT are startled for a second by a
          loud crash. Their eyes flit to the glass door of Travers'
          office. The etching on the glass reads:

<b>          TRAVERS GOFF - BANK MANAGER
</b>
                         

<b>          INT. TRAVERS OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          Travers has just dropped (purposefully) a tray of coins on
          the floor. He has a wild edge to him, he may well have been
          drinking.

<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>
<b>                          (TO CLERK)
</b>           Belhatchett. Bell. Hatchett. Ha!
           It's a ridiculous moniker!

<b>                          CLERK
</b>
<b>                          SIR--
</b>
<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>           And Mr Belhatchett has complained
           that I opened his stupid bank five
           minutes late has he? Hahaaa!
           (in a comedy voice)
           Time's Money, Goff, y'know! Time's
           money my man!
          The clerk laughs nervously.

<b>                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
</b>           Bell Hatchett! Beautiful hatchet.
           That's what it means. And I suppose
           if the poor dumb lambs on his
           downs, are five minutes late with
           their calving, or they don't drop
           dead on schedule when he wants a
           roast, he takes to them with the
           business end of his beautiful
           hatchet.
          Travers wields a glinting letter opener in the air, stabbing
          piles of papers, filing cabinets, desks.

<b>                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
</b>           There, whack! That'll teach you for
           not dropping your bairns on
           schedule. Whack! Whack! Whack!
          Travers looks at the figure standing outside his door and his
          eyes widen.

<b>                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
</b>           Whack. Whoops!
           (through the door)
           Mr Belhatchett! Allow me to--
          Travers pushes the door open to reveal Ginty at his side and
          is felled.

<b>                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)
</b>           Ginty!

<b>                          RANDOLPH
</b>           I want you gone.
          All eyes fall upon the little girl whom everyone seems to
          have forgotten. Travers is overcome with embarrassment and
          guilt.

<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>           Sweet thing! What are you doing
           here?
          Ginty looks up at Belhatchett and the manager.

<b>                          GINTY
</b>           You said today was--

<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>           Ice cream day! Yes! I did! What
           kind of father am I?

<b>                          GINTY
</b>
<b>                          (SCARED)
</b>           Are you fired again?

<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>           Ah, yes it does seem that--

<b>                          RANDOLPH
</b>
<b>                          (TO GINTY)
</b>           No. No sweetheart-- he isn't.

<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>
<b>                          (TO GINTY)
</b>           Just wait in my office for a second
           darling.
          Randolph walks away, stopping to whisper in Travers ear.

<b>                          RANDOLPH
</b>           If you can't straighten up for your
           own sake. Do it for your daughter.
           (muttering to himself)
           Irresponsible.
          Travers holds out his arms to Ginty and she runs into them.

<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>           Ice cream is so rare because it
           only comes from Siberian cows. Did
           you know that?!

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Brrrrrrrr!

                         

<b>          EXT. RIVER - ALLORA - DAY
</b>
          Ginty and Travers sit by the river. Ginty eats an enormous
          ice cream and Travers sips continuously from his hip flask.

<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>           We share a Celtic soul, you and I.
           This world is just an illusion,
           Ginty old girl. As long as we hold
           that thought dear, they can't break
           us. Money, money, money. Don't you
           buy into it Ginty! It'll bite you
           on the bot!
           How did we end up here eh? Look at
           it. Barren. Breathless.
           Get as far away from this place as
           possible my love. Find yourself a
           patch of green.

<b>                          (HE SIGHS)
</b>           It's a chimera you know? The world,
           the bank, you and I, Mr Randolph-
           whackety-whack-Belhatchett. All an
           illusion.
          He stares across the river, experiencing a wave of deep
          melancholy. Ginty looks up at him, aware of his profound
          unhappiness, but unable to understand its source.

          Another untouched meal in the hallway.

          Pamela lies in the dark, the phone pressed to her ear.

           How can a place so sunny be so
           cold?
          We don't hear what Diarmuid says.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           I meant heartless. I'm afraid a

           bringing up these-- it's so hot and
           stuffy I feel like I am being
           attacked. These odd dreams, like my

           me for entertaining the idea that I

</b>           Very well. Good morning and

          She hangs up the phone, and continues sitting upright. Wide
          awake. Staring into the darkness.
          Pamela checks through her multitude of pill bottles for
          something to help her. Nothing. She groans as she drags
          herself out of bed, pacing the room, counting steps.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           Serves me right. Money, money,
           money. Bit me on the bot.
          Her eyes stray to the big Mickey Mouse. She drags it onto the
          bed with her and climbs back under the covers, clinging onto
          the stuffed toy for comfort.

<b>          INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - MORNING
</b>
          The room is decidedly more lively, with sketches of the cast
          and models of the sets all about the place. And of course,
          the requisite abundance of brightly coloured food now
          accompanied by some healthier options - vegetables and a
          fluorescent looking soup.
          Bob and Dick are at the piano. Don sits in the corner,
          sketching energetically on his notepad what seems to be a
          cartoon sketch of Pamela Travers.

<b>                          DICK

          Pamela steps from the car and Walt is there to greet her.

          As they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the
          rehearsal room window and down onto the lot.

          Dick is playing about with a verse.

          Dick is confused.

<b>                          BOB (CONT'D)
</b>           Try B.
          He takes a pencil from behind his ear and marks Dick's sheet
          music. Dick immediately begins finding the tune on the piano

</b>           Yes!
          The sound of Walt's cough signals his imminent arrival.

           Play him what you got.
          Walt takes a seat beside the piano. Pamela folds her arms
          across her chest defiantly.

<b>                          DICK
</b>           It's just a chorus--

          Bob whistles what will end up being the Robin's part of the
          song.

          Dick is completely deflated.

</b>           MRS Travers! My point is that,

           the very enemy of sentiment and
           whimsy. She is truthful, she
           doesn't sugar coat the darkness in
           the world that these children will
           eventually come to know. She
           prepares them for it, she deals in
           honesty. One must clean one's room;
           it won't magically do it itself!
          She waves the script in the air.

          Dick, Don and Bob look out of the window as the pages flutter
          downwards and spread themselves over the Disney lot.

          Margaret sweats as she hangs out laundry whilst desperately

          Ginty and Biddy run in and out of the sheets, chasing a large
          hen that squawks and flaps its wings trying to escape the
          girls.

          She runs at him and swings her high into the air with one
          arm, catching Biddy with the other.

<b>                          MARGARET

          Travers throws his jacket to the ground and begins to chase
          the hen, tearing through the clean sheets and treading them
          into the ground.

          Margaret look at the dirty sheets and shrugs.
          The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the
          poor little hen runs for its life. Even the dog joins in,
          Margaret goes to retrieve the discarded jacket and sees a
          whisky bottle protruding from the inside pocket, she slips it
          back inside - out of sight, out of mind.

          Ginty dives on the hapless bird, who pecks her soundly and
          scarpers. It's chaos. Travers, the girls, the dog and the
          evasive hen running into each other, falling over each other,
          cursing and laughing.

          Biddy and Moya sleep but Ginty is awake, the hen snuggled
          firmly under her arm. She can hear the tense voices of her
          parents.

          Mickey Mouse - applying face cream, then hand cream, her face
          is screwed into a twist of unhappiness.

          Walt walks towards the music room, visibly moved by the song,
          a cough rattling in his throat.

</b>
          Also in lamplight, Dick Sherman sits at his piano. Bob asleep
          on a couch in the corner. Walt pushes the door open, Dick
          knows he's there but keeps tinkling away.

          sighs, sits next to Dick on the stool.

          Pamela sits by the pool, arms clasped around her, looking at

          Ginty sits on the front step of the porch, arms clasped
          around her body, face to the sky.
          The sounds of the evening closes in - crickets, the last
          deafening chorus of the birds.
          Travers walks up the path to their home, trailing his suit
          jacket over his shoulder, his shirt and tie loosened. His
          shirtsleeves are marked with sweat. His face is a study of
          something close to despair.
          He looks up to see Pamela sitting on the front step and
          immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of
          greeting.

          She goes back indoors and slams the door behind her. Ginty
          gets up to go indoors and Travers catches her by the arm.
          He swallows hard, eyes welling.

          He coughs to stop a crying jag and leaves her alone on the
          porch.
          Ginty is unnerved by her Travers' demeanor, she creeps around
          to the side of the house where she watches her father appears
          in the window of the washroom. She doesn't know what to do as
          he leans his head against the wall and breaks down sobbing.

          Travers buys two immense sticks of fairy floss and hands them

          Ginty appears in the tent's entrance. On first glance she
          sees only an unidentified group of local drinkers. Relief
          begins to dawn and she turns away.
          It is then that she hears Travers laugh, and turns back to
          see the group part, revealing Travers at its centre.

          hand.

          Despairing she looks up and sees her mother, carrying Moya,
          in the entrance. Her mother's face falls and crumples.

          Travers steps heavily, one at a time, up the steps onto the
          dais, and finds his way to the speaker's podium. Margaret
          and Ginty watch, hearts in mouths, Biddy blissfully unaware.

          Randolph looks at Travers with displeasure and then at one of
          the bank staff.

          But then Travers momentarily looks lost, a slight breeze tugs
          the speech notes from his hand and they float down in front
          of the dais.

          Ginty glances to her mother and then, on trembling legs,
          makes her way forward and up the stairs onto the dais.

          and topples off the stage. There's an audible, horrible snap
          as he lands in an undignified pile. But, despite his ugly

          Nervous, hopeful, Ginty withdraws a folded sheet of paper
          from her pocket.

<b>                          GINTY
</b>           I wrote a poem for you. It - it
           won first prize, at school.
          Travers takes the page, tries to hold it steady in his
          shaking hand.

<b>                          GINTY (CONT'D)
</b>           Would you like me to read it to
           you?
          The agony as Ginty watches the shaking hand. Finally, the
          humiliation is too much for Travers. He scans the page
          rapidly and lowers his hand.

<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>           It's hardly Yeats, is it?
          Ginty is devastated. But more than this there's a hardening
          in her small face, a sense of disillusionment that so far
          she's held in check. Here are the first signs of the Pamela
          to come.

          Pamela rushes from the rehearsal room, down the corridor, her
          face twisted, desperately trying to maintain composure. Don
          rushes out after her.

<b>                          DON
</b>           Mrs Travers!
          He stops, recognizing she doesn't need to be followed.

<b>          INT. KITCHEN - GOFF HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          Ginty rummages through kitchen cabinets, drawers, the trash
          but doesn't find what she's looking for.

                         

<b>          EXT. DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY
</b>
          Pamela rushes past Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck, through the
          lot, past Ralph - who's taking his lunch at the cafeteria -
          and towards a patch of green, a communal lawn at the back of
          a soundstage.

                         

<b>          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          Ginty fights the smell of the warm rubbish in the midday sun
          as she ransacks the outdoor trash cans, finally finding what
          it is she's looking for.

                         

<b>          EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY
</b>
          Pamela flops down onto the ground, digging her fingers into
          the dirt and lawn.

                         

<b>          INT. TRAVERS BEDROOM - GOFF HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          Ginty creeps into her father's room, he sleeps fitfully, and
          presses the half-full bottle into his hand. Covering both
          hand and bottle with his bed covers before leaving the room.

                         

<b>          EXT. GRASS AREA - DISNEY STUDIOS - BURBANK - DAY
</b>
          Pamela picks a daisy, finds a stray twig and arranges them in
          the grass.

<b>                          RALPH
</b>           Mrs?
          Pamela looks up, her eyes are red rimmed but she's not
          crying.

<b>                          RALPH (CONT'D)
</b>           I, uh, brought you a tea.
          He hands her the tea in a takeaway cup.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           It's blasphemy to drink tea from a
           paper cup.
          Ralph, shifts nervously from foot to foot. He's not quite
          sure what to say to her or why he brought the tea.
          Pamela puts the tea down and continues to fiddle with bits
          and pieces of twig and bloom that she's plucking from the
          area around her.

<b>                          RALPH
</b>           Everything okay Ma'am? Would you
           like me to drive you home?

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           All the way to England? Yes,
           please.
          Ralph lowers himself onto his haunches.

<b>                          RALPH
</b>           You got family back there Mrs?

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           You're an impertinent man you know?
           You ask an awful lot of questions
           that have no relevance to you being
           able to carry out your duties.

<b>                          RALPH
</b>
<b>                          (LAUGHING)
</b>           I know! I do, do that. Yes!

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           And you have no barometer.
          Ralph is confused.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           Let us say that I haven't family
           who'd notice whether I was halfway
           across the world or sitting in my
           living room.
          She pulls a thread from the hem of her skirt, ties two twigs
          together.

<b>                          RALPH
</b>
<b>                          MA'AM; I--
</b>          Ralph sees that she has a little collection of things, he
          looks around for some more. Pamela takes a stick and digs a
          small line through the grass then hands it to him.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Make a little furrow, there.
          Ralph dutifully does as he's told, looking over his shoulder
          for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil.
          Ralph pokes the ground, thinking.

<b>                          RALPH
</b>           I gotta kid.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Well, most people do.

<b>                          RALPH
</b>           Jane-- she's got all kinds of
           troubles.
          Pamela raises an eyebrow.

</b>           Handicapped you know? Myelitis-- 
           transverse.

</b>           She's in a wheelchair see? That's
           why I concern myself with the
           weather-- sunny day she can sit out
           in the garden. Rainy day I have to
           leave her cooped up inside.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Worry `bout the future, but then I
           stop cuz you can't do that. Only
           today.
          Pamela takes the plastic lid off the paper cup and pokes
          holes in it.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Now look.
          She takes the lid, twigs now sticking out of the poked holes
          and places it in the centre of what we now see is one of
          Pamela's tiny parks, she gently rest a leaf on the twig
          struts forming a roof.

<b>                          PAMELA (CONT'D)
</b>           It's a band stand.
          She takes the cup of tea and gently pours the steaming liquid
          into Ralph's trench, which runs all the way around the park.

<b>                          RALPH
</b>           A river!

</b>           Hey! I wish I could take her there!
          He points at the miniature park.

</b>           Wouldn't that be nice?

<b>          INT. GINTY BIDDY &amp; MOYA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Ginty, Biddy and Moya sleep soundly, Ginty clutching the poem
          to her chest.
          The door creeps open and Margaret stands in the shadows
          looking at her children, tears stream down her face but she
          seems calm, something has crossed over in her eyes. There's
          just nothing there--

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>
<b>                          (WHISPERING)

           All the hope is in the bottom of
           that bottle, Helen.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I want you to take care of the

          Ginty is groggy, she doesn't understand.

<b>                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
</b>           Watch over them.
          Ginty sits up.

<b>                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
</b>           I know you love your father more.
           But one day you'll understand.

<b>                          GINTY
</b>           What?
          Margaret leaves the room and Ginty is straight out of bed
          following her. Behind, in the room, Moya has awoken and is
          crying.

                         

<b>          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - ALLORA - NIGHT
</b>
          Ginty runs out onto the porch where she sees her mother in
          her white nightdress striding purposefully through the garden
          like some ethereal ghost.

<b>                          GINTY
</b>           Mother!
          She runs out into the yard but stops as she hears Biddy.

<b>           BIDDY (O.S.)
</b>           Ginty!
          Ginty turns back to the house and then back towards her
          mother but Margaret has disappeared into the darkness.

<b>                          GINTY
</b>
<b>                          (CALLING)

          The baby is screaming now.

          Ginty wrenches the eiderdown off the bed and wraps Biddy in
          it, she scoops Moya up from the crib.

<b>                          BIDDY
</b>           Where's ma?

<b>                          GINTY
</b>           Once upon a time there were three
           little girls alone in a house.
           They were frightened of the big
           wide world just outside the door.
          She takes them through the hallway, stopping momentarily
          outside the door to her fathers bedroom. It is slightly ajar
          and he looks incredibly frail and delirious.

<b>                          GINTY (CONT'D)
</b>           They were so afraid.
          She moves forward, her eyes flit to the front door, expecting
          her mother to be standing there any minute but there is
          nothing.

                         

<b>          EXT. CREEK - NIGHT
</b>
          The mud-stained hem of Margaret's nightdress sweeps along the
          ground, as her feet move towards, and then into, the water of
          the creek. One step, two, three, the water coming up over her
          ankles, soaking the nightgown.

<b>           GINTY (V.O.)
</b>           But the stars were guarding them,
           they glittered as they spoke "We

           way to the magical ladder which
           will bring them all the way up to

          Biddy and Moya are calming as Ginty places the girls in front
          of the fireplace.

<b>                          GINTY
</b>           And who do you think those
           sparkling messengers sent? Who was
           it that came flying through the
           starry, starry sky to carry us up
           to see them?
          Ginty wraps Moya in a blanket and puts her in Biddy's arms.

<b>                          BIDDY
</b>           An elf?

          Ginty begins to untie Albert from the fence still speaking to
          the girls through the window.

<b>                          GINTY
</b>           Their old Uncle Albert of course!
           (beat, to Biddy)
           Stay right here, be good--
          Ginty climbs atop the horse.

<b>                          BIDDY
</b>           Are you going to the sky?

<b>                          GINTY
</b>           I'm going to find the end of the

           you!

<b>                          BIDDY

<b>          EXT. PADDOCK - NIGHT
</b>
          Ginty rides fast, desperately searching the darkness for her
          mother and turning back frequently to check that the lamp
          still burns on the porch.

                         

<b>          EXT. CREEK - NIGHT
</b>
          Margaret is up to her neck in the freezing water of the
          creek. Shivering cold. She wills herself forward into the
          water. She wants to sink down and simply float away.
          From behind her comes the clip clopping of hooves. Margaret
          turns her head and there, atop the horse, is Ginty.
          Margaret begins to weep.
          Ginty jumps down from the horse and rushes to her mother,
          wading into the water to grab hold of her.
          Ginty bobs up and down in front of her mother in the deep
          water.

          Presently, the phone rings. Pamela almost jumps out of her

          An enormous carpetbag - similar to the one Pamela carries -
          plonked on the living room table and there beside it,
          upright, imposing and matronly is AUNT ELLIE herself. Hair
          scraped back, hands neatly perched inside her apron pocket -
          a very different version but Mary Poppins all the same.
          Ginty looks on in awed silence as Ellie begins to remove an

          Ralph drives Pamela up to the entrance to the park. Two

          open to reveal Walt Disney waiting for Pamela.

          Pamela steps out of the car and her eyes nearly pop out of

          and excitement.

          Ralph hovers at the car, filling his eyeballs with as much
          Walt Disney as he can get before he has to drive away.

          She proffers a pen and paper but Walt is prepared, he takes a
          signed postcard with his face on it from his top pocket and
          hands it to the woman.

          The woman looks expectantly at Pamela who just snorts. she
          realizes she's getting nothing and, clutching her precious
          postcard to her chest, melts back into the crowd who part
          like the red sea for Walt and his guest.

          There is a protracted silence as they walk, both encompassed
          by their own thoughts. The sunshine, the joyful crowds just
          background colour.
          They pass by a store front and Walt glances up at the window.
          It reads: Elias Disney Contractor Est. 1895. Pamela notices
          the look but doesn't say anything.

          her back to him as she folds clothes, a look of deep

          with tiredness.

          hands pages to Bob and pages to Dolly. Don and Dolly drop to

<b>          EXT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          Ginty skips up the path, clutching a brown paper bag. She
          ruffles Andrew's fur before entering the house.

<b>          INT. GOFF HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          Ginty senses something wrong, she hears hushed, urgent and
          emotional voices in the hall. She pokes her head into the
          hallway. There, huddled together, whispering are her mother,
          the doctor and Aunt Ellie.
          Ellie is holding a pile of blood stained sheets.
          Ginty stands frozen, trying to still the panicked beating of
          her heart.
          Margaret spies Ginty and moves towards her as if in slo-mo.
          There are flecks of blood on her dress. She is ashen,
          shattered. She comes down to Ginty's level.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>
<b>                          DADDY--
</b>          Ginty cannot react.
          Margaret sweeps her into her arms and Ginty drops the brown
          paper bag; it tears and scatters pears all over the floor.
          Ginty's eyes fix on Aunt Ellie's umbrella on the back of the
          chair, drawn into its beady black eyes.

<b>                          GINTY
</b>           I want to see my father.

<b>                          MARGARET

<b>                          GINTY
</b>           I want to see him!
          Suddenly she turns into a wildcat - lashing, thrashing,
          biting, screaming. Nothing will stop her seeing Travers.

<b>                          AUNT ELLIE
</b>           Let her go Margaret.
          Margaret is forced to let go and Ginty runs for her father's
          bedroom.

                         

<b>          INT. TRAVERS' BEDROOM - DAY

          Ginty stands in the bedroom, a long way from the bed. She
          stands there, it seems, for an eternity. Then, finally, step
          by step she draws closer. The empty bottle on the floor. The
          sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted
          with blood. The front of her father's nightdress is also
          bloodstained. Ginty's eyes reach his face. Travers lies, eyes
          open, mouth open, teeth slightly red-stained, neither
          peaceful nor distressed. Just-- nothing.

<b>                          GINTY
</b>           I dropped the pears.
          She perches on the edge of the bed and takes his hand.

<b>                          GINTY (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm sorry daddy.
          Ellie appears in the doorway, Ginty addresses her without
          turning around.

<b>                          GINTY (CONT'D)

          A black London Taxi pulls up outside the house. Pamela climbs
          out of the car, struggling to pull her huge Mickey Mouse out
          too.

<b>          INT. PAMELA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Pamela sits in a chair in the living room watching in
          darkness. She gently closes her eyes, ringed with sadness and
          a lifetime's despair.
          There's a knock at the door and she jolts awake, she doesn't
          know how long she's been asleep but it's black outside. She
          gets up and rushes to the door as quickly as her feet will
          take her.
          She swings it open.

          Pamela sits at the table, as Disney carries in a tray with a
          teapot, a milk jug, a sugar bowl and two cups. These he
          places on the table and proceeds to pour tea.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           Milk. The milk goes in first.
          He attends to it.

</b>           And whiskey. I'll have whiskey in

          Disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter. She takes
          it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup.

           a movie house - from Leicester to

           of my kids, and other kids and
           their mothers and fathers for
           generations to come, George Banks
           will be honoured. George Banks will
           be redeemed. George Banks and all
           he stands for will be saved.

          Pamela takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at
          the tarmac.
          She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes
          again and tucks her feet tidily together. She folds her hands
          neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.

          The porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn't even bother
          hovering for a tip.
          Pamela turns and it's like deju vu - the flowers, the
          chocolates, the champagne, a VIP invitation to the premiere
          of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins. And, of course, the ubiquitous

          The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo
          pulls up to the kerb. Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up
          but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person
          in America.

          It's spectacular! Disney's biggest Hollywood opening. Bulbs
          flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red
          carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters
          stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their
          hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens
          play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream
          every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and
          posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces
          up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing
          for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is
          completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest
          party you could ever go to.

          Ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds. Onlookers
          press their faces against the windows trying to make out who
          is inside. Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with
          them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.

          The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out.
          He rushes round to Pamela's side and helps her from the car.
          Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm
          up to shield her eyes. It's too much.

<b>                          RALPH

           This is your night. None of this
           would be possible without you.
          She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks
          into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic
          whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: "Who is
          that?" "Is that anyone?" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and
          Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.
          Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and
          Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved
          hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy
          train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds
          of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.

          Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the
          same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin
          to dim. The overture begins--
          We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade
          and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers
          old melody's rings in her ears.
          We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain
          with Pamela.
          She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing,
          humming, sad, happy, joyous.
          Intercut with images from Pamela's childhood and the voices
          of Bert and Jane -
          Ellie's parrot head umbrella--

<b>                          BERT
</b>           You know, begging your pardon, but
           the one my heart goes out to is
           your father.
          The carousel horses at the Allora fair--

<b>                          BERT (CONT'D)
</b>           There he is in that cold, heartless
           bank day after day, hemmed in by
           mounds of cold, heartless
           money.
          The tuppence and rolling pears--

<b>                          BERT (CONT'D)
</b>           I don't like to see any living
           thing caged up.
          Uncle Albert with Ginty on his back, carrying her river
          soaked mother back to the house--

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Father in a cage?
          Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father's hand--

<b>                          BERT
</b>           They makes cages in all sizes and
           shapes, you know.
          The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed--

<b>                          BERT (CONT'D)
</b>           Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets
           and all.

          Rapt.

<b>                          MICHEAL
</b>           You won't ever leave us will you?

<b>                          JANE
</b>           Whatever would we do without you?

<b>                          MARY POPPINS
</b>           I shall stay until the wind
           changes.
          And then an image from the film:
          George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined
          London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.
          Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.
          Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her
          shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud
          but people are noticing, looking at her.
          Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She
          reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.

<b>                          WALT
</b>           It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's
           alright. Mr Banks is going to be
           all right. I promise.
          Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It's
          all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.

<b>                          PAMELA
</b>           No, no. It's just that-- I can't, I
           can't abide cartoons!
          We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the
          film: Let's Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are
          smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent
          now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to
          mouth along with the lyrics.
          And in her head one final image appears.
          Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window,
          sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken
          understanding of what is to come, before his close with
          tiredness.

<b>           TRAVERS (V.O.)
</b>           Never. I promise. I will never lose
           you.

<b>          EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY
</b>
          The shadow of an umbrella leaves the ten-year-old Ginty
          sitting in the lush grass, arms wrapped tightly around her
          chest, face to the sky as a smile breaks free across her
          face.

<b>           TRAVERS (V.O.)

<b>                          (SINGING)
</b>           Winds in the East
           Mist coming in--
          The shadow of an umbrella, floats higher and higher--

<b>                          TRAVERS
</b>           --Like something is brewing,
           about to begin--
          And further and further--

</b>           But I feel what's to happen, all

<b>                          HAPPENED BEFORE--
</b>          And the umbrella floats up, up, up into the atmosphere and

<b>                         AWAY--
