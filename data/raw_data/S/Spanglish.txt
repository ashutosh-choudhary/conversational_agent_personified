<b>1   INT. BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE - MALE FORM - LATE AFTERNOON      1
</b>
    A shape fills the lower portion of the screen. It is a man's
    back..... a perfect back... good dark color, slim, muscular.
    LATIN MUSIC PLAYS... a song.... if you understood the words
    you would hear love confronted and considered in a very
    specific way...We are in a Mexico City suburb. The day is
    hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the
    first indication that we are in slow motion..Perfect red
    fingernails come into view...and now a woman's hand goes
    beautifully to work...part sensual back scratch, part
    massage. The hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb
    probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his
    ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down --
    and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for
    another trip down his upper body...
    MAIN TITLES BEGIN: Full titles, minute after minute of titles
    with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30
    minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and
    rub, the man making sounds of pleasure. The hand is getting
    tired. Flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work...The
    unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a
    single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand
    complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as
    TITLES CONTINUE.....The new hand, wearing a wedding ring,
    goes to work then it too stops to rest..the man says
    something in Spanish...important for us because it will
    establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we
    understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. She
    replies in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty
    laugh, that her hands are tired. We understand. The man tells
    her to continue. She continues, the rub now desultory and
    resentful. She stops for another rest. The man wants more and
    grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view
    for the first time. She says, in Spanish, with no particular
    anger, "you said you would never push me around again. If you
    do, I will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own
    back as high as you want." (NOTE: All Spanish dialogue will
    be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish
    speaking..working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc.)
    For now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue.
    Even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic
    argument in Spanish. This is no longer a massage we envy.
    This back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord
    and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of
    their marriage.

    Showing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school
    bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road.
    We now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks
    up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word,

    "Cristina." When the man protests her stopping she indicates
    they should both run and meet their daughter. He waves her
    off. Stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room.....

    As CRISTINA, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to
    step down. She sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly,
    digging into her little pack to pull out an English book
    which she displays with pride. Now she steps down from the
    bus and, as she walks TOWARD CAMERA, narration begins. The
    voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see.

              To Princeton University's Director
              of Admissions: In considering me
              for a scholarship you have asked
              for, and have every reason to
              expect, an essay from me about
              myself. And, as a clever high
              school graduate, I of course
              realize the subtext of this essay
              about who I am and why I want to
              enter Princeton, is actually to
              make clear to you why you should
              have me. I have gotten tips, from
              friends who have preceded me to
              college, that being a Latina, with
              my grades, list of activities and
              relative poverty, I am as good as
              in if I simply do the dance and
              work in a word like
              "bipolarization" every so often.
              And while I love dances -- this
              dance of self is one I am afraid to
              master.

                   lights up)
              I prefer to write about my mother.

</b>
    A drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20's. As mother
    and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man
    getting out. He nods in another direction calling our
    attention to a police car parked off the street. The woman
    does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her
    father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the
    child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is
    disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially
    when the child seems briefly hurt. The woman's husband looks
    from the window and sees the ominous man coming. The woman
    now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so
    she does not see what is transpiring.

    This room is directly across from the husband's room. The
    woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show
    the man a huge store of Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches.
    The man gives her husband some money..all the time the woman
    is chattering to distract the girl. Looking off --the woman
    grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money. The
    undercover cop begins shouting orders. The woman raises her
    voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles
    her daughter.

              There was never any pretense that
              the gorgeous, vital, clever,
              temperamental animal that was my
              mother ever for a heartbeat
              considered having any life of her
              own. She ignored all her needs and
              was alive only for me. It was
              terrific.

    As she watches her daughter chew a cookie. Her daughter
    begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a
    glow we have not yet seen. And all the while she eyes the
    action in the next room. Her husband makes a break for the
    window. The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing
    to fire a warning shot. The woman moves ever so quickly to a
    shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her
    daughter, making much over the kid's new school books. It is
    an impressive charade.

    And just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing,
    she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the
    shot.. The woman asks her daughter what she learned
    today..the daughter says she was taught a little English.
    Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband
    toward the front door where other police await. Her daughter
    starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her..brandishing
    the Spanish/English book and asking her to say something.

                 Hi.
    The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even
    though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the
    back of a police car.(Note: Mexican police DO NOT duck the
    perpetrator's head WHEN LOADING THEM IN THE BACK SEAT..they
    just allow the concussion.) It seems the mother will save her
    child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the
    police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her
    father as the car pulls away. The child is stricken. A tear
    starts to form in her eye. Her mother acts quickly. We are
    about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of
    will..the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power
    pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in
    Spanish.

                 "One tear..only one...so make it a
                 good one." This was my mother's
                 instruction to me.

    As she complies..one great tear forming and falling..Her
    mother's thumb wipes it away..But now her eyes well with more
    tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and
    resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little
    head...the eyes clear.

               her own best thoughts by sifting
               through her own words.
     The mother stops talking in mid-sentence, realizing she has
     just solved something and makes a note.

               tell my mother how much I loved

                We moved into a place managed by my
                mother's aunt. My mother worked two
                jobs in two local stores paying a
                total of 450 dollars a week...

     Cristina taking a snack from the refrigerator..smiling at the
     note her mother left...lighting a burner and melting cheese
     on a tortilla.

               But we were fine. We had it down.
               If only I could have stayed six.
     The CAMERA MOVES QUICKLY from the child to:

</b>
     The courtyard is lit with colored lights and candles..a
     wedding reception is in progress -

<b>     EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE BRIDE.
</b>
     Gorgeous round and full cheeks stretched into a deep,
     explosive smile.
     BACK TO SCENE... music plays and we focus on Cristina, now
     nearing 12 years of age..dancing with her mother and some
     other smaller children.. The mother eyes the muscular back of
     a Great Looking Man...who turns, and quickly oozes quality
     sex appeal. She is turned on..They talk in Spanish...him
     saying something hushed like, "I have been afraid to talk to
     you. I need oxygen when I look at you." She indicates the six
     children she is dancing with and offers to include him in
     some ring around the rosey dance...He indicates the magic of
     just the two of them...She quickly leads her little flock
     away..

<b>     OTHER ANGLE..
</b>
     A reed-thin FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY is staring at them...at
     first the mother thinks this is adorable...the child eyeing
     her as if he were a man..she indicates he should join the
     rest of the children for a dance..

<b>     MOVING WITH THE BOY..
</b>
     As he steps forward and it becomes clear it is Cristina he is
     interested in... Before the mom can do anything about it, he
     asks Cristina to dance and she readily accepts.

<b>     ON CRISTINA..
</b>
     Satellite virginities falling with alarming speed..the first
     time held by a male, the first time held close, the first
     sexy (albeit touchingly awkward) gaze from half-closed male
     eyes which utterly confuses Cristina. He begins to grind his
     hips into his dancing partner.

<b>     ON HER MOTHER.
</b>
     Not confused. It is exactly as if she sees her daughter about
     to be run down by a car..only this time the thing to do is
     scare the car.

     She runs toward the boy -- he sees the force of nature coming
     his way and makes a break but she gets him and actually lifts
     him and throws him to the sidelines. Then pats him on the
     head maternally and goes back to Cristina.

<b>     CRISTINA.
</b>
     Somewhat proud of her mom as the boy leaves the scene.

                 That quickly it was clear she could
                 no longer work two jobs and leave
                 me to my own at night. The
                 following morning she did something
                 about it. A boy I never saw again
                 had changed our lives.

     the busload of domestics into the canyon and up the

<b>THEIR POV.
</b>
DEBORAH NORWICH CLASKY, a cool beauty in her mid 30's, sits
dominating this three generation portrait of the Good Life.
She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirt..She is
a perfect dresser; meaning her clothes seem to say she
doesn't care, while every article is a true and gifted find.
She is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the "don't
hold your breath while you try to find something as terrific"
variety. She is flanked by her mother, EVELYN, 60, who is
drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year
old overweight daughter, BERNICE..who is reading, her
grandmother idly holding her hand..In the immediate area more
rolls of sod wait to be laid.

<b>THE TWO LATINAS.
</b>
As they stand inside the kitchen not sure what to do next.
Then Deborah gestures that they should join her at the
pool..as they start out..

<b>THEIR EXIT.
</b>
Boink..three stooges retro..those French doors were not open
after all. Monica hits first. The women at the pool react.
Deborah and Bernice running. Evelyn momentarily attempts to
join the rush.. she half rises and then thinks better of
it..too late in the day for sudden movements.

             walking into it and instead of

     Deborah grabs at paper towels, gets an ice pack from the
     freezer and then grabs some cash from a bowl in the
     kitchen..She has, moment to moment, the enormous desire to
     feel loved that only the seriously hard to love can
     experience.

     Moments later. As the group arrives at the outdoor table.
     Evelyn makes half-hearted incomplete gestures of shaking
     hands, nodding, indicating a seat...each simple act a test
     which she fails -- every gesture a bit too late and then
     some..simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under
     her belt. In the background workers roll out sod, the yard
     becoming more beautiful even as we look.

               She is my niece. She and her

               She doesn't mean it as a

She indicates a shaded seat. Deborah is protected by hat,
umbrella, sun glasses while her guest sits bareheaded
enjoying the rays and indicates she is fine. Underneath
Deborah's surface is a Russian roulette of deeply felt
emotions..at this moment she is earnest and vulnerable.

</b>
     Deborah is wearing a party dress. They are rolling out the
     last huge cylinder of sod, completing the now beautifully
     manicured backyard. It is hard manual labor involving
     physical strength. The female caterers are complaining that
     it's too heavy but Deborah is undeterred.

<b>                         DEBORAH
</b>
                   (to catering women)
               We can do it. Come on.
     She falls over the roll..getting filthy..but it gives and
     they gain momentum...one of the catering women falling down,
     one losing pace.. Deborah,however, gains the upper hand. Yet,
     even while succeeding, she remonstrates herself.

               Why... do... I... care.. so..
               much.. about.... CRAP?
     And now she wins.. the cylinder of grass rolls all the way
     out and she jumps on the seam in victory. She is dirty,
     spent and triumphant..the components for a solid sexual
     experience..and, in truth, as the exhausted caterers half-
     heartedly applaud the bizarre victory, she has gotten off.
     She looks with mother's pride at the lawn. Then sees John.

She hits a switch at the door and the backyard area is now
fully illuminated -- set up for a dinner party for 20 or
so....all details thought about and done to a "T". This is
the outdoor lighting nobody nails..the twinkling of a half
acre..the path to the pool like a runway to heaven. As she
looks at it all she has a wistful moment.

          There's no wait, no dung, nothing
          you have to do right and yet it's
          perfect. It covers up all your
          dirt and makes things immediately

          just give it time, it roots and you
          can't tell it from the real thing.

     addresses the men who are several tables away. Cristina

He signals her with his eyes and head and then takes a large
but tentative step away from the spot where he was
standing...then additional faster steps. He gestures with
enormous energy for her to follow him to his new spot in the
room. She eyes him suspiciously.

almost hushed, conspiratorial voice.

squirt lighter fluid at the flame of their love. Deborah
looks up at him..intimacy of a different sort.

looks her straight in the eye..And walks back to   the spot

     Open, smiling, trusting. Trying to get a laugh out of her.

     Deborah gestures impatiently for her to fall into step and
     come with her.

     The biggest, baddest, BLACKEST SUV..there is some subtle
     custom work so the vehicle impacts us in ways we cannot quite
     fathom. Deborah is wiping away a tear as she gets in and
     shares a woman to woman moment with Flor.

     back seat..Georgie..

               whole party paying attention you
               refused.
     As she puts the car in gear...Georgie sings insanely well.
     But he's just two lines into an old blues standard:

               It doesn't do any good now,
               Georgie.
     She presses a button on her dash and a glass partition comes
     up between front and back seat thereby cutting him off in mid-
     song. Flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a
     divider between parent and child. But Deborah is calling for
     her to pay attention to the car's navigation screen.. a
     Spanish voice says, "route guidance system starting."

     is thrown by the amount of oddness..All the while Georgie is
     singing his little heart out in the back seat. Flor,amused by
     the boy, suppresses a smile...maybe the first time in her
     life she's had to suppress joy. But Deborah never misses

           I worked in a kitchen once in New
           York that got four stars. It was
           like a line formed for the chance
           to become an asshole. People's

               nauseous..but with four there's no
               place to go but, "Oh my God, they
               took away a star."
                   (musing)
               Three..three and a half. That's
               what you want..No. Wrong! Three and
               a half you feel disappointed that
               you just missed out on four. You
               know what you want? Three and a
               quarter..

               It would mean you're good..but
               you're not good enough to feel
               disappointed that you just missed
               out on excellent..but nothing truly
               bad happened, you still got your
               three and a quarter stars. Which
               encourages you to try and
               improve..And you still get enough
               respect so that you can get good
               people to work with you..Business
               is good but not crazy. You're right

          her. But they were starkly
          different. Privacy and dignity were
          the same word to my mother.
          Naturally, when she found herself
          sitting next to a man who cried
          over his child's hurt she had no

Meanwhile, he has stopped for traffic near the end of the

     she wants is a way to say, "try it on" in a manner which is
     not a request..or order, but is, rather, friendly and caring.

               admissions committee, as
               intelligent as you are, have no
               idea how casual and complete such
               acceptance is back home, in the
               land of the size 16 bikini.

               to explore academically at
               Princeton. American women, I

     earned by a few hours of sobbing. She looks touchingly pretty

looks into the mirror.

To see Bernie in the foreground as Flor looks on..nods
approval and leaves.

The fit of the clothes is as mystifying as it is nice..she
picks up another shirt..checks the size tag and then studies
it a bit.

     are singing an old song...something like "LUSH LIFE" -

     The Claskys are engaged in sex. John's brief sounds are
     exuberant..they shift position so that Deborah is on top
     BRINGING DEBORAH INTO A CLOSE SINGLE. Suddenly her smile
     fades - she hits the skids.

     He speaks to her in Spanish..a lavish, poetic compliment.
     Flor, in full control, says, in Spanish.."Would you please
     just find out what she wants." Evelyn joins them.

                She can't because of her daughter.

          If she didn't tell us about her
          child she has to have a deep sense
          of privacy. We can figure out how

     walk away and she is thrown enough by the statement to
     actually stumble as she looks back at him...then, before

His kind eyes.

This is real eye contact..two vaguely humiliated people
finding real company for an instant. Without thought, she
duplicates his gesture and pats his back.

            Simpático, yes.
And when he seeks to add another pat, he misses, because she
is out of her chair..(This is as intimate as John has been
with another woman since he was married..) He calls out to
stop her.

flash of worry that he has inadvertently come on to her.

      The pad, in effect, lends subtitles to Flor's words. Cristina
      winces with the words she records even while punctuating
      perfectly.

          No. I'm kidding..Instead of a
          platter -- I'll just build a sea
          glass building and serve fish
          inside... Great, Cristina..Why
          don't you count it and..

<b>                    CRISTINA
</b>
          I have... Many times..I didn't
          sleep. I counted.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>
          So what's the damage...total?
Her eyes locked on his.

<b>                    CRISTINA
</b>
              (dead serious)
          It depends on whether you consider
          these four a color other than
          green, brown or clear..
She takes them from her pocket.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>
          Well, this one is borderline.

<b>                     CRISTINA
</b>
          I agree.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>
          Oh my God, you found a blue..Nobody
          finds a blue..You know how a blue
          happens? I mean, before the ocean
          blasts it for 30-40 years. Somebody
          had to throw away an old Milk of
          Magnesia bottle. You know what Milk
          of Magnesia is?

<b>                    CRISTINA

          Unfortunately.
He smiles broadly. The kid's a trip. He likes her.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>
          So how much for the whole deal?

<b>                    CRISTINA
</b>
              (unable to look at him)
          Eleven hundred and one dollar.
He reacts..then..

                Okay. We'll finish dealing with it

      She gasps..

      Flor asleep -- Cristina awake, alert..footsteps. She hears
      John enter. She moves slowly so as not to awaken Flor.

<b>115   INT. HALLWAY - ONE A.M.                                    115

      walking into the kitchen. Her eye goes to the hall table on
      which there sits a fat envelope with her name on it.

<b>116   INT. CLASKY BEDROOM - ONE A.M.                             116

      be late. He is disappointed.

<b>117   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT - ON CRISTINA                     117
</b>
      Not aware of being observed..opens the envelope and takes out
      a thick wad of cash..almost swoons..as she goes about hiding
      it..she is jolted by her mother's whispered incredulity...

<b>                             FLOR

                Cristina..
      She turns...the wad of money in her hand..

</b>
      The best chef in America has just fixed himself a snack as a
      salve to his spirits. It's a little like Dagwood Bumstead as
      a culinary genius..This is a snack we will remember and
      copy...John is approaching a perfect moment...and this is a
      guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the fullest...

<b>119   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM                            119

      He carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just
      about to take his first bite when he hears emotional Spanish
      voices approaching. He looks up.

<b>      ANGLE ON FLOR AND CRISTINA
</b>
      As they enter. Cristina translating her mother's words.

<b>                          CRISTINA
</b>
                My mother wishes me to represent
                exactly what she says, nothing
                else.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                         74.
</b>






And so, for the remainder of the scene, Flor will speak in
Spanish and Cristina will not only translate but render her
mother's emotion, sometimes including body language. It is
not only a translation but a reenactment.

<b>                    CRISTINA AS FLOR
</b>
          May I talk to you?

<b>                    JOHN
</b>
          You mean your mother....
Cristina nods...not comfortable breaking the rule of only
speaking for her mother...She faces him, her back to Flor.

<b>                    JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>
              (looking at Flor)
          Sure you can talk to me..
Cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in Spanish..

<b>                    CRISTINA AS FLOR
</b>
          I don't have to sleep first?

<b>                    JOHN
</b>
          What's wrong?
Flor waves the money..Cristina waves an empty hand as she
speaks for her mother.

<b>                    CRISTINA AS FLOR
</b>
          Did you give this money to my
          daughter?

<b>                    JOHN
</b>
          I made this little deal..with all
          the kids to...

<b>                    CRISTINA AS FLOR
</b>
              (interrupting)
          Please..
Flor advances on him past her daughter so Cristina now
translates from the background.

<b>                    CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D)
</b>
          You don't tell or ask the mother
          when you give a child a fortune for
          looking on the beach for
          stones..what is the word for this..

<b>                       JOHN
</b>
          Sea glass?
On hearing the translation of "sea glass" an exasperated Flor
turns so that her back is to John as Cristina admonishes him.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                           75.

<b>                      CRISTINA AS FLOR
</b>
            No..not a name for the stones..a
            name for the act..what you did..

<b>ON FLOR..
</b>
As she spits out the word to her daughter.

<b>                        FLOR
</b>
            EngreÌdo.

<b>ON JOHN..
</b>
As his eyes shift to Cristina fearing the word he will hear.

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
            Oh, no..engreÌdo's going to be
            rough.

<b>ON CRISTINA..
</b>
Reluctantly taking the emotional stance of her mother to
deliver the word.

<b>                      CRISTINA
</b>
                (briefly being herself)
            It's hard to translate.
She takes half a beat..finds the word and now spits it out.

<b>                        CRISTINA AS FLOR
</b>
            Smug.
John gets up and takes a conciliatory step toward Flor so
that now Cristina is in the middle looking up at them as she
translates for John

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
            I had no idea it would amount to
            that kind of money..I thought ---
            sort of tops fifty dollars.

<b>                      CRISTINA AS FLOR
</b>
            Fifty dollars is a lot of money..

<b>                      JOHN
</b>
            Okay. Right.
He has no idea where to take it from here -- the two females
look as he searches for the right thing to say..

<b>                       JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>
                (sighing to himself)
            Ah, shit..
That fast Cristina translates.. Before Flor can react. John
talks directly to Flor..quiet,compassionate, a bit beaten.

<b>                    JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>
          I'm sorry....I get why you are
          upset. It might not look it but I
          am good at getting things. Doing
          something about it is something
          else..I was going to talk to you
          before I actually gave her the
          money..but maybe I should have
          checked before I started the whole
          thing.
              (he smiles/they don't)
          I know what it's like when you feel
          your kid is being messed with..I
          get the message. It won't happen
          again. It's late..I'm sure we'd all
          like...
Flor lets it out...her daughter hard pressed to keep up.

<b>                    CRISTINA AS FLOR
</b>
          To what..sleep? If this was small
          enough to be helped by some little
          apology, I would be a fool to bring
          it up..I need to say more no matter
          what the result. I need to be
          impolite. You leave someone else's
          child alone. It's simple, no? It
          is too easy for children to feel
          contradictions..It encourages
          questioning their parents..and that
          makes them less safe. Your wife
          takes her for rides and changes her
          hair..You give her money. Here..
              (this next sentence
               Cristina translates with
               alarm and adds her own
               question mark.)
          Take back the money????????????
Flor hands John the envelope under her daughter's wrenching
gaze. They begin to exit..but Flor turns inadvertently
bumping into her daughter. Her voice softens.

<b>                    CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D)
</b>
          I did not mean to be angry to you -
          only emotional..
They turn to leave. John speaks with sudden volume and
muscle.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>
          What about hypocritical?
Cristina turns back..confused..her mother asks her for a
translation and she complies.. Flor then wearing the same
confused expression.

          Oh, yes. So go lecture
          yourself..you won't need a
          translator for that one...I mean
          what am I lately... A recycling
          bin?..just anyone dump in your
          garbage and hope I make something
          useful out of it...
Flor is confused and getting pissed but he is moving now and
pointing a finger at her.

<b>                    JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>
          Yes, you did the same thing...you
          think I didn't know about altering
          those outfits for Bernie..She tells
          me her stuff....So, am I missing
          something? Is there a real
          difference between that and what
          you are complaining about?
Cristina waits for a comeback from her mother to
translate..but doesn't get one..Instead her mother is a bit
mortified and considerably humbled..the pie smack into the
face.

<b>                    FLOR
</b>
          Sin diferencia. Yo interferÌ.

<b>                    CRISTINA AS FLOR
</b>
          No difference. I interfered.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>
          Okay......I'm still not sure I did
          the right thing keeping it to
          myself. It felt disloyal to
          Deborah..but my daughter really
          needed someone to be kind to her
          right then..so..so.

<b>                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          I'll tell you, it's pretty wild to
          say something and have the other
          person just concede the point. I'm
          dazed here.

<b>                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

<b>                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Because then Cristina will blame

          job...and that guilt...I don't know

Cristina doesn't have to check with her mother on this one.

      As John enters the house, clearly drunk.   There is the sound
      of skittering paws as CHUM approaches.

</b>
                    (cheering)
                Hey, boy, I can use some up
                company.
      But Chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of
      furniture and retrieves a tennis ball and rockets away. John
      follows, weaving a bit.

      As John enters the room to find CHUM proffering the ball to
      Flor who is watching one of video language tapes. She tosses
      the ball without a look or a thought..then starts when she
      sees John standing there. He cheers, seeing her predicament.

When she speaks English, at this point, her words are
halting.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>
          You gotta do something about
          Chum..Your arm's going to go.
She waves it off and hurries to get her tape and get out of
his way. Chum complicates the task, proffering the ball. Flor
wearily throws it.

</b>
          You're doing fantastic.

<b>                    FLOR
</b>
          Now I am like a three year-old.
          Your wife go out.

          She say where?

<b>                    FLOR

          No.
              (on his reaction)
          Sorry.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>
          Listen..I just forgot she was going
          out..don't be a smart ass.
              (jolted by his own remark)
          Uh-oh..well, you and I communicate
          mostly in apologies anyway..I'm
          sorry. I should be whipped. I
          should be stoned- it's been a while
          - I meant to say, I think, don't be
          smart, don't be kind, don't be
          sensitive, don't be beautiful. I
          meant to say, "hi, Flor, good night
          Flor..that show you're watching is
          going to be a hit."
He staggers out. Flor watches his lonely back for a beat and
then urgently gestures Chum to join him. Chum is reluctant,
but relenting, runs and accompanies his appreciative master.
Flor, now alone, finds herself staring at a framed picture of
John in the den. He is younger and smiling. She studies the
picture and then blinks when she realizes her own emotion and
purposefully goes back to her lessons.

                I'm not sure I can explain to you
                the concept of not doing well in a
                class..in this case math...and the
                system kind of insists on the
                illusion that you've learned math --
                so they make you go to summer
                school..It helps them avoid facing
                that they have failed in their
                mission.

                That you're better at everything

                where I might have my nose in
                front.
      Deborah can't think of what single thing Bernice could
      possibly feel superior about. She is genuinely puzzled.

                And that thing is???
      Bernice deeply resents the question..She turns to her mother.

                so wonderful and must have been
                very difficult to achieve.

                The experience was literally mind
                boggling. My mind did boggle. My
                cranial cells stunned. Even if I
                had enough sense of wonder to
                imagine such a school existed; my
                sense of fairness made it
                unthinkable that any school could
                offer this much more than my own..

      cartons on the floor. Deborah, Flor and Cristina engaged in a
      momentous conversation..(NOTE: Throughout the following, and
      quite beside the point, we see Flor periodically make the
      motion of throwing the ball. But we do not cut to Chum,

          No. I hate the damn school. But
          that's because they keep sending my
          daughter home anxiety-ridden,
          mostly over geometry..I mean you
          "get" Bernice..In a decent world
          her school should let her know how
          great she is, right?

          Very right.

          So, don't ask me..I'm worried about

          You don't have to worry about
          Bernice. Nothing is going to change
          that heart.
He looks at her..Out of nowhere overwhelmed by someone
echoing and affirming his deepest most private thoughts about
his daughter..It is odd..being this deeply touched before he

      Deborah does a good-natured "TAKE" accepting Flor's reaction
      as if it where an eccentricity..As Cristina and Bernice board
      the bus, Cristina generally says goodbye to both women,

                I need to talk to you privately,

</b>
                "Honey?"-- Can't now, Mom...I'm
                late..I was looking all over for
                you...keep an eye on the kids. You
                know my secret cell number.

                here..

                What is it? Are you buzzed?

<b>                          EVELYN
</b>
                No. I gave up drinking weeks ago.
                    (on Deborah's reaction)
                Yes. Nobody noticed -- which shows
                I probably conducted myself pretty
                well as a drunk. But duty called
                and I'm sober so may I say just one
                thing.

<b>                          DEBORAH
</b>
                One thing..go ahead...

<b>                          EVELYN
</b>
                Thanks..Deborah, you're going to
                lose your husband and you'll never
                find someone as good. There will
                only be men who you know are cheap
                and shallow and have no real warmth
                in their souls. You may have gotten
                by on those surfaces once but now
                you've been spoiled by a good man
                and you can no longer glide on such
                thin ice. If you do not act
                quickly you will soon cement an
                awful fate for yourself. A life,
                with no hope of repair, which has
                already begun to turn desperate and
                dumb. That's it. Drive safely.
      She grabs a deep breath and then turns and walks to the
      house.

                ...then, when I was driving back
                tonight after I ended the whole

                I'm done with what's his name..a
                relief... ..and now it can be like
                it never happened and then I
                thought that the only hope was that
                I own that it did happen and that I
                take my medicine here..because if
                I'm walking around with what I did
                and you don't know what I
                did..there is a real limit to how
                close we can be..you're with me and
                I'm this person who has this bad
                secret and we aren't really on the
                same page ever again..so the reason
                I took this chance in telling -- is
                because I want us to be good..I
                want us to be close. I want to
                feel like you're not nuts to be in
                love with me..So what I think is we
                should talk till we pass out ..
                Talk till we're so sick of each
                other that there's nothing left to

      snout..Flor loses her thought and tosses the ball.

      Flor shudders at her own sappiness as John opens the
      passenger door for her...very much into his own torture he
      nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in..she
      catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while
      he is clearly fucked up...She is impatient with his

      sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door..The

      She nods..there is almost a moment of relaxation..then the
      anger fires an immediate need..She leans across the seat to
      deliver an urgent message to him. The words come out
      exponentially too forcefully.

anew. The nervousness mounting.

          through my veins..

          Gardens of flowers blossom in my
          body.
He starts to make a comic gesture of awkwardness to get past
the event..she shakes her head at him..driving the words --
pointing emphatically..she will not have her poetry laughed
at..

<b>                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          nightingale undresses on my
          tongue..And under its wings..
He laughs. She stops cold. Looks down..though just seconds
long, this still constitutes the first depression of her
life.

<b>                    JOHN

The downcast eyes rise to see him..

He looks at her...they kiss..It is a kiss without an author.
God at the controls. They break. There is a beat then..

</b>
          Here's something I never asked

Flor looks at him with enormous warmth. Her arms looped
around his neck..aware of the music.

          But I've got to know whether he
          touched her - where he touched her -
          how he touched her - if they broke
          a sweat --- what they said - who
          made the first move - how they left
          it -- if anyone loves anyone or has
          an intention of making contact in
          the future - what she wore - how he
          felt afterwards - whether anyone
          mentioned me..
              (a wail)
          ..whether they held hands when they
          left..
The distinct sound of a door opening and closing from
downstairs.

      John looks up at her - not knowing what to say...he is
      thrown. His demeanor has changed...deeper..serious..

                I'm just so glad you're back.
      Deborah's suddenly classy demeanor provides just the barest
      of footings for them...He looks at her directly for the first
      time since she told him.

<b>                          JOHN

      Evelyn, who has been standing close to the doorway, stands
      clear to let her enter. As Deborah flies in wildly vulnerable
      - her breath racing.

<b>                          DEBORAH
</b>
                I am literally choking on unsaid
                words..seriously. If this were a

                The fact that you didn't just make

      the sewing machine...John enters. He is down, longing and
      finality make for a brutal cocktail..He rubs his head and
      sits near the sewing machine..He glances over and sees Flor's
      Spanish/English dictionary..There is a knock on the door.

                of a night.

                It's good for me to worry about

      in the pool...she opens the glass door Monica bumped into on

      how to handle this...so she goes direct.

                protest)
          No..and we must say "goodbye." I
          don't work here anymore.
She then talks Spanish to Cristina..admonishing her not to
embarrass them..something about Flor being prepared to go
nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity...but
it is said with total calm.

Bernice climbs out of the pool. Meanwhile, a flabbergasted
Cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three
word proddings in Spanish.

      Despite herself, Bernice starts to cry..moans to herself over
      the display...Now, in the background, we hear a subliminal
      human voice. Incrementally it will grow louder and be
      recognizable as Deborah calling Flor from the master bedroom
      window..Bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as
      Flor ignores it...Bernice goes to embrace Cristina.

                     understand)
                I'm sorry you're so sad but this
                could have been so much worse.

      Flor manages..

                    (to Cristina)

                I'll be in front.
      Upset, Cristina runs off. She kisses Bernice..and walks
      toward the house. As she passes under the bedroom..

<b>                          DEBORAH
</b>
                Please come see me.
      And then a crying Cristina appears on the deck. Flor glances
      up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly
      hears the beginning of their exchange

      She stands waiting..walks to the hallway and cranes her head
      to see into rooms, wondering if John is there. Finally, as
      she passes the stairwell, she sees Cristina on an upper
      landing and says, in Spanish, that Cristina should get her
      things and meet her out front. Cristina, agitated, moves off
      to comply...then Deborah appears in the same spot.

                We weren't close..but we were
                connected...in a bad way.

                    (strangely soothed)
                You know something, I think we're
                saying the same thing...Look as
                long as we're doing closure..What
                did you and my husband, John, do
                last night?
      Flor pauses for less of a beat than we would have imagined.

<b>                          FLOR
</b>
                I can only tell you what I did.

</b>
                That will be sufficient.

<b>                          FLOR
</b>
                    (these are tender
                     feelings)
                I became sure of what an incredibly
                lucky woman you are and I must make
                myself not envy you which is hard.
                No, it's not hard. It's impossible.
                Now please..I am exhausted.

<b>                          DEBORAH
</b>
                Same here - believe me.
      Deborah would hug..but it's only an eighth of a gesture
      because Flor has turned to exit, calling for her daughter to
      hurry as she goes.

<b>                          FLOR
</b>
                Cristina, apúrate.

<b>183   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                    183
</b>
      As she exits the house and moves to the gate where she
      punches in the exit code...

<b>      ANGLE ON GATE
</b>
      As it swings open to reveal John...

<b>184   EXT. STREET - DAY.                                         184
</b>
      As she moves alongside him and the gate closes behind her.

<b>                          JOHN
</b>
                I was hanging out here waiting.
                Can't give you guys a lift?
      Flor shakes her head "no." She looks away for a beat so the
      next thing she does is a considered action. She leans forward
      and kisses him on the lips. John looks at her.

<b>                          JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>
                This is killer.
                    (on her confusion)
                Incredibly hard.

<b>                          FLOR
</b>
                Yes, Cari..
      The gate opens and a sniffling Cristina is holding an armful
      of loot.

<b>                          JOHN
</b>
                    (reading Flor)
                Let her have it..party favors.

<b>
</b>

<b>                                                              127.
</b>






      She nods..bites back some emotion and turns from him.

<b>                             FLOR
</b>
                Cristina..

<b>                          CRISTINA
</b>
                Goodbye, Mr. Clasky..I am very
                sorry we will not see each other as
                frequently.
      She offers her hand, which John shakes while patting her on
      the back.

<b>                             FLOR
</b>
                Yes.
      They turn and begin walking down the street.

<b>      SHOT - STONE CANYON
</b>
      The women walking toward camera, John briefly in the
      background...As they begin their walk Flor begins talking in
      Spanish.

<b>                          NARRATOR
</b>
                The first minute we were alone, my
                mother told me that I would no
                longer go to the private school.

<b>                          CRISTINA
</b>
                No. No..You can't. I won't be able
                to forgive you..It will be the end.
                I won't let you.
      And then Cristina moves her hysterics to Spanish as she stops
      walking and her mother takes her hand and pulls her along
      with enormous dedication. CAMERA BEGINS A PULL BACK.
      Cristina dropping presents..picking them up..one of them left
      by the wayside..People noticing..Cristina's conduct violating
      tacit zoning laws.

<b>      CLOSER SHOT..
</b>
      So we can see their faces in the struggle.

<b>185   EXT. BUS STOP..                                            185
</b>
      As they wait...Flor talks sharply to Cristina to control
      herself.

<b>                          NARRATOR
</b>
                My mother changed our lives once
                more. This time because she saw in
                me, to her great alarm, a character
                flaw of some size. She has taught
                me to be a watch dog of my
                character, to control my ambition.
                I am not quite there.

</b>






      One last yelp from Cristina as the bus arrives.

<b>186   INT. BUS - DAY.                                           186
</b>
      Almost empty - it's Saturday. Mother and daughter sit
      together by the giant window in the center of the bus.
      Cristina eyes her mother who is bearing her own heartbreak
      with stoic dignity. The girl is becoming less inconsolable
      and more in need of mothering.

<b>                           NARRATOR (CONT'D)

                For that reason should you choose
                to grant me your scholarship my
                mother, at my request, will be
                relocating to the New York
                Metropolitan Area so that she can
                stay close during my time at
                Princeton.
      Cristina moves closer to Flor, who senses it immediately and
      wraps her in her arms.. kisses her head.

<b>                          NARRATOR (CONT'D)
</b>
                I hope my essay has done her
                justice. I love her with all my
                heart.
