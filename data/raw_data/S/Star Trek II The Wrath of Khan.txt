                   (screens and visual displays are in use): COMMANDER
                   SULU at the helm, COMMANDER UHURA at the Comm Con-
                   sole, DR. BONES McCOY and SPOCK at his post. The
                   Captain is new -- and unexpected. LT. SAAVIK is young
                   and beautiful. She is half Vulcan and half Romulan.
                   In appearance she is Vulcan with pointed ears, but her
                   skin is fair and she has none of the expressionless
                   facial immobility of a Vulcan.

                   is worried; something about all this is familiar.

                   He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in,
                   pulling out TWO CETI EELS -- wriggling items --

                             Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's
                             only remaining indigenous life form;
                             what do you think? They've killed
                             twenty of my people, including my
                             beloved wife. Oh, not all at once
                             and not instantly, to be sure. Their
                             young enter through the ears and wrap
                             themselves around the cerebral cortex.
                             This has the effect of rendering the
                             victim <u>extremely</u> susceptible to
                             suggestion. Later, as they grow,
                             follows madness, paralysis -- and
                             death. These are pets, of course --
                             not <u>quite</u> domesticated.

                   As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets;
                   he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing
                   martinis --

                             benign -- until the end. That was
                             what I learned from watching my wife.

                   At a sign, the helmets are slammed down. As the muffled
                   shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across
                   the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring in-
                   stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men.
                   There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then
                   dazed calm.

                             You must control your prejudices
                             and remember that as a Vulcan as
                             well as a Romulan you are forever
                             a stranger in an alien land.
                             Around you are humans, and as a
                             member of the Starfleet you are
                             unlikely ever to escape their
                             presence or their influence.
                             You must learn to tolerance in addition
                             to all else I have taught you.
                             Tolerance is logical.

                             Starship. If we are to go on actual
                             duty, it is clear that the senior
                             officer aboard must assume command.

                   Kirk, wearing his spectacles, studies the transporter

                   Chekov and Terrell look at each other; they seem a bit
                   stronger.

                             most of his time trying to wring the
                             information out of the people.

                   Saavik approaches Kirk:

                   Kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses:

                             everyone else was dead, it implies
                             that no one remained to turn it off.
                             Those people back there bought escape
                             time for Genesis with their lives.

                   Saavik studies the console.

                   rolling in electronic coding. The others join Kirk.

                   All react. David and Kirk, facing each other, are
                   turned to stone. Bones, Jedda and Chekov turn to look
                   at Carol, wondering. Terrell very casually takes the
                   phaser from Jedda.

                   Terrell fires, hitting Jedda, who was behind David --
                   a killing ray. Jedda dematerializes. Carol SCREAMS
                   and David reacts with horror and guilt.

                   Most importantly, Chekov begins to tremble. Terrell
                   himself is shaken by his reflexive action. He's in

                   David and Saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something.
                   Chekov is close to a seizure. Terrell fights conflicting

                   As though tearing off a leach, Terrell grabs at the
                   wrist recorder and flings it to the ground. A shock-
                   wave of pain hits Terrell. He recovers, trembling and
                   tries to obey. Chekov is shaking badly. Terrell aims
                   his phaser at Kirk. Chekov slowly raises his phaser
                   and aims at Terrell, though his hands are like lead.
                   We THINK Chekov is going to do the right thing. Then,
                   shockingly: Terrell turns his phaser on himself.

                   After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk. He
                   pours a drink, then decides not to have it.

                   He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts.
                   Then he sees the book.

                   Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his
                   friend, and closes his eyes a moment. Almost idly
                   he starts turning pages, looking for a clue. But he
                   can't see the writing -- he rummages through his

                   One of the lenses is broken. It has a deep impact on
