<b>          1 INT. TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 1
</b>

<b>           -EARLY APRIL, 1841-
</b>           We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A

<b>           FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.
</b>
           WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high
           end piece, but it is quite nice.

           WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair
           with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late
           twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,
           is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.
           Someone who has known manual labor in his time.

           Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing
           the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to
           play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:

                         


<b>           INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
           We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being
           thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In
           attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are
           FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women
           are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense
           that for the most part they are people of means.

           The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At
           the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a
<b>           REEL.
</b>
           The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,
           having cut directly from the tune he was previously
           playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no
           way seems possessed with empty servitude.

           Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into
           enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal
           thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear
           that despite their respective races there is much
           admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.

                         


<b>           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
           It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is
           ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We
           see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and
           ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed
           kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,

</b>           she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if
           preparing to pose for a portrait.
           They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.
           He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY
           stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,
           he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his
           greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and
           well and provided for. He goes to his children, and
           hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss
           on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.

                         


<b>           EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
           Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets
           and groves of Saratoga.

           The streets are well populated this morning with many
           people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are
           BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly
           easily - though not always completely - with the whites.
           We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their
           WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south
           and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are
           not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are
           well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" -
           comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.

           As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an
           intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart
           traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the
           muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for
           Solomon to help her across.

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           Solomon...
           Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile
           waving her forward:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Come, Anne. Jump.

           The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.

<b>                          ALONZO MARGARET
</b>           Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make
           it.

                         

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           I will not ruin my dress. Catch
           me!

           Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's
           still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne
           gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon
           replies.

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I will catch you, Anne.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           I will.
           Again, lightly stern:

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           You will.

           And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,
           swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to
           the delighted applause of the children. That done,
           Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.

           As Solomon and his family make their way, among the
           slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.
           As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon
           and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of
           this most handsome and harmonious group should be
           obvious.

           With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the
           STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.
           Suddenly a voice barks out-

<b>           A VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           Jasper! Come on!

                         

<b>           INT. STORE - LATER
</b>
           We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man
           and a supplier of general goods. Solomon greets him

<b>                          WITH:
</b>
<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Mr. Parker.

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.

           With money in hand the Northup children move quickly
           about the store looking for items to purchase.

                         

<b>                          CONTINUED:

           Anne looks over some silks and fabrics. Parker suggests

<b>                          TO SOLOMON:
</b>
<b>                          PARKER (CONT'D)
</b>           A new cravat, Solomon? Pure silk
           by way of the French.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           We are in need of a fresh carry
           all for the Mrs's travels.

</b>           A year's passed? Off to Sandy
           Hill?

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           I am.
           Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL
           from an upper shelf.

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           Something to suit your style, but
           sturdy enough for the forty miles
           round trip.
           Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it.

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           It's beautiful.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>
<b>                          (CAUTIOUSLY)
</b>           At what price?

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           We will take it. Children, come
           see what your father has just
           purchased for me.
           As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the
           new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered
           the store.
           At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY
           HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the
           book sits a LEDGER. Mr. Parker asks of Solomon:

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           If you would sign our condolence
           book. My hope is to find a way to
           forward it to the Widow Harrison.
           Sad days for the nation.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Yes, certainly. Poor Mrs. Harris
           and her children. I hope brighter
           times ahead.

</b>           Jasper looks scared, timid. It's as though he'd like to
           engage, but is unsure of as to how. Noting Jasper, Parker

           Before Parker can finish, the door opens. It's Jasper's
           Master, FITZGERALD. He's stern, clearly displeased.

</b>           Jasper!

</b>           My regrets for the intrusion.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           No intrusion.
           Fitzgerald looks to Solomon. It is a cold glare as
           though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a
           response from a black man. Looking back to Parker:

<b>                          FITZGERALD
</b>           Good day, sir.

           Anne, busy in the kitchen, puts the final touches to the
           meal, which is just about to begin. Solomon, in the
           meanwhile, sits at the head of the table reading from a
           NEWSPAPER. He reads to his children solemn news of the
           funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President
           Harrison.

</b>           "Thus has passed away from earth
           our late President."
           Solomon starts from the top of the article.

</b>           "During the morning, from sunrise,

           Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at

           Solomon and Anne have fun and difficulty putting the
           unruly children to bed. They are tucked in, and each
           given a kiss good night. As Margaret lays down to sleep,
           Anne blows out the candle darkening the room.
           Silhouetted in the doorway, Solomon takes Anne in his

           simple, beautiful gift that is their children.

           Now alone together, we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in
           each other's arms. Beyond being physically close,
           emotionally close, they are just so very comfortable with
           one another. They are the very representation of a
           couple who are made for each other.

                          
           They look at each other for a prolonged time.

           We are just outside the Northup house. A CARRIAGE waits
           with a DRIVER. Anne and the children are dressed for
           travel - Anne sporting HER NEW CARRY ALL. The Driver
           loads bags into the carriage.
           For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss.

</b>           Travel safely.

</b>           Stay safely.
           Anne and the children loaded up, the Driver chides the
           horse and the carriage heads off. Solomon waves a hearty
           good bye to his wife and children.

           Solomon is now out for a stroll. He passes two men - two
           in particular - who stand outside conversing with MR.
           MOON himself: MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON. Brown
           is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and
           intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair
           complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a
           bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes
           him, slightly effeminate.
           Moon, spotting Solomon:

<b>           MR. MOON
</b>           Call the Devil's name... There he
           is now. Mr. Northup...! I have
           two gentlemen who should make your
           acquaintance. Messrs. Brown and
           Hamilton.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           Sir.

<b>           MR. MOON
</b>           Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen
           were inquiring about distinguished
           individuals, and I was just this
           very moment telling them that
           Solomon Northup is an expert
           player on the violin.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           He was indeed.

</b>           Circus too constricting a word to
           describe the talented and merry
           band with which we travel. It is
           a spectacle unlike most have ever
           witnessed. Creatures from the
           darkest Africa as yet unseen by
           civilized man. Acrobats from the
           Orient able to contort themselves
           in the most confounding manners.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           And I myself in aide of Mr. Brown;
           an internationally renowned
           practitioner in the art of
           prestidigitation.

           would provide sufficient pay for
           the expenses of your return from
           New York here to Saratoga.

           Solomon gives the whole deal one last consideration.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           The payment offered is enticement
           enough, as is my desire to visit
           the metropolis.

<b>                          HAMILTON

           Solomon sits down to write a letter; pen poised over
           paper with already a few lines written. But Solomon
           thinks better of it. WITH LITTLE THOUGHT HE TEARS THE

</b>

<b>           -MID TO LATE APRIL, 1841-
</b>           We find ourselves in a roadside pub. It serves the
           purpose of drinking and diversion, and little more. As
           Solomon plays his violin, Brown and Hamilton perform a
           decent, paired magic routine before a SPARSE AUDIENCE NOT

<b>           OF "SELECT CHARACTER."

           After the show, the pub now fairly empty, Solomon,
           Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat. Hamilton and Brown
           drink, but again Solomon abstains. Though Solomon
           remains cool, Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of
           being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little
           money was collected.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           Not an additional tip from a one
           of them. They expect to be
           entertained for nothing.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           And not satisfied a bit despite
           giving them more than what they
           paid for.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           It's the national mood. There's
           too much grief to make room for
           frivolity.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           My sincerest apologies, Solomon.
           You were promised opportunity, and
           you were given none.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           The opportunity is with the
           circus. A two man show poorly
           promoted, what were we to expect?
           But the circus bills itself.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           True.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           I have told you of the circus with
           which we are connected. Creatures
           from the darkest of Africa.
           Acrobats from the Orient who--

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           You have described it, yes.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           Yes. We need to return
           immediately to Washington.
           Solomon...I believe us familiar
           enough now, but forgive me if I am
           bold...would you consider making
           the trip with us?
           Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea.

           skills deserves better.

</b>           And more importantly you would
           build your own name and following.
           The circus tends to attract those
           with the highest of reputations.
           An introduction here and there
           could amount to a lifetime of
           reward. Now would be the time.
           With your family away, an
           opportunity presents itself.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           Said as fellow artists as well as
           businessmen. Well worth the
           effort at least.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           You present a flattering
           representation. As my family will
           be traveling back shortly, perhaps
           I might commit only to one trial
           engagement.

           cannot recall being so excited.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           There is a practical concern. If
           you are to continue on with us you
           should obtain your free papers.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Not necessary.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           Here in New York, no. But we will
           be entering slave states and as a
           matter of precaution... It's to
           all our benefit we should not have
           to come to account for your well
           being.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           Six shillings worth of effort
           could well save much trouble
           later.

           The city is a swarm of people. At the moment the populace
           is displaying both sorrow and anticipation. Sorrow for
           the loss of the President. Many are dressed in black,
           and black crepe hangs nearly everywhere. Black armbands
           are frequently seen, and the occasional American Flag
           hung at half mast. As well, there are portraits of
           Harrison at varying locations.

           among several parties drinking in the hotel's bar. As
           with seemingly everywhere in the city black crepes
           accessorize the background. Brown counts out $43.00 IN
           COIN on the tabletop. Solomon is astonished by the

           Solomon, a bit reluctantly, does the same.

           WE MAKE A HARD CUT to Solomon outside of the Pub, in an
           alley, with Brown and Hamilton in silhouette, back-lit by
           the street lights. He is violently ill, hunched over and
           retching horribly.

<b>                          HAMILTON

           Hamilton and Brown help Solomon to lumber up the spiral
           staircase, passing the occasional bemused guest.

                         

<b>          23 INT. GADSBY HOTEL/SOLOMON'S ROOM - NIGHT 23
</b>
           Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where
           a prone and reeling Solomon lays. Hamilton sits on the
           bed. As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton
           speaks sweetly.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           I'm afraid that Brown and I
           haven't brought you much luck.
           But rough waters bring smooth
           sailing. Eventually they do.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           ....So...so sorry...

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           Shhh. We won't hear it. We
           won't.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           Let him sleep.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           Hmm. A good night's sleep. And
           tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel
           as well and refreshed as though
           the earth were new again.
           Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to
           Solomon for Brown's taste. With more than a bit of

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           Such is the pity.
           Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks
           away from the bed. He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A
           CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than
           night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the
           dark and moans. His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE

</b>           Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new
           circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless
           room about twelve feet square with walls of solid
           masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small
           window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only
           furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box
           stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are
           CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and
           his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But
           that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.
           He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He
           does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails
           about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and
           beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams
           without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his
           flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.
           After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,
           slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed
           state he remains.

<b>           INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - MORNING

           Solomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the
           door...footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter
           JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER
           RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.
           As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into
           the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to
           Solomon's eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch

<b>                          ASKS:
</b>
<b>                          BURCH
</b>           Well, my boy, how yah feel now?
           Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he
           can put together he states what he considers to be fact:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I am Solomon Northup. I am a free
           man; a resident of Saratoga, New
           York. The residence also of my
           wife and children who are equally
           free. I have papers. You have no
           right whatsoever to detain me--

<b>                          BURCH
</b>           Yah not any--

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           And I promise you - I promise -
           upon my liberation I will have
           satisfaction for this wrong.

<b>                          BURCH
</b>           Resolve this. Produce your
           papers.

<b>                         25 CONTINUED: 25
</b>           With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his
           trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are
           empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his
           papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts,
           but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will
           not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts:

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah no free man. And yah ain't
           from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia.
           A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon
           and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man
           yielding. Burch says again:

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah ain't a free man. Yah nuthin'
           but a Georgia runaway.
           Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not
           in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare.
           The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch,
           leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT

<b>           DISTINGUISH.
</b>           Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of
           "instruments:" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is
           about the size in circumference of two open hands, and
           bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also
           carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many
           strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the
           extremity of each. Burch says again:

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.
           Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say
           nothing of the kind.
           As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is
           pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his
           back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon
           down in a bent position.
           With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the
           back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no
           taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each
           blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND

<b>           BRUISES.
</b>           This beating continues on and on and on until quite
           literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.
           Dripping in sweat and panting:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           ...I...I insist...
           Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but
           rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to
           beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch
           returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows

<b>                          WITH:
</b>
<b>                          BURCH
</b>           Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave!
           Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until
           the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.
           Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly,
           the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's
           arm tires before Solomon "breaks."

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Are yah slave?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           ...No...
           Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...

<b>           SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND
</b>           OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He
           pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough
           energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn
           lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's
           legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these
           gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one
           wrought with poor sincerity::

<b>                          RADBURN
</b>           I seen a good many of the black
           kind just where yah're. Sick.
           Make me sick. Often times the
           situation was resolved, and I
           think; what was all the beatin'
           and abuse for? Things end as they
           should, and the violence was for
           naught. So why cause trouble when
           they ain't no cause for it? Be of
           a cooperative nature, and things
           don't need be particularly
           unpleasant.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Or, yah can carry on like yah
           been, and I fear yah won't live to
           see Sunday next.
           With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to
           rest seems like giving in to defeat. He begins pulling

           loosens none. Solomon calls out:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Help me! Someone help me!
           If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. Solomon
           continues his plaintive cry for assistance.

           cluttered with litter and the remains of previous day's

<b>          30 EXT. BURCH'S DUNGEON/YARD - DAY 30
</b>
           It is a yard just beyond Burch's. The yard is hemmed in
           by a brick wall. In the yard are two men, and a boy.
           The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age.
           He is well educated. JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years
           old. He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in
           education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.
           Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who
           answers to the name of Randall.
           Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED.
           Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are
           all aware of the uselessness of modesty. Radburn is
           present. He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD
           WATER. He throws water on the naked men.

<b>                          RADBURN
</b>           Go on. Warsh up.
           The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to
           scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them.

<b>                          RADBURN (CONT'D)
</b>           The boy, too. Get him clean.
           Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall.

<b>                          RADBURN (CONT'D)
</b>           Scrub now. Git 'em clean.
           Solomon scrubs harder. Randall - clearly cold and
           uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon.

</b>           Do you know when my Mama will
           come?

</b>           Hush him up!
           Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to
           cry.

<b>                          RANDALL

           On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall
           goes silent. Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws
           water on the soapy men.

           Radburn brings food in to Solomon; a shriveled piece of
           meat and some water. Just barely enough to sustain
           Solomon. Radburn also has a SHIRT.

</b>           That old thing of yours is just
           rags and tatters. Need something
           proper to wear.
           Solomon doesn't move for the clothing.

</b>           Go'won. Put it on.
           With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed. He
           removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was
           wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one
           Radburn brought him. The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty.
           Despite that, Radburn says:

</b>           There. Tha's fine. Tha's fine.

           Taking the shirt, the "rags and tatters" as he calls
           them, Radburn exits, locking the door behind him.
           Solomon sits with the plate of food before him. He
           pushes the plate away rather than eat.

           calls out for his "Mama." By now, however, his calls
           should feel like little more than background noise.

           doesn't call out emptily. At the door to the yard is
           Burch along with two women. One in her late twenties;
           ELIZA. She is "arrayed in silk, with rings upon her
           fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears."
           Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this
           point - lived well. This is reflected in her airs and
           her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin
           color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall's
           half sister.
           As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight,
           then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. Clearly
           this is mother and child being reunited.

           Later in the evening. Solomon now shares his space with
           Eliza and her children. As the children rest, Eliza
           drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon
           who lends a sympathetic ear.

                         

                         
           Both slyly, and with a bit of aggrandizement:

<b>                          ELIZA
</b>           When I say I had my master's
           favor, you understand. Above even
           his own wife, I had it. Do you
           know that he built a house for me?
           Built it on the sole condition
           that I reside there with him. The
           added promise in time I would be
           emancipated. And for nine years
           he blessed me with every comfort
           and luxury in life.
           Displaying the finery she still wears:

<b>                          ELIZA (CONT'D)
</b>           Silks and jewels and even servants
           to wait upon us. Such was our
           life, and the life of this
           beautiful girl I bore for him.
           But Master Berry's daughter...she
           always looked at me with an unkind
           nature. She hated Emily no matter
           she and Emily were flesh of flesh.
           As Master Berry's health failed,
           she gained power in the household.
           Eventually, I was brought to the
           city on the false pretense of our
           free papers being executed. If I
           had known what waited; to be sent
           south? I swear I would not have
           come here alive.

           Alone in the dark in the hold, John cries, as does Eliza.
           Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can, as if
           wishing bad things. As if wanting to exact some measure
           of revenge. But the greater insult is that Burch and
           Radburn, engaged in conversation, take no notice of
           Solomon whatsoever. He is that insignificant to them.
           That fact, that reality, makes Solomon boil with a rage
           he cannot express in words.

           We see a flat overhead view of the port of Norfolk. 
           Sardines are laid out to dry in rows, glittering in the 
           day's sun as if like silver pennies. A chain of slaves 
           enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked 
           vessel. 
           MORE SLAVES - about 15 in all, of various genders and 
           ages - are brought on board. Chief among them is ROBERT 
           who fights viciously with his captors. "With all haste" 
           is shoved down into the hold. 
           Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to, 
           Burch and Radburn depart. They do so without a word 
           spoken to Solomon or the others. 
           With this new and sizable batch of slaves on board, the 
           crew again CASTS OFF, and the Orleans makes its way 
           again.

           The slaves are asleep. 
           A Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza. He bends 
           down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her 
           face. 
           Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. 
           From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt 
           the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back 
           at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the 
           hold. 
           As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand 
           between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand 
           to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says "No you 
           don't." 
           Clemens Ray is awake now, watching. 
           There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor 
           and Robert, an impasse. 
           We focus on the Sailor's face. Slowly, a greasy smile 
           erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of 
           incomprehension. 
           Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that 
           has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs. 
           The sailor withdraws the bloody blade. 
           A wide shot of the two men. Robert collapses to the

           We are in the port of New Orleans, one of the busiest in
           the young nation.
           On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods
           are loaded and unloaded from a various ships. It's a bit
           of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken
           and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to
           a holding pen. Solomon, and all the slaves are
           overwhelmed by all that is happening around them.
           Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the
           Orleans. They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Ray's master - and
           DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray. They both look
           like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is
           laid, Ray yells for Clemens.
           Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight.
           He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically,
           his master now represents "freedom."

           Clemens pulls on his chain. As he does so, Several other
           slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master, like
           dominos.

           over his master as would a lost and then found child.

           As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart, it
           opens up to the frenzic, busy port.
           For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery.
           These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back
           in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage -
           herded like cattle, chained together as if in a "chain
           gang." Slaves are evident not merely by the color of
           their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are
           everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars -

<b>           THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT
</b>           UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks
           are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to
           elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked.
           Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is
           attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and
           tears at the slave's clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A

           ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch's.
           Including Burch's group there are about 30 SLAVES in the

           Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but
           downtrodden and despondent faces. Three men sit next to

           It's an odd, ironic scene. The slaves are in a large and
           fairly ornate room within Freeman's house. CAPE PLAYS A
           PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman
           tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes
           less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his
           livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a
           good impression. Sometimes his patience gets the better
           of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the
           slaves.
           The business has the air of an etiquette class, though
           what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into
           being more "sellable." He works with them in groups of
           five or so.

           (to the group)
           Keep your heads up. A sense of
           direction; that's how you look
           smart. None of those saucer eyes.
           Rid yourself of that smile. Look
           like a goddamn grinnin' monkey.

           Weary of Cape's playing, Solomon moves to Cape. He asks:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Can you play a reel?

<b>                          CAPE

<b>                          (DISMISSIVE)

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           If I may...?
           Cape looks to Freeman:

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           He sick of your caterwaulin'. Let
           him play, boy. Let's see what he
           can do.
           Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon.
           Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play. His fingers
           stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up. But as he
           warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful.

<b>           INT. FREEMAN'S/GREAT ROOM - DAY
</b>
           We come in on an odd sort of sight; A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY.
           CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman's lot - the room all
           gussied up with flowers. Freeman moves among them,
           displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel.
           Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - "look
           smart" as he previously admonished them. They are made
           to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their
           hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what
           skills they possess. The Customers routinely make the
           slaves open their mouths and show their teeth.
           At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the
           side, stripped and inspected more minutely.
           One of them, John, is stripped and inspected.
           Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle.
           A buyer - WILLIAM FORD; a man of middle age, and an
           attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list
           he's drawn up and asks of Freeman:

<b>                          FORD
</b>           What is the price for the ones
           Platt and Eliza?

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           A thousand for Platt; he is a
           nigger of talent. Seven hundred
           for Eliza. My fairest price.

<b>                          FORD
</b>           You will accept a note?

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           As always, from you, Mr. Ford.
           Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be
           separated from her family. She begs of Ford:

</b>           Please, sir... Please don't
           divide my family. Don't take me
           unless you take my children as
           well.

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           Eliza, quiet!

<b>                          ELIZA
</b>           You will have the most faithful
           slave in me, sir. The most
           faithful slave that has ever
           lived, but I beg that you do not
           separate us.
           A BUYER interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman
           and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall-

<b>                          BUYER
</b>           Your price for the child?

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           You see how fit the boy is. Like
           ripe fruit. He will grow into a
           fine beast.
           Randall is made to run, and jump by FREEMAN - exhibiting
           his activity and his condition.

<b>                          FREEMAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Six hundred, and that's fair and
           final.

<b>                          BUYER
</b>           Done.
           He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet,
           counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the
           already extended hand of Freeman.
           Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly
           touches him. He now tries to buy EMILY to console her.

<b>                          FORD
</b>           How much for the little girl? You
           have no need for her. One so
           young will bring you no profit.

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           I will not sell the girl. There's
           heaps 'n piles of money to be made
           off her. She is a beauty. One of
           the regular bloods. None of your

           cotton picking niggers.

           least?

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           My sentimentality stretches the
           length of a coin. Do you want the
           lot, Mr. Ford, or do you pass on
           them all?

<b>                          FORD
</b>           I will take the ones Platt and

           Eliza grips her children tight.

           Freeman, to Cape:

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           Take her out of here.
           Cape DROPS HIS FIDDLE, begins to pull Eliza away toward
           the door of the room, but her screaming and pleading do
           not abate. IT IS CLEARLY UNSETTLING TO THE OTHER BUYERS.

<b>                          FREEMAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Keep her quiet.
           Cape tries to muzzle her with his hand, but Eliza
           continues to scream for her children as Emily does for
           her mother.

<b>                          EMILY

</b>           Play something! Get the fiddle
           and play.
           As ordered, Solomon takes up Cape's fiddle and begins to
           play lightly.

<b>                          FREEMAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Play!
           Solomon plays harder and more loudly. Still, it is
           barely enough to drown out Eliza's cries. Freeman gets
           the other slaves to clap along with Solomon's playing.
           Emily frees herself and runs back, crying but endeavoring
           to be strong-

<b>                          EMILY
</b>           Don't cry, Mama. I will be a good
           girl. Don't cry. I will keep my
           head up and I will look smart. I
           will always look smart.

           your damned hide I will take it

           Cape pulls a rag, stuffs it in Eliza's mouth. Clamping
           both hands over her mouth, he hauls Eliza from the room
           by the head. IT IS AN UGLY, UGLY SCENE.

           Driven in a horse drawn wagon by Ford are Solomon and
           Eliza. Eliza is sullen to say the least. With the loss
           of her two children she has dropped into a depression she

           the plantation - the GREAT HOUSE as they are commonly
           called - is sizable. Two stories high with a piazza in
           front. In the rear are also a log kitchen, poultry
           house, corncribs and several slave cabins. The
           plantation is described as "a green spot in the
           wilderness."
           With the arrival of Master Ford there is a flurry of
           activity - the "excitement" of a new delivery. MR.

           made no more easy by the sweltering heat. Solomon is
           among them as well as Sam.

           As Sam drives the wagon, the other slaves trudge along

           It is a sizable work area on the edge of Indian Creek.
           There is much work being done, the slaves primarily
           employed in piling the timber and chopping it into
           lumber. As before, there is little doubt about the
           rigors of the job at hand.
           Working as a carpenter at the work area is JOHN TIBEATS.
           There are also various CUSTOMERS who move about placing
           orders.

           present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to
           them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by
           way of compassion.

<b>                          FORD
</b>           "But as touching the resurrection
           of the dead, have ye not read that
           which was spoken unto you by God,
           saying, I am the God of Abraham,
           and the God of Isaac, and the God
           of Jacob. God is not the God of
           the dead, but of the living. And
           when the multitude heard this,
           they were astonished at his
           doctrine. Then one of them, which
           was a lawyer, asked him a
           question, tempting him, and
           saying, Master, which is the
           great commandment in the law?
           Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt
           love the Lord thy God with all thy
           heart, and with all thy soul, and
           with all thy mind. This is the
           first and great commandment. And
           the second is like unto it, thou
           shalt love thy neighbor as
           thyself. On these two
           commandments hang all the law and
           the prophets."

           in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED

           reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves.

           A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound
           of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over. He grabs the
           Bible.

<b>                          WINSLOW

           The White Customer has no interest in Sam's answer. With

           ever was. Only...it's not quite the same. Sam brings
           the wagon to a halt. He, and the slaves look up the road
           ahead of them.
           Standing in the middle of the road is a group of
           CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their "usual" dress of
           buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic
           colors, buttoned from belt to chin. They have with them
           DOGS and HORSES. They carry with them the carcass of a
           deer.
           The two groups stare at each other for a long moment.

           They "break bread" - actually they work on the carcass of
           the deer which is now roasting over a large fire. As
           well the group share a smoke on a pipe.
           One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an "INDIAN
           FIDDLE." The Chickasaws perform a customary dance;
           trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a
           guttural, sing-song noise.
           The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon
           particularly taken by the music...if not entirely
           enthralled by it.

           Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the
           river. Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO
           DEFECATE. As he does, he stares out toward the flowing
           waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a
           thought far greater than relieving himself has come to
           him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants.
           Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were
           a man possessed.

           bayou is several miles by water
           fewer than land. It occurs to me

           I will offer up my talents to
           Master Ford. I will keep myself
           hearty until freedom is opportune.

           Eliza uses Solomon's name quite pointedly as if to
           underscore his true self. Solomon get her meaning. Yet
           he says nothing. Again, pointedly:

           The phrase seems to trigger Eliza's tears. She begins to

           Mrs. Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper-

<b>           -JANUARY, 1842-
</b>           Seasons have passed. It is winter now, and very grey out
           along the bayou. Ford and Tibeats - who we have seen
           working around the WORK AREA - stand with Solomon,
           Tibeats giving Solomon an inspection. Ford carries much
           lament.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Raise yer shirt.
           Solomon does as instructed. Tibeats looks at Solomon's
           back, at the scars from lashings he bears.

<b>                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)

           Tibeats heads off. Solomon, highly curious over the
           preceding.

<b>           -END OF JANUARY, 1842- [OVER ONE DAY]
</b>           We see Solomon working as a carpenter, helping to erect a
           Weaving House that stands off to the side of the
           plantation's Great House.
           At the moment Solomon is nailing on siding. Tibeats
           arrives and is immediately dissatisfied with the work.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Make them boards flush.

<b>                          SOLOMON

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           They is no such thing.
           Solomon runs his hands over the boards.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           As smooth to the touch as a
           yearling's coat.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Callin' me a liar, boy?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Only a matter of perspective, sir.
           From where you stand you may see
           differently. But the hands are
           not mistaken. I ask only that you
           employ all your senses before
           rendering judgement.
           What's Tibeats to do when faced with fact? All he can do
           is spew invectives.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           You are a brute. You are a dog,
           and no better for followin'
           instruction.

<b>                          SOLOMON

           from Chapin and commence puttin'

           Tibeats wheels away. Solomon goes back to his work.
           After a few moments Solomon notices a bit of commotion in
           the drive of the great house. It involves an
           inconsolable Eliza who is being herded by Sam onto a cart
           DRIVEN BY A WHITE MAN. Mistress Ford and Rachel watch.
           Solomon can only watch as the last connection to his days
           as a free man is driven away to a location unknown.

           It is day break. As ordered, Solomon is up and working.
           Chapin is rolling a keg of nails off a handcart for
           Solomon.

<b>                          CHAPIN
</b>           If Tibeats prefers a different
           size, I will endeavor to furnish
           them, but you may use those until
           further directed.

           As the day gets on to mid-morning, the sun already baking
           in the sky, Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon. Even
           before arriving to Solomon his mien is one of
           belligerence; out of sorts and something less than sober.

<b>                          TIBEATS

</b>           Yes, master. I am about it. I
           have begun on the other side of
           the house.
           Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon's work. He is
           picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Didn't I tell yah last night to
           get a keg of nails of Chapin?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           And so I did; and Chapin said he
           would get another size for you, if
           you wanted them when he came back
           from the field.
           Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it. Moving toward
           Solomon "with a great passion:"

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Goddamn yah! I thought yah knowed
           somethin'!
           Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in
           no mood for Tibeats.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I did as instructed. If there's
           something wrong, then its wrong
           with your instructions.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Yah black bastard! Yah goddman
           black bastard!
           In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza
           to fetch a whip.
           Solomon looks around. He is alone other than Rachel and
           Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses,
           runs out to the field to fetch Chapin. Solomon's
           instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats
           marches back whip in hand.

<b>                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)
</b>           Strip yer clothes!
           Solomon does no such thing.

</b>           Strip!

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I will not.
           With "concentrated vengeance," Tibeats springs for
           Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and

</b>           raising the whip with the other. Before he can strike
           the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar
           of his coat and pulls him in close. Reaching down,
           Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back
           with the other hand. Tibeats tumbles to the ground. A
           violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to
           Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches
           the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the
           handle again and again and again.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Yew will not live ta see another
           day, nigger! This is yer last, I
           swear it!
           Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats.
           Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats's
           wriggling form. The stiff stock of the whip wraps around
           Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches.
           Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and
           then pleas for mercy:

<b>                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)
</b>           Murder! It's murder! Lord, God,
           help me. God be merciful!
           And then suddenly, Tibeats shrieks-

<b>                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)
</b>           Papa I'm sorry!
           Chapin comes RIDING IN FROM THE FIELD fast and hard.
           Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers
           a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the
           ground.

<b>                          CHAPIN

           Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of
           dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on

</b>           What's the matter with the nails?
           With a mix of shame, anger and embarrassment, Tibeats
           says, as if being exposed-

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           This ain't done by half. I will
           have flesh, and I will have all of
           it.
           Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE.
           Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He
           looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee.
           Anxiety mounts on his features.
           A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles
           his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to
           fetch him.
           Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is
           visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest.
           Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off
           an air of impending trouble.

<b>                          CHAPIN
</b>           Do not stir. Do not attempt to
           leave the plantation on any
           account whatever. But if you run
           there is no protecting you.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>
<b>                          SIR--
</b>
<b>                          CHAPIN
</b>           If you run, Platt, there is no
           protecting you. Rachel...!
           Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a
           distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log
           kitchen.
           Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is
           to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we
           continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the
           unexpected mounts.
           Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man,
           and he knows that death awaits him.

<b>           A SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS
</b>           THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it.

</b>           Chapin has now returned to the piazza. He stands and
           watches, but does not move to Solomon.
           Solomon waits, and waits...
           WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and
           louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It's Tibeats.
           He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK. They
           carry with them large whips and a coil of rope.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Tha's the one. Tha's him.
           Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with
           perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon
           tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by
           TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same
           manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a
           cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back
           and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a
           peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of
           it intensely palpable.
           Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone.
           Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the
           verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution,
           he begins to struggle and fight.
           A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over
           the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon.
           He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the
           life is choked from him.
           With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing
           a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber
           "Holster" pistols with 9" barrels. Chapin moves with
           determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and
           matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't
           need to be much more demonstrative.

<b>                          CHAPIN
</b>           Gentlemen... Whoever moves that
           nigger another foot from where he
           stands is a dead man. I am
           overseer of this plantation seven
           years, and in the absence of
           William Ford, my duty is to
           protect his interests. Ford holds
           a mortgage on Platt of four
           hundred dollars. If you hang him,
           he loses his debt. Until that is
           canceled you have no claim to his
           life.
           Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook:

           regard for your own safety...I
           say, begone!
           Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice. The pistols
           Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without
           further word, they mount their horses and ride away.
           Tibeats remains, and his anger with him.

           and mine ta do with as I please.
           Yah touch my property, I will 'ave
           yah strung up as well.
           Tibeats mounts up and departs. There is a surreal moment
           as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon. He
           chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the
           neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the

           to Master Ford. Tell him to come
           here at once without a single
           moment's delay. Tell him they are
           trying to murder Platt. Hurry,

           Sam mounts up and rides off, the mule demonstrating much
           speed.

           HOURS HAVE PASSED. The sun is now at its apex. The sight
           and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as
           Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was
           left. The scene is both tranquil and horrific. Life on
           the plantation continues. The OTHER SLAVES work in the
           field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard.
           It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging
           even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this
           time and space.

</b>           Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his
           hands. Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and
           better assistance. And yet, he does nothing to alleviate
           Solomon's suffering. He heeds Tibeats words, and as
           though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a
           property dispute, he offers no further aid.
           Solomon's head lolls to one side. He looks toward the
           sun. The bright light flares off the leaves and branches
           of the tree from which Solomon hangs. The glare in
           Solomon's eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he
           cannot help but look upward. As he does, his eyes
           flutter between life and lifelessness...

           Solomon continues to hang. By now he is drenched in
           sweat, and nearly delirious with dehydration. His lips
           dry and parched. He may not die from hanging, but he may
           very well expire before the day is over.
           Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she
           were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of
           water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for
           him. She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the
           water which clings to his lips. Rachel then retreats,
           and leaves Solomon to hang.

           The sun is just now arching for the horizon. Solomon
           remains, as though his torture will not end. Ford,
           trailed by Sam, finally comes riding up. He dismounts,
           and moves swiftly over to Solomon. With great heartache:

<b>                          FORD
</b>           Platt... My poor Platt.
           Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose. Solomon
           attempts to carry himself, but he cannot. He falls to
           the ground and passes out.

           the floor. Eventually, his eyes flutter, then open. He
           is in the foyer of the Ford house. As he gets his
           bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS
           HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED. It is sharp contrast to
           the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has
           largely been accustom to during his time of slavery. It
           will be the "first and last time such a sumptuous resting
           place was granted" during his twelve years of bondage.

           is unnerved. Has Tibeats returned to finish what he
           started?
           From a study, Master Ford appears with a gun in hand. He
           goes to the door, opens it and looks outside. He can see
           nothing. Satisfied, Ford crosses back over to Solomon.
           He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation.

<b>                          FORD
</b>           I believe Tibeats is skulkin'
           about the premises somewhere. He
           wants you dead, and he will
           attempt to have you so. It's no
           longer safe for you here. And I
           don't believe you will remain
           passive if Tibeats attacks. I
           have transferred my debt to Edwin
           Epps. He will take charge of you.

<b>                          SOLOMON

           Master Ford, you must know; I am
           not a slave.

           And...I have a debt to be mindful
           of. That, now, is to Edwin Epps.
           He is a hard man. Prides himself
           on being a "nigger breaker." But
           truthfully I could find no others
           who would have you. You've made a
           reputation of yourself. Whatever
           your circumstances, you are an
           exceptional nigger, Platt. I fear

           years. WILEY, who is forty eight. PHEBE, who is married
           to Wiley. BOB and HENRY who are Phebe's children, EDWARD
           and PATSEY. Patsey is young, just 23 years old...though
           in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day. She
           is the offspring of a "Guinea nigger," brought over to
           Cuba in a slave ship. She nearly brims with unconversant
           sexuality.
           MISTRESS EPPS, Epps's wife, is also present. She sits
           with, holds quite lovingly, some SLAVE CHILDREN. WITH
           THEM SHE IS VERY "MOTHERLY." We also see Epps's overseer
           TREACH. Treach constantly sports a LOADED PISTOL.
           Though Epps reads the word of the Lord, he lacks the tone
           of compassion with which Ford read.

           laundry, cooking food. There is no respite from a
           slave's charge.

           A fire is kindled in the cabin. The slaves finally fix
           their own dinner of corn meal. Corn is ground in a small
           hand mill. The corn meal is mixed with a little water,
           placed in the fire and baked. When it is "done brown"
           the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried. As the
           slaves eat, Abram goes on in great length and with much
           emotion about General Jackson.

           Despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and
           now fully dressed. They take up position in the middle
           of the floor. They wait, poised like actors. Solomon
           strikes up a tune; Henry joins in with a pan flute and
           the slaves dance. They do so very wearily. The whole of
           it certainly more torture than pleasure.
           Epps, whip in hand:

           feet.
           As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on
           Patsey. It should be quite clear that his primary
           motivation for holding dances is so that he may view
           Patsey twirl about the floor.
           This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps. A few moments of
           Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear.
           Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all
           her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square
           in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY
           AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop.
           The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first
           time they've seen as much from the Mistress.
           Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion:

           Mistress Epps stands irate, lost in fury and unable to
           even think of what to do. Eventually, optionless, she
           storms away.
           For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey
           sobbing.

           responds by playing.
           Treach literally drags the prone Patsey from the floor,
           blood still spilling from her face. The slaves, as

           Solomon walks along a well-worn path, shopping bag draped 
           over one shoulder. We see his feet. As the walk slowly 
           gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense 
           foliage. His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees 
           flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods. 
           The sound of branches cracking underneath. His feet, 
           heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate. 
           The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is 
           silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, 
           preparing for a lynching of two young men. Solomon's 
           eyes meet theirs. The two men look back at Solomon with 
           a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose 
           around their neck. Suddenly the bloodhounds start 
           barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of 
           Solomon. Solomon's whole body shakes with anticipation.

<b>           -JULY, 1844-
</b>           Sitting on the Grand house's Piazza, Patsey is having tea
           with MISTRESS HARRIET SHAW, WHO IS A BLACK WOMAN. Though
           once a slave, she is now comparatively refined though not
           wholly so. The table where they sit is adorned with
           white linens, and they are attended by a HOUSE NIGGER.
           It makes for a tranquil surreal scene.

           Solomon is running flat out along the road. Running as
           though his life depended on getting to his destination in
           beyond a timely manner.

           Still running, slick with sweat, Solomon comes upon the

</b>           As Solomon arrives:

<b>                          MASTER SHAW
</b>           Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Good morning, Master Shaw. I've
           been sent by Master to retrieve
           Patsey. May I approach?

<b>                          MASTER SHAW
</b>           You may.
           Solomon makes his way over to the piazza.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.

<b>                          MISTRESS SHAW
</b>           Nigger Platt.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           My apologies. Patsey, Master

           me running to fetch you, and said
           no time should be wasted.

</b>           Solomon knows better, but he sits and the Mistress has
           tea poured for him.

<b>           MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D)
</b>           What'n was Epps's concern?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           ...I'd rather not say...

<b>                          MISTRESS SHAW
</b>           L'il gossip on the Sabbath be
           fine. All things in moderation.
           Solomon is not sure what to say. He struggles to be as
           diplomatic as possible.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           As you are aware, Master Epps can
           be a man of a hard countenance.
           There are times when it is
           impossible to account for his
           logic. You know he has ill
           feelings toward your husband.

<b>                          MISTRESS SHAW
</b>           He do.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Master Epps has somehow come to
           believe, as incorrectly as it may
           be, that Master Shaw is... That
           he is something of a lothario and
           an unprincipled man. A misguided
           belief born out of their mutual
           competition as planters, no doubt.

<b>                          MISTRESS SHAW
</b>           No doubt...if not born outta truth
           itself.
           The Mistress waves to Shaw. Shaw, unsuspecting of the
           conversation, waves back.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I'm certain Patsey's well being is
           Master Epps's only concern.

<b>                          MISTRESS SHAW
</b>           Nothin' Epps desire come outta
           concern.

<b>                          SOLOMON

<b>                          MISTRESS SHAW
</b>           Ha! You worry for me? Got no
           cause to worry for my
           sensibilities. I ain't felt the
           end of a lash in 'mo years than I
           cain recall. Ain't worked a
           field, neither. Where one time I
           served, now I got others servin'
           me. The cost to my current
           existence be Massa Shaw
           broadcasting his affections, 'n me
           enjoyin' his pantomime of
           fidelity. If that what keep me
           from the cotton pickin' niggers,
           that what it be. A small and
           reasonable price to be paid 'fo
           sure.
           Looking toward Patsey, speaking with great empathy:

<b>           MISTRESS SHAW (CONT'D)
</b>           I knowed what it like to be the
           object of Massa's predilections
           and peculiarities. And I knowed
           they can get expressed with
           kindness or wit violence. A lusty
           visit in the night, or a
           visitation from the whip. And wit
           my experience, if'n I can give
           comfort, then comfort I give. And
           you take comfort, Patsey; the Good
           Lord will manage Epps. In His own
           time the Good Lord will manage dem
           all. Yes, Lordy, there's a day
           comin' that will burn as an oven.
           It comin' as sure as the Lord is
           just. When His will be done...the
           curse on the Pharos is a poor
           example of all that wait 'fo the
           plantation class.
           Mistress Shaw turns her head to the side, catching a
           slave's attention. As she does so, the slave, a YOUNG
           WOMAN, commences to pour tea.
           As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip
           of her tea.

           Solomon and Patsey are returning from Shaw's. Waiting on

</b>           Patsey...!
           Solomon moves between Epps and Patsey, cutting Epps off
           as Patsey continues on. Playing up his "ignorance" of

</b>           I'll cut your black throat.
           Solomon pulls away from Epps, RIPPING HIS SHIRT IN THE
           PROCESS. Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around
           the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps,
           however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as
           speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.
           And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and
           suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely
           breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts
           up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach.
           Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in
           what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after
           Solomon. Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can
           even get close to the slave.
           Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety:

           us carryin' on like this. Help me
           ta my feet, and let us both pray
           to the Lord for forgiveness.
           Epps extends a hand to Solomon. Cautiously, Solomon
           moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within
           striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases
           Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more
           drops down. And again offering a treaty:

<b>                          EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm all done in, Platt. I have

           but in the name of valor, help yer
           master to his feet.
           Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is
           attacked by Epps - this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is
           too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and
           chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THE

           Patsey from where she'd taken
           sabbatical at Master Shaw's. Upon
           returning, Master Epps believed
           Patsey and me to be in
           conversation when we were not. I
           tried to explain, but it lead to
           all this.

</b>           With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
           working the field picking cotton. As before THEY SING A
           SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the
           tedium at hand.
           But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry
           begin to falter before it... And eventually collapse
           right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note,
           none move to help him. None dare.
           From Treach rather matter of factly:

<b>                          TREACH
</b>           Get him water.
           Edward runs to fetch a gourd. He carries it to Henry,

</b>           Go'won. Git up.
           Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking
           cotton. He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the
           song is all that can keep him going.

           On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house -
           Epps shoves Patsey. He stops, stands as if gathering his
           manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and
           clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape
           and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter.
           Patsey does not respond in any way other than to
           continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain
           as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is
           vicious with her passive aggressiveness.
           Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw
           had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to
           violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response
           from her. When that fails, he punches her which only
           leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey
           MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten,
           Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep
           breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left
           him.
           Epps heads from the field. Patsey is left where she is.

           another quantity of foolscap.

           Solomon is making his way back to the Epps plantation.
           He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the
           store. As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY. When
           he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens
           it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he
           folds and places in his pocket. That done, he cinches up
           the sack and continues on his way.

           Solomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his
           fiddle. Perhaps the safest place he can think of. He
           acts as though he's hiding away found gold. In reality
           it's more than that. For Solomon the paper is a first
           step toward freedom.

<b>           -DECEMBER, 1844-
</b>           It's another night of Epps's forced revelry. Coming in
           quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding
           his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to
           dance.
           Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked
           pastries. She sets them down on a table.

<b>                          MISTRESS EPPS
</b>           A moment from the dancing. Come
           sample what I baked for y'all.
           The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food,
           file toward the tray reciting a chorus of "Thank you,
           Mistress." As Patsey moves toward the pastries:

<b>           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           There'll be none for you, Patsey.
           Patsey merely turns away. Her non responsiveness,
           however, serves only to incite the Mistress. Screaming:

<b>           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah see that? Did yah see the
           look of insolence she give me?

           black animals to leave us gut like
           pigs in our own sleep?
           Epps isn't sure how to respond to the inchoate berating.
           It's an invitation for the Mistress to continue.

</b>           You are manless. A damned eunuch

           at least be a credit to yer own
           kind and beat every foul thought
           from 'em.
           Epps does nothing. The Mistress lets her anger loose.
           She moves quickly to Patsey, DRIVES HER NAILS INTO THE

<b>           PATSEY'S FACE AND DRAWS THEM DOWN ACROSS HER FEATURES.
</b>
<b>           FIVE DEEP AND BLOODY GASHES ARE LEFT IN PATSEY'S SKIN,

           collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face.

           Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistress's actions, Epps
           takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house. His
           intentions are plain.
           All the slaves remain silent. The Mistress, however,
           displaying high satisfaction, entreats the others:

<b>           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           Eat. Fill yourselves. ...And
           then we dance.
           The slaves eat, but without a hint of levity.

</b>           Hard times on the planation. Where previously the field
           in bloom was a carpet of white, it is now patchy and
           under grown.
           The slaves move through the field picking not cotton, but
           rather COTTON WORMS from the plants. The cotton worms
           have dined on the cotton and nearly destroyed the crop.
           We see the cotton worms in extreme close-up, moving among
           and destroying the cotton crop.
           Epps is beside himself as he looks out over his ruined

           ever returning to his family. This clearly weighs on him

           rows after.
           Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves

           Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her
           breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act -
           really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE

<b>           ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT,
</b>
<b>           FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN
</b>
<b>           AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE
</b>
<b>           SOLOMON.
</b>           The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to
           Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER
           DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more
           compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO
           MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more
           perfunctory than passionate.
           We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual
           release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous
           sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against
           reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that
           remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.
           And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna
           turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is
           as though the act had not happened at all.

           Dipping the piece of cane - a quill - into the crushed
           berries, Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper.
           The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink.
           Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle. He has some

           a variation of decorative masks. The party is a feast of
           celebration. As entertainment, SOLOMON ACCOMPANIES A
           GROUP OF MUSICIANS, no more than three. And as he does
           so, they all play with jovial liveliness. Clearly a good

           which to light the way. As he walks, Solomon eats from a
           HEARTY CHUCK OF BREAD. Obviously part of his haul from
           the evening. Solomon again hears noises coming from the
           brush just up ahead of him. Solomon tears off some of
           the bread, kneels and holds it out before him.

           the men over - their clothes tatters and they themselves
           covered in dirt. It becomes quite clear they are not
           just slaves. A fact confirmed when they step menacingly
           toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND.
           At first it seems they want Solomon's food or money.
           Worse, THEY GO FOR HIS FIDDLE.
           Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is

<b>           -FEBRUARY/MARCH, 1847-
</b>           Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a
           low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON.
           As he plays, something appears in the distance. From the
           edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen
           from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of
           about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks.

<b>           "IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER
</b>           FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD." Beyond
           that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely.
           Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water.
           Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt.
           It's very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in
           her dress.
           Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As
           Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite

<b>                          PLAINLY:
</b>
<b>                          CELESTE

<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           I'm hungry.
           Solomon gives Celeste some of his food. Celeste,
           famished, devours it.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           What is your name?

</b>           There are some whose tracks the

</b>           Give it to me.
           Almost as if compelled, Solomon does as ordered. As she
           eats, Celeste aggrandizes herself:

<b>                          CELESTE (CONT'D)
</b>           Most slaves escape at night. The
           overseers are alert for such
           chicanes. But Celeste tricked dem
           'n alight in the middle of the day
           wit the sun up at its highest.
           The place of my concealment now
           deep in the swamp, not half a mile
           from Massa's plantation, and a
           world apart. A world a tall
           trees whose long arms make fo' a
           canopy so dense dey keep away even
           the beams of the sun. It twilight
           always in Celeste's world, even in
           the brightest day. I will live
           there, and I will live freely.
           The overseers are a cowardly lot.
           Dey will not go where their dogs
           show fear and where it always be

           Dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is
           about. Taking out a handkerchief, Solomon begins to load
           it with food. Not too much. Not so much his thievery
           will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself.

           As if to punctuate her resolve, without a word more
           Celeste departs toward the swamp. Solomon starts on into
           the swamp after her.

           Nothing. No answer. Not a human one. There are sounds
           and echoes - some in the distance, some perhaps moving
           closer - which, moment by moment, become more and more
           frightening. Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite
           literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then
           neck deep. With no way to orient himself, no means to
           guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to
           crumble. He thrashes in the water trying to find his way

           calls to her - desperately - for assistance.

</b>           Celeste! Come to me, Celeste!
           In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly
           done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this
           is his final moment. His panic should be that tangible.
           It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or
           maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he
           reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. Hauling
           himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses
           in a drenched, worn heap. His life spared, but Celeste
           never to be seen again.

<b>           -MAY/JUNE, 1847-
</b>           We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation. Epps
           stands in the drive. He's in surprisingly good spirits
           as Solomon, Uncle Abram, Henry and Bob trudge their way
           wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are
           gathered.
           The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully
           returned.

</b>           As thick 'n white as New England

           Oh, did you beguile him, Platt,

           Well, yah won't stand idle, boy.
           Not on my land. Much work to do.
           Days of old long since, eh?
           Joyous! Joyous indeed!
           Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey
           who is lined up with the other slaves. SHE IS NOW MORE
           HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER. Her face and arms
           display many new scars. It's clear that in the
           intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping
           boy for Epps and the Mistress.

           no easy chore on the spirit. I
           say no man of conscious can take
           the lash to another human day in,
           and day out without shredding at
           his own self. Takes him to a
           place where he either makes
           excuses within his mind to be
           unaffected... Or finds some way
           to trample his guilty sensations.
           Well, I trampled.

           With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
           working the field picking cotton. As before they sing a
           spiritual, the only thing that distracts them from the
           tedium at hand.
           But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Uncle
           Abram begin to falter and finally drop down to the
           ground.
           Treach calls to Edward:

           Solomon, Bob and Henry, now much visually older than when

           A female voice appears out of the blackness and begins to
           sing solo, "Went down to the river Jordan." A response of
           "Oh Yeah" quickly follows. Again the singer continues,
           "where John baptized three."
           The same faces we have seen on Epps' plantation, but now
           filled with rapture, appear. It's as if the voices have
           created a new form of awakening and presence. It seems to
           transcend and translate in a strange way, joy. A joy
           which has un-yet been seen on screen. A joy which has
           been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there. It's
           captivating, infectious.
           This should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the
           audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the
           seemingly chastising environment.
           The singer continues, "Well some say John was a Baptist,
           some say John was a Jew, but I say John was a preacher,
           because the Bible says so too, preach on Johnny." And
           with that, the rest of the congregation chant "I believe.

           ask only that you deposit a letter
           in the Marksville post office.
           And that you keep the action an
           inviolable secret forever. The
           details of the letter are of no
           consequence. Even at that, there
           would be an imposition of much
           pain and suffering were it known I
           was the author. A patron is what
           I require, sir.

           Armsby considers the request.

           Solomon hesitates. In the moment, he's not so sure he
           can wholly give himself over to trust.

           Solomon and the slaves pick cotton. Armsby is
           conspicuously NOT laboring in the field. As Solomon
           works he is watched by Epps. Watched more than he
           normally is. For a moment it seems it might just be a
           matter of perspective; Solomon's unease over his actions.
           But soon Epps is joined by Armsby. The two men stand and
           talk, their looks locked toward Solomon.
           Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues
           for a long, long moment. But Epps makes no move toward
           Solomon. Solomon continues with his work.

           Looking right to Solomon:

           Solomon does. Epps heads back out into the dark. He
           says nothing, but his directive is clear: Follow me.

           Solomon comes out into the dark. Nearly hidden in the
           shadows is a bitter Epps. Despite the lack of light,
           Epps's malevolence is quite clear. His whip attached to
           his hip. As he speaks, he stokes himself with swigs from
           a FLASK.
           Epps puts his arm around Solomon, as if consoling a
           friend, and guides him into the woods.

           Increasingly it become apparent that, shallow minded and
           equally soused, Solomon has been able to fold Epps's

           going on between Epps and Bass. Bass much skilled in the
           art of sophistry, while Epps's arguments are fueled
           mostly by emotion alone. Though at first Epps does
           little more than joke his way around the facts.
           Solomon, working still, can't help but overhear as Epps
           offers Bass a drink, which Bass waves away.

           truths are constant. It is a

           It's the Sabbath. The slaves are left to themselves to
           do their own chores. At the moment the female slaves are
           washing their clothes in large cauldrons, slapping their
           clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry
           near to their living quarters behind the plantation. It
           is a sight of ritual. Missing from the field of labor is
           Patsey, for whom Epps hollers.

           strike her until her flesh is rent
           and meat and blood flow equal, or
           I will kill every nigger in my
           sight!
           Solomon can't strike a blow, even if it means his life.
           But from the ground, from Patsey:

<b>                          PATSEY
</b>           Do it, Platt. Don't stop until I
           am dead.
           What else can he do? Solomon begins to whip, to truly
           whip Patsey. Her back welts, then tears... Patsey
           screams in agony. Solomon strikes again and again...
           After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps, who is
           not satisfied.

<b>                          EPPS
</b>           Until I say no more! I ain't said
           nothing!
           Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times. By now, as
           promised, Patsey's back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE

<b>           THAN TORN MEAT AND BLOOD.
</b>           Finally, Solomon holds low the whip. He can and will do
           no more.

<b>                          EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           Strike her! Strike her!
           Solomon will not. Epps takes up the whip and whips
           Patsey with "ten fold" greater force than he had. The
           painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air.
           Patsey by now is terribly lacerated, literally flayed.
           The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and
           dropped upon the ground. At length Patsey ceases
           struggling. Her head sinks listlessly on the ground.

</b>           Her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die
           away into a low moan. It would seem that she was dying.
           Solomon, screaming at Epps:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Thou devil! Sooner or later,
           somewhere in the course of eternal
           justice thou shalt answer for this
           sin!
           Though Epps fronts rage, there should be underlying
           anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats.

<b>                          EPPS
</b>           No sin! There is no sin! A man
           does how he pleases with his
           property. At the moment, Platt, I
           am of great pleasure. You be
           goddamn careful I don't come to
           wantin' to lightenin' my mood no
           further.
           By contrast to this horror, the field of cotton smiles in
           the warm sunlight. The birds chirp merrily amidst the
           foliage of the tress. Peace and happiness seems to reign
           everywhere.
           Everywhere else.
           Epps leaves Patsey to herself. He says not a word to the
           Mistress as he passes. The Mistress herself heads back
           into the house.
           Solomon unties Patsey, lifts her and takes her to the
           cabin.

           Patsey is laid on some boards where she remains for a
           long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony. Phebe
           applies melted tallow to her wounds, and all try to
           assist and console her.
           In time Patsey opens her eyes. She looks to Solomon.
           She does not say a word. She just looks at him...and
           then her eyes close again.

<b>           -APRIL, 1852-
</b>           Solomon and Bass are working together alone on the
           extension. From the amount of work that's been done on
           it, it should be obvious that days have now passed.
           Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass. As casually
           as he can he inquires:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Master Bass, I want to ask you
           what part of the country you came
           from?

<b>                          BASS
</b>           No part of this land. I was born
           in Canada. Now guess where that
           is.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Oh, I know where Canada is. I
           have been there myself.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           Have you?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Montreal and Kingston and
           Queenston and a great many places.
           And I have been in York state,
           too. Buffalo and Rochester and
           Albany, and can tell you the names
           of the villages on the Erie canal
           and the Champlain canal.
           Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           Well traveled for a slave. How
           came you here?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Master Bass, if justice had been
           done I never would have been here.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           How's this? Tell me all about it.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I am afraid to tell you, though I
           don't believe you would tell
           Master Epps if I should.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           Every word you speak is a profound
           secret.

           before? Prior to Solomon stating his case, WE FADE TO:

</b>
           Hours have passed. Bass reflects on the story that Epps
           has told in the intervening.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           How many years all told?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Just nearly...just passed eleven.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           Your story is...it is amazing, and
           in no good way.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Do you believe, sir, in justice as
           you have said?

<b>                          BASS
</b>           I do.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           That slavery is an evil that
           should befall none?

<b>                          BASS
</b>           I believe so.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           If you truly do, I would ask...I
           would beg that you write my
           friends in the north, acquainting
           them with my situation and
           beseeching them to forward free
           papers, or take such steps as they
           might consider proper to secure my
           release.
           Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a
           prolonged beat.

<b>                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)
</b>           My daughter Margaret is possibly
           now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16. I
           miss them so. It would be an
           unspeakable happiness to clasp my
           wife and my family again.
           Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and
           looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the
           conversation by work. They both lift it toward the
           floorboards. Finally Bass speaks.

           Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon
           immediately hands over.

</b>           But that was a long, long time

           country for the best part of
           twenty years. My freedom is
           everything. The fact that I can
           walk out of here tomorrow gives me
           most pleasure. I see the aching in
           your eyes, the pain of not being
           attached to your loved ones. My
           life doesn't mean much to anyone,
           but it seems your life means a lot
           to a lot of people. What you have

           must say, sir, I am afraid. Not
           just for you, but for me.
           They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison.
           Solomon, slightly confused.

           nails, sir.
           We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the
           unfinished structure. They continue to work, as if the
           conversation had never occurred.

           more on his way back from Bartholomew's - sack familiarly
           slung over his right shoulder. Drearily he walks. His

           Slaves continue to work on it. As they do so, Bass peels
           away from the structure to have an overview. He beckons
           Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who
           are continuing to work on the gazebo. As Solomon
           approaches, Bass shouts-

<b>                          BASS
</b>           And bring those markers!
           Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and

           each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how
           greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon. Equally,
           we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass. The
           moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither
           man can openly speak his regret or thanks. A moment
           longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his
           way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.
           Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone.

           Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in
           hand. He stares across the expanse. His eyes fixed on
           something that is a million miles away.
           Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg
           tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound
           is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as
           if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the
           breaking point of sound, there is a snap.
           He then repeats the action.
           Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb
           and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it
           at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it
           from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the
           ground.
           He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it
           falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small
           bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of
           violence, rather than aggressive. Seems almost to be, in
           an odd way, respectful.

</b>           Not claims. I have no doubts.
           This is Solomon Northup, a
           resident of Saratoga Springs, NY.

</b>           As is your right. As it will be
           my pleasure to bankrupt you in the
           courts. Your decision.
           By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome
           their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered
           in the yard as witnesses. They stand behind the cabin,
           out of sight of Epps.
           Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda
           next to her house slave. Her face is of a strange mixed
           emotion.
           Epps looks to Solomon. Solomon icily, stoically holds
           his ground. He makes it quite clear in his countenance
           that nobody owns him. Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there
           to back Solomon up. Epps, with no other recourse than to

           here.
           Epps walks back into the plantation.
           The trio starts for the carriage. Solomon is pulled back
           by the call of Patsey's voice:

<b>                          PATSEY
</b>           Platt...
           Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey.
           Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to
           engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around
           Solomon and they embrace.
           Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter.
           Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he
           rides off furiously.
           Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps:

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           Solomon...if we know what's wise,
           we should depart.
           A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other. They
           separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage. He and
           Parker alight. The Sheriff chides the horses and they

           ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining
           state, the other slaves around her.
           WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further
           from the slaves - who are diminished by distance.
           Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a
           bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes
           forever more.

<b>           -MARCH, 1853-
</b>           We now see Solomon in front of a door. A door we have
           seen before at the very beginning of our story. Solomon,
           aged significantly since then, stands nervously,
           swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and
           holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A
           tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he
           wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and
           looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places
           his hand on Solomon's shoulder. He says gently-

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           Are you ready?
           Solomon swallows and nods.

           THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS. Mr. Parker enters, Solomon
           behind. We first see Anne, in her finest attire; the
           Northup children: Alonzo, who is now seventeen and
           Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A
           BUNDLE. Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family
           waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.
           Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the
           body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They
           are, after all - after twelve years - little more than
           familiar strangers.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I apologize for my appearance. I
           have had a difficult time of
           things these past many years.
           Solomon looks among his family; trying to recall them as
           much as they look to see familiarity within him. To his

           Margaret, tearing, hugs her father. Solomon almost
           breaks, but he keeps himself together. Looking to the

           Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father.

</b>           And this is your grandson.
           Solomon Northup Staunton.

</b>           ...Solomon...
           The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming.
           Solomon breaks down. Emotionally, physically... But
           ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM. As she holds him, Solomon
           says to Anne with all his heart:

</b>           Forgive me.

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           There is nothing to forgive.
           The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each
           other for life...and one would think for all the rest of
           their lives.

</b>           against whites. The charges against the kidnappers were
           eventually dismissed.
           Northup spent the rest of his life working as an
           abolitionist, and with the Underground Railroad.
           Solomon Northup most likely died between 1863 and 1875.
           The exact date, place, and circumstances of his death
           remain unknown.
