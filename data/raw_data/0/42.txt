           bottom. Pluming off into dust. White, white, white. We 
           move toward it even as it recedes, always out of reach. 
           Finally we pop out wide and high to reveal...

          Blinds closed. Dust motes in the air. A large GOLDFISH TANK
          bubbles. BRANCH RICKEY at his desk. Two photos on the wall:
          Abe Lincoln &amp; Leo Durocher. CHALKBOARDS covered with 100's
          OF NAMES, every player in the Dodger organization.

          CLYDE SUKEFORTH and HAROLD PARROTT sit across from Rickey
          who stares at them. Sukeforth stares back. Parrott nervous.

</b>          A plan's always good, Mr. Rickey.

          against me. But I'm going to do it.

          Parrott looks to Sukeforth who keeps his eyes on Rickey.

<b>                         SUKEFORTH
</b>          Do what, Mr. Rickey?

          Rickey looks dismissively at Parrott, over to Sukeforth.

          Negro baseball fans; every dollar
          is green. I don't know who he is,
          or where he is, but he's coming.

<b>          2 EXT. RICKWOOD FIELD - BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA - NIGHT 2
</b>
          The big Birmingham Black Barons CATCHER behind the plate as
          Kansas City Monarchs JOHN SCOTT stands at bat. The catcher's
          attention on the RUNNER DANCING off first. Stomping a foot,
          feinting, hard to see clearly in the glare of the lights.

<b>                         CATCHER
</b>          Where'd you learn to move like
          that, runner?! At dime a dance
          night?! Stay quiet!
          INSERT: Birmingham, Alabama. April 8, 1945. 
          On the first pitch the runner takes off. The catcher fires to
          second. See it from his POV as the runner slides in âSAFE!â
          A foot on the bag, the runner dusts off, heckles the catcher:

<b>                         RUNNER
</b>          Is that the best you got?! Huh?!
          I'm going to steal nine, ten bases
          today! You better start counting!
          The catcher frowns. Standing, we see he is a big, big man.

<b>                         CATCHER
</b>
<b>                         (ALABAMAN)

<b>                         CATCHER
</b>          He's got a mouth on him.
          Shaking his head, the catcher gets back in his crouch,
          signals the PITCHER. On the wind-up, the Runner is off
          again. The catcher fires to THIRD: âSafe!â

<b>                         RUNNER
</b>          You got a rag arm, catcher!

<b>                         CATCHER
</b>          Steal home! You'll find out what
          kind of arm I got!

<b>                         RUNNER
</b>          Okay, I'm coming!
          The Catcher looks over at Scott who chuckles.

<b>                         CATCHER
</b>          California, huh?

<b>                         (SCOTT NODS)
</b>          Well California here he goes, if he
          comes down here.
          The Catcher gets back down in his squat. Signals the
          pitcher: fastball. Scott digs in, ready. The runner dancing
          off third. Here comes the wind-up...
          The Runner takes off even as the pitcher fires it in. The
          Birmingham Catcher receives it. As the Runner slides --
          The Catcher intentionally drives his glove, the ball and both
          hands into the runner's face -- WHALLOP! Sound drops as
          we're knocked flat senseless along with the runner.
          ON HIM now as he tries to push himself up from the dirt. A
          close look at JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON. A born battler, he
          shakes out the cobwebs, finally lurches to his feet, looks to
          the UMPIRE. He never heard the call.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          What was I?
          The umpire passes one hand over the other: Safe. Jack looks
          over at the catcher, gives him a pointed look as he goes --
          The catcher shoves him in the back. Jack turns, shoves back.
          As the two men wrestles each other to the ground --

          As Parrott sets them on the desk, they start to slide off,

          looks down, surrounded by black faces...

</b>          He was court-martialed. A trouble
          maker. He argues with umpires. A

          Rickey is obviously keen on him. 

<b>                         PARROT 
</b>          What was he court-martialed for? 

<b>                         RICKEY

</b>          A man needs a family relying on

          Jack looks to Sukeforth who smiles placidly. Back to Rickey.

</b>          I don't make much money. Between
          the army and now baseball I've been
          away a lot. And Rae, Rachel, she
          wants to finish school. Considering
          all that, I say I think so.

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          Do you love her? Rachel?

<b>                         (JACK CONFUSED)

</b>          Yes, sir, very much.

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          Marry her.
          What? Rickey stands, walks to a window. Jack looks at
          Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance.

<b>          RICKEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Baseball's a hard life; a man needs
          a good woman by his side. You
          don't want the only person waiting
          for you at home to be a catcher.
          Sukeforth chuckles at that. Rickey fingers open a slat on
          the blind and peers out. Jack looks hard at him.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Coach Sukeforth here said you were
          starting a new Negro League. That
          doesn't make sense to me.

<b>          MR. RICKEY
</b>          It doesn't, huh? Are you calling
          us liars, Jack?

<b>                         JACK
</b>          What's this about, Mr. Rickey?

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          This is about baseball.
          Rickey opens the shade. Sunlight floods in. Rickey follows
          it to the chalkboard, to the list of players under Montreal.

<b>          RICKEY (CONT'D)

          Jack looks to Sukeforth who nods: Yes, you heard right.

          Believe it or not that's a lot of money to Jack on this day
          in time. This is all becoming a bit overwhelming.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Yes, sir. That's fine.

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          There is one condition. I have a
          pile of scouting reports. I know
          you can hit behind the runner, that
          you can read a pitch. The question

          Rickey furious, the avuncular old man gone. Jack sits there, 
          fists now balled. Rickey to Sukeforth like he's not there:

<b>                         SUKEFORTH
</b>          He'll need to be.
          Rickey looks back to Jack who is as angry as he is confused.

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          I want to win! I want ballplayers

          will be out in force, but you can
          not meet him on his own low ground.
          We win with hitting, running and
          fielding, nothing else. We win if
          the world is convinced of two
          things: that you are a fine
          gentlemen and a great ballplayer.
          Like our Savior, you must have the
          guts to turn the other cheek.
          Jack considers Rickey. Rickey looks worn out.

          Jack poised at what will be his Rubicon. He crosses.

</b>          Mr. Rickey, you give me a uniform,

          only to religion in strengthening
          the morals of the American people.'

          They shake hands. Brock looks to Smith, obviously knows him.

<b>          MR. BROCK

</b>          I'm just a ballplayer, Mr. Brock.

<b>          MR. BROCK

          today. You're a hero to them.
          The look on Jack's face says that's a heavy burden.

<b>          MR. BROCK (CONT'D)
</b>          Sit down, have something to drink.
          My special rum and coke.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          No thank you, sir, I don't drink.

</b>          A ballplayer who doesn't drink?
          That's a new one on me.

<b>                         SMITH
</b>          I'll have one. I'm a stereotypical

          pitch as a LOW LINE DRIVE shoots for the gap between 1st and
          2nd. Robinson turns himself inside out to dive on his belly
          and catch it before it hits the ground.
          He spins himself around, pivots on a knee to throw the runner
          out before he can get back to first. Â  Rickey is astounded.

          away, Mr. Rickey, that's still a
          Nigger out there.
          Rickey takes a moment to process. It's Hopper's light
          admonishing tone that really halts him. Finally...

<b>                         RICKEY

          you can manage Robinson fairly and
          correctly or you can be unemployed.
          They both look over as Jack comes off the field toward them.

          over the plate. Here comes the pitch. Low. âBall four!â

<b>                         RACHEL &amp; SMITH

<b>                         HIGBE
</b>          Looks ill-tempered over to first where Jack gives the same
          look back as he sidesteps an enormous, defiant lead off the
          bag. Higbe incredulous. Did he just do that?

          Higbe fires to LAVAGETTO at first. Jack dives back in time.

</b>          Higbe gets the ball back, settles. Jack takes a lead, but a 
          modest one this time. Here come the pitch -- And Jack goes.
          You knew he was fast; but not this fast. Bragan's throw to 
          Pee Wee is late and high. Pee Wee throws back to Higbe. 
          Higbe sets. Bragan gives him a sign. Jack takes a lead. On 
          the wind-up, Jack goes. Bragan stands -- it's a PITCH OUT. 
          Bragan fires to third and Jack is caught in a RUN DOWN. It 
          seems like half the team gets involved with Higbe finally 
          getting the ball by third and Jack ducking under the tag. 
          Safe! A BUZZ goes through the stadium now as people start to 
          realize they are not watching something or someone ordinary.

<b>                         HIGBE &amp; JACK
</b>          Higbe looks home for the sign, Jack dancing off third, 
          pounding his right foot toward home. He feints hard home. 
          Higbe steps off the rubber. Jack stays where he is. 

<b>                         HIGBE
</b>          Hell! You're supposed to go back
          to third when I step off! Don't
          you know nothing?!
          He throws over. Jack back to the bag. Higbe gets the ball
          back, looks in. Jack bouncing, pounding off third. His 
          movements carry violence within them. Like a piston 
          exploding in an engine. 
          Higbe into his motion, stops his delivery, accidentally drops 
          the ball to the ground. The umpire signals BALK, points Jack
          home. Higbe is furious.

          covering. Too late. Only Jack doesn't stop.
          Realizing the SHORTSTOP isn't covering the bag, Jack bolts
          for second. The second baseman has to wait on the throw and
          when he makes it -- The UMPIRE signals safe. A bunt double!
          Spider Jorgensen settles in the batter's box. The pitch.

</b>          He may stay there or he may be
          brought to Brooklyn. But if Jackie
          does come up to the Dodgers, the
          biggest threat to his success, the
          one enemy most likely to ruin that
          success, is the Negro people
          themselves!
          There is shocked silence in the room. Rickey notices a group 
          of KIDS watching from a raised running track, soldiers on: 

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          I say it as cruelly as I can to
          make you all realize the weight of
          responsibility that is not only on
          myself and the Dodgers, but on
          Negroes everywhere. For on the day
          Jackie enters the National League,
          if he does, I have no doubt every
          one of you will form parades and
          welcoming committees. You'll
          strut. You'll wear badges. You'll
          hold Jackie Robinson days and
          Jackie Robinson nights. You'll get
          drunk, fight and be arrested.
          This is too much. People are slackjawed. Rickey powers on.

          is fat and futile. You'll
          symbolize his importance into a
          national comedy and yes, a tragedy!
          So let me tell you this!
          (pounds his fist)
          If any group or segment of Negro
          society uses the advancement of
          Jackie Robinson in baseball as a
          triumph of race over race, I will
          regret the day I ever signed him to
          a contract, and I will personally
          see that baseball is never so
          abused and misrepresented again!

          Dodgers are never gonna demand
          Robinson be brought up from
          Montreal. Ball players are

          accept him? Once they see how he
          plays, how he can help them win.

</b>          I'm not saying they won't accept
          him: I'm saying they won't ask for
          him. I'm saying Robinson's good
          medicine, but they're not gonna
          like the taste. I'm saying bend

</b>          Sitting down across from Rickey.

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          I received your letter, Dixie.

<b>                         (READS)
</b>          Recently, the thought has occurred
          to me that a change of ball clubs
          would benefit both the Brooklyn
          Baseball Club and myself.

<b>                         (TO WALKER)
</b>          This is about Robinson?

<b>                         WALKER
</b>          I'm keeping my reasons private.
          Hope you can respect that, sir.

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          I realize, Dixie, that you have a
          Southern upbringing, that you would
          have to subordinate your feelings
          for the welfare of this venture. I
          for one would deeply appreciate it.
          I think we can all learn something.

<b>                         WALKER
</b>          What I have, Mr. Rickey, is a
          hardware store back home. It's
          called Dixie Walker's. Folks don't
          come because I have the lowest
          prices, they come because it's
          called Dixie Walker's. Understand?
          And I make as much money owning
          that store as I do playing for you.

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          Is that what you're you afraid of?
          (he doesn't answer)
          Bragan's a third-stringer, but you
          bat clean-up. You're popular in
          Brooklyn. Children look up to you!

<b>                         WALKER
</b>          You got my letter; can I go?

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          I'll start looking for a trade or a
          sale. But it won't happen until I
          get value in return. Until then I
          expect you to drive in runs.

<b>                         WALKER 
</b>          I always have. That's my job.

          Jack exits with his luggage. Looking for a cab, he sees
          Smith waiting. Smith offers a salute. Jack looks grumpy as
          he steps over. The Buick waiting beyond.

</b>          You again.
          Smith leans back, blinks.

<b>                         SMITH
</b>          That's right. Me again. Something
          wrong with that, Jack?

<b>                         SMITH
</b>          They can't keep you on Montreal for
          long. After these exhibition

          my knees? Does that ever cross
          your mind?
          Jack stares out the passenger window, not in the mood. As he
          looks up at some of the taller buildings they pass...

<b>                         SMITH
</b>          It's because Negro reporters aren't

          That was Mr. Ford's estate. My

</b>          I did not know that.

<b>                         SMITH
</b>          Cooked for him for years, but never
          once broke bread with him. I'd go
          to work with daddy sometimes. Play
          baseball out on the lawn with Mr.
          Ford's grandchildren. We all had a
          real good time. But it was
          understood, if they got tired of
          playing ball and moved inside to
          the bowling alley or swimming pool,
          I was not invited or allowed. The
          grass was as far as I got. So
          guess what? You're not the only

<b>                         JACK

          Smith stops at a red light.

</b>          I apologize. You've been there for
          me through this more than anyone
          besides Rae and Mr. Rickey. But I
          guess that's what bothers me.

<b>                         SMITH

          should I let you out so you can
          walk?
          Jack bursts out laughing. So does Smith.

          upset team chemistry and so the

</b>          I saw him at a UCLA football game.
          Even in uniform with a helmet on,
          his vanity was awful. It was the 
          way he held his hands on his hips.
          I hated him!

<b>                         (RICKEY LAUGHS)
</b>          And on campus he always wore crisp
          white shirts and I'd think his skin
          is so dark, why would he do that?
          Then I got to know him, his pride
          and confidence, and I realized he
          was showing off his color. I was
          wrong. He wasn't conceited; he was 
          proud. Always, of who and what he 
          is. I'd never met another man like
          that. What about you? How did you
          meet your wife?

</b>          Everything. I can't apologize to
          him. He and I both knew what we
          were getting into. But you. A
          newlywed, trying to blossom a

          was my instrument. Can you
          imagine? I wish I could help him,
          but I'm just a spectator.

</b>          Is he able to get things off his
          chest? So he doesn't burn up?

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Yes. I have to let him have that
          silence at first, let him come to
          me. But he opens up eventually.

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          Good. It's too much to carry
          inside. Does he have any friends
          on the team?
          (she gives him a look)
          They're spectators, too. They do
          admire him though.
          Rachel looks out to where Reese and Stanky play catch.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Do you think so?

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          Even the worst of us recognizes
          courage. Moral courage especially.
          I have to think they see it.
          Jackie's a man on trial. He's
          responding with glory and grace.
          No one can take their eyes off him.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          He's had himself on trial since the
          day I met him. No man is harder on
          himself or gets to himself worse
          than Jack. But I hope his team-
          mates know, they're on trial too.

          ENOS SLAUGHTER steps in for St. Louis. Hugh Casey on the
          mound for Brooklyn. Slaughter looks fiercely determined.

<b>          RED BARBER'S VOICE
</b>          It wasn't enough as the Cardinals
          tied it with two of their own in
          the top of the ninth. This game is
          crucial to the Red Birds. They're
          five games out, the Dodgers having
          not relinquished first place sine
          June 30th.
          Casey throws a pitch. Inside, a ball.

          Casey in his second inning of
          relief. This game is tighter than
          a new pair of shoes on a rainy day.
          Slaughter hitless in four trips as 
          Casey goes into his wind-up. 
          Slaughter swings, hits a hard ground ball right at Reese who
          fires over to Jack at first. Slaughter is out by fifteen
          feet, but he never slows down. And his foot comes down --
          -- High on Jack's right calf. Slaughter's spiked him
          something wicked. Jack goes down in a heap clutching his
          leg, blood already seeping through his high socks.
          Slaughter, head down, on his way to the visitor's dugout as
          Dodger players pour out of their own to protest. As the UMP
          raises his hands, motions them all back... Jack pulls up his
          sock, a bloody mess. Stanky looks to Casey.

          As Casey nods, Jack reaches up to Stanky and Reese.
          They pull him to his feet. Jack looks, finds Rachel in the
          stands. As he gives her a little wave: âI'm okay.'

          Branch Rickey was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1967. 

          Pee Wee Reese was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1984.

          Bobby Bragan retired the following year and became a manager
          in the Dodger minor leagues. He is credited with mentoring
          several African American minor league players.

          Wendell Smith became the first African-American sportswriter 
          to join the Baseball Writers Association in 1948.

          Ben Chapman was fired in 1948 and never managed again.

          Jackie Robinson was named Major League Rookie of the Year in 
          1947. He won the World Series in 1955 against the New York 
          Yankees, stealing home in Game One. He was elected to the 
          Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. 

          We end on a montage of Jackie Robinson Day in present time.
          Every year in April, all MLB players wear the number 42 as a
          reminder of Jackie's accomplishments on and off the field.

          The number 42 is the only number retired by all of baseball.
 
          We see 42s leaving their dugouts, 42s at bat, 42s in the
