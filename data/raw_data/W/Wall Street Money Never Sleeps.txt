<b>                         WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS

<b>          A BLACK SCREEN
</b>          Onto which is written in white letters...

          "When business in the United States underwent a
          contraction... the Federal Reserve created more paper
          reserves.

          The excess credit spilled over into the market triggering a
          fantastic speculative boom... "



<b>          EXT. CLINTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY
</b>
          It's a summer day. The heat floats above the pavement.
          A cab waits in the lot.

          The large gates of New York's largest prison open and today's
          group of newly released emerge.

          They pass a guard who lifts up a copy of The USA Today to
          reveal the headlines and date that tells us it's 2002.
          Amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel.
          And we know this man. He is Gordon Gekko.

          But he is not as slick as we remember... he doesn't have that
          gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair. No, this is a
          very different version of the man we remember... because now
          there's nothing behind those eyes... nothing we can read
          anyway.

          And he just stands there... coldly watching his recently
          freed brethren greet their wives and children... reuniting
          with the people who waited for them... the people who love
          them.

          The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger... wait
          a minute. He glares over to the entrance of the lot...
          waiting for his people... but they don't come.

          And the cab waits... Gordon stands there... in the heat...
          completely disappointed... and completely alone.
          And we...

<b>          SLAM BACK INTO
</b>          As the white letters reappear on the screen...
          "As a result... the American economy collapsed...
          Taken from an article about the pre-crash 1929...
          ... written by Alan Greenspan."

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.)
</b>           It's funny, the more we find ourselves
           slaves of chance... the more
           superstitious we become.

</b>           And that would make Andrew Zabel one
           superstitious motherfucker.

          Find ANDREW ZABEL, mid 50s, shaved-head and in good shape.

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           He started every day the same exact
           way. He would walk his dogs then
           leave his Gramercy Park condo at seven
           am on the dot.

          As Andrew leaves 36 East Gramercy Park East, an impressive
          building made of white stone.
          Andrew wears a suit and holds an umbrella.

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           And he would take an umbrella with him
           even when there was no chance of
           rain...

          As Andrew heads to a newsstand and throws the INDIAN CLERK a
          familiar nod. And without saying a word, the clerk knows
          exactly what to give him.

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           He'd buy a journal, a tin of chocolate
           Altoids and a cold bottle of Poland
           Springs water.

<b>          23RD ST SUBWAY STATION
</b>          As Andrew bounds down the stairs and through the gate...

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           He had timed it out so he wouldn't
           have to wait more than three minutes
           for the uptown five train.

          As Andrew emerges out to the platform and sees the headlight
          from the 5 train coming down the tunnel.

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           I guess you could say that day was
           like every other...

          And as the train approaches... holding that Wall Street
          Journal... the bottle of water and that tin of Altoids...

<b>                          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           Except for one thing...

          ... Andrew Zabel simply steps forward and falls onto the
          track.

          "Money Never Sleeps" graces the screen... and we move down
          below the letters to find...

<b>                         A CHART

          Average. It's for the year 2008 and it's down to the
          right... not good.
          A circle marks Friday June 13th. Follow a blue line back
          three days and stop. Another circle is now formed and
          Matthew Good's "Giant" rings out...

          Move with this throng, to the Matthew Good tune, under the
          opening titles, past 745 Seventh Avenue, the Lehman Brothers
          building... with that giant ticker that rounds the building
          posting Dow 12,579.76 -- +119.86

          And keep moving... all is normal in the financial center of
          the universe.

          Land on a impressive modern building made of glass and steel
          then climb up it to the top... to the penthouse office

          An impressive office with a 180 degree view of southern

          And across from Andrew Zabel sits JACOB L. MOORE... who holds
          his bonus check.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Really?
          On the wall over Zabel's shoulder runs an electronic ticker
          with the major indices and just one stock... ticker KZI...
          Keller Zabel Investments.

</b>           I thought that because of the problems

<b>                          ZABEL
</b>           Screw the credit derivative desk, I
           don't understand half the shit they do
           anyway.
          Zabel forces a smile. But Jacob can tell something's wrong
          with him.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Are you okay?
          Zabel doesn't answer... he just nods to the envelope.

<b>                          ZABEL
</b>           Open it.
          He opens the envelope and looks down at the check.
          $1,450,000. And he can barely contain his excitement.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Thank you.
          And we get a good look at Jacob now... boyish features that
          display humility with a trace of mischievousness thrown in.
          He's definitely sexy, definitely cerebral and definitely
          winning.

<b>                          ZABEL
</b>           I'm proud of you, Jacob.
          And Jacob tries to play it cool as he looks up at the
          electronic ticker on the wall... 12,592.46 -- +132.46... KZI

          Two bedroom in a Murray Hill high rise. Jacob watches Fox
          Business on his tv. A much nicer, much bigger, much flatter
          plasma sits against the wall under it waiting to be
          installed.
          A promo plays for a magazine show being narrated by Cody

<b>           CODY WILLARD (ON TV)
</b>           Tomorrow night we explore the excesses
           of hedge fund managers.
          Different pictures flash on the screen of private jets,
          massive mansions, expensive watches and wines.

<b>           CODY WILLARD (ON TV) (CONT'D)
</b>           Whether they're spraying $5000 a
           bottle champagne at Voile Rouge in
           Saint-Tropez, ordering a $10,000
           Martini at The Algonquian Hotel with a
           diamond on the bottom or eating a gold
           dusted $175 hamburger at the Wall

          Now the flashes are of some of the top HEDGE FUND MANAGERS in

          named BRETTON WOODS... maybe we hold a little longer on him

<b>           CODY WILLARD (ON TV) (CONT'D)
</b>           ... these cowboys of finance always

          He grabs the phone and makes a call...

          He grabs a framed picture of her and looks at it.
          She's in workout gear, wearing earbuds, obviously just off a
          run, caught off guard and thus flipping him the finger...
          it's adorable.

<b>          INT. KELLER, ZABEL INVESTMENTS/TRADING FLOOR - MORNING

          A large space lined with long desks that hold five TRADERS
          each. Each trader has two phones and three huge monitors in
          front of them.
          It's loud and frenetic. Most of the traders are under thirty-
          five, it's a young person's game.
          Jacob heads in and takes his seat at his desk. It's larger
          than the others and anchors the room... this is his domain.
          Fox Business plays on each of the screens that line the space

          Audry grins in victory.
          Willy shakes his head, grabs a marker, scribbles something
          down on a post-it then places it on his forehead. It reads
          "I bought Toll Brothers at $24" and he has to wear it all
          week.

          Diego cracks up. Jacob just shakes his head and moves on.
          And Jacob walks uptown... deep in thought. It's a gorgeous
          June Friday.
          Suddenly, Jacob just stops walking and stands there for a
          long moment... coming to a decision.
          And as Jacob turns around and starts heading the other way...

<b>          INT. 36 GRAMERCY PARK EAST/LOBBY - MORNING

          Jacob smiles to the doorman.

<b>                          JACOB

          And Andrew Zabel doesn't seem all there... introspective and
          blank.

<b>                          ZABEL
</b>           I remember when the starter gave me
           this bushy hair twelve year old kid
           and I said; "Donny, what the fuck --

</b>           Because I know you, Jacob. And I know

           four percent on the session.

          She can only shrug... tears in her eyes.
          Jacob shifts his gaze over to the trading floor's electronic
          ticker on the wall... KZI $26.34... -$29.57.

          He disconnects the call and keeps walking.
          After a beat, with his anger brewing... Jacob SLAMS his phone
          down on the ground and it shatters.

<b>          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - DAY

          footage of THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, a tough looking man in

<b>                          GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE)

           this practice of short selling
           American financial institutions then
           floating rumors in order to profit
           from them must be stopped. The uptick

          Another knock... this time louder. Jacob mutes the tv.

<b>                          JACOB

<b>                          ROBBY
</b>           Dude...
          He stops short... swallows...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           What?

<b>                          ROBBY
</b>           I just found this out and it hasn't
           hit the press yet.
          Once again... he stops short and looks away in frustration.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           What? Robby, what are you trying to
           say?

<b>                          ROBBY
</b>           Andrew Zabel threw himself in front of
           the subway this morning.
          Jacob just stands in that doorway. No reaction at all.
          Absolutely frozen.

<b>          INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Jacob now stands in the center of his apartment. Completely
          in shock. As he looks to the plasma... Fox Business on mute.
          Brian Sullivan reporting under the graphic KZI $19.34... -

<b>          $37.28.
</b>          He glares at it for a long moment, then... almost calmly
          picks up a chair and throws it into the tv... which shatters.
          And Jacob... not sure what to do. Until... he turns and
          sees... on the dresser... a gorgeous engagement ring sitting
          in an open box... a fuck you ring.

<b>          EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY/CAMPUS - DAY
</b>
          As Jacob bounds the steps of the Business School and heads
          into the old stone building.

<b>           18.
</b>
                         

                         

<b>          INT. COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF BUSINESS/URIS LECTURE HALL - DAY
</b>
          The lecture hall is packed with wall to wall students. Jacob
          stands at the back.
          A PROFESSOR is at the podium.

<b>                          PROFESSOR
</b>           Our speaker today has quite a
           checkered background in the world of
           finance.
          Some laughter from the room.

<b>                          PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
</b>           He graduated from City College in 1966
           and became a securities broker at
           Hudson River Bank then moved on to
           Smith Barney. In 1973 he went out on
           his own to establish a spectacular
           career as a independent trader then an
           active participant in the LBO craze of
           the 1980s.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           In 1988, he was indicted for insider
           trading and then charged with other
           various forms of securities fraud and
           IRS violations. In one of the most
           harshest sentences ever given to a
           white collar criminal... he served
           fourteen years in a maximum security
           prison and he wants me to stress that
           it was not a country club.
          Again laughter from the floor.

<b>                          PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Since his release in 2002, he has
           written and has spoken publicly about
           what he refers to as the current state
           of the world economy. He is not
           allowed to trade on the US exchanges.
           His new book "Moral Hazard! Why Wall
           Street Has Finally Gone Too Far."
           comes out in October.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Please welcome... Gordon Gekko!
          The room applauds... and out to the podium slowly walks...

<b>                         GORDON GEKKO
</b>          No swagger in his step... not in a suit... hair not slicked
          back... but still looks fucking good.
          As he waits for the applause to wind down... and even a
          little longer... surveying every corner of the large room...
          commanding its full attention... getting it... holding the
          silence... until finally... he leans into the mic and says...

<b>           19.
</b>
                         

                         

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           You're all pretty much fucked.
          The room breaks into laughter... Gordon smiles and waits for
          it to die down.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           What's not funny is what's happening
           out there. I don't think people get
           it. And I know the financial center
           of the world doesn't get it... which
           happens to be Washington DC now.
          As he takes to a pace...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           To understand where we are, we need to
           understand how we got here. No good
           deed goes unpunished, all fires start
           with a well meaning spark and we
           wanted Americans to be able to afford
           homes. Sounds nice enough... lets try
           to get the middle and lower classes
           into homes they can own. So we made
           money cheap and lowered restrictions
           on mortgage lending.
          As he takes a moment and looks over the room...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Somebody reminded me the other night
           that I once said "greed is good." I
           swear I don't remember it but it
           sounds like something I would say in
           the Eighties.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           And I was right then. Greed was good.
           America needed greed and risk-taking
           and leverage to get to become the
           superpower we are... or were. And
           capitalism needed greed and risk and
           leverage to become the economic
           platform it has become... but those
           same attributes that got us there are
           now the liabilities that threaten to
           destroy us.
          Jacob's blackberry vibrates and he checks it. He has a text.
          "KZI!!! -- wtf?"

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           So greed has been redefined. Who
           knows -- maybe it was always like this
           and like everything else in this
           world, it's good and it is evil.
          Taking a moment to survey the room...

<b>           20.
</b>
                         

                         

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Because people -- it's greed that
           caused someone who aspires to own a
           seven-hundred thousand dollar house
           they can't afford, to take on a loan
           they'll never be able to pay back...
           and it's greed that caused their
           mortgage lender to give them that loan
           then sell it right away... and it's
           greed that caused the buyer of that
           loan to slice it into a million little
           pieces then spit them all over the
           world... and it's greed that caused
           the rating agency to give that toxic
           loan a triple-A rating just because it
           was mixed in with some good loans...
           and it's greed that caused the
           insurance company to insure that loan.
          Jacob quickly glances down again at his blackberry and checks
          the quote, KZI $14.53.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           They were insuring the end of the
           world; "When the world explodes...
           just find us in the rubble and we'll
           be sure to pay your claim."
          Drawing in a deep breath...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           CMO's, CLO's, CBO's, CDO's, CDS's,
           SPE's, ABCP's,SIV's, REMIC's, CMBS's,
           toxic traunches, ninja loans, credit
           default swaps, affinity marketing,
           stapled financing, synthetic
           securitization.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Maybe I was in prison too long but I
           have no idea what half that shit
           means.
          The room laughs in agreement.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           And I'm considered a pretty smart guy
           when it comes to finance!
          And Jacob's blackberry vibrates again. This time he removes
          it from his pocket, doesn't check it and simply turns it off.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           And if I know our central bank --
           which I do -- I predict it's going to
           throw gasoline on this fire with more
           cheap money and federal bailouts and

<b>                          HEAD-IN-THE-SAND MANIPULATED
</b>           statistics on productivity and
           inflation.
          And Gordon stops pacing... takes a moment for effect.

<b>           21.
</b>
                         

                         
          Then sums it all up with...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           So no good deed goes unpunished and
           all fires start with a well-meaning
           spark and when you take free money and
           no lending standards then add it with
           unaccountable risk and ungodly
           leverage and unbridled greed... what
           you end up with is cancer.
          And Gordon takes in a deep breath...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Systemic, malignant and global.
          Now the room is completely silent.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Do they still have the V&amp;T restaurant
           on Amsterdam? Is that still there?
          A stunned girl in the front row shakes her head.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           (with a smile)
           God, I loved their pizza.

<b>          INT. URIS HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
          Jacob looks on as Gordon is surrounded by professors and
          students alike...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           (announcing to the throng)
           I'll give you six minutes then I
           really have to go.

<b>          EXT. URIS HALL - EXACTLY 6 MINUTES LATER
</b>
          Gordon quickly walks out with his PUBLISHER, a woman in her
          40s and heads into the quad. Jacob immediately matches their
          stride.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Mr. Gekko, can I speak to you for a
           moment?
          As he keeps walking...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           You're too late, Sport... Q&amp;A's over.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           My name is Jacob Moore and I'm dating
           your daughter.

<b>                          (AND THEN)
</b>           I'm going to ask her to marry me.
          And this makes Gordon stop and finally face Jacob with...

<b>           22.
</b>
                         

                         

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           I'll give you nine minutes.

<b>          EXT. 112TH STREET - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          As Gordon and Jacob leave the campus and take to the street.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Keller, Zabel? Then you have my
           apologies.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Yeah...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Stock's in a free fall. My guess is
           that it just lost its Bar Mitzvah...
          Jacob quickly takes out his blackberry, turns it on and
          checks to see Gordon's right... KZI... $12.54.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           By the end of the day it might not
           even be potty trained.
          And Jacob looks at him.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           I might not be allowed to trade, Jake,
           but I still love to watch from home.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Andrew Zabel took me under his wing
           when I was in high school. He
           basically got me my scholarship to
           Yale then hired me right out of
           business school.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Andrew's smart, he beats the
           benchmarks consistently. He'll land
           on his feet.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           He's dead.
          And Gordon stops walking and regards Jacob. Who confirms...

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           He killed himself this morning.
          As that registers...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           I'm sorry to hear that.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           He was a father to me.

<b>           23.
</b>
                         

                         
          And Jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath
          and looks into Gordon's eyes... genuine and lofty...

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           I love your daughter very much and I
           would be honored if...
          And realizing what this is... Gordon starts to laugh... which
          throws Jacob off.

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           ... you would bless-- I really don't
           understand what you find so funny.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           My daughter hasn't spoken to me for
           eleven years and you know it. She
           blames me for her brother's overdose
           and every other disaster that's fallen
           upon the world since the mid-nineties.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           And by the way, isn't it strange that
           Winnie would date a guy from the
           street?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           What?

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           She hates me. And she hates Wall
           Street and everything it represents...
           so don't you find it curious that she
           would fall in love with you?
          And that slams into Jacob... who's frozen for a beat.
          Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           So you want my blessing?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Yes.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           I guess I should know a little about
           you first. Where did you grow up?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Matinecock.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           I'm impressed.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           It wasn't like that. I mean we didn't
           have much money. My mother was a
           tailor.

<b>           24.
</b>
                         

                         

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           And your father... what did he do?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Disappear.
          And Gordon regards Jacob for a long moment, taking him in,
          until...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Clever.
          Jacob looks down the street.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           What are you looking for?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Your town car.
          With a laugh...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Well, pal...
          As Gordon pats Jacob on the back...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           ... then you're going to be looking
           for quite awhile.
          ... and heads for the subway.

<b>          INT. 110TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAY
</b>
          Gordon takes out his wallet and produces his metrocard.
          Jacob notices a picture of Winnie in the wallet.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>
<b>                          (RE PICTURE)

          Gordon shrugs and shows the picture to Jacob.
          It's of a young Winnie and younger Gordon on the back of a
          gorgeous white horse.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           She was eight in that one. It was

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           You... wanna make a trade?
          And Gordon thinks about, then...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Yes. I'll give you this picture and
           in return... I'd like a picture of
           Winnie... taken recently... without
           you in it.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           I don't have one on me.
          Gordon sighs, takes the picture out of his wallet and hands
          it to Jacob.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Then I'll give you this one on margin.

<b>                         PLATFORM
</b>          As they wait for the train...
          Jacob produces the ring box and opens it to show Gordon the
          ring.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           I really did come to ask for your
           blessing.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           No, you didn't. Nice ring...
          As the train arrives...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           It's so typical.
           (inside of an ironic laugh)
           Levered to the hilt... and with the

          As he gets on...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

<b>          INT. THE DOWNTOWN 3 TRAIN - DAY
</b>
          Gordon stares at a one sheet advertisement on the wall.
          And he doesn't look at Jacob when he says...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Don't play me, Jake. You don't think
           I can see it in your eyes? You don't

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           I know it by sight, Kid... because I

           even smell it on you.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Smell what on me?

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Revenge.
          Jacob just looks away.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Some hedgehog said bad things about
           your company. It caused the stock to
           plummet and made those bad things
           become true.
          And Jacob now sees the poster that has Gordon's attention.
          It features a pile of money being blown out the window under
          the caption that reads... "If this looks familiar to you...
          it's because you're renting!"

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           The man you loved like a father threw
           himself in front of the uptown five
           this morning and you want to bring
           that hedgehog to their knees.

<b>                          JACOB

          "Guardian Mortgage... Low down payments... Adjustable rates."

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Like I said -- I still love to watch
           from home.
          And now Gordon turns to face Jacob with...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           So don't insult me by pretending to
           ask for Winnifred's hand when what you
           really want to know is who to bring
           down to their knees and how to do it.
          And Jacob swallows that back... doesn't argue it.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           I know who.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Really?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           It was either Nassim Tariq from the

           Locust or Karen Molina from ESL.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO

           me?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Well, not exactly.

<b>                          (THEN)
</b>           But I'm going to tell her.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Not such a grand idea, Pal.
          Off Jacob's confusion...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           See, I have a feeling you're going to
           want to see me again. And if you tell
           her we had this little pow-wow...
           she's not going to let that happen.
          As Jacob considers that... the train slows to a stop.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Look, you seem like a smart kid.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           ... but do it quick.
          And with that, Gordon moves for the doors.
          But Jacob steps in front of him.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           I'm going to bring them down. Whoever
           floated the rumor for a quick buck.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           It's not worth it. It's a waste of
           energy and time. See, Jacob, nobody
           gets it... they never did.
          As the subway doors open...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           If there's one thing I learned in
           prison it's that money is not the

           is.

</b>           And your nine minutes are up.
          And Gordon Gekko gets off the subway... leaving Jacob on the
          train. But right before the doors close, Gordon stops and
          turns with...

<b>           28.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           There are worse ways to go than

           something for your diabetes...
          As the doors close...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           .. and end up having it cause you to
           die of acute pancreatitis?
          And as the subway pulls out of the station, Jacob Moore just
          stands there... holding the pole and wondering what the hell
          that was supposed to mean.

          She's in her late-twenties with a natural beauty that might
          take two glances to notice. But after that second glance...

          Jacob agrees. And she softly kisses him and squeezes him
          tight... tears in her eyes.

<b>                          WINNIE

          A huge chandelier hangs over the all marble room. A
          fireplace on one wall and a twelve foot wall of glass
          featuring that park view on the other.
          And Jacob realizes that sonata is live. He's walked into a
          recital of some sort.
          About twenty people sit watching a YOUNG GIRL play on a very
          unique looking silver grand piano.
          The girl can't be a day over thirteen. She's playing
          Mozart's "Ronda Alla Turca"... her fingers gliding across the
          keyboard in precision, her eyes closed in inspiration. It's
          as spectacular as it is moving.
          Jacob takes it in for a moment then looks over the room. All
          ethnicities and types...
          The AFRICAN LEADER in full tribal gear, the DISHEVELED ARTIST
          with his GAY NOVELIST LOVER, the NEW YORK KNICK with his
          MODEL WIFE, the MOVIE STAR with her TEENAGE SON.
          And BRETTON WOODS...
          Mid 40s, slicing jawline, deep set eyes, in great shape,
          refined, composed and masculine.
          He's the owner of this penthouse and he's looking right at
          Jacob. Jacob looks away.
          And the young girl finishes the last movement of the sonata
          to applause.
          The guests all stand, some go talk with the girl. Bretton
          heads over to Jacob.

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS

          Jacob nods. Bretton just looks at him... making him nervous.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Your daughter's an amazing piano
           player. That was quite a show.

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS
</b>           That wasn't my daughter. That was
           Isabel Patrovsky, she's the world's
           greatest living piano prodigy.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           And that wasn't a show... that was a
           very expensive private recital.
          There's a long beat of silence with Jacob just looking at
          Bretton... taking him in.
          And it's unmistakable -- the one thing that this man exudes
          above all else... is composure.

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
</b>           You cost my fund three hundred and
           forty million dollars today.
          Off of Jacob's slight smile...

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
</b>           Yeah, kills my year, pushes my

</b>           You don't want to deny it?

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS
</b>           Then why did you do it?

<b>                          JACOB

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS
</b>           Your firm destroyed itself.

          And Bretton sighs...

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
</b>           The rumors were true.

<b>                          JACOB

</b>           No, Jacob, being levered thirty-eight

           playing recently.
          And Jacob holds Bretton's look for a moment, then... heads
          for the door without saying a thing...

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
</b>           Come work for me.

          As he stands...

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
</b>           And as for Andrew Zabel... there

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           No, that's not okay. Because it means

           service chain will be extended. The

          Gordon enjoys a turkey burger from the deli while Jacob doesn't
          eat.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Yeah... I used to not eat lunch too.
          Jacob nods and slides something across the table. The
          picture of Winnie in workout gear, flipping the finger.
          Gordon looks at it and laughs.

          Off Gordon's look...

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           I crushed him.

</b>           Did you?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           His fund is bleeding. I wouldn't be

           the job.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Well, Chief... you seem awfully proud

<b>                          JACOB

          And never to look up from his lunch...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Naw. I prefer to write about the
           action now than be apart of it.

<b>                          JACOB

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           You're out of a job and most likely
           going to marry my daughter... I

</b>           That would've been insider trading,

          Gordon just shakes his head.

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           And not "most likely."

           your new fiance about our little

          Jacob doesn't say anything. And Gordon doesn't press.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           So, I'm guessing she's not going to

           (sucking in a deep breath)
           And since Rudy... you know... well,
           I've worried about the name. It's
           something you don't really think about

          The doors begin to close but someone gets on at the last
          moment.
          He's a hedge fund type, real SLICK, reminds us of Gekko

          No doubt about it, this is a nice place. Worth three million
          dollars, maybe four at the beginning of the year.
          Sparsely decorated. Large framed photographs line the walls.
          Gordon shows Jacob pictures of Winnie's childhood.

          Smitten, Jacob looks at some more of the pictures then
          stands... taking in the large framed pictures on the wall.
          As Jacob checks out a framed chart for "Gouda Tulip Bulbs Dec
          1 1634 to Feb 5 1637." The chart goes straight up and to the

          As Jacob moves over to an another piece.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Fuck no.
          Jacob now finds himself looking at a political cartoon from
          the early 1900s.
          It's of two men rowing a boat in a lake of dollars. One of
          the men is Uncle Sam dressed in US flag colors. But Sam's
          very small in this cartoon... can't really row the boat.
          The other man is much bigger and clearly doing the heavy
          rowing. He is...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           JP Morgan... he single-handedly
           stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping
           in and buying up shares in all the

           Everyone else quickly followed like
           lemmings.

           See -- people had stopped looking to
           their government or trusted advisors.
           They looked to JP Morgan. It was all
           about simple psychology -- every crash
           should have a JP Morgan to step in and
           save it.

</b>           See Jacob... the best opportunities
           are found where angels fear to tread.
          And they arrive at the next piece on the wall... a small
          framed bond.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           That's a bond issued by the Central
           American country of Poyais. Gregor
           McGregor made a fortune dealing these

<b>                          JACOB

           bring him down from the inside?
          Gordon confirms that with a simple shake of the head and...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           I don't know, Jake... what you kids
           think is pay-back these days is really

           over then put on his... which, of

<b>                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
</b>           Then one year the city passed an
           ordinance that their firework show had
           to be the last of the night... they

           (then... almost to herself)
           The show was even more amazing over

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
</b>           Here it is... one of the most
           beautiful pieces of music you'll ever
           hear.
          Bretton places the record on the phonograph and The Rolling
          Stones "Let It Loose" rings out...

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
</b>           "Exile On Main Street," without a
           doubt The Stones greatest album.
          Jacob laughs. He was expecting Beethoven.

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
</b>           It was all outtakes. Throwaway
           tracks. And the critics hated it.
           And it didn't sell well at first.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           But now it's universally known as
           their best release. I asked Mick once
           how he thought that happened. How
           something could go from so worthless
           to so valuable. He just looked at me
           and said... "it never went from
           worthless to valuable... just the
           opinions of it did."
          Taking a seat...

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
</b>           And that was the greatest lesson I

          $450,000 (once you get to the top of the waiting list.)
          Jacob and Bretton ride into the city. Bretton takes a call
          on his Vertu.

          front of the mirror.
          As Jacob throws on a top hat and admires the 1928 version of

</b>
          A Roaring 20's party is taking place... it's full-on
          speakeasy vibe. It's right out of 1928, only with Europeans,
          Russians and Middle-Easterners.
          Smoke fills the room. A jazz band roars. Drinks flow.
          As Jacob and Bretton head in...

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
</b>           If he offers you a line of coke --

          He's in his mid-40s, overweight, sweaty, draped in tight
          black Prada and smoking a cigarette.

          And it seems A MODEL BOMB has recently exploded at Oleg's
          table... leaving the skinny shards everywhere.
          Oleg sees them, stands and opens his arms.

          Oleg regards Jacob for a beat, then back to Bretton and asks
          again...

<b>                          OLEG (CONT'D)
</b>           It was that mortgage shit. He

          Oleg motions to a WAITRESS who immediately pours vintage
          champagne.

<b>                          OLEG (CONT'D)
</b>           In honor of the theme tonight, have a

          Oleg hands Jacob a flute before he can decline.

<b>                          OLEG (CONT'D)
</b>           This is one of two hundred bottles
           discovered on a shipwreck off the
           coast of Finland... thirty grand a
           bottle.
          And Oleg aggressively puts his arm around Jacob, bringing him
          into a drunken half-bear hug and spilling most of the
          champagne out of Jacob's flute.

<b>          EXT. DUBAI HARBOR - NIGHT
</b>
          Oleg and some of his crew lead Jacob, Bretton and three
          beautiful, giggling model girls down a trail to a secluded
          mooring.
          Fishing boats bob violently in the water -- and next to them
          is Oleg's Phoenix 1000, his personal, 65-meter SUBMARINE.
          As a boatman helps them all climb aboard:

          out at the city of Dubai.

          And then the view starts to MOVE. The surface of the water
          RISES before them, Dubai recedes and the submarine descends
          spectacularly into the depths.

          Lights illuminate the dark waters as curious fish flit past.
          Jacob, Bretton and Oleg are on divans, the girls undulating
          around them.

<b>                          OLEG
</b>           Bretton, I have... what?... two

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS
</b>           And hopefully that's just a start.
           Oleg, there are so many opportunities
           out there right now I feel like a kid
           in the candy store.
          Oleg waves him off.

<b>                          OLEG
</b>           You know I like to spread it around...
           I'm like my own fund of funds. I
           don't like to have too much with one
           manager.

</b>           You never really know who to trust in

          Jacob takes a beat, swallows nervously, then...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           I couldn't agree more, Oleg. It's one
           of the first things that Andrew Zabel
           taught me. I worked very closely with
           him. It's why Bretton hired me. To
           get behind the Andrew Zabel curtain.
          Bretton flashes Jacob a look... "What the hell are you
          doing?" Jacob swallows back some nerves then continues...

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           You said before that you always wanted
           to invest with Zabel but couldn't
           because he only handled institutional
           money. Well here's your chance.
           Zabel taught me everything he knew.
          Oleg looks up to Jacob from the line of coke with interest.

          He looks over to Bretton who still glares at Jacob...

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)

          And Oleg regards Jacob for a long moment, a jury determining
          the verdict... Jacob holding on to that sly smile... Bretton
          looking away... playing it cool.

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           It's complicated but like Bretton said
           -- right now there are more

          Oleg simply nods... with a simple...

<b>          INT. JACOB'S SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
          Jacob sleeps. There's a knock on his door. He stirs. The
          knock's louder. Then... Jacob finally wakes, moves to the
          door and opens it to see...
          TWO BEAUTIFUL RUSSIAN WOMEN, PAULINA and NADIA

<b>                          NADIA
</b>           We're here for the party.

          We pan across the suite... past the roaring fire...

<b>           PAULINA (O.S.)
</b>           Right there... ?
          ... past the empty bottle of champagne...

<b>           JACOB (O.S.)
</b>           No... not there...

<b>           NADIA (O.S.)
</b>           How about there? I bet you want me to
           do it there.
          ... past the plate of half-eaten chocolate strawberries...

<b>           JACOB (O.S.)
</b>           No... I want you to hold it.
          And find the three of them...

<b>           NADIA (O.S.)
</b>           But it's gone up so much.
          ... sitting at Jacob's computer... looking over a chart for a
          Russian oil company.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           I know... but if you're going to
           correctly utilize this technical head
           and shoulders strategy, you need to
           hold the stock until...

           ... right here.

<b>                          PAULINA
</b>           I always sell too soon.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Very common mistake. You need to cut
           your losers short and let your winners
           run.
          She looks to her friend with a smile...

<b>                          NADIA
</b>           Good advice for everything... no?
          Her friend agrees with a laugh. And Jacob checks the clock.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Okay. I think enough time has passed.

<b>                          NADIA
</b>           You must love her very much.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           I do.
          Jacob opens the door to let them go but he hears a door open
          across the hall... Bretton's.
          And they all witness a YOUNGER AMERICAN WOMAN leave Bretton's
          room then head down the hall right by them.
          Jacob's stunned.

<b>                          PAULINA
</b>           The most famous hooker in the world.
          Off Jacob's confusion...

<b>          THE YOUNGER AMERICAN WOMAN
</b>          that had just left Bretton's room looks right at us under the
          caption "The Governor's $5000 Mistake"
          Pull back to be on Perezhilton.com
          Jacob Moore sits in front of his computer. And he turns to
          Paulina.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Is she a gift from Oleg?

<b>                          PAULINA
</b>           No. She's Bretton's go-to.

<b>                          NADIA
</b>           He flies her in wherever he's at.
          And Jacob slowly takes that in... absolutely floored.

<b>          INT. BURJ AL ARAB/LOBBY - MORNING

          Wearing sunglasses, Jacob greets Bretton at the elevators.

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS

           stocks new to volatility for real?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           No Bretton. That was all bullshit.

<b>          AND SLAM INTO ESSEX CAPITAL ADVISERS/CONFERENCE ROOM
</b>          A stuffy conference room half-filled with bored MEN in their
          40s watching a presentation...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           Or the baby cub funds like Sammy

</b>           Here's the thing about Bretton. He

          Holding his suitcase, Jacob emerges from the elevator and

          Jacob sees Diego...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Bring it.
          Diego smiles... loves this new one...

          Winnie and Jacob jog the park through the humid July haze.
          It's very early.
          And Jacob stops jogging. Catches his breath. She keeps
          running.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Why are you with me?
          She stops and turns back to him.

          Winnie nods. It's a valid question. And she thinks about it
          for a moment, then...

</b>           It's Freud.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           And what does it mean, psych major?

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           Well, it's when people repeat the same
           dysfunctional relationships from
           childhood in their adult life in hopes
           of trying to master them.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Like when children of alcoholics fall
           in love with alcoholics.

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           Yeah.
          He turns away... upset.

</b>           That's great, Winnie.

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           Jacob, that might be why I was
           initially attracted to you... but it's
           not why I love you.
          She moves to him.

<b>                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
</b>           I love you because you're

</b>           And you're the smartest person I've

          air. And trails. Many trails that go on for miles.
          As the two Becker jetvans arrive at a restricted area, a
          STATE RANGER opens the gate and allows them to drive through
          then park.
          Jacob and Bretton emerge from the jetvan.

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS
</b>           This is how we do.
          And with a nod, the DRIVER of the other jetvan opens it to
          reveal two motorcycles inside. Bretton's MTT Turbine
          Superbike and an Agusta, these bikes are handcrafted works of
          art as much as they are demons of speed.
          Jacob laughs in disbelief and excitement.

<b>          AND THEY RIDE
</b>          Winding through the trees... along the side of a river...
          Bretton riding extremely fast with Jacob trying to keep up.
          Bretton reaches a clearing and waits for Jacob to catch up.
          Once he does...

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)
</b>           You're going to have to keep up.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Okay. I'm just getting used to it.

<b>           78.

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS
</b>           No. After KZI, I took profits.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           I think it's time to go the other way.

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS
</b>           Banks?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Insurance companies. I'm talking the
           old school insurers that have become
           the babies thrown out with the bath
           water.
          Jacob waits for a reaction from Bretton. But all he gets
          is...

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS
</b>           Keep up!
          And with that, Bretton rips into the clearing. Jacob rides
          just as fast. They're neck and neck... it's definitely a
          race.
          Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesn't give up.
          As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only
          narrow trail entering it, Jacob focuses on the horizon and
          revs the bike into more speed. He pulls up next to Bretton
          as they approach the trail.
          If Jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind Bretton,
          he's going to hit the trees. But he doesn't.
          Instead, Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed,
          narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail... pulling
          ahead of Bretton and taking the lead.

</b>           Winnie... Winnie...
          He turns her around.

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           You don't understand.
          Her tears being washed away by the rain.

<b>                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
</b>           My mother couldn't handle Rudy. He
           was so out of control. I couldn't

</b>           He's not the person people think he
           is.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           It was a long time ago.
          She pulls out of his embrace...

</b>           He'll hurt us. Can't we just go home?
           Please... Jacob. It's raining.
          And he just looks at her for a long moment... soaking wet and
          shivering... crying and exposed.

<b>                          JACOB

</b>
          Jacob sits across from Gordon at this well-known breakfast

</b>           Tripling the size... that's a very

          Jacob nods.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           And I promise you he's using leverage

</b>           He's chasing.

</b>           Mr Gekko, I'm Tom Sanders. I write

          Letting out a little laugh...

<b>                          TOM
</b>           I'm sure you have.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Well, I'm doing a piece of Wall Street

           Both those assholes got the cover when

</b>           Welcome to the 2008 Financial Follies!

<b>                          (APPLAUDS)
</b>           I'm Bill Maher and I'm getting paid in

          Jacob shares a table with Bretton, Bretton's wife and a few
          other FINANCIAL PLAYERS. Winnie is not here.

<b>           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
</b>           When The Financial Writers Association
           asked me to host an event for the
           world of finance, I was shocked. I'm
           known in Washington not Wall Street...

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           ... but then they informed me that
           Washington is actually in the process
           of buying Wall Street, so it all makes
           sense.
          Laughter...

<b>           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
</b>           I asked them if anything's off limits.
           And they said to stay away from the
           brokerages, banks and insurers...
           (pause for effect, then...)
           ... where the fuck was that advice
           five months ago?
          More laughter.

<b>           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
</b>           I see Sammy Rosen's here.
          The spotlight finds SAMMY ROSEN, billionaire hedge funder.

<b>           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
</b>           Sammy, how are you?
          From his table...

<b>                          SAMMY ROSEN

           Of course he is... in the amount of
           time it took for us to have that
           exchange, he made three hundred and
           nine thousand dollars.
           (back to Sammy)
           Sammy, let me give you some free
           advice, the next time someone with bad
           eyesight wants to sell you a hundred
           and fifty million dollar painting...

</b>           Somebody told me Gordon Gekko is here.

</b>           There you are. I have some inside
           information for you, Gekko... sex

          Gordon smiles and raises his glass up to Bill.

<b>           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)
</b>           Talk about your sour grapes.
           Seriously Gordon -- just because the
           SEC doesn't let you make obscene
           amounts of money by being wrong and
           nefarious doesn't mean you have to
           ruin it for all of these hard working

          The room applauds...

<b>           BILL MAHER (CONT'D)

           account of the current mortgage
           crises. Let `er rip!
          And the room goes dark... and on the screen plays a childlike
          roughly illustrated stick-figure skit being narrated by
          children.

<b>                          BANKER MAN
</b>           Totally cool. Since housing prices

</b>           Good news, Smart Man, not only did
           foreigners buy those traunches, but so
           did school boards and charities and
           big pensions.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Why did they buy them you ask? Well,

<b>                          JACOB

</b>           It's not out yet.

          Bretton leans back... taking in this sparring match.

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           Really Gordon? Do you really need
           attention that badly?

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Since I have forty-four seconds to
           spare, I'm going to tell you a story.
           It's about a guy named Sam.
          And we go close on Gekko...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Sam used to work a job, he made things
           and he grew things and he sold those
           things. Until one day Sam got a
           credit card and was amazed how easy it
           was to buy things with it. So Sam got
           another card and then another. Then
           he used the credit card money to make
           it look like he had an income... and
           he used that "income" to secure a
           loan.

<b>                          (MORE)
</b>
<b>           92.
</b>
                         

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           And with that loan Sam bought a fancy
           BMW car and rented a fancy penthouse
           apartment.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Now, the credit cards hit their limit
           and the bank needed him to service
           that loan, so Sam went to his friends.
           His Chinese friend... and his Japanese
           friend... and his British friend and
           so on. And his friends loaned Sam
           money.

<b>                          (ANOTHER BEAT)
</b>           And that brings us to today... where
           Sam owes the credit cards and Sam owes
           the banks and Sam owes his friends and
           eventually they're going to take away
           Sam's fancy BMW car and his fancy
           penthouse apartment.
          And Jacob can now see... in Gordon Gekko's eyes... he truly
          believes every word he's saying.

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           And Sam doesn't make anything anymore
           and Sam doesn't grow anything anymore
           so Sam doesn't sell anything anymore.
          As he stands...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Our favorite Uncle Sam's desperate,

</b>           We're getting fucking killed.

<b>                          BRETTON WOODS

          Jacob takes his chair and reaches for the phone.

          She leans up.

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           He didn't want to keep my mother awake
           so he'd go into the kitchen and sit
           there. I could hear him because my
           room was right up the back stairs.
           I'd go and sit with him sometimes.
           We'd eat ice cream.
          Jacob gets out of bed and throws on his robe.

<b>                          WINNIE (CONT'D)
</b>           I was only eight but I could tell he
           was worried about something and that
           made me worried.
           (softly, almost to herself)
           Then the market would go back up and
           he would sleep through the night
           again.

          And she stops, staring at that picture.
          Her and her father on that white horse... taken years ago.

          Suddenly...

</b>           We're done.
          And Bretton CHUCKS the drink against the wall and the glass
          shatters. Jacob takes a step back.
          Bretton's in a complete state as he walks over to Jacob's
          desk and SWIPES it clean... papers flying about.

<b>           BRETTON WOODS (CONT'D)

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Because nobody gave a shit about me

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           On November 15th, 1903 an Italian man
           arrived aboard the S.S. Vancouver in
           Boston. He had two dollars and fifty
           cents to his name. Yet just a few
           years later he was millionaire. You
           wanna know how? He had invented a
           scheme... it was quite simple
           actually.
          And Jacob now steps forward... piecing it together...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           No...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           He would get people to invest with him
           by offering larger than normal returns
           then pay the old investors with the
           new investors money. As long as there
           was fresh money, he could keep going.
           Do you know what his name was, Jacob?
           It was Charles...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Wow, Bretton -- you really kicked some
           ass for client forty one.
          Finally Jacob turns to the back of the ledger, to the client
          key, where he moves the pencil down to client #41 and it
          says... Gordon Gekko.

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           Bud Fox wasn't the only one.

<b>          INT. IMPRESSIVE TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

          Jacob waits in the large entry hall... holding a cheap
          umbrella he bought at Heathrow.
          And down from the stairs walks...

<b>                          OLEG
</b>           It's been a bitch of a month, my
           friend... tell me this visit does not
           bring bad news.

<b>          INT. OLEG'S LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b>
          Oleg sips his vodka and looks at Jacob.

<b>                          OLEG
</b>           You want me to audit The Locust Fund?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           That's right. I want you to tell
           Bretton you need the official records
           of all the fund's activity starting
           with when you gave him the original
           two hundred million. You need this
           because The Russian Federal Tax
           Service is up your ass and you have to
           play ball with them.

<b>                          OLEG
</b>           And if he declines... ?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           You'll have no choice but to pull your
           money.

          Oleg lights a cigarette... exhaling the smoke with...

<b>                          OLEG
</b>           And why would I do that?
          And Jacob leans forward...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Because if you do this for me, Oleg,
           I'll teach you the Andrew Zabel magic.
           I'll explain to you, in detail, all of
           his techniques... I'll give you all
           his secrets... it's less complicated
           than you might think.

          Darkness, until... a phone rings. Jacob wakes up and takes
          it.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Hello... Okay, thank you.
          He moves to the curtains then opens them.
          And the daylight spills in.

<b>          INT. OLEG'S LIBRARY - DAY

          Oleg slides four encyclopedia-sized bounded stacks of
          printouts across his desk.

</b>           All the Locust Fund's trades for the

          Jacob nods, placing them into his bag.
          And Oleg lights a cigarette... looks right at us...
          excited... leaning forward with...

<b>                          OLEG (CONT'D)

<b>          INT. 767 - DAY

          As Jacob flies back to New York. He flips through the Locust
          Fund trading ledgers, shaking his head in disbelief.

<b>          INT. WINNIE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Winnie answers the door to find...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           They were working together. Your

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           Jacob, what are you doing here?
          Following her in...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Gordon wanted the trust the whole
           time. And when I came to him seeking
           revenge... he saw his window.
          Upset, she looks for her keys.

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           I have to go to work.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Bretton owed him a favor because he
           fed your father information twenty
           three years ago when he was a young
           broker in London and your father never
           ratted him out.
          She just looks at him... shaking her head... and not in
          disapproval... but in pity. But he keeps going.

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           And he never put the money into
           Bretton's fund. Turns out your trust
           had built up a controlling position in
           Hudson River Bank.

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           That's the bank he worked at when I
           was born.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Well, now he owns it. Or shall I say
           pilfered it before he went AWOL.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           And that money wasn't even the
           bank's... it was taxpayers'... bailout
           money.
          As this washes over a stunned Winnie Gekko...

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           Jesus...
          And Jacob confirms...

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           He saw this coming years ago... from
           his cell. I'm guessing he made off
           with billions.
          And he throws something on the table.

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           And now look?

<b>           118.

          It's a copy of Portfolio Magazine with a picture of Gordon on

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)

           and being hailed as a genius.
           Everyone's buying his book and waiting
           to see his next move.
          Desperately trying to get her mind around this...

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           But what about the SEC, the regulatory
           agencies-- ?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           The government is flying this 700
           billion dollar airplane by the seat of
           it's pants. They don't know where
           half of the fucking money is going.
           And even if they did, do you think
           they want this out there?
          As this all washes over her...

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           This is his revenge.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Yup... sure beats the hell out of
           insider trading, doesn't it?
          And Winnie finds her keys and heads for the door...

<b>                          WINNIE
</b>           I can't hear anymore of this.
          ... but Jacob steps in front of her.

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           I'm done. I sold everything. The
           ring. Everything. I gave back the
           KZI bonus. I'm out and I'm broke and
           I deserve it.
          And she just looks at him...

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           But Winnie, the one thing I can't
           accept -- is losing you.
          And before she reacts...

<b>          THE CABIN OF A BOEING 777

          under the caption "What's His Next Move?"

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           You finally got the cover.
          Gordon nods.

<b>                          JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>           Everybody thinks you got rich of
           betting against the system. If they
           only knew...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           The powers that be will never let that

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           How much is enough, Gordon?
          Gordon laughs with a shake of the head.

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           I've been asked that before...

<b>                          (AND THEN)

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)

</b>           I'll always have America... it's why

<b>                          JACOB

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Same answer.

<b>                          JACOB

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           That sounds good. I bet you can even

           revenge or the compulsion to chase...
           it all amounts to the same thing...
           loss of control. And it's always

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           You can offer that?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Your daughter can. She works with the
           new Secretary of Treasury now.
          Considering that...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           What else?

<b>                          JACOB
</b>           Winnie. Me. Your grandson.
           Something money can't buy... a family.
          And Gordon looks at him for the longest moments, allowing it
          all to register, then...

<b>                          GORDON GEKKO
</b>           Sorry son -- that's simply a trade I
           cannot make.
          And as Gordon Gekko walks off... leaving Jacob Moore
          behind...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           You wanna know what the mother of all
           bubbles was? Us. The human race.
           Scientists call it the Cambrian
           Explosion, from the Cambrian fauna.

<b>          AND RONALD REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT
</b>          As Jacob heads into the baggage claim area to see Winnie
          waiting for him...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           It happened 530 million years ago...
           when all of the sudden, there was the
           seemingly rapid appearance of most
           major groups of complex animals.
          And as they embrace...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           And from it was born humanity.

<b>          AND GORDON GEKKO
</b>          Being led through a massive empty space... office space...

<b>           124.
</b>
                         

                         

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           It was an explosion of life.
           Scientists will tell you it was
           unprecedented, excessive and by the
           standards of evolution-time...
           happened in a flash.
          The City of London outside the large windows...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
</b>           Suddenly the world had millions of new
           species... just like that.
          This will be the home of his new international empire.

<b>          AND BRETTON WOODS
</b>          At his desk in his 15 CPW penthouse...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           See -- bubbles are the purest form of
           Darwinism.
          ... looking over pages and pages of destruction... Andrew
          Zabel's legacy that he now has to pay for...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           They teach us what we didn't know and
           they remind us of what we forgot...
          And Bretton completely loses it... just starts ripping out
          the pages then tearing them in two...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           They kill excess and they lean out the
           herd.
          ... methodically... page by page... over and over again...

<b>          AND GORDON GEKKO
</b>          Sitting in his massive London office.
          It's empty. It's night. He's completely alone.
          He looks up at the wall... at the framed picture of JP Morgan
          and Uncle Sam rowing that boat.
          Then he looks down at an old picture of Winnie... she's
          probably three or four years old... and lovingly holding her
          baby brother, Rudy.

          And Gordon holds on this picture for a long moment, before
          finally...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           They actually bring us back to the
           necessary simple...

<b>           125.
</b>
                         

                         
          ... picking up the phone.

<b>          AND GORDON GEKKO
</b>          Now in the back of a Town Car... we don't know where...

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           Because Jacob...
          As the door opens, daylight spills in and we see the charging
          bull of Bowling Green Park across the way...
          Gordon is escorted out of the car and led to the doors of the
          New York stock exchange.
          And Gordon stops at the famed doors, takes a moment to regard
          the exchange, sucks in a deep breath, readies for his hero's
          welcome and finally... opens the doors then disappears
          inside.

<b>          AND WINNIE AND JACOB
</b>          Greet the morning in their small Washington DC apartment.
          Winnie pouring coffee, Jacob turning on the TV.
          And on the screen is a picture of Gordon Gekko walking the
          floor of the New York stock exchange under the graphic...
          "Gekko Now Betting On A Recovery."

<b>           GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           ... you'd be amazed what can rise from
           the ashes.

          Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come" kicks in.
          And we go close on the Fox Business Channel's coverage of the
          market's huge rally of an opening... with Gordon Gekko
          ringing the bell... until the channel suddenly changes... to
          the cartoon network... while we...

<b>           FADE OUT.
