</b>

<b>      1     INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY                                1
</b>
            A tense surgery in progress.  Meters flicker, instruments
            flash in the bright overhead light.  In the midst of it all
            stands DR. DAVID RAVELL, 35.  The master of his domain.
            Ravell leans forward so a NURSE can mop the sweat from his
            brow as he completes a last, delicate procedure.  His co
            workers sigh collectively with relief.

<b>                                DAVID
</b>                          (to Asst. Surgeon)
                      Close her up, will you?

</b>
            Dr. Ravell comes out of surgery, clearly exhausted.  Without
            his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome.  TWO NURSES
            follow, attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring:
            CHLOE, 25, Raven-haired and striking, and JASMINE, 24, an
            exotic mix of African-American and Asian.

            BLAKE DANIELS, 58, the silver-haired Chief Surgeon, rushes up
            the corridor.  On his heels is DR. LONNIE WALSH, 33. Lonnie
            is also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to
            David.  In everything.
            The look on Blake's face stops David in his tracks.

<b>                                BLAKE
</b>                      There's been a train crash near Santa
                      Barbara. They're flying an aortal trauma
                      here now.  How can I ask you this,
                      David...

            David rubs his eyes.  Thinks about it.

<b>                                DAVID
</b>                      I can do it, Blake.

            His bravery isn't lost on the two nurses, although Chloe
            exchanges a quick, covert glance with Lonnie.

<b>                                CHLOE
</b>                      Is he crazy, Jasmine?   He's been on his
                      feet for fourteen hours.

<b>                                JASMINE
</b>                      Chloe, it's been this way since Leslie
                      died.  Losing himself in his work, poor
                      thing...

</b>
            Quaint, Midwestern eatery.  Knick-knacks and photos abound.
            The booths and counter are packed with LOCALS.  A family
            dining section off in one corner.

            TWO GUYS sitting at the counter in team jackets.  The older
            of the two holds up his empty coffee cup.  But his WAITRESS,
            standing a couple seats down from him, doesn't move. She's
            completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on
            two battered, fuzzy TV sets.
            BETTY SIZEMORE, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that
            competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white
            waitress uniform. TWO OTHER WAITRESSES attend to customers
            behind her.
            The younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera.
            But the older one, still wants coffee.  He gestures toward
            Betty.

<b>                                OLDER MAN
</b>                      Miss?

            Betty leans forward, grabs the coffee pot and moves in front
            of him.  Without taking her eyes from the TV, she pours the
            java, which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop.

<b>                                OLDER MAN
</b>                                (cont'd)
                      Very impressive.  That is very...
                          (turning to others)
                      Did anybody see that?

            The LOCAL GUYS around him don't even bother to look up. Of
            course, they've seen it before.  Betty smiles.

<b>                                                                    3.

</b>                                (cont'd)
                      Thank you.  Could I bother you for a
                      little more...?

            Before he can even finish, Betty is topping him off with
            milk.

<b>                                BETTY
</b>                      Skim, right?
                          (tears open an Equal)
                      And half a pack, if I remember correct...

            The older gentleman's mouth works a bit but nothing comes
            out.  He is flabbergasted by her attention to detail.  She
            looks at the younger man, who is still following the show and
            gobbling down a huge bacon burger.

                                BETTY (cont'd)
                      You know, you're never too young to start
                      on a lean meat substitute...
<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>                      You wanna try some turkey bacon on that?

</b>                      It's your body...

            Betty turns back to change pots.  The older man watches her
            intently as the younger of the two mumbles to himself.

<b>                                YOUNGER MAN
</b>                          (to himself)
                      That's right, so why don't you get up off
                      it...

                      I've told him the same thing.  Thanks for
                      the suggestion.

<b>                                BETTY
</b>                      No problem.

            Betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off, one eye
            always on the TV as she approaches two local types.

            SHERIFF ELDEN BALLARD, 32, a short, tightly wound little man,
            sitting at his own booth.  Ballard is spit and polish all the
            way:  creases in his shirt, a glossy shine on his shoes.
            Badge proudly displayed.  He sits with

</b>

            ROY OSTREY, 31, a gangly, bookish local reporter.  Betty
            drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the
            table for him.  Another smile.

</b>                      Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar,
                      but sweet.  I liked your editorial this
                      morning...

                      Yeah, it was great.  Really put the whole
                      idea of "church bake sales" in

                          (chuckles to himself)
                      I'll take a refill there, Betty...

            His cup is full before he can even finish the sentence.

<b>                                BETTY

<b>                                BALLARD

<b>                                BETTY

<b>                                BALLARD

<b>                                BALLARD

                      another man's omelette...
                          (to Betty)
                      It's no big deal, Betty.

<b>                                BETTY

                      prob'... gotta keep you on track.

            Betty grabs Ballard's plate without another word, gives him a
            reassuring rub on the shoulders and moves off.  He smiles
            appreciatively after her, then turns on Roy.

<b>                                BALLARD
</b>                      Why you always gotta embarrass me?  I
                      been eating lunch with you since grade
                      school and you always gotta embarrass me!

<b>                                BALLARD

                      that shit so you could look at her a
                      little longer, anyway...

            Still carrying Ballard's plate, she returns to the counter.

<b>                                BETTY

                      zone if he's in it...

            Betty and the cooks share a quick laugh.  They move to change
            his order while Betty glances up at the TV.

            Blake exits.  The camera moves in to hold on a CLOSEUP of
            Lonnie's face as he simmers in anger.  Music soars.

            Plates of food are piling up on the shelf in front of the
            COOKS.  One of them turns the TV off by remote.

            Frustrated, Betty delivers several plates and drops them at
            tables where the people know her by name.  She moves off
            toward FOUR LOCAL GUYS in a booth jangling their empty cups.
            Betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills.  When a
            hand strays around to touch her ass, she pushes it away with
            her foot and keeps right on pouring. Absently, Betty takes a
            look around the restaurant.  The other waitresses are gone
            and no one is behind the grill.  Alarmed, she pushes through
            the double doors into the kitchen.

            Betty laughs and puts her arm around the cardboard man.  A

            Del's very busy.  He's on the rented sofa in the trailer's
            lounge, screwing his secretary, JOYCE.  But as he rocks the
            couch, he's listening to Betty's message.

                      tonight, so... I was wondering if I could
                      take one of the new Buicks.

            Del pulls out and lurches across the room.  He reaches for
            the desk phone but misses, spilling down onto the carpet.  He
            gathers himself and his pants up in disgust, pawing around
            the desktop until he finds the phone.

            The answering machine is on, so their VOICES are BOOMING. The
            phone cord is stretched across the trailer as he tries to get
            back to Joyce.  He motions for her to join him but she
            remains where she is, fuming.

            LONG PAUSE. Joyce looks at Del, incredulous. Then pissed off.
            He signals to hold on.

                      might be fun to go in a nice car...

            Joyce wriggles to a sitting position and begins to pull up
            her panties.  Del shoots her a look that says 'I'm not
            finished yet!'  They pantomime frantically back and forth
            until Joyce throws him the finger and SLAMS out the door.

                      see you when I get home.

            He throws the phone onto the cradle, then bangs on a window
            to get Joyce's attention as she fires up a smoke.

            As Del zips up his pants Joyce trudges across the lot to
            bring in the "Closed For Lunch" sign and open the gate.  Del
            silently studies the much nicer car lot next door for a
            moment.  He takes in the banners, the signs, etc.

            Betty enters the office.  Joyce is on the phone.  She looks
            up, irritated, and says something under her breath to the
            caller.

            Betty nods and swaps her car keys for a set Joyce gives her.

                      'S too bad about the LeSabres... they're

            As Joyce prattles on, Betty notices the Buick LeSabre keys on
            a rack behind her.  She sidles around Joyce, deftly removes a
            set from the hook and drops them in her purse.  She smiles
            and starts to wave goodbye as Joyce puts her call on hold.

            The cardboard doctor is standing next to Betty's Olds.  She
            thinks about leaving him, but picks him up and tosses him
            into a blue Corsica.  He lands with his face against the
            passenger window.

            She stands for a moment by the Corsica, dangling the LeSabre
            keys before her eyes.  Suddenly, she jumps inside the

            The blue Corsica leaves the parking lot and pulls onto the

            directly behind the car lot and glides to a halt behind a row
            of battered airstreams.

            Betty gets outs of the Chevy and looks back:  the handsome

            climbs over herself and walks straight to the LeSabres.  Her
            key opens the last one - maroon. She puts the doctor on the
            passenger seat, gets in the car and inhales the new car
            smell.

            Joyce can be seen inside the trailer, still talking on the
            phone.  She misses the whole scene as she works on her nails.

</b>
            Betty has the car at 75 m.p.h., on the rural Kansas roads,
            wheat fields for miles on both sides of her.  The RADIO is
            blasting Bonnie Raitt and she's singing along.

            She sees her speed and punches the accelerator ... 80 m.p.h.
            ... 85 ... 90 m.p.h.  She turns the radio up louder.

            When she approaches a sign saying "You are leaving Kansas"
            Betty suddenly becomes self-conscious.  She eases up on the
            gas ... slows down ... does a U-turn and heads back toward
            Fair Oaks.  She glances wistfully in her rear view mirror at
            the billboard that quickly fades into the distance.

            Betty enters a modest residential neighborhood and pulls into
            a driveway.  She parks in a detached garage and looks over at
            the cardboard David.  There's no way he's going in the house.
            She puts him in the trunk and closes the garage door.

            She walks several houses down.  On her way to the door we
            hear a DOG BARKING, CHILDREN and GENERAL COMMOTION from
            inside.  SUE ANN ROGERS answers Betty's knock.  Her hair is
            matted with sweat as she struggles with CHILDREN, ages 4, 3
            and 6 months.  Suddenly, Sue Ann is hit by an errant rubber
            ball.

<b>                                SUE ANN

                      little Gulf War going on here.

            Betty takes the baby as Sue Ann pulls a videotape from a
            shelf.  It's all one move; they do this every day.

            A low-end ranch.  A worn-out sofa and loveseat form an 'L'
            that dominates the living room.  Romance novels line a small
            bookcase.  SIX CANARIES in cages chatter away in the kitchen.

            Del sits at the dining room table, agitated.  He is presently
            attacking a pork chop, baked beans and a loaf of Wonderbread.
            All we hear is A FORK CLICKING and BIRDS CHIRPING.  Betty
            stands at the breakfast counter, barefoot, still in her
            uniform and quietly eating a salad.

            She drops the dishes with a clatter, pours herself a glass of

            the one card on the table.

            She puts her hand over his on the gear shift.  A moment.
            Finally, he has to move her fingers to start the car.

                      Let's not go... not yet.

            BETTY sits on an old couch in the den and watches, eyes glued
            to the screen.  Suddenly, she hears the sound of TIRES ON
            GRAVEL.  HEADLIGHTS sweep across the window.

            She hits PAUSE and crosses to look out.

            Del gets out of a black Lincoln Town Car, followed by CHARLIE
            and WESLEY - the guys in the team jackets from the diner.
            Charlie is 63 years old.  He wears a dress shirt, slacks and
            docksiders.  The suburban father look.

            Wesley is 28. He's in jeans, T-shirt and white Reeboks. Clean
            cut; the kid who used to mow your parents' lawn.

            Betty quickly snaps out the light and closes the door until
            it is open only a crack.

            Del stops and looks around, deflated by the mess.

            The den is only a short flight of steps from the living room
            and the kitchen.  Betty has a clean view of both from where
            she sits on the couch.

            screen.

            Del crosses to an old stereo and puts on an LP.  He smiles as
            the music overtakes the room.  Charlie and Wesley stand
            nearby, appreciating the quaintness of the surroundings.

<b>                                DEL

            leisurely in the living room.

            Del reaches into the fridge and produces a Miller for Wesley,
            then mixes two drinks and walks into the dining room and
            Charlie and Wesley follow to the table and sit down.

            They raise their glasses and drink.  Del tosses back his

            Chloe is on top of David, kissing him on the mouth as he
            resists.  He finally has to push her away forcibly, and we
            hear a TEARING SOUND.  Chloe's blouse has been ripped.

            She starts to cry.  David reaches out to comfort her.

            David looks up to find her lips on his.  In spite of himself,
            he gives in to the warmth of her kiss and responds hungrily.

            Betty is mesmerized.

            standing around a worn wooded table.  Charlie and Wesley are

            into his mouth and starts to cry.  Wesley produces a roll of
            duct tape and fastens Del's hands to the back of his chair.

                      Don't we?

            Del nods; crying, sweating.

                      Good.  Now we're getting somewhere.  You

            Del nods again.  Wesley collects Charlie's glass and mixes
            him another drink.  He gets a beer for himself and stands
            behind Del.  Charlie sips his drink slowly, savoring it.

                      You know, a hundred and fifty years ago

                      First you take a knife and just draw a
                      mark right across the hairline.

            Wesley produces a long knife and traces a line across the
            very top of Del's forehead.  Trickles of blood wind their way
            down his brow.  Del is MOANING and PANTING through his socks.

                      pull as you cut.  It's amazing how easily
                      the scalp comes off.

            Wesley takes a jab at Del's forehead with his knife, leaving
            a small cut.

            Del starts twitching, rocking back and forth as Wesley grabs
            a fistful of his hair.

            Del is facing her, tiny rivulets of blood running into his
            terrified eyes.  Wesley stands at his shoulder, still holding
            a handful of his hair, still poised with the knife.

            Annoyed, Charlie stuffs the socks back in Del's mouth.

            Betty stares.  Her gaze shifts from Del to Wesley, drawn by
            Wesley's demonic expression.

<b>                                CHARLIE

            Wesley stares at the top of Del's head.  Betty stares at
            Wesley.  Charlie walks into the kitchen for another drink.

                      I'll tell you, if anyone got a raw deal

                      done to them.

            And with a long SCREAM, Wesley rips Del's scalp from his
            head. It makes a sickening sound like fabric tearing.  For a
            long moment, there is only silence.  An eerie silence.

            Suddenly, Del SCREAMS into his socks and thrashes in his
            seat, blood pouring down his head on all sides.

            Somehow, he manages to get to his feet, the chair still taped
            to him, and begins smashing into whatever is near.  Blood
            flies and curios shatter as Del thunders through the room.  A
            dying bull, only messier.  It's quite a show.

            Wesley steps back, staring at the dripping scalp in his hand,
            as if wondering how it got there.  Betty is transfixed,
            horrified.

            Charlie re-enters.  The two men look at each other over Del's
            MUFFLED SCREAMS as he plows headlong into wooden paneling, a
            china cabinet, and finally, back toward them near the
            breakfast counter.  Del bashes blindly into it.

            Wesley is practically foaming at the mouth, still rushing on
            what he did.  Charlie draws a silenced pistol and mercifully
            SHOOTS Del through the head.  The big man stops suddenly,
            blinks once or twice, topples over.

            Betty points her remote at the dining room and clicks it, as
            if trying to make the image disappear.  Finally, she gives
            up, slowly turning away from the carnage and aims at the TV.
            "A Reason to Love" pauses on the face of David Ravell and

</b>                      She's in a kind of shock. I see all the
                      signs of a post-traumatic reaction with
                      possible dissociative symptoms.

<b>                                DOCTOR
</b>                      It's a type of altered state...it allows
                      a traumatized person to continue
                      functioning.

            behind him, leaning in to listen. Ballard doesn't see him.

            Ballard nods, sure he's got a clue here. He looks in at Betty
            again, just as she begins repacking her travel bag.  He

                      something extra in one of your cars, and
                      you decided to see what it was.  Then you
                      figured you'd take this valuable
                      commodity and go into business yourself,
                      even though it didn't belong to you.  But
                      you needed a crackerjack salesman to move
                      it, so you made the biggest mistake of
                      your short life and chose Del.  Sound
                      right so far?

            Duane nods.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Del's dead, by the way.  I sent him to
                      the Great Beyond.

                      killed him.

            Duane narrows his eyes in disbelief.

                      checked all the Buicks on that lot.  Four
                      '97 LeSabres and nothing in 'em.

            Charlie reaches up above the visor and pulls down a rumpled
            manifest.  He leafs through it.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)

            Duane nods emphatically.  Wesley pulls the Confederate flags
            out of his mouth.

            He spits in Wesley's face.  Charlie has to restrain Wesley.

                      That's why they get all the glory.

            Charlie climbs down from the big rig and heads across the
            parking lot. The Town Car is parked near the adjacent motel,
            just a few spaces away from Betty's LeSabre.

            With a furious calm Wesley wipes his face, then takes out a
            can of lighter fluid, sets it on the dash and looks at Duane.

<b>                                WESLEY

            Charlie pulls the Town Car alongside Duane's rig and drums
            the steering wheel impatiently.  It begins to rain.  There
            are flashes of LIGHTNING in the distance.

            A FLASH OF ORANGE FLAME ignites inside Duane's cab.  Charlie
            sighs.  Finally, THREE DULL THUDS reverberate from inside.
            Wesley climbs down clutching a videotape and gets in the car.

            Big ol' place.  Lots of wood and red leather.  Betty rushes
            in as the clock on the wall reads 2:58.  The Town Drunk,

            TV screen.  In front of him is a remote control.  A FEW
            OTHERS at tables.

</b>                      When I left here I went straight to
                      Italy.  Everybody told me not to go.  But
                      I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw
                      Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and

                      by these Tunisian guys who thought I was
                      a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter
                      than stink the whole time, and I got some
                      kind of weird gum disease from the water.
                      Plus, it ended my marriage--

                      than Merle... I just wear the ring to
                      keep the flies away.  Rome was the best
                      thing I ever did, because I DID IT!  And
                      I swear to you, it changed me.  I've been
                      to Rome, Italy!  I sat every morning at
                      the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino,
                      and watched the pilgrims walk to mass,
                      and no one can ever take that away from
                      me.

            Betty leans across the bar conspiratorially.  She looks at
            Merle to make sure he won't hear her.

            Ellen walks to the end of the bar and starts rinsing glasses.
            After a beat, Betty gets up and moves down close to her.

                      Europe, but I just know there's something

            Ellen looks into Betty's eyes - sees the innocence, the hope
            and enthusiasm - and has to look away. Betty takes it as her
            cue to leave. She smiles, puts two dollars on the bar near
            the phone and leaves.  Ellen stands perfectly still, watching
            the door.

            bouquet of roses.

            moment... Shattered when a black sedan appears, inching its
            way along. She freezes. David vanishes, and ...
            An ELDERLY MAN helps his wife out of the car and snaps her

            The remains of pie and coffee on the table, Charlie and
            Wesley kick back with JERROLD BLAINE and his wife ELIZABETH,
            both in their 80's.  Photos of Betty at various ages lie
            scattered in front of them.

            Charlie holds up a picture of a young Betty in ballerina

                      caring for her father, going to school.

            Charlie admires a photo of Betty, around 18 years old.  He
            continues to rummage through a box of collectibles, pocketing
            a small child's diary when it is convenient.

            On her way down the hall Betty passes a patient's room when
            the sound of A PERSON MOANING stops her.  She can't help but
            go inside.  A TV plays commercials.

            AN OLDER WOMAN lies in bed, alone and staring at the ceiling.
            Betty looks around and notices several arrangements of
            flowers on a deserted nightstand.  She brings them over to
            the older woman's bedside, positions them, then gently
            strokes her head.

            The woman's eyes flutter.  She is disoriented at first, then
            calms as she adjusts to the comforting sight of Betty.  Betty
            takes her hand.

            The woman smiles serenely at this and begins to drift off.
            Betty checks her monitors as the opening credits of "A Reason
            to Love" begin to play.

            She glances up at the doorway at the same moment and sees Dr.
            David Ravell standing at the entrance.  He checks the chart
            on the door, smiles warmly at Betty and then moves off.  In a
            flash, Betty is up and after him.

            The THEME MUSIC is her private soundtrack as she checks out
            every man in surgical scrubs, looking for David Ravell.
            Then... She sees him.  In all his glory at the end of a
            corridor walking away from her.  Betty gives chase.  She
            gains steadily on him, her heart racing.  As they near
            Emergency the NOISE LEVEL picks up.
            He stops at the nurses' station.  Betty closes the gap.  She
            starts to run.

            He turns to face her ... It's not David Ravell.

            FIVE AMBULANCES unload patients at the same time.  At that
            moment a group of TWENTY JAPANESE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS
            reaches the E.R. portion of their tour.

            A WHITE MERCEDES tears up the ramp and SCREECHES to a stop.
            A YOUNG MAN in gang colors is pushed out, bleeding heavily.
            A DOCTOR runs at the Mercedes to head it off, yelling
            indignantly.  The car plows right into him and takes off.
            Another ambulance crests the ramp, lights flashing.  The
            Mercedes SLAMS into it head-on.  NURSES AND DOCTORS run into
            the parking lot. A GANGBANGER gets out of the Mercedes, dazed
            and wobbly.  He pulls a pistol.  Everyone dives for cover.

            The Mercedes driver is unconscious. The driver of the smashed
            up ambulance is slumped over the wheel.  The rear doors fly

            On the gurney is a YOUNG MAN with a chest wound, nearly dead

            a quick attempt to arrange himself and motions to Wesley, who
            turns off the tape.

            Wesley's head.  Wesley looks at it and keeps on driving.

            Charlie knows this isn't the way to handle it.  He lowers the
            pistol.

                      canyon, I'm blowing my goddamn brains all
                      over this car.

            He puts the pistol in his mouth and cocks it.  Wesley looks
            over, not so sure this time.

            LONG SHOT of the black Town Car as the turn signal comes on,
            and it eases onto a lonely dirt road.  Their headlights pick
            out a sign that says: "Grand Canyon Fire Trail.  Forestry
            Personnel Only."

            Rosa and Betty approach the hotel entrance.  Ahead of them a
            black Lincoln Town Car pulls up. Headlights glint on the
            chrome, hitting Betty in the eye. She freezes, and Rosa bumps
            into her.

<b>                                ROSA
</b>                      Sorry.

            Betty stares at the car, unable to remember what it should
            mean.  Then a MAN in a tuxedo gets out.  Betty moves on.

            A sign on an easel reads "Save the Children."  Betty and Rosa
            present their tickets at the door to a ballroom.

            Several times there is a stir near the entrance and a
            scattering of flashbulbs.  Rosa scans the crowd.

<b>                                BETTY

            Rosa keeps looking.  Finally, GEORGE McCORD - the actor who
            plays DAVID RAVELL - enters.

            He comes in with LYLA BRANCH, late 40's, and TWO OTHER MEN.
            Several women approach George, some starry-eyed, for quick,
            polite greetings.  He's doing his job of being a soap star.

            Rosa waits for an opening, then puts her hands on Betty's
            shoulders and points her at George.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      Look who's here!

            Betty's jaw drops.  She freezes.

                                ROSA (cont'd)
                      What are you waiting for?   Talk to him!
                      You came fifteen hundred miles for this.

            Rosa prods her, then Betty makes her way unsteadily toward
            George.  When she's a few feet away he looks up.

            He can't help but notice her - she's beautiful.  She's also
            looking right into his eyes.  The conversation stops as he
            does a double take in Betty's direction.

            George's friends look at each other.  A few heads turn.

<b>                                GEORGE
</b>                      I beg your pardon?

                      We were thirteen days away from getting
                      married and ... I just got scared. It's a
                      mistake I've had to live with for six
                      years.  But it's behind me now...

                      And I hope you can put it behind you.
                      I've missed you... David.

            George sighs with relief.  His friends smile.  The tension
            evaporates.  They can handle a fanatical fan.

<b>                                GEORGE

                      night, and I didn't go anywhere.  I just
                      kept driving.  I stopped at a little
                      country church, and the pastor let me in,
                      and I sat--

                      I can't believe I remembered that,

                      But that was seven years ago, and you're

<b>                                BETTY
</b>                      Well, David moved out here and started
                      his residency.  Then he met Leslie--

            The friends laugh.  Rosa watches, confused.  So is Betty.

                      salesman.

            George likes the challenge. This party isn't so boring after
            all.

<b>                                GEORGE
</b>                      Right, Del.  Del was one hot salesman.
                      Of cars.  He could talk anyone into
                      anything.

<b>                                BETTY

                      time, but Del and I go way back.  We went
                      to school together.  In fact, he saved my
                      life.  Two more minutes in that icy water
                      and I would have drowned.  But Del jumped
                      in and grabbed me.  We fell out of touch
                      eventually, but I still owe him one.

<b>                                BETTY
</b>                      He never told me anything about...that's

</b>                      I can't tell you how much it hurts me to
                      hear that you married him.

            His friends snicker.  Rosa stares.  Betty is oblivious to
            everything but George.

<b>                                BETTY
</b>                      I'm so sorry.  Life makes us do awful
                      things sometimes.

            She's ready to cry.  Which only inspires him all the more.

<b>                                GEORGE
</b>                      I tried to tell myself it was for the
                      best, that there was a reason behind it.

<b>                                BETTY

                      stupid and scared!

<b>                                GEORGE

<b>                                BETTY
</b>                      I know that.  I can't tell you how many
                      times I've said that to myself in those
                      exact words.

            Betty wipes her tears away as they flow freely now.  George
            doesn't like seeing her cry; he tries to say something but
            his friends interrupt.

            Rosa watches, stunned, as Betty waves to her as she leaves
            arm-in-arm with the man of her dreams.

            The Town Car is parked near one of the viewing stops at the

            with a bouquet of flowers.

            The image of Betty shudders, then blurs, then fades away
            entirely.  Charlie rubs at his eyes tiredly, then slowly

            Merle is at the bar, drunk, the only customer on a slow
            night.  Ellen drops two coasters in front of Charlie and
            Wesley as they sit down.

            Ellen looks dubiously at their unshaven faces and rumpled
            clothes.

<b>                                CHARLIE
</b>                      We're looking for this young lady.

            He slides the photo of Betty across the bar. Ellen's gaze
            drops to the picture for a second, and Charlie sees what he
            was looking for - a flicker of recognition.  He allows
            himself a satisfied grin.

            Wesley shows Ellen his badge as Merle checks out the photo.

</b>                      I haven't seen her.

            Charlie takes the photo and puts it back in his pocket.

                      you're not cops.  Now get out of here.

            Wesley steps behind Merle, takes a handful of his hair and
            SLAMS his head into the popcorn machine on the bar.  Merle
            staggers away, stunned. Wesley removes the tin popcorn scoop
            from a nearby hook.

            Ellen reaches for something under the bar, but Charlie's
            faster.  He pins her arm with one hand.

<b>                                CHARLIE

                      us.

            They watch Wesley follow Merle at a slow walk around the pool
            table, CLOBBERING him over the head about every five steps
            with the popcorn scoop.

            Merle wobbles with every shot, but won't go down.  They begin
            a torturous second lap around the table, punctuated by the
            CLANG of the scoop against Merle's head.

<b>                                CHARLIE

            After one more CLANGING shot Merle staggers, then falls.
            Wesley walks over to Charlie and Ellen, drawing his knife.

            He hangs up.  Deletes another one off the list and looks out
            the window.  Checks the now well-worn photo of Betty.  He's
            starting to doubt himself.

            She kisses him deeply, then allows herself to fall back on
            the sofa, pulling George down on top of her and kissing him
            passionately.

                      stand near the nurse's station... we're
                      gonna do a quick walk-through.  Alright?

            He kisses her cheek and walks off toward the waiting Lyla
            before she can respond.

                      pages to shoot...take your time.

            A STAGE MANAGER hands Betty a set of sides and an on-set
            COSTUMER tries to fit her.

<b>                                BETTY

                      this, just put this on...

            The other actors take their positions.  Lyla watches from
            behind the cameras as David readies himself. Chloe enters the
            set with Kleenex tucked into the neck of her costume.

                      new feel to the show.

            She's sliding toward a complete meltdown.

<b>                                VOICE
</b>                      Slate it!

            George steps back behind the cameras.  Betty's still frozen
            to her spot, overwhelmed.

<b>                                GEORGE
</b>                      Just do what you've been doing.  Watch

            Chloe and Blake run through their lines lifelessly, then stop
            when they get to Betty's cue. Their faces loom around her
            menacingly.  Staring.  The lights are impossibly bright.
            People begin to shuffle and stare at one another. Lyla clears
            her throat as George bounds on stage, still smiling.

<b>                                GEORGE

            She's freezing up.  George approaches her.

<b>                                GEORGE

            As he pulls away Betty grabs his arm.

<b>                                BETTY

            Lyla approaches.

                      nuts with this for three days, now do it!

            George steps back behind the cameras as if nothing's wrong.
            Betty still hasn't moved.  She's shaking with fear.  The cast
            and crew members find it hard to look at her.

<b>                                LYLA

                      didn't work.  Nice try.

            George throws down his script and rushes up to Betty, who
            reaches out to him.  He brushes her hands away.

<b>                                GEORGE

                      but I hope you're happy.  I put myself on
                      the line for you, my reputation, and
                      you're making me look like an idiot.

            Betty begins to cry.

</b>                      Leave her alone, George!

                      And you're not an actress, you're nothing

                      and stop ruining mine!

            Betty stands dead still as George continues to berate her.
            ALL SOUND slowly starts to drop out, then comes back abruptly
            with a RUSH.  Suddenly a light snaps on for her and she
            stares at him.

            George watches Betty walk off the set.  The cast and crew try
            to pretend this scene didn't happen, except for Lyla, who
            burns a hole into George's back.  Their eyes meet.

            George McCord, wearing sunglasses and still angry, strides
            into the lobby.  Charlie and Wesley stand quickly and take
            out their badges as he approaches.

            Wesley takes out the photo of Betty.

                                GEORGE (cont'd)
                      That won't be necessary.  She's staying
                      with a Rosa something... Hernandez,
                      Herrera.  I know it's an 'H' sound... in

<b>                                CHARLIE

            George stops.  Wesley is suddenly shy, hesitant.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      It's just... well... I watch the show
                      too, and you being Dr. Ravell and all, I
                      thought you could maybe get Jasmine to
                      come out here.

<b>                                GEORGE

            George pulls away.  Wesley grabs his sleeve.

<b>                                WESLEY

            George wrenches free of Wesley's grip and takes off.

            Wesley is furious.  He catches George in two strides, spins
            him around and SLAPS him across the face.  George's glasses
            go skittering across the floor.  PEOPLE stare.

<b>                                WESLEY

            Charlie pulls Wesley away.  George is frozen to the spot,
            humiliated, a pink handprint emerging on his cheek.

            Betty walks aimlessly along a busy street.  She moves without
            direction, in a daze until a glint of bright light hits her,
            causing her to turn.  She is staring at a black Lincoln
            sitting in a car lot, sunlight dancing off its chrome.  She
            shudders involuntarily at it.  Suddenly, she hears a familiar
            voice.

            It's Del.  He's in a pastel version of his usual shirt,

            Del looks up at the sun for a moment, shading his eye from

            He wipes the sweat from his brow.  Betty looks at his
            handkerchief and sees that it's soaked in blood.  Then back
            at his face, now obscured by blood pouring down from his
            head.
            She stares, horrified, and in that moment Del becomes... a

            She emerges from Rosa's bedroom with toiletries and moves to

            Charlie watches Betty undress from a nearby fire escape.  He
            stares at the object of his desperate search with relief and
            some fascination.

            Betty's movements are unhurried, mindless.  Charlie stares,

            cardboard cut-out of David Ravell pops out at him.

            He breaks it over his knee and throws it in the gutter, then
            quickly removes the wing nut holding the spare tire.  He
            removes the tire, then raises the panel on the floor of the
            trunk as Charlie joins him.

                      It's all here.  It hasn't been touched.

            The bottom of the trunk is lined with brown paper-wrapped
            bricks of cocaine.  Charlie stares at it, shaking his head.

                      You were right.  Del wasn't lying.

                      Del scalped.

<b>                                BALLARD

            BALLARD shoves Roy aside; Charlie's getting edgy ...

<b>                                BALLARD
</b>                      Don't give me that.  I've come two

            Charlie has been listening quietly on the other side of the
            door and finally snaps.

<b>                                CHARLIE
</b>                      Two thousand miles?  That's nothing!

            He flings the door open, sticks a pistol in Ballard's face
            and yanks them both inside.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                      Hah!  You probably flew!  I've crossed
                      the river Styx looking for her, pal!  I
                      travelled the fucking country to be here!

            Charlie slams the door and frisks them, taking a gun and
            handcuffs from Ballard.  Wesley returns with Rosa.

                                CHARLIE (cont'd)
                          (to Betty)

            Wesley takes over.  He sits Rosa down on the sofa, then
            pushes Betty down next to her and beckons to Roy.

<b>                                WESLEY
</b>                      Come here.

            He breaks Roy's nose with his pistol. Roy crumples to the
            floor, holding his face. Betty starts to scream, but Charlie
            puts his hand over her mouth.

            Wesley tapes Roy's hands together, then beckons to Ballard.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      Your turn.

            Ballard drops to his knees in a prayer-like position near the
            aquarium.

            Wesley grabs his shirtfront and slams him to the floor, then
            with a foot on his neck, he loops Ballard's arms around one
            leg of the steel aquarium stand and handcuffs him.

            Charlie does nothing but stare at Betty, his eyes locked with
            hers.  Wesley sees it.

<b>                                WESLEY

            Charlie pulls her to her feet.

                      What are you doing?

            Charlie leads Betty out of the room.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      No way!  This is not professional!

            Silence.  Then Charlie takes out a knife and cuts the tape
            from Betty's wrists, touching her hair.  Gently.  He leaves
            her standing in the corner while he sits on the edge of the

            Roy are sitting in chairs opposite them, their mouths and
            wrists already taped.

            Wesley is engrossed in watching "A Reason to Love."  Behind
            him, Ballard quietly walks his feet up the wall until he's
            completely upside down.  He rubs one foot against the other
            until one pantleg is above his cowboy boot. Rosa and Roy
            watch.
            He finally lifts the boot off.  It falls soundlessly onto his
            chest. A small pistol is revealed, holstered above his ankle.
            He works the holster open using the edge of the fishtank.

            Roy and Rosa COUGH LOUDLY at the same time to cover the
            noise. Wesley glares at them.

            Ballard gets the pistol free. But it falls into the fishtank.
            The air goes out of Roy's sails. Ballard has fucked up again.

            On screen, Chloe and Jasmine kiss and embrace.  Wesley reacts
            as if he was slapped.

<b>                                WESLEY

            Wesley immediately runs the sequence back to view it again.

            Ballard KICKS the wall of the fishtank with his cowboy boot.
            Roy and Rosa cover the sound again with COUGHING. Wesley
            pauses the T.V. and looks around.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      What's your problem?

            Ballard KICKS at the tank again.  But he can't break the
            glass. Roy can't take it any more. He launches himself at the
            tank, grabs it by the rim and pulls it down on top of
            himself.  A torrent of water, fish, plants and gravel pours
            down upon him.

                                WESLEY (cont'd)
                      You stupid piece of fuck!

            He leaps at Roy and starts kicking him savagely.  Rosa throws
            herself onto Wesley's back, knocking him to the floor.
            Ballard paws through the muck, scattering fish and gravel
            everywhere.  He spots a glint of metal in the sand.

            Wesley struggles out from under Rosa. Just as he gets free,
            Ballard FIRES, hitting him TWICE into his chest. Wesley
            stares in disbelief at the blood rushing out of him.  Then at
            Ballard, as if trying to link the two.

            He slumps to the floor and opens his mouth to scream ...

            Charlie sees Wesley turn to him as Ballard FIRES again.
            Wesley's face explodes.  The flying lead drives Charlie back
            to the bedroom.

            Crawling through the muck, Roy notices a fish flopping
            helplessly on the carpet inches from his face.

                      water.

            He gently hands her the fish, then picks up Wesley's nearby
            gun.  Rosa nods; she's amazed that he knew what it was.  She
            looks at Roy in a slightly different way before crawling away
            toward the kitchen.

            Enraged, he empties his pistol at the living room.  Ballard

            stumbles back, losing his balance.  His gun falls and slides
            right into Betty's hand.  Equally surprised they stare at one

            Charlie slumps over in his defeat as Betty holds a shaky

            George and Betty sit across from one another in a booth.
            Betty listens patiently.  Her former co-workers try to remain
