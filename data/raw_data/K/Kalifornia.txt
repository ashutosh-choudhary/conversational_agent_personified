<b>               EXT. - NIGHT
</b>
               It's raining like hell. Flashes of lightning reveal momentary 
               glimpses of a decayed urban/industrial landscape. Far below 
               us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the 
               drowning earth. We descend toward the rock. Sporadic flashes 
               of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. It looks 
               strangely beautiful, like a diamond stuck in the dark mud... 
               Closer... Closer...

               Suddenly, STRONG MALE HANDS cut across the frame and wrench 
               it free from its muddy grave. Even closer... And we discover 
               that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming with 
               every kind of slithering repulsive insect... FLASH!!* 
               Lightning obliterates the frame.

               (* FLASHES OF LIGHT from lightning, car headlights, 
               photographic strobe units and flashlights are used throughout 
               the following sequences as recurring transitional devices.)

<b>               CITY STREET EXT. NIGHT
</b>
               We can barely see the darkened street in a run down part of 
               an inner city -- what we can see looks half demolished. 
               Flash!!

               Through chain link fencing, the blinding headlights of a 
               70'S CHEVY arc into frame. For an instant we see the fleeting 
               image of a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL. On her feet a pair of bright 
               red high heeled shoes. The Chevy pulls up next to her.

<b>               INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT
</b>
               FLASH!! An oncoming car's headlights streak across the beat 
               up Chevy's windshield... revealing... THE DRIVER, 45ish, as 
               he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door.

               The pretty teenage girl slides into the car. Dressed only in 
               a skirt and T-Shirt, she's soaked to the skin. Make-up runs 
               down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders. She 
               seems nervous... scared even.

<b>                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
</b>                         Thanks.

               As she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has 
               been injured. It's bound with coarse white toweling and 
               stained with blood. In her other hand, she clings tightly to 
               a cheap yellow leather purse. He reaches forward and puts 
               his hand on the gear-shift, the back of his hand brushing 
               against her leg, she moves away. He slides the gear-shift 
               into drive.

               Another car's headlights flare the windshield as he pulls 
               out into the night.

               Suddenly... a powerful photographic strobe light ignites! 
               Revealing a decrepit warehouse interior. Silhouetted briefly 
               against the paint chipped walls are two figures: A man, BRIAN 
               KESSLER, 25, short chopped hair dressed in black on black, 
               and a woman, CARRIE LAUGHLIN, 25, short black hair and tight 
               black clothes. Carrie holds a 35mm still camera, an umbilical 
               cord runs to a strobe light. Brian holds a flashlight in one 
               hand, a tape recorder in the other. He begins speaking into 
               the tape recorder.

<b>                                     BRIAN
</b>                         Her father worked the night shift 
                         here. Most nights he'd bring her 
                         with him.
                              (pause)
                         She was eleven years old.

               His flashlight scans the ominous environment. Carrie takes 
               flash photo.

<b>               EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
</b>
               Emerging from the blackness... The same strong male hands 
               that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket 
               clear of his torso. A crude bandage wrapped around one of 
               the fingers. The rock is slipped up under his jacket... up 
               against his bare chest. The jacket is pulled down to conceal 
               the rock and the faceless figure drifts away.

<b>               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               The beam of Brian's flashlight sweeps through the darkness, 
               revealing another room.

<b>                                     BRIAN
</b>                         This is it. This is the where he'd 
                         take her whenever he had the urge to 
                         molest her.

               The flashlight finds the corner in question. Flash!! The 
               warehouse lights up again, revealing a huge machine room.

<b>                                     BRIAN
</b>                         Of course! Nobody would have heard 
                         her cries over the noise of the 
                         machines.

               A male hand wipes the steamy condensation clear of his car's 
               front window. The windshield wipers swipe incessantly at the 
               constant sheet of rain beyond.

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         Damn! This defroster never works...

               The driver fidgets blindly with the various levers and knobs. 
               He finally manages to get the defroster and heater to work. 
               The girl leans forward into the stream of warm air.

<b>                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
</b>                         ...Mmm... feels good.

               She closes her eyes, lets it blow across her face. He watches 
               her. His eyes linger on her body.

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         Have a problem with your car?

               She pulls her wet hair off her bruised face and gives him a 
               nervous smile.

<b>                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL

                         My problem's with men.

               He throws a curious look at her, then back to the highway.

<b>               INT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               Brian's flashlight moves around the room.

<b>                                     BRIAN
</b>                         This is where she murdered her first 
                         victim. They found his body over in 
                         the corner, shot through the head.

               The flashlight continues to search through the darkness.

</b>                         They found her second victim over 
                         there.

               Another flash!!!!!

<b>               INT. 70'S CHEVY

               Very close on the girl's yellow purse... as the metal zipper 
               is pulled open. The driver notices her opening the purse.

<b>                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL

                         ...sure.

               The driver watches as she reaches into the purse... out a 
               soggy pack of matches. She looks at them... I look to the 
               driver.

<b>                                     PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL
</b>                         My matches are all wet. You got a 
                         lighter?

</b>                              (scans the dashboard)
                         Yeah. It's here somewhere. It's my 
                         wife's car. Ah... there it is.

               He pushes the cigarette lighter in to heat. Out of the corner 
               of his eye, he sees the girl's hand slip back in her purse. 
               And stay there. She stares at the car lighter and... waits. 
               The driver glances at her, then back to the lighter.

               FLASH!! As another strobe light ignites. Tape recorder hand, 
               Brian continues...

</b>                         She lured them here with the promise 
                         of sex.
                              (beat)
                         Imagine the anger and hatred she 
                         must have felt returning to this 
                         place. Did she use that to help her 
                         pull the trigger?

               Carrie snaps another shot. Flash!! The blinding flash 
               illuminates the night rain streaming in through the fractured 
               remains of the ceiling.

               Brian stops talking. Carrie scans the darkness. From the 
               quiet...

               A Thunderous Roar!!

<b>               INT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT
</b>
               A Blinding Flash!!

               As... a semi-trailer crosses paths with the 70'S CHEVY.

               Close on the girl. An intent expression on her face as she 
               watches and waits... for the cigarette lighter to eject. His 
               hand reaches deeper into her purse. The Driver tenses as he 
               sees this. Suddenly...

               POP!! The lighter ejects.

               The Driver reaches for the dash. The girl hurriedly lifts 
               something out from inside the bag. The Driver yanks the 
               lighter out... and whips a look to the girl.

               Brian's flashlight sweeps across the shadowed remains of the 
               rafters and catwalks. Scanning... Listening... Brian and 
               Carrie glance tentatively at each other... Then slowly Carrie 
               lifts the portable strobe unit upward until it is pointing 
               into the rafters. Carrie fires a shot, triggering a brilliant 
               Flash!!

               Flash! Out of the inky black... The glistening wet rock 
               emerges, hurtling downwards... Tumbling end over end through

               The girl pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her purse. She 
               looks curiously to the driver whose hand is trembling 
               slightly.

               The girl reaches out, steadies his trembling hand... and 
               pulls the red hot coil to the cigarette between her lips.

               When... in a THUNDEROUS CRASH!! The glistening wet rock comes 
               smashing through their windshield!!!!

<b>               EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               The CHEVY brakes... Skids across the rain-slicked pavement 
               and turns a somersault, landing upside down on its hood.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE: CLOSER
</b>
               The CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the fractured front end of the 
               overturned CHEVY. The twisted hunk of metal hisses... 
               steams... groans. The front tire spins lazily to a halt on 
               its mangled axle.

<b>               IN THE BACKGROUND - HIGH OVERHEAD
</b>
               We see a man standing on a highway overpass. He's leaning on 
               the railing and calmly looking down at the wrecked car.

<b>               CLOSER
</b>
               EARLY GRAYCE, 25, athletic build, big watery eyes, jet black 
               hair, stands by the railing. Rain streaks down his 
               expressionless face. He dropped the rock.

<b>               EARLY'S POV - THE 70'S CHEVY
</b>
               Lying in the deserted highway. The Driver crawls out covered 
               with blood. Still clutched in his hand is the car cigarette 
               lighter. Its red hot coil extinguishing quickly to a faint 
               glow.

<b>               ANGLE: CLOSER ON EARLY
</b>
               Calmly looking down with no pity. Even closer... Water running 
               down his face. Closer yet... On his eye... And right into 
               the dilated pupil.

               As we enter it -- it's like being in a dark winding tunnel 
               filled with the hum of dynamos and the loud rhythmic pumping 
               of powerful machinery.

               The room's crowded with people. There's a lot of noise -- 
               "shop talk," banter. Clipped conversations overlap, as we 
               find Brian with his friend Eric. They are in the midst of 
               making a blender of margaritas.

               Brian turns to see Carrie now behind him. She wraps her arms 
               around his neck.

<b>               EXT. LUCKY STREET GRILL
</b>
               A relic from the fifties with large glass windows. The rain 
               has stopped but the streets are still wet. Early's piece of 
               shit Grand Prix pulls into the lot. He gets out and walks 
               into the diner.

<b>               INT. DINER - NIGHT
</b>
               The place is almost empty. Early, still wet from the rain, 
               walks to the counter and sits down. He calls out to the 
               kitchen.

<b>                                     EARLY

</b>                         ...Be right there.

               The only other customer is an OLD MAN, sitting at the counter 
               nearby nursing a cup of coffee. His face half hidden under a 
               rain soaked hat. Early selects a tune from the countertop 
               juke box.

<b>               OLD MAN'S POV
</b>
               Out of the corner of his eye he sees a bug (from the concrete 
               block) crawl out of Early's sleeve and onto the counter.

<b>                                     OLD MAN
</b>                              (from beneath his 
                              shadowy brim...)
                         The Antichrist'll be a woman, in a 
                         man's body. Seven heads and seven 
                         tails.

               Early gazes at the Old Man curiously, then calls out to the 
               waitress...

<b>                                     EARLY
</b>                         Make that to go.

               Early notices the small bug crawling across the counter. He 
               leans closer to it and watches it. After a moment, he THWACKS 
               it off the counter with his thumb and finger. The bug lands 
               on the hot iron griddle with a SIZZLE!

               EARLY glances at the Old Man again... then scoots over one 
               stool closer to him. Early seems curious to want to get a 
               glimpse under the brim of the Old Man's hat.

<b>               IN THE BACK KITCHEN AREA
</b>
               The waitress is bagging Early's order to go... when the front 
               door slams shut!

<b>               FRONT DINING AREA
</b>
               The waitress re-enters the room. It's empty. Neither the Old 
               Man nor Early are there. With Early's food in hand, she makes 
               her way along the rear of the counter toward the front door. 
               She glances around curiously. On the griddle, the remains of 
               something black and charred smoulders. Closer to the entrance, 
               she stares at the front door. The sign that hangs in its 
               window has been turned... the backside which faces her reads 
<b>               "OPEN."
</b>
<b>               AT THE FRONT DOOR
</b>
               She wonders about the sign for a moment, then stares curiously 
               out the window... not a soul in sight. She locks the door 
               and begins closing up for the night. She turns to make her 
               way to the rear of the diner then notices something. Slowly 
               she moves along the side wall, past a number of highbacked 
               booths.

<b>               HER POV
</b>
               Sitting on one of the funky old leather seats in a booth are 
               a pair of RED HIGH HEELED SHOES (the same pair worn earlier 
               by the Pretty Teenage Girl). The Waitress glances nervously 
               about the interior. No one in sight.

<b>               AT THE BOOTH
</b>
               She reaches down slowly and picks up the pair of shoes. Looks 
               at them closely. Stares at the inside lining. Then suddenly 
               out of the quiet... a voice.

<b>                                     EARLY
</b>                         ...Size 6.

               The Waitress spins a startled look to the booth beyond hers! 
               Early leans out from behind the highback partition.

<b>                                     EARLY
</b>                         That's right ain't it, size 6?

               The Waitress... smiles, nods shyly.

<b>                                     EARLY

</b>                         Early, you are so sweet.

               This is ADELE CORNERS. She's 17, pretty, uneducated and 
               Early's girlfriend. She steps over to him, gives him a kiss, 
               then sits down on the seat across from him. She starts to 
               try on her new shoes.

                         that chili there.

               She passes the bag to Early. He digs in. Between bites, he 
               glances over to Adele who's enthusiastically pulling on the 
               new shoes.

               A door swings open spilling light into a darkened room. Brian 
               and Carrie, a little drunk, return home from the party.

               Their apartment is in an old converted industrial building 
               in a funky low rent part of town.

               Brian walks ahead, Carrie trails behind him, peeling off her 
               clothes. She begins unzipping her dress, unnoticed by Brian.

                         visceral.

               Brian is at the foot of the bed, he turns to see... Carrie 
               has transformed. She has stripped down to her black bra and 
               panties, fishnet stockings, a nightporter style leather cap. 
               A surprised Brian stands there a moment. Looking at Carrie. 
               She looks great.

               Carrie climbs on top of him. She kisses his neck. Slowly

               A solitary trailer sits alongside a run down house.

</b>
               Through the soot tinged atmosphere, sunlight filters in past 
               the curtained windows. Early is lying face down in bed, his 
               right arm extended over the side. Adele is in the kitchen 
               half dressed, and unsuccessfully attempting to iron one of 
               Early's shirts. She realizes the iron is out of water, she 
               sets it down and steps to the sink and fills a glass with 
               water. As she does she glances at a cactus on the counter.

               Adele smiles then notices that a photo held to the fridge by 
               a decorative magnet has fallen to the floor. She picks it 
               up.

                         angel.

               Adele puts it back onto the fridge. It is a photo of a young 
               Early with his mother. In the photo Early appears to be about 
               ten or eleven. he stands next to his mother. Her arm is draped 
               over his shoulders, she is holding a drink. A cigarette butt 
               dangles between her fingers. Nearby a portable radio is tuned 
               to music, when the local radio jingle comes on and segues to 
               the news.

               A handkerchief bandana is tied around his head and over his 
               eyes.

               The NEWSCASTER'S voice gets louder.

</b>
               Slowly he reaches to his face and lifts the bandana up off 
               one eye. Even closer on his left eyelid. It flutters... pops 
               open and blinks. Now... his eyeball stares right at us. The 
               pitch black pupil contracts in the morning light. The 
               newscaster's voice continues to amplify...

                         police operation is underway... no 
                         arrests have yet been made.

               The newscaster's voice quickly fades away. Early calmly closes 
               his eyes and drifts back to sleep.

<b>               EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE MORNING
</b>
               Early emerges from the trailer drinking a bottle of beer. He 
               looks around the yard, it's full of various kinds of useless 
               junk. He walks over to his car. Adele appears in the doorway 
               of the trailer in her bathrobe.

               She glances around to make certain that no one's looking, 
               then 'flashes' her body to Early with a giggle.

               Early smiles. Adele turns back into the trailer then, 
               remembers...

               Early looks at the run down house next door where Diebold 
               lives. A beat up red pick-up is parked in front.

                         he's gonna "kick us the...

               Early revs the raspy engine.

               front yard.

</b>
               Brian enters the darkened loft interior.

                         hear from the gallery?

               Brian turns the corner, he's immediately greeted by a series 
               of erotic images being projected on the far wall. They are 
               slides of Carrie's photographic work. In regard to the nature 
               and content of Carrie's photographic work, her photographs 
               address the sexual collision of opposites. "What if's." The 
               subjects of her photographs are hypothetical and highly 
               unlikely partners. Studies in contract. Moments of passion.

               From across the room, he hears Carrie's disembodied voice. 
               He drifts toward the couch.

                         one of those... I forget. Who cares.

               Brian finds her slumped down on the couch. He sits down. 
               She's got a drink in her hand. A bottle on her lap. She 
               continues to click through the slides. As she rambles on, 
               it's obvious that she's definitely under the influence of 
               something 90 proof.

                         University Library... then what?

               Brian can see she's upset. Drowsy from the booze. He just 
               watches her. Listens. Her words linger in his head.

               The bold graphic sexual photographs of Carrie's continue to 
               accentuate her comments.

               Brian notices an envelope on the floor nearby. He picks it 
               up. Opens it. Inside, he finds the photographs Carrie took 
               at the warehouse. Interested, he shuffles through them. He 
               becomes more and more intrigued with what he sees.

               The Parole Officer opens one of the closet doors, pilfers 
               through things inside, as if searching for something. Early 
               is getting pissed off but says nothing.

               Early sits down at the table. The Parole Officer steps over 
               to him.

               The Parole Officer pulls a slip of paper from his shirt 
               pocket, sets it on the table.

               Early lifts his beer for another drink. The Parole Officer's 
               prosthetic hand snaps tight around the neck of the beer 
               bottle, just inches from Early's lips.

               With that Early looks up at the man, almost defiantly, then 
               stands up. The Parole Officer hiccups again. Early stares at 
               him for a moment.

               Early tries to get the engine to tick over. Then... He sees 
               JOHN DIEBOLD, his landlord, emerge from his house and begin 
               lumbering toward the Grand Prix. The two panting ugly-ass

               Early tries the engine again. Still won't start. Diebold,

               Hurriedly, Early tries the engine one more time. It starts. 
               Grinning from ear to ear, Early pulls away before Diebold 
               and his dogs reach him.

               Pissed, Diebold grabs a rock and hurls it, hitting Early's 
               car.

               The car stops, dead in its tracks.

               the pitbulls bark, then follow suit.

               Early laughs as he stalks Diebold.

               Diebold jumps out of the way of the Grand Prix just as it 
               pulverizes his portable barbecue.

               After a moment, Early climbs out of the hole and stands in

               cap. Pull back to reveal that it is Early as he opens a bottle 
               of Lucky Lager beer and takes a sip. On the back seat between 
               them sits a brown paper bag. Adele reaches into the bag and 
               pulls out a cheap pocket camera. Excitedly she rips open the

               them.

               Brian and Carrie look to one another then force a weak smile. 
               Early jumps in and throws a pair of devil's horns up behind 
               Brian's unsuspecting head as... the shutter clicks.

               Brian and Carrie quickly turn their attention back on the 
               house.

                              recorder)
                         Neighbors said he was a quiet young 
                         man, who was often seen pushing the 
                         children on the swing set.

               An unusual bird house and a tricycle sit in the front yard. 
               To the side of the house are the remains of an old swing 
               set. Carrie finds an interesting angle on the swing set, 
               with the house in the background, SNAP! She fires off a shot.

                         Everything was fine until the day 
                         the family ran out of work for 
                         Michael, and had to ask him to leave.

               As Carrie frames up another shot, Early crosses in front of 
               her camera. Realizing he is in Carrie's photo he stops and 
               poses. Carrie looks to Brian.

</b>                         Sorry, Early... Could you step out 
                         the way, for a second?

               Early is surprised that they don't want him in the photograph. 
               He wanders away from the front of the house. Meanwhile, Adele 
               photographs the moment.

                         year old daughter...

               Just then... A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL comes running from around 
               the side of the house. She stops dead when she sees all of 
               them. Carrie snaps a final photo.

               The little girl scans all their faces.

</b>                         ...My name's Brian, what's yours?

               The little girl remains silent. Brian rolls a look to Carrie 
               then back to the little girl.

</b>                         ...Could I speak to your parents?

               After an awkward pause, the little girl silently crosses the 
               yard to the porch and opens the front door.

</b>
               Looking into the house through a kitchen window we can see 
               into the entrance hall and through to the open front door. 
               Brian waits outside on the porch, as the little girl enters 
               the house looking for her father. Inside the kitchen, right 
               next to the window, is a side table with a telephone and a 
               purse on it.

               Suddenly... Early's reflection appears in the window; he has 
               obviously seen the purse.

<b>               AT THE FRONT DOOR
</b>
               Brian motions for Carrie to join him.

<b>               AT THE SWING SET
</b>
               Adele watches Brian and Carrie for a moment, then loses 
               interest. She stands on the seat of the swing and begins 
               swinging.

<b>               AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE
</b>
               Early tries to push up the kitchen window. It barely lifts 
               three inches before jamming. Through the room we see the 
               little girl and her father step to the front door.

<b>               EXT. FRONT DOOR
</b>
               A MIDDLE AGED FARMER with tanned leathery skin. He is not 
               happy. Brian extends his hand...

                         Hi, my name is Brian Kessler.

               The father says nothing and does not respond to the extended 
               hand. Brian retracts his hand.

                              confident)
                         I'm a writer, I'm working on a book 
                         about famous murderers.

<b>               AT THE SWING SET
</b>
               Adele swings higher. Her summer dress ripples in the wind. A 
               smile on her face.

<b>               EXT. KITCHEN WINDOW
</b>
               Early's entire arm is through the opening. His shoulder 
               presses against the window pane. But still he can't reach 
               the purse. So, he grabs the tablecloth and begins pulling it 
               toward him. The purse slides closer, inch by inch. All the 
               while, he keeps one eye on the Farmer across the room.

               EARLY'S POV (ACROSS THE ROOM) The Farmer's back is turned to 
               the kitchen as he listens silently to Brian.

                         is the Novak house...

<b>               AT THE SWING SET

               Adele swings even higher. She's lost in the moment. Euphoric.

                              (pause)

                         come in and photograph...

               Before Brian can finish, the man slams the door in his face.

               The Farmer turns away from the front door.

               Brian is surprised. He just stands there a moment. He's not 
               sure whether to knock again.

               Brian continues on in a huff until Carrie breaks stride and 
               stops. She pulls him next to her.

               Brian glances back at the house. She interrupts his glance, 
               kisses him.

                         come back and get him.

               Carrie, surprised at Early's new found philosophical belief. 
               She looks into her side view mirror... And sees Early smiling 
               back at her. Carrie looks away...

               Shifts from the mirror to the house in the background... as 
               the car pulls out of the driveway, the little girl watches 
               from her porch.

               A small roadside diner. A fair number of people inside having

</b>
               Carrie watches Early eat with a kind of horrible, rude 
               fascination. He has no table manners at all. He eats with 
               his elbows on the table, fork wedged in the fist of his right 
               hand. All the while, he chews with his mouth open. He's 
               serious about his "eating."

                         so far. Not a bad day's haul.

               Early doesn't bother to respond. He keeps eating.

               do any good.

               As Brian folds up the map. Early takes off his boot, then 
               his well-worn sock. Carrie's look of disgust grows as Early 
               brings his foot up onto his lap and scratches it while he 
               eats. Carrie puts her fork down: dinner is over for her.

               He notices Brian and Carrie staring at him and slowly puts 
               his foot back down on the floor -- then the sock.

               Brian picks up the check to see the total... Starts pulling 
               his wallet out... Isn't quite sure how to bring up the tab 
               to Early.

               Brian decides to leave the light on. He moves closer to 
               Carrie. He slides up against her backside. He reaches for 
               her under the sheets. Kisses her neck.

               Brian's mouth moves down along her back. He slips beneath

               approves... Yet she can't resist slipping in another remark...

               Carrie reaches down and grabs two fists full of Brian's hair. 
               She pulls him to her. He slides up along her chest, kissing 
               her. Things heat up. She reaches out, grasps his arms. Pulls 
               him closer.

                         and carved it out.

               Brian bites at her neck. She stops talking. His sweating 
               shoulder presses against her face. She turns her head to 
               encourage him.

               In the dresser mirror... she sees their shadowy reflections. 
               Their bodies atangle under the sheets.

               Their reflection in the mirror intrigues her. Intoxicates 
               her. His aggression excites her. She pulls him into her. The 
               metal bedframe bangs against the motel wall repeatedly as 
               they make love.

               Then slowly, the camera bisects the plaster and lumber divider 
               and emerges in the next room...

               Adele in bed asleep... the scissors stop.

               crosses Brian's face. Early turns to see... Adele approaching 
               the table. Her hair has been crudely chopped to resemble

               small cactus on the window near the table.

               He sees Carrie's reflection in the bathroom mirror, she's in

               Early completes the task. Together he and Brian begin putting 
               everything back in the trunk.

               Suddenly, from behind, Adele jumps onto Early's back,

               The horn honks. Early is behind the wheel, engine running. 
               Brian steps out of the motel room.

               Carrie snaps another shot of Adele. Every once in a while 
               Adele feels like she should be "posing" for the shots that 
               Carrie's taking of her. So, occasionally, as she carries on 
               her conversation with Carrie, she does.

               Carrie watches her in amusement. After a moment, Adele

               Early looks at the beer.

                         Bri' this shit ain't Lucky Lager!

               Early takes a swig off the beer, grimaces and sprays it out. 
               It hits the Young Cracker. The Cracker looks down at his 
               shirt in shock. Early is oblivious.

               Brian is frozen, confused, doesn't know who to address. Early 
               continues to ignore the Young Cracker.

                         Why you fuckin'...

               The Young Cracker moves to hit Early. Early swiftly smashes 
               his beer bottle into the oncoming face. The Young Cracker 
               doubles over clutching his face in agony. Early kicks him in 
               the face, sending the Young Cracker to the ground. Early 
               finishes him off with several more kicks from his heavy work 
               boots.

               Two large tough guys approach Early and Brian. Brian's heart 
               racing, Early cool as a cucumber. Instead of taking on Early, 
               they stop, reach down and drag the unconscious man away. The 
               waitress returns to their table.

               Brian reaches in the back seat and grabs the last Lucky Lager. 
               He crosses to the other side of the car and hands Early the 
               beer.

               When Early opens his eyes, he sees a concerned look on Brian's 
               face.

               An awkward silence.

               Then Early starts laughing. Brian follows suit. They both 
               climb back in the car. Their forced laughter trails off.

               Brian shifts the Lincoln back into gear and segues 
               awkwardly...

               Early will say, or do? Then Early grins...

</b>
               With her arm buried inside the ice machine, Carrie scavenges 
               for what little ice there is... when, out of the corner of 
               her eye, she notices...

               SOMEONE standing at the other end of the corridor. The 
               silhouette of a man.

               Carrie stops. Her eyes scan the claustrophobic hallway for 
               another way out. There is none.

               She tries to ignore the situation. Grabs another handful of 
               ice cubes. The man approaches. Carrie stops again. Her mind 
               races. The man's face slowly becomes visible as he nears the 
               fluorescent light. It's Early.

               Early reaches past her into the ice machine and grabs a 
               solitary cube. He puts it in his mouth, sucks on it. His 
               torso is drenched in sweat. He catches Carrie staring at 
               him.

                         just start sweating like a dog. You

                         No.

               Early spits the ice cube back into his hand. He presses it 
               against the back of his neck.

                         ...and down my back... right into my 
                         pants.

               Carrie follows a bead of ice water as it slides down between 
               his shoulder blades and along his back.

                         for my boots, see who gets there 
                         first.

               He snaps a look back to Carrie and finds her looking at his 
               ass. She diverts her glance.

</b>                         You never get that hot, huh?

               Carrie shakes her head no. Early looks in his hand to see 
               that his ice cube has melted.

                         melts.

               Carrie tries to slip past him. He reaches back into the 
               machine, momentarily blocking her exit. He grabs another ice 
               cube. His face only inches from hers.

               He pops the ice cube in his mouth and lets her pass.

               Carrie is driving. Brian is contending with a major hangover. 
               There is still a silent tension between Brian and Carrie 
               from the argument the night before. Early is in the back 
               with Adele. Brian moves his head and moans.

                         tomato juice...

               From the front seat, Brian's hand springs up in a desperate 
               plea for an end to Adele's colorful description.

               Brian rolls down his window for some fresh air, as the car 
               pulls away.

               Early is asleep, leaning against the door. Adele is rummaging 
               through a large canvas bag on the seat next to her. 
               Suddenly... The wail of an approaching ambulance gets Carrie's 
               attention. It roars by. Carrie glances in the mirror again. 
               The next instant, unexpectedly...

               She furiously pulls the car off the road to an abrupt halt.

               Carrie nods toward the back seat. Brian turns and sees Adele 
               looking back at them questioningly. Beside her, Early rustles.

<b>                                     BRIAN

               Brian notices that Adele's rummaging has revealed an automatic 
               pistol in the open canvas bag. Brian stares at it. Early's 
               eyes open.

<b>               EXT. PARKED LINCOLN - LATER

               A deserted plain. It's very quiet here. Until the silence is 
               broken by the sound of gunshots. Reveal Early teaching Brian 
               how to shoot. A row of tin cans are set up on a rusty old 
               car. It's obvious that Brian's enthralled with the idea of 
               shooting the gun. Even if he isn't hitting anything.

               Brian fires off another shot, misses again.

                         pull the trigger, hold it real steady.

               Nearby stands an unhappy Carrie. Adele pulls her yoyo out of 
               her pocket.

               Carrie doesn't respond. Adele offers the yoyo to Carrie.

               Again Carrie declines. Her steely gaze returns to Brian.

               Early helps Brian to hold the gun.

               BANG!! The can flies off the tree stump. Brian turns to Carrie 
               to see her reaction... but she's already on her way back to 
               the car, and she's furious. Concerned, Brian starts to follow 
               after her... But Early grabs his attention.

               Brian is driving. Carrie keeps to herself. In her side mirror 
               she catches a glimpse of Early curled up in Adele's lap. She 
               watches a moment longer... and realizes that they are making 
               out. Beginning to kiss and touch one another.

               The Lincoln turns off the main highway onto a dirt road. In

               The Lincoln pulls up to the ramshackle structure. Brian 
               glances to the back seat to make a remark to Early and Adele 
               and sees that they are amorously engaged.

               Brian and Carrie start to gather their stuff. Carrie opens 
               the glove compartment, inside are boxes of film... and the 
               .45 automatic. She takes a few packs of film, and closes the 
               glove compartment.

               Carrie reaches over and takes the keys from the ignition, 
               locks the glove compartment and pockets the key. Both she 
               and Brian exit the car. As they start to walk toward the 
               structure Brian hears a sound, he turns back to see. Adele 
               leaning forward into the frontseat as the lincoln's big white 
               top starts to come up.

<b>               INT. ABATTOIR

               Even in daylight, the interior of the dilapidated old building 
               is equal parts unnerving, austere, and menacing. The last 
               rays of sunlight stream through what remains of the windows. 
               The light falls on a long ominous row of wicked looking meat-
               hooks hanging from the ceiling.

               Carrie is getting her camera equipment ready. She's quiet 
               and uncommunicative.

               Camera in hand, Carrie begins to move about, despite the 
               fact that this place repels her.

               Brian presses a button on the audio cassette player. The 
               small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we 
               slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman 
               being tortured and pleading for her life.

               Carrie fires off a series of shots from different angles.

               Carrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior. Then

               Carrie storms out of the place. She exits the tunnel, and 
               makes her way toward...

               As she approaches it, through the rear windshield she sees... 
               Early and Adele fucking wildly!

               Carrie wants to turn away, but she can't stop watching them. 
               Fascinated, she raises the camera to her eye and zooms in on 
               them.

               Early is sitting against the back seat. Adele is straddling 
               him. Carrie's finger finds the shutter button.

               Early's arms move up under Adele's dress... Her hands press 
               up against the roof. She's trembling... Wavering... Carrie's 
               finger presses down on the button, CLICK!!

               Then in one swift movement Early sweeps Adele onto the back 
               seat. Close on Early's face. He's sweating... Lips moving... 
               Talking dirty to Adele.

               Keeping her finger on the button, Carrie rapid fires through 
               a whole roll of film. She's oblivious to the whine of the 
               motor drive once all the film is shot out.

               Then unexpectedly!! Early looks directly into the camera, at 
               Carrie. And smiles... And continues to fuck Adele.

               A chill rushes through Carrie, she almost drops the camera. 
               She runs back toward the tunnel... and right into Brian's 
               arms. He startles her. She pulls away from him.

               Carrie looks at the TV, watches for a moment. It doesn't

               The room fills with billowing down stuffing. As the stuffing 
               floats to the floor it sticks to their hair, skin and

               Early drags Carrie out of the office toward the car. Brian 
               sees them running toward the car. They spill into the back 
               seat. Brian sees Carrie is upset.

               From the back seat Early wipes some more feathers from his 
               face, then points the Attendant's gun at Brian's head.

               The last of the feathers fall like snow. The whole room is 
               now white except for a red stain around the head of the dead

               The car moves down the highway. Early in the back seat is

               Carrie sits in the corner of the back seat, covered in 
               feathers but not even noticing them.

               Adele enters the decrepit store. The others are inside. Brian

               takes one of the bags from Adele. He begins opening one of

               Early opens another container. Stares curiously at the

               Early notices that Brian is watching him intently. He mistakes 
               Brian's interest for hunger.

               Carrie doesn't respond at all. Adele unties Brian.

               Early pulls out his gun, puts it on the table next to him. 
               Brian sits across from Early. He watches as Early rummages 
               impatiently through the carry out paraphernalia.

                         at!

               Frustrated, Early finally takes a gulp of Chinese food right 
               out of the container. It goes down rough.

               Brian picks up a pair of chopsticks, then reconsiders, puts 
               them back down and, like Early, gulps from the container.

               NEARBY, Carrie sits quietly. As she listens to the two men 
               talk... she notices something on her arm. She lifts her arm 
               up to get a closer look.

               She sees that a few of the white down feathers still cling 
               to her. Closer... and she sees that one of the tiny feathers 
               is tinged with blood. The Gas Station Attendant's. It freaks 
               her.

               Carrie watches as Brian and Early disappear around a bend in 
               the dirt road. Out of the corner of her eye, she hones in on 
               Adele's yoyo.

               Adele becomes increasingly intense about manipulating the 
               yoyo, controlling it. Until she's lost in it. A momentary 
               refuge.

               construction. An old photo on the bookshelf shows a much

               Mrs. Musgrave is confused, is it a trick? She looks into 
               Adele's eyes... and knows it's not. The old lady turns and 
               walks out into the dark desert. Adele stands at the open 
               door, watching Mrs Musgrave escape.

               Early enters, and sees Adele standing at the back door. Adele 
               turns to face him. Early looks past her into the night and 
               realizes what she's done. He strides across the room pulling 
               the pistol from his waistband.

               Aside from the occasional pools of light illuminating the

               He steps outside and starts firing his gun into the

               Desperate, Adele grabs a large potted cactus. She rushes 
               toward Early. Swinging the cactus like an unwieldy bat, she 
               pummels the side of his head. He stumbles forward, 
               disappearing into the darkness. Adele stands outside the

               Early re-emerges from the shadows. Adele's eyes widen when 
               she sees him. His cheek has long bloody gashes where the 
               cactus ripped the flesh.

               A look comes over Early's face that we've never seen before. 
               That he's never felt before. Hurt. He doesn't know how to 
               deal with it. And he definitely doesn't like it.

               Carrie glues her eyes to the kitchen doorway. Brian presses 
               his back up under the belly of the piano and using all his 
               strength manages to lift the piano an inch off the floor. 
               Carrie slides her cuffs out from under the leg.

               Carrie's eyes dart back toward the kitchen. Then she notices 
               a chair nearby.

                         hurry.

               Carrie grabs the chair. As Brian lifts the piano, she pushes 
               the chair beneath the underside of it. It holds the piano 
               suspended an inch off the floor. Brian drops to the floor 
               and slips the cuffs free.

               When... a solitary gunshot rings out from the cactus garden.

               A moment later, Early steps quietly into the room. He's 
               pulling the last few cactus needles from his face. He sees 
               Brian and Carrie standing.

               A shocked silence. Brian and Carrie look to one another. 
               Carrie moves toward the kitchen but Early stops her! Brian 
               rushes at him. Early sticks the .45 automatic in his face!

                         Just don't kill him.

               Early deliberates the situation, then eases up off the 
               trigger... and smiles to Brian.

               Then, without warning, he hits Brian over the head with the 
               butt of the .45 automatic. Brian falls to the floor 
               unconscious.

               beer on the ground and shoves it in the back seat, then slides 
               into the driver's seat next to an anxious Carrie. Carrie is

               Early still behind the wheel. Carrie sits up against the

               Carrie quietly responds. She kneels on the front seat and 
               reaches into the back. She grabs a bottle by its neck, and 
               pulls it from the six pack of beer. Bottle in hand, she

               but instead of taking it, he clasps his hand over hers.

               The wind has picked up. An old wooden gate blocks the fire 
               road. On either side, barbed wire as far as the eye can see. 
               The Lincoln roars into frame and powers through the barrier.

               The gate smashes into splintered pieces of wood.

               Carrie leans against the passenger door. Early's eyes scan 
               the open desert -- looking for the elusive 'doors.' Carrie 
               reaches for her pack of cigarettes. Early, without a word, 
               reaches out and takes the pack from her. He crumples it up 
               and throws it out the window.

               The pickup truck arrives at a crossroads and skids to a halt. 
               Brian tries to guess which direction to take. Then he spots 
               Early's discarded beer bottle up ahead. The truck accelerates 
               straight ahead, tires spinning.

               The winds continue to escalate, blowing harder and harder. 
               The Lincoln approaches on the fire road. A trail of steam is 
               streaming out from under the hood, blinding Early's view.

               Finally, Early slams on the brakes and skids 180 degrees to 
               a halt... Steam pours out of the Lincoln's grill. The Lincoln 
               has had it.

               Early is indifferent and looks around. About a hundred yards 
               away, barely visible through the growing sand storm, an old 
               1950's style building.

               A FAMILY OF FOUR MANNEQUINS placed around the room: The father 
               sits in front of the TV... The mother (the same mannequin as 
               in Mr. Musgrave's old picture) is toppled over a kitchen

               Wind and sand blow freely through the remains of the windows. 
               A solitary kerosene lamp dimly illuminates the living room 
               area. Its flickering light finds... Early, stripped to the 
               waist, crouched over the broken TV set. He fidgets with the 
               knobs. Then the mangled rabbit ears antenna. Carrie sits on 
               some blankets in the corner next to the couch. She's scared 
               to death. Her eyes scan the battered room. Debris everywhere.

               Amidst all of it, Carrie's erotic photographs have been placed 
               about the room.

               Still unable to get the TV to work, he smacks it a good one 
               on the side.

               With the smack!... Carrie whips her look back toward Early... 
               To find he's lost interest in the TV. He turns toward Carrie. 
               Stares at her for a moment. Then with a hint of a smile, he 
               begins to move toward her. The time has arrived.

               He reaches down, grabs her by the shirt and pulls her to her 
               feet. Carrie doesn't resist. He's rough with her as he kisses 
               her on the lips. Carrie pulls her mouth away from his. She 
               seems confused, unsure of her feelings. Early watches her, 
               until her eyes come back to his. Then she steps forward 
               crowding her body against his, as she slips one hand around 
               his neck and kisses him deep and hard...

               Suddenly Early breaks the kiss and backhands Carrie hard 
               across the face. She lands on the floor several feet away, 
               the palm of her right hand is bleeding.

               Early looks down to his waist to find a large piece of glass 
               protruding from his side.

               He pulls the glass shard out, blood drips down his side and 
               onto his jeans.

               Carrie gets up and races into the back bedroom, frantically 
               looking for a way out, there is none. On the bed the two 
               adult mannequins now lie naked. They have been placed, 
               intertwined in a grotesque sexual position.

               Carrie turns and rushes back toward the door. Early intercepts 
               her and throws a punch to her stomach, which doubles her 
               over. Then Early sends a second punch to her face, she 
               stumbles backward, landing onto the bed amongst the 
               mannequins. Early begins undoing his belt.

               swirling through the air. One of the photos whips across 
               Early's chest. The wind holds it there momentarily.

               Early peels Carrie's photo off him, the blood from his wound 
               covers the back of it. He slaps it against the nearest wall. 
               It sticks. He walks toward her.

               In the darkened bedroom, Early's solitary figure rustles 
               atop the bed. Slowly, he awakens. His eyes open. Across the 
               bed, a pair of handcuffs is locked around the bedpost. In 
               the other cuff is Carrie's motionless hand.

               Then, out of the corner of his eye, Early sees something in 
               one of the nearby rooms. Curious, he stands, shoves the .45 
               automatic in his waistband and walks toward the hallway.

               As he passes through the living room and enters the hallway,

               slides across the floor. A look of joyful amazement over the

               reflecting the sun's rays back toward the house. He realizes

               to help her. As he gets closer, he sees her badly bruised 
               face and realizes what's taken place throughout the night.

               Brian stops. The sympathetic expression on his face changes. 
               With hatred in his eyes, he pivots around, strides out of 
               the bedroom and moves toward the front of the house to Early. 
               in the front room Gun in hand, Brian rushes back into the

               lay... but Early's not there.

               Brian's eyes dart around the room... then suddenly, from 
               behind him, Early grabs him!

               He wrenches Brian's head back and whips his belt buckle knife 
               toward his throat!

               Brian manages to lift his hands to his neck an instant before 
               the knife tears through his flesh. The knife slices a vicious 
               wound across the back of Brian's right hand. He drops the 
               gun to the floor. Brian elbows Early in the ribs and pulls 
               away from him. He reaches to the ground for the gun, but 
               Early kicks him in the stomach and sends him crumbling to

               to crawl toward it. But Early's foot shoves Brian. He flips 
               over onto his back, landing in front of the bedroom doorway. 
               Early moves toward him, knife in hand.

               As Early moves toward Brian, unexpectedly from inside the 
               doorway, the torso of the female child mannequin whips past. 
               Her hardened molten face slams into Early's bloodied face. 
               Early stumbles backward.

               Brian crawls for the gun and grabs it. From his knees he 
               turns, steadies the weapon, takes a quick breath... and fires. 
               Hitting Early square in the chest!

               Early falls to the ground on his back. Brian lifts himself 
               to his feet.

               He sees that Carrie has dragged the bedframe to the doorway, 
               and in her free hand she holds the child mannequin by the 
               leg.

               Gun in hand, Brian steps over to Early. Early's body is still. 
               Blood oozes from the hole in his chest. On a silver chain 
               around his neck is the key to Brian and Carrie's handcuffs. 
               Brian reaches down and grabs the keys... when suddenly Early's 
               arm springs up from his side. His hand grabs Brian's shirt 
               collar. Brian is startled by the move, then realizes that 
               Early's hold is weak. His fingers tremble. Finally his arm 
               drops back down to his side.

                         What d'ya say?

               The two men stare at one another for a moment... then Brian, 
               with one hand still on the handcuff keys, shoves the .45 
               automatic firmly under Early's chin.

               o.s. BANG!! rings out as...

               CLOSE UP on the chain and keys snapping free from Early's 
               neck.

               CLOSE UP on Brian's handcuffs hitting the dusty wooden floor.

               CLOSE UP on Carrie's handcuff swinging empty against the 
               rusty bedpost.
