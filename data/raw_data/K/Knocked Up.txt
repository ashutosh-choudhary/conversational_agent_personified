<b>          EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
          BEN STONE, 23, cute in a chunky Jewish guy sort of way, boxes one
          of his roommates, MARTIN. His other roommates, JAY and JASON fight
          with broom sticks. JONAH drinks beer on the couch spectating.

<b>                         QUICK IMAGES:

           We see Ben and Jay fighting. At one point they fight with gloves
          which are on fire, balancing on a plank over a dirty pool.
           Ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head.
          There is a smoking joint in his mouth, making the bowl get
          cloudier and cloudier. He starts coughing hysterically and takes
          it off.

           A boom box is playing. The boys are now free style rapping. It
          is terrible but they are having a blast. Pot is being smoked.
          Beer is around.

          which they work at, and a few TV sets which have movies running on
          them. Ben and his friends are holding a meeting. They each have a
          note pad and pen, and Jonah is on a computer. They smoke a joint
          and drink beers.

</b>          Martin, listen. You don't shave your
          beard or cut your hair for one year,
          and if you can do that, I will pay
          your rent. But if you shave, then you
          have to pay all five of our rents.

<b>                          MARTIN
</b>          Thanks for the free money, bitch.

<b>                          JONAH
</b>          Hey, Martin, was it weird when you
          joined the Taliban, being American and
          everything like that? Like when you
          see a woman driving a car, do you just
          get pissed?

<b>                          JASON

          whole time.

<b>                          JASON
</b>          But, Martin, it's a competition. It's
          called "The Dirty Man Competition."
          We're gonna make fun of you until you
          shave the beard. That's the rules.

<b>                          JAY
</b>          That's the whole point. You're

<b>                          BEN
</b>          Your face looks like Robin Williams'
          knuckles.

<b>                          MARTIN
</b>          You guys aren't allowed to make fun of
          me. It's not part of the rules.

<b>                          JASON
</b>          Martin, why didn't you just listen to
          me when I was explaining the rules?
          You just looked at me with that blank
          stare of yours. It was like talking to
          a wax statue.

<b>                          BEN

           wanted to talk to you today because we
           had a little debate on the conference

<b>                          JACK
</b>          Don't make everything smaller. I don't
          want to generalize that way. Tighter.

<b>                          JILL

</b>           I cannot be supportive of this. This
           is a mistake. This is a big, big
           mistake. Now think about your
           stepsister. Now, you remember what
           happened with her? She had the same
           situation as you and she had it taken
           care of. And you know what? Now she
           has a real baby. Honey, this is not

<b>                          BEN

          from covering her breast to shake his hand. Jonah immediately
          covers her breast with his hand.

</b>           Yeah, because you were getting high

           of the good thing. You know, my dad

          Alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought. None
          of them have been read. Alison sadly puts them back without Ben

           All the problems are the same, but

           pithy dialogue, everybody's just

</b>           It definitely is. That's why I got one
           in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The
           only thing is we have to decide if
           we're going to be Crips or Bloods
           before we get there.

</b>           Well, I look good in red.

</b>           I look good in blue. The fighting
           continues. We could just throw off
           everyone and become Latin Kings.

<b>                          ALISON
</b>           Yeah.

<b>                          BEN
</b>           We both look good in gold.

<b>                          ALISON
</b>           Good choice. I would yell at you about
           driving so slow, except the baby's
           here.

<b>                          BEN
</b>           No, these guys can honk all they want.
           I ain't going faster than twelve. It
           might take us around three hours to
           get home, though.
          The car moves slowly down the highway with a line of cars waiting
          behind them.

<b>          FADE OUT.
