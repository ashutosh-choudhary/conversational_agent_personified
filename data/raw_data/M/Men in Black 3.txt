<b>          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MIRROR AVIATOR SUNGLASSES
</b>
          Standard issue throughout the south to abusive, racist prison
          guards.

          Widen to reveal that, indeed, these glasses are on the
          sneering face of just such a man.
          We follow the guard

<b>          DOWN A DINGY PRISON HALLWAY
</b>
          Paint peeling off the rusty bars. Somewhere, someone is
          playing harmonica. Prisoners yell complaints as he passes.
          He meets them all with--

<b>                         GUARD
</b>          Shut up, convict! Get yer hands
          off the bars!

          The guard passes through several levels of security doors,
          deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison --
          home of the scum of the scum.
          Meanwhile...

<b>          PRISON VISITING ROOM
</b>
          The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read
          magazines, watch TV. Footsteps -- someone's here. Which
          pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do
          their jobs.

          The unseen visitor buzzes for help. They take their time
          getting off their asses. When they finally look up, their
          gaze becomes a leer. Follow it to:
          DEVIL GIRL, the visitor. Too tall, too muscled, but hot if
          you're into that kind of thing -- an R. Crumb drawing come to
          life.

          She holds a CAKE -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake
          right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook.

<b>                         GUARD 2
</b>          Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I
          guess even a turd gets flies to
          land on it.

<b>                         GUARD 3
</b>          Me, I like a big girl.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>          They smirk, hoping for a reaction. Devil girl emits a low,
          sinister growl like an angry Doberman... The guards look at
          each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS:

<b>                         GUARD 2
</b>          I.D., visitation papers.

<b>          BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH THE GUARD
</b>          He reaches the end of the hallway. The biggest, most
          absurdly-reinforced double security door. He punches in a
          code.
          The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it
          squeaking and groaning the whole way. Whoever's behind this
          thing must've done something REAL bad.

<b>          WITH DEVIL GIRL
</b>          Going through the metal detectors, waved over with security
          wands. The guards are being thorough. Maybe more thorough
          than they need to be. They check everything -- even the
          cake. The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED.

<b>                         GUARD 3
</b>          She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but
          you know.
          They laugh, buzz her through.

<b>          WITH THE GUARD
</b>          The giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the
          hallway. Stops in front of a cell. Yells in:

<b>                         GUARD
</b>          Hey, Yaz! You got a visitor.
          Let's go, pretty boy.

<b>                         VISITING ROOM
</b>          Spare. Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured
          concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face
          of a guard.
          The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks
          like they're not taking chances.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>          At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake. She
          hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HER

<b>                         BELOVED --
</b>          YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider. A
          huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a
          grubby unshaven face...
          Everything about him seems strangely independently alive --
          every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the
          way Elvis was in his prime.
          He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING. A smirk plays on
          his mouth that says -- I'm smarter than you, asshole.
          The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and
          MANACLES. They dump him into one of the chairs. Devil Girl
          jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long.
          A guard pokes them with his billy club --

<b>                         GUARD 2
</b>          This ain't a conjugal visit.
          quit yer conjugating.

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          When's the last time you conjugated
          anything?

<b>                         DEVIL GIRL
</b>          I brought you a cake.

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          Thanks, darling.

<b>                         (TO GUARDS)
</b>          Hey could you cut this up for us?
          It's our anniversary. I'm romantic
          like that.
          A guard picks up the cake. Smirks and takes a dirty three-
          fingered scoop of frosting.

<b>                         GUARD 2
</b>
<b>                         (MOUTH FULL)
</b>          Not great. She must.be good at
          somethin' else.
          They all LAUGH. He goes back for another scoop.

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          I wouldn't do that.

<b>                         GUARD 2
</b>          Why's that, convict?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          4.

<b>                         GUARD POV:
</b>          Where he scraped away the frosting, REVEAL A HORRIBLE ALIEN

<b>                         MOUTH
</b>
<b>                         GUARD 2 (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>                         WHAT TH--
</b>          But in a flash, the mouth SPRINGS OUT -- IT BELONGS TO A
          VORACIOUS ALIEN -- another springs out behind it -- they
          consume the guard's entire face.

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          That's why.
          The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of
          grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as
          their master, snarling and hungry for blood.
          The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER.-- he
          launches his aliens, taking them all out.
          Yaz "holsters" the aliens and...

<b>          THE PRISON BREAK IS ON!!
</b>          One guard, badly wounded, crawls to SOUND THE ALARM
          In the reflection of a pair of blood-spattered aviator
          glasses -- Devil Girl puts the guard down with his own
          weapon.
          She uses one of the cake-aliens like a saw to get Yaz out of
          his chains.

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          There's nothing sexier than a girl
          killing for me.

          She runs a hand over his bicep.

<b>                         DEVIL GIRL
</b>          You got so strong in prison.

          Yaz notices the almost-dead guard:

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          I'm not just a man of brute force,
          you know. I prefer to be known for
          my rapier wit--
          His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier --
          impaling the guard--

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          5.
</b>
<b>                         YAZ (CONT'D)
</b>          --and tongue.
          The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl KISS.
          They collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to saw
          open the door.

<b>          YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL ESCAPE
</b>          Prisoners go nuts, guards scramble -- smoke, screaming,
          chaos.
          Yaz and Devil Girl, armed with weapons they took off the dead
          guards, BLAST THEIR WAY OUT.
          He's a sociopathic badass... and she's no slouch either.
           Along the way, Yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs
          an armload of weapons -- Shotguns, pistols, and a Rocket-
          Propelled grenade (RPG).
          He uses and discards them as he goes.
          They head for the front gate and FREEDOM...
          But..
          They turn the corner and find 50 GUARDS in FULL RIOT GEAR --
          Plexiglass shields, helmets, shotguns -- all aimed at Yaz.
          All Yaz has left is his RPG.

<b>          GUARD ON MEGAPHONE
</b>          Give it up, Yaz! There's no way
          out!
          A beat of stand-off -- Yaz and Devil girl facing off against
          the 50 Guards... No one blinking...
          Prisoners. watching... what's gonna go down?

<b>                         GUARD
</b>          You can't win. You've only got one
          shot in there!
          Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it. The
          guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear.

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          You look hot. Mind if I open a
          window?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          6.
</b>          The guards share a look - huh?? Yaz grins, turns his RPG
          towards the wall behind the guards. The guards' faces go

<b>          WIDE WITH TERROR.
</b>
<b>                         GUARD
</b>          Hey! Whoa! What are you doing?
          Don't do that!

<b>          SLAM!
</b>          Yaz blasts a hole in the wall -- the guards are IMMEDIATELY
          SUCKED OUT like from a hole blown in an airplane.
          What the...?
          Yaz steps through the hole.

<b>                         ON YAZ
</b>          As he and Devil girl step through the hole, take a deep,
          satisfied breath of FREEDOM.
          Reveal we are on...

          As Yaz fixes his gaze on our planet, his hair, his fringes
          INDEPENDENTLY ARTICULATE YAZ'S MALEVOLENT EMOTIONS... they
          also seem drawn here. Like bees, they express a collective
          intelligence.

<b>                         YAZ

          As it revolves, we observe its strange craters and surface,
          where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases...

</b>          Look at table two over there. They
          haven't ordered a thing. When's
          the last time Wu let someone sit at
          a table without ordering? And
          table five over there just drank
          his third cup of duck sauce.
          Now Kay's radar is up --

          getting our noodles... outside?

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Because it's about to go down.
          Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.

<b>          MR. WU
</b>          Sorry, guys.
          Wu leaves, quickly pulling the door behind, him. The guys
          reach for their weapons.
          And IT GOES DOWN --
          It's a SET-UP, and everyone in the restaurant is in on it --
          The hipsters, the families, the wall street guys -- all draw
          various forms of ALIEN WEAPONS and ATTACK
          It's like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping
          truckloads of ordnance at each other. Close hand-to-hand
          combat. Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and they're not
          taking any chances.
          Right ahead of the onslaught, JAY GIVES KAY A HAND SIGNAL --
          He nods, and they dive in opposite directions, SAVING

          his back to Jay.

</b>          Absolutely secret, do you
          understand?

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Yes, but we're running out of time--

<b>          AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM
</b>          Hey! Excuse me!

<b>                         TREVOR
</b>          With you in a second, ma'am.

<b>          AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM
</b>          It'll only take a minute. You see,
          my nanny's phone number got erased
          from my favorites and I have to ask
          her what my daughter wants for her
          birthday.
          Jay takes the phone.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Oh, I see the problem.
          He CHUCKS THE PHONE across the store, where it SMASHES TO
          PIECES. She leaves in a huff.

<b>                         TREVOR
</b>          I've always wanted to do that.
          okay, so here's what you do...
          Trevor pulls Jay in, ready to lay this top secret information
          on him...

<b>                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay, so go to the clock app. And
          shake it.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          That's it?
          Jay does it.

<b>                         TREVOR
</b>          Now you just type in the year you
          want to travel to...
          On the phone -- it's "augmented reality" -- the image through
          the phone is the image of the targeted time period.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Okay, thanks.

<b>                         TREVOR
</b>          Now listen. This is highly
          crucial: Time travel is nothing to
          mess with. You can't change
          anything, you can't use new
          technology or all of space-time can
          just -- kablooey!

<b>                         JAY
</b>
<b>                         (OFF MISSILES)
</b>          Yeah, well, is it ok if I change

<b>          THAT?
</b>
<b>                         TREVOR
</b>          Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's cool.
          Jay is about to "enter" time travel...

<b>                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>          Wait -- hold on a second. If you
          go -- I'm just gonna stay... and be
          dead?

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Don't worry, I'll fix it. You'll
          only be dead for a little while.
          Jay DISSOLVES INTO A TIME TRAVEL EFFECT...
          Cera is left alone. The missiles get EVER CLOSER...
          Trevor opens a "Voice Recorder" app:

</b>
<b>                         (INTO PHONE)
</b>          Trevor's last words. Dear
          posterity... Should anyone find
          this, let history remember that
          Trevor was a man of noble bearing,
          quiet dignity --

<b>          (IMPACT!)

<b>          29.
</b>          And the world is vapor.

<b>          EVERYTHING GOES WHITE...
</b>
<b>                         WHITE
</b>          Pure white.
          Jay comes to, groggy, like he has the worst hangover of all
          time, brain bigger than his skull, trying to make his eyes
          focus.
          Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white
          environment -- Is this the afterlife?
          The reverie disrupted by a TOILET FLUSH
          The white resolves into

<b>          INT. BATHROOM
</b>
          Jay realizes he's in a men's room, sitting in a urinal. The
          music transitions: Whatever hip-hop featuring a 60s sample
          was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s
          song itself, played over a tinny portable radio.
          He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of
          one of the stalls, washes his hands... and flips Jay a
          quarter.
          Jay stares at it a beat, confused. Misreading his confusion,
          the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter.

<b>                         OFFICE WORKER
</b>          What the heck, you're doing a great
          job.
          The kid leaves.
          Jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in...

<b>          INT. HIGH 60'S OFFICE
</b>
          White guys on IBM Selectric typewriters as far as the eye can
          see -- like the office in the Apartment.
          Jay stops in his tracks, taking in the 1969-ness of it all.
          An officious guy, annoyed, runs up--

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          30.

</b>          You're late! Where's Mr. Watkins'
          lunch?

<b>                         JAY
</b>
<b>                         OH--
</b>
<b>                         OFFICIOUS GUY
</b>          Did his girl not put in the order?
          The officious guy glares at the "girl" -- in her 60s.

<b>          OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D)
</b>          (shoves a bill in Jay's

<b>                         HAND)
</b>          Run down to Woolworth's -- Two
          hamburger sandwiches, fries, egg
          cream, and a pack of luckies. If
          you're back in half an hour, you
          can keep the change.
          Jay looks at the SINGLE DOLLAR BILL.

<b>          OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D)
</b>          On the double, OK?

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Yeah.
          Jay's moves to the elevator, waits for it. Pockets the
          profits of the racist misunderstandings.
          Elevator opens, the elevator operator opens the door -- Jay
          climbs in with a car full of older executives.
          Jay shakes his head, just taking this all in.

<b>                          JAY (CONT'D)
</b>          Wow. 1969. You're all dead now.
          Just as the elevator's about to close, a leggy blonde tosses
          him a set of keys.

<b>                         BLONDE
</b>          The Big Man wants his caddy. Chop-
          chop.
          The doors close.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          31.
</b>
<b>          EXT. PARKING LOT NEXT DOOR
</b>
          Jay's got the keys. He looks at the parking tag, walks down
          a row of beautiful classic cars, looking for the right car --
          stops and smiles.

<b>          THE BIG MAN'S CADDY - JAY DRIVING
</b>          Reveal Jay cruising in the most gorgeous 1964 Coupe deVille
          convertible. Fins, chrome, a thing of beauty.
          From the seat next to him -- a fedora. He puts it on,
          completing the look.
          In the background we notice the Leggy Blond getting yelled at
          by the guy who must be "The Big Man" Jay HONKS and waves --
          thank you!
          Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a
          minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York.
          A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS' "Can't Get Next to You"
          comes on the radio. Jay is swept up in the music and soon is

<b>          SINGING ALONG AT FULL BLAST.
</b>          At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian
          couple. They give him a disapproving look. The woman
          clutches her pearls just a little more protectively.
          He smiles and leans towards them.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Guess what? Black president!
          He laughs and drives off.
          Pulls up at...

<b>          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING
</b>
          The secret entrance to MiB HQ, familiar from the first movie.
          Jay strides up to the entrance and... can't open the door.
          Bangs on the door -- nothing. Shaking the knob, calling to
          the guard... nothing. From behind him:

<b>          VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Help you? Look a little lost.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Yeah, thanks, listen--

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          32.
</b>          Jay turns and is face-to-face with two grinning Staten Island
          cops. He instantly realizes what's about to go down.

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>                         (SIGHS)
</b>          Yeah, guess I knew this wasn't
          gonna be just people handing me
          money and Cadillacs.

<b>                         COP 1
</b>          'Scuse me?

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Nothing, officer. I'll be on my
          way.

<b>                         COP 2
</b>          That's an awful nice car.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Thanks.

<b>                         COP 1
</b>          Kind of work you do, individual of
          your particular... ethnic
          persuasion... to buy a car like
          that?

<b>                         COP 2
</b>          Wouldn't be anything illegal, would
          it?

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Yeah, I'm the North American
          champion of kiss my ass.
          The cop loses his smile, turns to his partner:

<b>                         COP 1
</b>          That sound like resisting arrest to
          you?

<b>                         COP 2
</b>          Sure did.
          They grab him, start to frisk him --

<b>                         COP 2 (CONT'D)
</b>          Well, well. Boy, you're gonna have
          a little problem explaining THIS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          33.
</b>          The cop holds up Jay's HIGH-TECH GUN -- the NOISY CRICKET
          and his NEURALIZER.
          A BLACK CROWN VIC SCREECHES UP between the cops and JAY.
          Out steps KAY -- but 40+ years younger.

<b>                         KAY

          look here for a moment --
          Kay pulls out what looks like a NEURALIZER -- and swiftly
          beats each one over the head -- it's just a BLACKJACK -- they
          crumple.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Kay? Kay, is that you? Oh, man
          it's good to see you, buddy!
          Jay hugs Kay -- who remains stony-faced. Jay gets a little
          choked up to see his friend alive -- Kay is a rock.

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Oh! You think -- aw,that's funny.
          No, it's not like that. You see,

<b>          EXT. NEW JERSEY STATE PARKWAY

          We hear the way-too-loud death-rattle exhaust note of what
          sounds like ten Harleys at once.
          Reveal -- Yaz, the nightmare biker, looking like Dennis
          Hopper meets Satan, riding a badass custom skull-themed rig
          that might have dropped out of the brain of Stanley Mouse.
          His skull ring gleams on his pinkie. Devil Girl sits behind
          him, hands on his shoulders.
          We ride with them a beat, tearing down the highway...
          They STOP AT A LIGHT -- even with a brightly-painted microbus
          full of hippies.
          One of the hippies leans out --

          Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup.

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay, you all wanted to go home.
          Well here we are. So how do you
          want to get off this rock? You
          guys have the spaceport on Long

          Kay just looks at him.

          The Archanans smile.

<b>                         ATTENDANT

          The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and
          hands it to one of his attendants.
          The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT... it passes
          through all the attendants and then to JAY.
          Jay gives it a look.

          Okay, then. Follow me.
          Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the
          terminal. Kay catches up --

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Where are we going?
          Jay looks at him a beat.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the
          biggest T-bone you ever saw when we

          these guys over here for a second.
          But I'll meet you in a minute. By

          They stare at each other --

</b>          Sounds good. See you there.
          Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and
          reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card --

          Agent Kay, dead at the scene.
          Killed by Yaz.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          You know what an MiB agent calls it

          They walk to the FLORIDA TUBE

<b>                         JAY

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Doing what?
          He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          You stay home and stay alive.
          But Kay isn't down.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          I told them I'd help them -- I'm
          honor-bound to do it.
          Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney.
          Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus.
          Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Damn, you used to have some abs.
          They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches:

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)
</b>          I can't let you go to Florida.

<b>                         KAY

          feet collide.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Bet you're sorry you taught me
          that.
          The fight continues... They're wearing down, circling each
          other...
          And then Kay fakes a left ---

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)
</b>          You always lead with your--
          But this time Kay connects with his right, knocking Jay down
          hard.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Had enough yet?
          On Jay -- gasping, spent -- using every last reserve of
          strength to lift himself off that floor.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          I can't let you go -- I love you!
          Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN. Kay LUNGES AT JAY.
          They CLINCH... it's a stalemate...

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Aw, hell, look at that-- behind you-

<b>                         JAY

<b>                         KAY
</b>          I'm not kidding --
          Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see...
          The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the

<b>          FLORIDA TUBE.
</b>          Jay and Kay share a look -- and both run INTO THE TUBE!

<b>          THROUGH THE TUBES
</b>          Jay, Kay and the Archanans hurtle through the MiB system of
          pneumatic tubes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          84.
</b>          The Archanans fly through the tubes, relaxed and happy,
          moving gracefully, like fish through water...
          Kay is in perfect controlled tube position -- everything
          clenched, hands by his sides, looking like he's in an "air
          luge"...
          Jay is SCREAMING and ricocheting off the sides of the tube
          like a pinball...
          They shoot SOUTH, passing landmarks of the Eastern
          seaboard...
          Intercut with Jay's face -- blown back like Right Stuff
          astronauts in a G-Force simulator.
          Jay FLAILS towards the Archanans, grabs onto the Lama's robe:

</b>          (yelling over the wind

<b>                         NOISE)

</b>          Yes.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Oh. Okay, then. Thanks, good to

<b>                         LAMA

          will be death.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          What does that mean?
          The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current. Jay gets
          CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube.

          like kung fu masters...
          Kay hits with both feet and rolls...

          Jay looks up -- FIVE MANATEES STARE HIM DOWN. The ALPHA

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          You can't stop me! Nothing on
          Earth can stop me!

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Nothing now.
          Yaz raises an eyebrow...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          98.
</b>          Jay draws his NOISY CRICKET -- the gun he brought from the
          future.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          What's that?

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Little something I brought with me.
          Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS --
          As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5... 4...

<b>                         YAZ
</b>          Try it! You wouldn't dare! One
          false shot and you'll rip space and
          time!

<b>                         JAY
</b>          That's a chance I'll have to take.
          Jay BLASTS YAZ
          Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE... The hatch SLAMS him in!
          Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF--

<b>          HUGE FLAMES - HUGE CLOUDS OF SMOKE THREATEN TO ENGULF JAY AND

<b>                         KAY -
</b>
<b>                         KAY
</b>          Uh oh --
          But the Archanans surround them with their aura -- where the
          flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them...
          And then it's over...

<b>          BIG VICTORY MOMENT
</b>          As they watch the rocket carry Yaz off...

<b>                         JAY
</b>          We did it, partner. I hope you
          remember this when you recruit me --
          you won't give me such a hard time.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          You know I will.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Yeah.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          99.
</b>
<b>                         KAY
</b>          I guess we'll have to build a
          prison on the moon or something.
          Jay realizes -- grabs Kay --

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Do a better job this time, OK?
          That needs to be one hell of a
          prison. You don't want that guy
          coming back, or I'm coming back.
          Look, once was enough, OK?
          Jay turns to The Colonel --

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)
</b>          Thank you for your help, sir. Hope
          we don't get you fired.

<b>                         COLONEL
</b>          Not too worried about that.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Can I ask you -- what did the Lama
          show you in there that made you
          help us? Was it the Earth being
          destroyed?

<b>                         COLONEL
</b>          No -- it was my son. All grown up.
          As a matter of fact, I'm late to
          see him -- I promised I'd watch the
          launch with him.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Oh. Thanks. He's a lucky kid.

<b>                         COLONEL
</b>          I'm a lucky dad. Take care.
          Jay offers him a handshake. The officer takes it -- and
          pulls Jay into a hug.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Okay...
          The Colonel leaves. Jay and Kay congratulate each other,
          smile over a job well done...
          But then they see the Archanans... And realize...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          100.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          We're sorry we didn't get you home,
          guys. It was the only way to get
          rid of Yaz.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          But we'll make sure you're safe
          here. And the next rocket out...

<b>                         LAMA
</b>          All is well. You have done well.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          No we didn't. You wanted to go
          home...

<b>                         LAMA
</b>          There is what we desire and what
          must be... And now our gift to
          you...

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Gift? But we didn't get you home.

<b>                         ARCHANANS
</b>          There is the action and there is
          the intention. It is the intention
          we reward.

<b>                         LAMA
</b>          You did the right thing. And if
          humans are capable of such
          sacrifice, such friendship...
          perhaps we ARE already home.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          So then what's the gift?

<b>                         LAMA
</b>          You already have it.
          Jay looks at pong.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          This? Pong?

<b>                         LAMA
</b>          Yes. PONG. The Pan-Galactic
          Ordnance Negation Grid. Agent Kay
          will use this technology...

<b>                         JAY
</b>          To make the missile defense system.
          You use this to save the world.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          101.
</b>
<b>                         ARCHANANS
</b>          Yes. Don't drop it.
          They take the PONG and drape it around Kay's neck
          The Archanans leave, chanting...

<b>                         ARCHANANS (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>                         (CHANTING)
</b>          Bip... Bip... Bip...
          And it's just Jay and Kay.
          Jay looks at Kay wearing the PONG... just like in the case
          file picture...

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Hey. My watch stopped.
          We see -- a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something
          about it bothers him...

<b>                         KAY
</b>          C'mon. Let's go watch that bastard
          leave the atmosphere.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a
          second.

<b>          KAY GETS INTO THE ELEVATOR
</b>          Jay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the
          scaffolding.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          So you guys understand all this
          time stuff, right? So is
          everything going to be okay now? I
          mean, if I saved everything, and
          Yaz is really gone, why am I even
          here? Shouldn't I not have come in
          the first place? And why do I
          still have time left on my watch?

<b>                         UNDERGROUND
</b>          The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of
          underground hallways.
          Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          102.
</b>          ,He sees a WALL CLOCK -- 3:59.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          3:59. But Kay didn't get killed
          until...
          And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)
</b>          He didn't come yet! Kay, he didn't
          come yet!!!
          Jay races to find Kay.

<b>                         WITH KAY
</b>          Unaware that his appointment with death is near...

<b>          WITH YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL
</b>          Racing down a hallway... hunting Kay...

<b>                         WITH JAY
</b>          Running... running... searching... where is Kay?

<b>          INTERCUT BETWEEN KAY... YAZ... JAY...
</b>          All converging on destiny...

<b>                         WITH JAY
</b>          Running... more frantic now...
          And then he sees him!
          Kay -- at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to
          the outside...

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Kay!
          And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there!
          Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot!
          Yaz pulls his guns...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          103.
</b>          Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to
          know HE'S ABOUT TO DIE!
          Yaz FIRES!!
          But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead! He catches the
          bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes.
          And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ AND
          KILL HIM, blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY
          LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch.
          They look at each other -- it's over.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          See? I knew you had my back.
          Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL

<b>          MAN -- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JAY'S OWN SILHOUETTE.
</b>          As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller,
          shrinking to KID SIZE. It's a boy.

<b>                         KID'S VOICE
</b>          Dad? What's going on?
          The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape
          of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG

<b>          JAY.
</b>
<b>                         JAY
</b>          Where there is death, there will
          always be death. He saved your
          life. He swapped his for yours.
          He saved the world.
          Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --

<b>                         KAY
</b>          I'll take it from here.
          Kay steps away... but turns back.
          In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses
          Kay a modern Neuralizer.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Leave me some memories this time,

<b>          OK?
</b>
<b>                         KAY
</b>          Sure, partner. I'll see you
          around.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          104.
</b>
<b>                         JAY
</b>          Yes you will.
          Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand.
          Jay watches them from a distance:
          Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body
          was -- hands it to the son.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to
          have this.
          Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain.
          Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and
          worn.

<b>                         YOUNG JAY
</b>          Where is he?

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Your daddy had to go -- he's part
          of the space program, now. He's
          okay, he just had to take a trip up
          to the stars, but you'll be just
          fine. I'll keep an eye on you...
          They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo
          launch...
          Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE...

<b>          PURE WHITE LIGHT...
</b>          And it resolves into...

<b>          NEW YORK - BACK TO PRESENT DAY...
</b>          Jay comes to in the Apple Store, looks to the sky and

<b>          THE MISSILES ARE STILL COMING!!!
</b>
<b>                         JAY
</b>          Noo!!!!
          And then...
          A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and

<b>          PONGS THE MISSILES BACK INTO SPACE
</b>

<b>          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING

          Jay is walking on air -- thrilled to see the deadpan security
          guard.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          It's good to see you, man.
          He gives him a hug-- gets a "what the hell?" face.

<b>          INT. MIB HQ
</b>
          Jay is thrilled to be back -- hugging everyone he can.
          No one else knows what he's talking about -- from their POV
          he never left... It all seems the same except for quick shots
          of Ex the bitter janitor, aged Devil Girl pushing the coffee
          cart...
          Jay bounces through the MiB HQ -- it's just a regular day to
          everyone else, but it's HOME SWEET HOME to Jay.
          He even gives the worm guys a big, gushy hug.
          A crowd of people gathers around Kay, congratulating him on
          winning the Bowling trophy... AGAIN.
          Kay looks up -- SMILES BIG when he sees Jay.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Alright, everyone, give me and my
          partner here a minute.
          They leave the guys alone. A beat -- and Jay just wraps him
          in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          It's good to see you, man. So

          I mean, do you know what I've been
          through?
          Kay just stares at him.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          You mean, do I remember that you
          travelled back in time to save my
          life and the world? Not bad,

<b>                         JAY
</b>          No problem. You'd do the same for

          did?

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Well, I don't know exactly.
          Because I was dead. But in a
          quantum reality, objects can exist
          in contradictory states... So
          multiple timelines with varying
          probabilities can exist, and the

          our love... Across timelines!
          You're saying our love will go on!
          Kay swats him away -- but the love couldn't be more clear.
          Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain. Takes it
          out.

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)

<b>                         JAY
</b>          No.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          You're sure? Because the littlest
          thing can have huge repercussions.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          I was very careful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          107.

<b>                         KAY
</b>          Good man, good man. Well, let's
          get you a uniform.

<b>                         JAY
</b>          Excuse me?
          We PULL BACK --
          Revealing PRESENT DAY MIB IN ALL ITS KICKASS GRANDEUR.
          Eternally vigilant in the struggle to protect the Earth and
          all its inhabitants...
          And every one of those agents wearing BLUE SUITS WITH SHORTS.

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)
</b>          Even I can't make that look good.

<b>          FADE TO BLACK.
