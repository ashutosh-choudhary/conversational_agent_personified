               well-dressed, intelligent, attractive looking young man.

                         this has to do with Mr. Blandings 
                         and his Dream House? Well, I'll tell 
                         you. Jim Blandings is part of the 
                         fabric of this town. Born and raised 
                         right here, he's as typical a New 
                         Yorker as anyone you'll ever meet. 
                         At least he was.
                              (confidentially)
                         And if you want to know the real 
                         story, I guess I'm your boy. Cole's 
                         my name, Bill Cole. I'm Jim's lawyer 
                         and quote, best friend, unquote. 
                         Jim's one of those bright young men 
                         from Yale. Advertising business, 
                         lovely wife, two fine kids, makes 
                         almost fifteen thousand a year. Want

                         over on East Seventy-fourth Street. 
                         It was just another of those wonderful 
                         crisp September mornings and the 
                         Blandings were still asleep. Just

               The CAMERA GOES THROUGH the window and INTO:

<b>               INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
               Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel (Myrna Loy) Blandings are asleep 
               in twin beds.

               The room, not large to begin with, gives us the impression 
               of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds, 
               oversized chest of drawers, dressing table and chaise lounge 
               take up an inordinate amount of space.

               SOUND of an alarm clock going off. Jim awakens, yawns himself 
               into hazy consciousness, gropes about on the night table for 
               the clock; it isn't there. He slips out of bed, and rubbing 
               his eyes, blindly moves toward the dresser. The circuitous 
               path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entails 
               going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominously 
               pointed edge of Muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping 
               over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching the 
               chest of drawers upon which is the clock. He turns off the 
               alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path. We get 
               the feeling that Jim makes this sleepy excursion every waking 
               morning of his life.

               Back at his bed, Jim sits down, and, yawning loudly, gropes 
               with his feet for his slippers. Before he can find them, 
               however, he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back toward 
               the pillow, pulling the covers over him. In a moment he is 
               sound asleep. Muriel's arm automatically stretches out and 
               shakes Jim into consciousness. As he painfully reawakens and 
               starts to rise, Muriel's arm disappears.

               We get the impression that this, too, is a regular part of 
               the Blandings' daily routine.

               Jim locates his slippers, reaches around for his bathrobe, 
               can't find it, stumbles his way over to the closet, opens 
               the door.

<b>               INT. THE CLOSET
</b>
               This is a fairly good-sized closet but it was never intended 
               to be shared by two people, particularly not Jim and Muriel 
               Blandings. Assuming that they had started out on even terms, 
               it is now obviously Muriel, three-to-one. Her dresses, gowns, 
               slips, seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks, suit 
               or sports coat. Her shoes neatly line the floor and the shelf 
               above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes, in an 
               orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance.

               Groping blindly for a robe, Jim feels around and pulls one 
               out. As he slips into the arms, we see it's much too small 
               for him, obviously Muriel's. In disgust he attempts to put 
               it back. Unable to find a hook he finally jams it in between 
               two silk dresses which fall to the floor. As he bends down 
               and gropes for the dresses, he discovers his robe crumpled 
               under them on the floor. He drags the robe out and dons it, 
               leaving the dresses where they fell. With a guilty look at 
               Muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the bedroom 
               and into the narrow hall.

<b>               INT. THE HALL
</b>
               A narrow corridor extending the length of the apartment. Off 
               it are doors leading to the bathroom, the childrens' room 
               and the foyer.

               Jim shuffles down the hall. He stops at the closed bathroom 
               door, listens, hears the shower, knocks.

<b>                                     BETSY'S VOICE
</b>                         Okay, dad.

</b>                         Mm.

               Jim continues down the hall, stops at the closed door of the 
               children's room, knocks. No sound. He opens the door and 
               enters.

<b>               INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM
</b>
               A small room, crowded and cluttered up with the accoutrements 
               of adolescence. Joan, an eleven-year-old is asleep in one of 
               the twin beds. Jim automatically pulls the covers clear off 
               Joan's bed. She awakens, cocks an eye at him.

<b>                                     JOAN
</b>                         Okay, dad.

<b>                                     JIM
</b>                         Mm.

               As she sleepily stretches and prepares to rise, Jim exits 
               into the hall.

<b>               INT. THE HALL
</b>
               CAMERA FOLLOWS Jim through the foyer into the living room, 
               on through the very small combination dining and breakfast 
               nook and into the compact but tiny kitchen. Gussie, the 
               colored cook, greets him heartily.

<b>                                     GUSSIE
</b>                         'Morning, Mr. Blandings!

<b>                                     JIM
</b>                              (a feeble attempt at 
                              a smile)
                         Mm.

               Gussie takes a glass of hot water, squeezes in a little lemon, 
               stirs and hands it to Jim who gulps it down, makes a slight 
               face and pats his stomach. Gussie hands Jim a cup of black 
               coffee and he starts back toward the bedroom.

<b>               INT. THE HALL
</b>
               Gingerly balancing the cup and saucer, Jim approaches the 
               door to the children's room. With split-second timing, he 
               pauses as the door flies open and Joan, in her bathrobe, 
               towel in hand, rushes out and past him down the hall. She 
               disappears into the bathroom. Jim carefully proceeds down 
               the hall and, as he reaches the bathroom, deftly steps to 
               the left as the door bursts open and Betsy flies by on the 
               way back to her bedroom. All this is done with a timing and 
               shifting of hips of which Knute Rockne might have been proud. 
               Jim continues down the hall, enters the bedroom.

<b>               INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM
</b>
               Muriel is still asleep as Jim enters, walks over, nudges 
               her.

<b>                                     JIM
</b>                         Muriel.

<b>                                     MURIEL
</b>                         Mm?

<b>                                     JIM
</b>                         Coffee.

               Muriel awakens, sniffs the fresh coffee, smiles, sits up, 
               takes the cup.

<b>                                     MURIEL
</b>                         Thank you, dear.

               They kiss briefly. Muriel starts to sip the coffee as Jim 
               goes to his chest of drawers. It consists of several rows of 
               small drawers above and large drawers below. Jim ruffles 
               through a couple of small drawers, pulls out a suit of 
               underwear, continues noisily and with some annoyance to look 
               through the other drawers.

               He strides angrily to the closet, opens the door, reaches up 
               for the basket and pulls it off the shelf. As he does so, 
               all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket 
               from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor. About to 
               explode, he looks at Muriel.

                         I'll try, dear.

               Jim looks at her barely containing himself, and then puts 
               the hats back in the boxes, jams them back on the shelf where 
               they toter precariously. With bated breath he gingerly closes 
               the closet door. Pause. Silence. He picks up a pair of socks 
               and walks cautiously toward the hall door. Suddenly there is 
               a rumble and crash from inside the closet. Jim exchanges a 
               look with Muriel, is about to say something, changes his 
               mind, exits into the hall. Muriel looks at the closet, sighs, 
               takes another sip of coffee.

<b>               INT. THE HALL

               Jim opens the door of the bathroom. There is a scream. He 
               quickly closes the door, scowling with annoyance. A moment 
               later the door opens and Joan emerges, wrapping her robe 
               around her.

                         'Morning, dear.

               Joan disappears into her room as Jim enters the bathroom.

<b>               INT. THE BATHROOM
</b>
               Very small with a stall shower. Jim takes off his bathrobe, 
               yawns, gets on the scale, looks at the dial, shakes his head. 
               He takes a deep breath, draws in his stomach, looks down, 
               scowls, shrugs, gets off, moves to the mirror. He examines 
               the thinness of his hair, the condition of his tongue, etc. 
               Taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about 
               to use, frowns.

<b>               WHAT HE SEES - THE TOOTHPASTE TUBE
</b>
               WHAT HE SEES - the toothpaste tube. It has been squeezed in 
               the middle, one of Blandings' pet peeves.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - JIM METICULOUSLY SMOOTHES OUT THE TUBE
</b>
               CLOSE SHOT - Jim meticulously smoothes out the tube, rolls 
               up the used portion from the bottom. Then placing a small 
               amount on his brush, he caps the tube, and starts vigorously 
               to brush his teeth. As he does so, he attempts with his free 
               hand, to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he 
               opens.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - THE MEDICINE CABINET

               CLOSE SHOT - the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with 
               medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - JIM
</b>
               CLOSE SHOT - Jim. As he pushes the tube into the bulging top 
               shelf, a bottle of iodine falls out. Jim makes a desperate 
               one-handed catch, still brushing his teeth. As he pushes the 
               iodine into the second shelf, a small bottle of pills pops 
               out. Jim catches it, pushes it back into the cabinet. A bottle 
               of cough medicine falls out. He catches it, tries to put it 
               back, finds it won't fit. He looks at the bottle, sniffs it, 
               contemplates its value, throws it in the wastebasket. He 
               finishes washing his mouth, admires his teeth, disrobes and 
               steps into the shower, putting on his shower cap. He reacts, 
               scowls, takes off the cap and turns it upside down, a full 
               cup of water falling out. He reaches out for a towel, dries 
               the inside of the cap, carefully puts it back on his now wet 
               hair. Then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray 
               Jim Blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better. He 
               starts to sing, a robust bathroom baritone version of "Home 
               On The Range."

</b>
               Jim - He stands in front of the washstand lathering his face. 
               Over scene we hear Muriel's voice from the shower. She is 
               singing a lusty chorus of "Home On The Range." Jim picks up 
               his razor and turns to the mirror. He reacts with annoyance, 
               as he discovers it is covered with steam. With weary 
               resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror. 
               As he clears one section another clouds up. By the time he 
               gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs 
               freshening. He grimly relathers his face only to find that 
               the mirror is again clouded up. As he turns with exasperation 
               toward the shower we see Muriel turn off the water, reach 
               for a towel, start to dry herself.

               The mirror cleared off, Jim relathers, starts to shave. During 
               this, Muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes 
               into scene.

               She takes her toothbrush and then opens the cabinet to get 
               the paste. Jim, automatically following the mirror, has to 
               squeeze around in a desperately contorted position as he 
               continues shaving.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT - MURIEL

               CLOSE SHOT - Muriel. She takes the tube from the cabinet 
               and, squeezing the tube in the middle, applies the paste to 
               her brush.

<b>               JIM AND MURIEL
</b>
               Jim and Muriel - Placing the tube on the washstand, Muriel 
               closes the cabinet. Jim, still shaving, moves back to his 
               original position as he follows the mirror.

               Muriel nods, steps back, starts to brush her teeth. They 
               both hum "Home On The Range". Her mouth full, Muriel taps 
               Jim on the shoulder. Without stopping his shaving, Jim moves 
               to one side as Muriel rinses her mouth. She examines her 
               face in the mirror.

                         If you don't mind, dear.

               As he steps back in front of the mirror, Muriel continues to 
               look at her face in the glass, over his shoulder. She decides 
               she needs a little skin lotion.

               She again opens the cabinet. Jim once more follows the mirror 
               around, nicks his face, gives up, stands glaring arms folded. 
               Muriel takes the lotion from the cabinet.

               Muriel exits. Jim sighs, turns back to the mirror and with a 
               few deft strokes finishes shaving. As he reaches for the 
               water faucet, he encounters the tube of toothpaste, squeezed 
               in the middle. Reacting with annoyance, he meticulously 
               smoothes it out and rolls it up from the bottom. He opens 
               the cabinet and gingerly places the tube on the top shelf. 
               The iodine bottle pops out. He grimly catches it, studies 
               his problem, has a solution. With his right hand he starts 
               slowly to close the mirror door. Just before it closes, he 
               slips the bottle into the cabinet with his left hand, quickly 
               slamming the mirror door, trapping the bottle. He reacts 
               masterfully at his triumph, picks up his robe and starts for 
               the door. As he reaches it, there is the SOUND of the cabinet 
               opening and a crash as the bottle obviously hits the 
               washstand. As Jim winces,

               Funkhauser looks briefly for a high object over which to 
               display his last bolt of chintz, finds none, settles for 
               Jim's shoulder over which he drapes the cloth, the folds 
               flowing down in front. As Jim reacts:

                         do them?" And the answer was perfectly 
                         obvious. Very American, very grass 
                         roots, very blueberry pie -- that

               He angrily jerks open the hall closet door, pulls his hat 
               down from the shelf, several hat boxes, some ski boots and a 
               tennis racket tumbling down on his head. Jim jams his hat 
               onto his head, takes a deep breath and storms out, slamming 
               the door. Muriel walks over to the closet, is about to bend 
               down and pick up a hatbox when all of her pent-up emotions 
               explode. She kicks the hat box into the closet, slams the 
               door, starts to cry.

               Most prominent are advertisements for a meat product called 
               "Wham!" "A Whale of a Ham!" There is ample evidence of the 
               fact that Jim's most successful slogan is: "When you've got 
               the Whim - say 'Wham!'"

               Jim enters, goes to his desk, sits down, still emotionally 
               upset. He glances at a photograph of Muriel, looks guiltily 
               away, then back.

               Jim, Muriel and Mr. Smith - They are driving through a 
               beautiful Connecticut countryside. Mr. Smith, a local real 
               estate dealer, is of that shrewd Yankee breed which 
               specializes in the understatement, underselling school of 
               salesmanship.

                         That's Smith, the real estate 
                         salesman. Mighty shrewd cookie in a 
                         quiet sort of way. Never thought 
                         he'd get a bite this quick.

               Smith looks speculatively at the Blandings.

               Jim takes a deep breath, looks at Muriel as if to say, "Get 
               that air!" Muriel smiles with approval. Jim pats her hand 
               affectionately. Smith reacts.

                         Yes, sir, Smith, looks like you're 
                         finally going to unload the old

                         get 'em a little anxious.

               Jim slows down the car as they approach a rather picturesque-
               looking old Connecticut farmhouse. He and Muriel react with 
               approval, look questioningly at Smith. Smith shakes his head, 
               "no," as though to say, "Not nearly good enough for you."

               What they see -- Burrowed into the upward slope of the land

               overall condition of board and beam to be a trifle unsteady, 
               charge it up to age, which will be a hundred and seventy 
               years come next April. However, the overall effect is 
               definitely one of picturesque rustic beauty. In the back are 
               a series of barns and behind them the rolling hills known as 
               Bald Mountain.

<b>               JIM'S COST CHART

               INSERT JIM'S COST CHART - Rising diagonally and bisecting 
               the chart is a line graduated in scale starting at $5000 and 
               running up to around $17,000. Resting on the line at exactly 
               $10,000 is a miniature of the old house. Fluttering across 
               the scene from left to right is a letter from Smith on the 
               stationery of the Lansdale Realty Co.

               As we see the letter and hear the voice of Smith, miniature 
               figures of Smith and Hackett appear at the lower side of the 
               house. Their shoulders start pushing the house up the 
               graduated scale. Over this:

               A letter on Danton &amp; Bascomb's stationery flutters across 
               the screen from right to left. A miniature figure of Jim 
               appears above the house, desperately pushing it back. Over 
               this, we hear:

               As a succession of letters flutter across the screen, first 
               from left to right and then from right to left, and the house 
               is jockeyed back and forth, they are punctuated with the 
               following lines:

</b>                         "Dear Smith - !"

               Throughout this Smith's voice remains bland and unperturbed 
               while Jim's has the desperate, frenetic quality of a man 
               being slowly pushed to the wall.

               The Special Effect concludes with the house finally and firmly 
               at rest on the preordained $11,550. As the antagonists on 
               both sides of the house relax, Smith reaches around in front 
               of the house and shakes hands with Jim. It's a deal!

               About halfway through when the going gets tough, Jim beckons 
               Muriel to help in the losing fight. As they now embrace, 
               Smith and Hackett shake hands in mutual congratulation.

               They pause, turn, go through the bridge.

               As they drive through the dark interior of the bridge there 
               is an appropriate rattling and rumbling of the ancient 
               timbers.

<b>               EXT. THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
</b>
               There is another fork in the road. Muriel points to the road 
               to the right. Jim shakes his head, points to the road to the 
               left. Muriel points to the right. Jim emphatically shakes 
               his head, puts the car in gear, drives off on the road to 
               the left.

               Jim reacts with annoyance, mops his brow.

               right, as Muriel looks slightly triumphant.

               Jim, Muriel and Bill stand a little distance from the house, 
               looking at it. A vast lilac spreads across it. The Blandings 
               are in quiet rapture, and it is Bill who speaks first.

                         live and be so old, so can the house. 
                         It just needs someone to love it, 
                         that's all.

               Three shingles slide from the roof. As Jim and Muriel react:

                         and shingles start to fall off!

               As if on cue, a few more shingles slide off the roof, nearly 
               hitting Jim.

               As Jim opens the door and disappears, there is a crash,

               Near the front entrance. After a moment, the door opens, and 
               the Blandings and Mr. Apollonio emerge. Jim, limping, is 
               aided and abetted by a cane. Apollonio is a stolid, New York 
               construction man, replete with derby, blue serge suit, and 
               cigar. A short rule sticks out of a back pocket. As they 
               emerge, the Blandings are hopefully enthusiastic; Apollonio 
               is thoughtfully noncommittal.

               Apollonio casually walks over to the corner of the house, 
               kicks an exposed beam. It crumbles, apparently rotted by 
               termites. Two shingles fall off. The Blandings watch him 
               anxiously.

               As he thoughtfully rubs his chin, Jim, followed by Muriel, 
               limps his way over to him.

               Apollonio looks at the Blandings, at the house, then back at 
               the Blandings. He takes the cigar from his mouth.

               During this speech Apollonio picks up a wooden frame, squares 
               it with a pocket square, levels it on a fence, and looks 
               through it at the house.

<b>               INT. HENRY L. SIMMS' LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Jim, Muriel, Simms. The room is in quiet, good taste, a 
               flagstone fireplace, modern steel casement windows, window 
               seats, etc. The walls are crammed with books and photographs 
               of Simms' handiwork. There are a couple of gold medal 
               citations of his work conspicuously spaced around the room.

               Simms is a tweedy, pipe-smoking, conservative New Englander, 
               a distinguished-looking local architect. He puffs thoughtfully 
               on his pipe as he looks at a photograph of the old Hackett 
               place, an exact duplicate of the shot we saw through the 
               window frame.

</b>                         Of course you could fix up that old 
                         house. You can fix up any structure 
                         that's still standing. The sills and 
                         floors couldn't be worse, I grant 
                         you, and I guess you'd have to jack 
                         up that west corner at least three 
                         feet to make it level. Need new 
                         chimney. New roof. Complete new 
                         plumbing.
                              (sigh)
                         Too bad you didn't buy it ten years 
                         ago. Could have fixed it up in jig 
                         time then, and it would have made 
                         some sense.

                         would be less expensive to tear the 
                         old place down and build a new one, 
                         same size.

                              in, becomes attractive)

                              pleasant incredulity)
                         You mean... for the same money... we 
                         could build a brand new house?

               He turns and looks thoughtfully at Muriel who raises an 
               interested eyebrow. Then, to Simms:

                         you'd want would be something in 
                         quiet good taste, two story, frame 
                         and brick veneer construction -- 
                         modern, but of course fitting in 
                         with the architectural traditions of 
                         the countryside.

</b>                         Perhaps you'd like to see a basic

                              behind him)
                         -- something like this.

               Simms places the basic floor plan on the desk before him, 
               the Blandings moving around, flanking him. They examine the 
               plan with interest.

<b>               WHAT THEY SEE -- THE PLAN.

               What they see -- the plan. A simple master plan of a two 
               story house, the names of the various rooms indicated. As he 
               talks, we see Simms' hand, holding a pencil, point out the 
               various rooms

                         dining room, kitchen, service porch, 
                         maid's room -- upstairs three family 
                         bedrooms with two adjoining baths.

<b>               THREE SHOT. THE BLANDINGS PRAISE THE PLAN

               THREE SHOT. The Blandings praise the plan with the 
               uncompromising expertness of two people who have never seen 
               such a plan before in their lives.

                         well -- doesn't it seem just a little 
                         bit conventional?

               He starts off for the steam shovel, nimbly jumping over a

               Two workmen pass by carrying a few long pieces of lumber. 
               The workmen don't see the Blandings.

               As they enter the foyer, a carpenter appears.

               skeptically.

               After the sheerest pause there comes a shriek of nails 
               brutally withdrawn from timber, a loud splintering of wood 
               and then something of the appearance of entrails comes 
               hurtling down end over end landing with a dusty slap at Jim's 
               feet. The carpenter exits. Muriel gives Jim an accusing look.

                         It sounded less... expensive to say 
                         no.

               There is another loud screech and more "entrails" come 
               hurtling down, narrowly missing them. Muriel yells in the 
               direction from which they came.

               From upstairs comes a long, shrill whistle. Instantly all 
               sound of activity ceases and a voice is heard.

               As Muriel turns with apprehension, eighteen workmen come 
               trooping down the stairs.

                              (the workmen regard 
                              him curiously)
                         I mean, there's no point in walking 
                         off a job just because... a woman 
                         makes a silly little remark.

               As the workmen exit the Blandings look at each other a little 
               sheepishly, start up the stairs.

                         and on the inside everything's miles 
                         too small.

               As they reach the second floor landing, we hear, o.s. a steady 
               but muffled pounding.

               They stop as they hear the thumping.

                         It's coming from the closet!

               They rush to the closet, open the heavy oak door. Bill is 
               inside, leaning disgustedly against the wall.

</b>                         Impossible. I had this closet built 
                         especially for myself. The lock opens 
                         from the inside.

               As Bill starts to step out, Jim detains him.

               He steps inside with Bill, firmly closes the door. A moment's 
               pause. The door re-opens.

               The CAMERA REMAINS on the closed door.

               An efficient clockwise turn of the knob. Pause. An impatient 
               doubletwist of the knob. Pause. A more forceful rattling of 
               the knob, plus a slight kick. A furious rattling, pounding 
               and kicking. The door remains closed.

               Jim gives him a look, turns back to the window, sizing up an 
               escape, starts muttering to himself.

               As Bill somewhat skeptically complies, Jim picks up a piece

               Jim swings; the window shatters. Almost simultaneously there 
               is a click and the door to the closet swings open. As Jim

               and the others see that the erratic door has opened.

               Without a word, they stop, look at each other, turn and walk 
               back upstairs.

               Two moving vans are approaching the bridge. Behind them is 
               the Blandings' convertible. In it are Jim, Muriel and the 
               children. Behind it and attached is a trailer. After a pause,

               from the nursery are working on the landscaping. For the 
               first time we, as well as the Blandings, see the property as 
               a clean, bright and very attractive new house.

               floor. He looks up in complete dismay as he sees his newly 
               varnished floor being violated. After a couple of steps, Jim 
               stops, suddenly aware of the painter. The painter rises, 
               throws down his brush, says something caustic.

                         through varnishing that floor.

               Jim reacts, raises a tentative foot, the sticky varnish 
               practically holding it to the floor. Jim says something.

               The painter says something, points at Muriel. Jim looks darkly 
               and accusingly at Muriel whose weak smile is an admission of 
               guilt.

                         in.

               Jim turns and shouts something to the painter.

               Jim reacts, turns and walks back out of the foyer, desperately 
               trying to match his clearly outlined incoming footsteps. 
               Each step is outlined by strands of thick sticky varnish.

               his attention, indicate the front wall of the house which is 
               complete except for the windows. Jim reacts.

               out.

               But Jim has stepped on the papers. They stick to his feet. 
               After a few steps he is aware of it, tries to get rid of 
               them. After a few hectic but futile attempts, he disgustedly 
               disappears around a corner of the house, the newspapers

               A general flurry of activity; Gussie and several workmen 
               carrying furniture upstairs, unpacking barrels, etc. Muriel, 
               list and samples in hand, is explaining her color scheme to 
               Mr. PeDelford, a polite, cigar-smoking, noncommittal boss

               PeDelford's taciturn and somewhat skeptical-looking assistant.

                         Not quite as bluish as a robin's

               Muriel opens the closet door revealing Jim and Bill, who 
               have been locked in the closet for the last hour. Each leans 
               against the wall, arms folded, in an attitude of boredom and 
               disgust. Without a word Jim and Bill exit from the closet. 
               The three start down the stairs.

               It is dark outside and getting quite chilly. The children 
               are unpacking a last barrel. They have made a rather unsteady 
               pile of books and boxes, obviously Muriel's personal effects. 
               Jim is in the process of trying to start his first fire in 
               the fireplace. The immediate result is a clouding of the 
               room with smoke. As he backs away, coughing, he bumps into 
               the pile which falls to the floor spilling open a box which 
               contains, among other things, Muriel's diary and a lifetime 
               accumulation of sentimental trinkets.

               Betsy coughs her way to the fireplace, turns the flue handle. 
               The smoke immediately goes up the chimney and the room starts 
               to clear.

               The family, in overcoats, is huddled around the kitchen table 
               finishing dinner. Gussie, in overcoat and muffler, is clearing 
               the dishes away. Jim, a sober look on his face, rises, takes 
               a steaming kettle from the stove.

               Jim, in his pajamas and overcoat is shaving. After a few 
               moments Muriel, in her nightgown and overcoat, enters the 
               scene.

               She takes her toothbrush and opens the cabinet, Jim 
               automatically moving around back of it in their previously 
               established pattern. As Muriel puts the paste on her brush, 
               replaces the tube, shuts the cabinet and starts to brush her 
               teeth, Jim uncomfortably moves back to his original position.

               He picks up a pencil, nibbles on it thoughtfully. The silence 
               in the room is broken only by the patter of raindrops on the 
               window. It strikes a note in Jim's subconscious. He swivels 
               around in his chair and stares soberly out the window.

               Note: The house is painted and almost completely furnished.

               A hard rain beats on the windows. There is a blazing fire in 
               the fireplace. Muriel, in a warm bathrobe, sits near it, 
               comfortably knitting. In fact, the scene is exactly the one 
               Jim has just described, except that the man with slippers, 
               pipe and smoking jacket, reading the paper, is Bill Cole. 
               Near the fire, Bill's rain-drenched jacket, shirt and shoes 
               are hanging up to dry. The cozy tranquillity is broken by a 
               sharp RINGING of the front doorbell.

               The CAMERA FOLLOWS Bill to the front door. He opens it. A 
               man in raincoat and boots stands there in the pouring, driving 
               rain. The man enters as Bill struggles to get the door shut 
               against the wind.

               He sees Jones' doubtful look at the smoking jacket, feels an 
               explanation is necessary.

               Muriel walks into scene. Jones takes in the bathrobe, again 
               looks skeptically at Bill.

               The door is opened with a terrific swirl of wind and rain. 
               Jones exits as Muriel and Bill push the door against the 
               wind, finally getting it shut.

<b>               INT. JIM'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

               The CAMERA COMES IN ON a package of cigarettes. A finger 
               impatiently rips open what is left of the package, discloses 
               that it is empty. The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a tired, 
               disheveled Jim. Disgusted, he fishes the most likely butt 
               from a tray littered with them. With considerable difficulty 
               he manages to light it, only to burn his nose. Impatiently 
               stamping out the butt he rises, stretches, walks to the 
               window, pulls up the shade. Early morning sunlight floods 
               the room. He turns off a standing lamp, looks thoughtfully 
               out the window, suddenly gets an idea. Turning, he snaps his 
               fingers. Mary, who is asleep on the desk, her head resting 
               on her elbows, raises her head, opens a sleepy eye.

                              desperation in his

                         "Compare the price, compare the slice, 
                         Take our advice -- Buy Wham!"

               Mary critically shakes her head "no", closes her eye. Jim 
               wearily throws himself down on the couch, absently toys with 
               his already loosened tie. He pulls it up over his nose, 
               throwing the balance over the top of his head. Suddenly he 
               reacts, snaps his fingers. Mary opens a sleepy eye.

                         better oil, You'd better buy Boyle."

               Her eye closes. Jim sinks back with defeat, his hand dropping 
               over the edge of the couch. It encounters a crumpled piece 
               of paper, earlier work. He smoothes the paper, scans it, 
               kind of likes it. He gets up, comes over, snaps fingers. 
               Mary looks up.

               into the wastebasket.

               Mary looks at him sympathetically, doesn't quite know what 
               to say. As the CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the emotionally 
               distraught Jim, his eyes go to a large photograph on his 
               desk of Muriel and the children. He picks it up, looks at it 
               with affection. Suddenly he gets an idea. Rising with 
               determination he puts on his coat and starts for the door.

               It is an especially beautiful, sunshiny morning. A rural-

                         Hello, Simms, what brings you out 
                         with the morning dew?

                         blueprints. Some extras came in from 
                         Retch this morning and there're a 
                         couple of things I thought we ought 
                         to go over together.

                         Let's just take a look.

               As he unrolls the blueprints, Jim looks suspiciously at 
               Muriel. She seems a little nervous.

                         I haven't done anything! And what I 
                         did was... just nothing at all.

                              (rattling off)
                         All I did was one day I saw four 
                         pieces of flagstone left over from 
                         the porch that were just going to be 
                         thrown away because nobody wanted 
                         them and I asked Mr. Retch if he 
                         wouldn't just put them down on the 
                         floor of the flower sink and poke a 
                         little cement between the cracks and 
                         give me a nice stone floor where it 
                         might be wet with flowers and things. 
                         That was absolutely all I did.

               During the above speech Simms sinks into a chair, puts his 
               head in his hands and closes his eyes, a fact that isn't 
               lost on Jim.

</b>                         Absolutely. Just four little pieces 
                         of flagstone.

</b>                              (to Muriel; wearily)
                         Did you by any chance authorize a 
                         drain?

                         Of course I didn't. All I said was I 
                         wanted a nice stone floor and Mr. 
                         Retch was just as nice as could be 
                         and said, "You're the doctor," and 
                         that's all anybody ever said to 
                         anybody about anything.

               Jim takes a deep breath, turns to Simms.

</b>                              (sigh; plunging in)
                         All right, I think I can tell you 
                         what happened. First, the carpenters 
                         had to rip up the flooring that was 
                         already laid. Those planks run under 
                         the whole width of the pantry, so 
                         Retch had to knock the bottom out of 
                         the pantry wall to get at them.

               Jim and Muriel - Jim looks at Muriel as though he were 
               premeditating first-degree murder. She averts his gaze. Over 
               this:

</b>                         Then he had to chop out the tops of 
                         the joists under the flower sink 
                         space to make room for a cradle. I 
                         guess he bought some iron straps and 
                         fastened them to a big pan to give 
                         him something to hold the cement. 
                         What with that added load on the 
                         weakened joists, I'll bet he had to 
                         put a lally column down there for 
                         support, too.

                         there on wall brackets, so Retch had 
                         to get his plumbing man back to take 
                         out a section so he could get that 
                         cradle set. I guess that meant he 
                         had to change the pitch of the soil 
                         pipe from one end of the house to 
                         the other.

               in the pajamas and robe. A little shocked but unwilling to 
               believe the implication of what he sees, he looks to Muriel

                         joists right under that pantry. They 
                         go up to the wing bathroom on the 
                         second floor, and I'll bet my bottom

                         breakfast started.

               As Gussie exits, Muriel turns to Simms.

                              at Muriel)
                         You mean the children weren't here 
                         last night either?

                         think I'll just go up and slip into 
                         something a little more comfortable.

               Bill exits. Another pause. Simms, aware of the tension, wants 
               to get out of there.

                         the pantry wall and that meant getting 
                         a plasterer back. And of course, he

                         and see what you two have here -- I 
                         don't know.
                              (pause)
                         Maybe there are some things you should 
                         buy with your heart and not with 
                         your head. Maybe those are the things 
                         that really count... See you around.

               As Bill turns and leaves, the outer door is heard opening 
               and the kids appear. There is an exchange of "Hi's" as they 
               pass.

               THE CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to disclose Mr. James Blandings 
               reclining in a hammock on the patio of his Dream House. In 
               the b.g. Muriel is working at her garden, Joan and Betsy 
               assisting her. Jim reacts with pride and satisfaction as he 
               sets the magazine down, takes a long drink of lemonade and 
               picks up a book which he has been reading. As the CAMERA 
               COMES IN for an EXTREME CLOSE SHOT of Jim we see the title 
               of the book on the jacket cover. It reads:

<b>                          "MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE"

               Jim looks up over the top of the book, directly into the 
               camera and winks.
