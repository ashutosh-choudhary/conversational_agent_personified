<b>     FADE IN:
</b>
<b>     A WORN SATCHEL (MOVING - DAY)
</b><b>    
</b>     is being carried by a world weary middle European wearing a black 
     armband.  VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH exits a gleaming building, pausing 
     for a moment, under a motto clearly visible above his head, 
     <i>'Where the future is now'</i>.  He checks the time.

<b>     INSERT - WATCH
</b>
     set in <i>Countdown Mode.</i>  It's at 19 hours forty-seven minutes and 
     sixteen seconds and dropping, 19:37.15,  :14,  :13,  :12 etc.

     O.S. children are singing:

                <i>Ring a ring a rosy/a pocketful of posy/
                a tissue a tissue/we all fall down.</i>

     Nekhorvich looks to see children at play outside the adjacent 
     Natural History Museum.  They are moving in and around an odd
     freeform sculpture.

<b>     POV - SCULPTURE AND CHILDREN
</b>
     a blur where the sculpture seems to be distorting the children, 
     almost like mirrors in a fun house.

<b>     NEKHORVICH 
</b>
     wipes his eyes, a horn honks.  He looks toward the sound.

<b>     MOVING SHOT - SATCHEL (INT. AIRPORT SECURITY - DAY)
</b>
     on the belt that takes it thru X-Ray.  On the other side a guard 
     opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles, personal 
     items, books, a battleship gray digital camera and - in a small 
     plastic container marked 'S.G.' - a small, square shiny object, 
     hi-tech and at odds with the other items.  She pulls out an urn-
     shaped vessel.

<b>                                GUARD
</b>                What's this, then?

<b>                                NEKHORVICH 
</b>                        (handing her documents)
                The ashes of a colleague, I'm taking them
                to his family.  If you wish to open it,
                please be careful.

<b>     COMPUTERIZED SCREEN DISPLAY (INT. PLANE - MOVING - DAY)
</b>
     on the cabin wall displays a colorful map showing the flight 
     point of departure in Sydney, continuously updating distance, 
     direction and time to its ultimate destination, Atlanta, Georgia.

<b>                                CAPTAIN'S VOICE
</b>                - folks, we're a little over two and a 
                half hours from touchdown in Atlanta, but 
                if you look out your windows on either 
                side of the aircraft, we'll soon be 
                crossing the southern section of the Rocky 
                Mountains, a range which includes more 
                than 50 peaks rising above 14,000 feet.  
                The chain's loftiest point, Mount Elbert, 
                at 14, 433 feet should be coming into view 
                as we pass over central Colorado shortly..

<b>     NEKHORVICH (INT. CABIN - DAY)
</b>
     seems intent on the map, its changing times and distance.  He  
     checks his watch - the countdown has gone from 20 to three hours 
     and 32 minutes as Nekhorvich is mesmerized by the descending 
     seconds whipping by.

     ETHAN HUNT sits into shot on the vacant first class aisle seat 
     beside Nekhorvich.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                You keep staring at that watch as if your
                life depended on it, Doctor..

<b>                                NEKHORVICH 
</b>                Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be 
                with old friends.

<b>                                NEKHORVICH 
</b>                        (meaning Ethan)
                I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Sorry it couldn't be under happier 
                circumstances.

<b>                                NEKHORVICH 
</b>                Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm
                sorry..'
                        (bemused laughter, then looks at Ethan)
                - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.

     Nekhorvich is overcome.  Ethan puts a comforting hand on his  
     shoulder:

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                He was quite a man.  Did he know before 
                the end you two had succeeded?

<b>                                NEKHORVICH 
</b>                Yes, he knew.  Just..

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                ..not in time to save him.

<b>                                NEKHORVICH 
</b>                No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for 
                twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not 
                even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>

     Nekhorvich pats the satchel.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                You carry them together?  Safely?

     With an almost impish grin and a wink:

<b>                                NEKHORVICH 
</b>                Yes, and you'll get us to a safe place 
                with them, thank god!..left to my own 
                devices, I'm an old fart too inept to read 
                a railroad timetable!..

     Good-natured laughter.  Cut off by a flight steward who passes 
     by, giving a sidelong silence in Ethan and Nekhorvich's direction. 
     Oxygen masks suddenly deploy from the ceiling.  Passengers are 
     puzzled and alarmed.

<b>                                CAPTAIN'S VOICE
</b>                You Captain again.  We've experienced a 
                slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure..
<b>                
</b>     A passenger struggling with his mask.  As Nekhorvich fumbles with 
     the strap on his mask he notes that the display screen shows 
     their altitude is below 30,000 feet and dropping.  He checks the 
     countdown time on his watch again.  Nekhorvich looks around him.  
     The flight attendants are conspicuously absent and all the 
     passengers who have on oxygen masks are passed out.

<b>     INT - COCKPIT
</b>
     The flight crew now wearing their oxygen masks.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                        (into radio)
                Pan, pan, pan, Denver Center.  This is 
                Trans Pac Flight two-two-zero-seven, 747 
                heavy.  We are not reading you.  We're 
                unable to maintain cabin pressurization.  
                We have initiated a descent to one six
                thousand.

     The Co-pilot is working on the plane's altitude when his hands 
     slip off the controls.  His eyes flutter, then:

<b>                                CO-PILOT
</b>                Captain, I don't..can't..

     He passes out.  The Captain, HUGH STAMP, turns to verify that the
     relief pilot is also unconscious at the controls.

     He then removes his oxygen mask, sets the auto pilot, inputting 
     numbers to slow the plane and descend.  As the craft titles 
     downward...

<b>     INT - GALLERY
</b>
     The flight attendants are pulling on jump suits.  Stamp emerges
     from the cockpit.

<b>     INT - CABIN
</b>
     Ethan returns.  Nekhorvich beckons to him.  Ethan sits.  Grinning 
     around, Nekhorvich conspiratorially:

<b>                                NEKHORVICH
</b>                ..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                        (in the same tone)
                You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really 
                shouldn't.

     Nekhorvich's eyes narrow.

<b>                                NEKHORVICH
</b>                You're not Dmitri?

     With a lightning swift move Ethan breaks Nekhorvich's neck.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                - no.

     He grabs the satchel.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                        (to Wallis)
                Wallis, hold onto it.

     Wallis slashes the satchel handle open, takes the satchel for 
     Ambrose.  He peels off the latex mask, revealing SEAN AMBROSE.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                Ulrich, pull the -

     He tears off the vocal oscillator at his adam's apple, clears his 
     throat, now as Ambrose:

<b>                                AMBROSE
</b>                - pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..

<b>                                STAMP
</b>                        (the 'captain' into shot)
                All done, chief..

<b>                                AMBROSE
</b>                        (what else)
                - right -
                        (kidding)
                - don't go too far ahead of me now -

<b>                                STAMP
</b>                Not possible..

     Ulrich has rolled back the carpet over an access panel just 
     beneath them that leads to the belly of the plane.  Stamp pulls 
     back the panel, hops into the compartment below which is four 
     walls of electronic equipment.  Stamp kneels and slides back the 
     floor hatch.  The wind howls, puffs of cloud zip by beneath them.  
     As they descend into the belly:

<b>                                WALLIS
</b>                Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus 
                two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven-
                niner knots..

<b>                                AMBROSE
</b>                It's that time.  Go.

     They don goggles and, with Ambrose in the lead, 
     the team leaps, one after another from the hatch, sailing off
     into the sky.

<b>     INT - COCKPIT (DAY)						
</b>
     An automated voice repeats in an ominous monotone:

<b>                                VOICE
</b>                Terrain, terrain.  Pull up, pull up.

     The co-pilot stirs.  He blearily rouses himself just in time to 
     see:

     A mountain rushing toward him.  As mountain meets airplane, the 
     frame is filled with fire, but when camera pulls back from the 
     fireball, it is in fact no more than a match head filling frame, 
     which ignited, lights a fuse..

     The MI theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to:

<b>     EXT - FACE OF MOUNTAIN (DAY)
</b>
     For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the 
     plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle 
     widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from 
     than where he's going.  Aside from the fact that he's in the 
     midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at 
     least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of 
     a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below.  Ethan 
     climbs out of shot.

<b>     WIDE UP ANGLE (DAY)
</b>
     revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and 
     whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, 
     fluffy clouds overhead.

     Ethan into shot.  Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds 
     he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears 
     relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's 
     holiday.  It's leisurely danger for Ethan; one might almost 
     expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling 'Climb Every Mountain' on 
     the soundtrack.

     Then a rock he's been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six 
     inches before he grabs onto the mountain again.  As he hangs by 
     five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem 
     terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter.

     It's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close 
     just overhead, casting its shadow downward over Ethan.  
     Instinctively, Ethan flattens himself against the rock surface, 
     as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him.  But when 
     its rotors whir it into the distance Ethan relaxes and resumes his 
     climb.

<b>     A HAIRY OVERHANG (EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY)
</b>
     near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now 
     traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet 
     exposed to the earth far below.  He's clinging to the mountain 
     almost like a fly walking on the ceiling.  When he reaches for a 
     handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a 
     lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of 
     feet to oblivion.
<b>                                
</b><b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Whoaa..

     He pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang.

<b>     REVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT
</b>
     with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the 
     summit.  He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who 
     favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.  To 
     lizard:

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                You're welcome.

     The lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back 
     attracts his attention.  He turns to see the source of the 
     beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo 
     streamer.  Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now 
     ominously circling back.

     Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of 
     the copter.  With a distinct lack of enthusiasm.

     The helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears.  Ethan has 
     opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses.

<b>     ETHAN'S POV SUNGLASSES
</b>
     First, a retinal scan.

<b>                                ELECTRONIC VOICE
</b>                Identity confirmed.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Good morning, Mr. Hunt.

     Swanbeck's face flashes onscreen.  Over his introduction of Nyah 
     is a series of satellite photographs whose subject is so elusive 
     she never seems to give the camera a clean shot.

<b>                                SWANBECK'S VOICE
</b>                Your mission, should you choose to accept 
                it, requires you to recover a stolen item, 
                designated <i>Chimera.</i>  Essential to the 
                mission is the recruitment of a civilian -- 
                a Miss Nyah Nordoff-Hall.  She is a highly 
                capable professional thief currently 
                active in Spain.

     A series of Nyah's 'accomplishments', i.e., warrants, complaints, 
     Interpol summaries of her various criminal activities, as well as 
     glimpses of the elusive Nyah circulating about Seville.

                                SWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd)
                Her dossier's available on I-COM 3.  You 
                have 48 hours to recruit Ms. Nordoff-Hall 
                and meet me in Seville to receive further 
                details.  Should you or any member of your 
                IM force be caught or killed, the 
                Secretary will disavow all knowledge of 
                your actions.

     Swanbeck's face reappears on screen:

                                SWANBECK'S VOICE (cont'd)
                And Mr. Hunt - the next time you go on 
                vacation, please be good enough to let us 
                know where you're going.  This message will 
                self-destruct in five seconds.

     Ethan removes the glasses, then tosses them into space.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                If I let you know where I'm going -

     The glasses explode in a puff of smoke.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                - won't be on holiday.

     Ethan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps 
     off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal 
     snit.  Then, somewhere hundreds of feet below camera, there's a 
     little puff of color as the tulip-shaped chute pops out of his 
     back-pack.  Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries 
     of flamenco dancers.

<b>                                                        DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>     EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (EVE)
</b>
     Bustling in the activity of a large private party, with arriving 
     guests and attentive valets, as a young woman, her face unseen, 
     exits her car and enters the villa.

<b>     A FLASH OF SKIRT AND LACE (INT-EXT. VILLA - FLAMENCO DANCERS - EVE)
</b>
     where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands 
     wielding the castanets.  The dancers perform on a raised platform 
     and NYAH NORDOFF-HALL'S face can be glimpsed thru the swirling 
     skirts and pounding heels, looking thru, not at them.

<b>     REVERSE ANGLE - ETHAN
</b>
     looking back in a similar way to Nyah; surreal lighting and the 
     relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the 
     crowed party.  Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder 
     over her wanna-be escort, a very attentive gentleman.  Nyah 
     offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to 
     the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one 
     another.  Ethan approaches her.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Do you know me?

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                No.  Should I?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                No.  You just looked as if you did.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                No.  Just as if I'd like to.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                There's not enough time in the world for 
                any of it to be bad.

     This stops her.  Nyah moves closer to him, until they're nose 
     to nose.  Whispered but breezy:

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Look, it's either you or the rent and I 
                don't mind telling you it's not an easy 
                choice.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                What if I pay the rent?

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Uh-huh.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Uh-huh?

     Glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink 
     then:

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Go find the wealthy lady you came with and 
                next time we meet - I'll pay your rent. 
                        (kissing him, sweetly)
                Now bugger off.

     And purposeful creature that she is, she takes her frustrated 
     desire upstairs, timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of 
     the dancer's steps to cover her own.  Once upstairs, a security 
     guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her
     down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to 
     Ethan.  In a few moments, Nyah can be seen past the 
     windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following.  
     In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard 
     can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the 
     hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah.  Ethan smiles, moves out 
     of shot.

<b>     INT - MASTER BEDROOM (EVE)
</b>
     Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom.

<b>     INT - BATH (EVE)
</b>
     A decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored 
     walls.  The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler         
     chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of 
     ice.  Nyah can't resist.  She spoons a dollop of the caviar and 
     downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to 
     its back.  There, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff, 
     revealing an electronic density meter.  She turns it on and holds 
     it at the rear of the tub.  Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from 
     green thru yellow and into red.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                        (her fondest hopes confirmed)
                Mmmm.

     She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the 
     tiles just above the sop dish.  Her knee eyes search for any 
     cracks in the grout and she spots one.  Using a tweezers she 
     pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing 
     something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles.  
     She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish.

     There's the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble 
     casing out from the rear of the tub.  Nyah breathes a sigh of 
     relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself 
     looking down at an open safe, revealing some half-dozen locked 
     compartments.  As she studies them:

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Decisions, decisions.

     Nyah looks up to see Ethan's reflection in the bathroom 
     mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                What are you doing here?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Think you're the only one who can pick a 
                lock?

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                        (not altogether pleased)
                I see.  You're not just another pretty face..

     Before Ethan can answer, a voice can be heard coming from the 
     bedroom warbling Granada in Spanish, and with considerable gusto.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                Oh god.  A bloody baritone.

     Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethan's in the bathroom mirror.  
     She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the 
     tub, pulling him down on top of her.  Once again they're nose to 
     nose.
<b>                                
</b><b>                                ETHAN
</b>                I take it you prefer tenors.

     She glances up at the mirror.  In it is the reflection of SENOR 
     AUGUSTO DE L'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's 
     changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it.  He 
     breaks into a heavily accented version of 'Now or Never', and 
     disappears from the dressing room mirror.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Would you mind if I'm on top?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Oh, either way works for me.

     With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins 
     working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque 
     wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara 
     brush.  She glances down and is rather disconcerted.  Continues 
     working with the pick and wrench.

<b>                                ETHAN'S VOICE
</b>                You're never gonna find it there.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                        (she jumps, dropping the torque wrench)
                Damn it!  Find what?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                His ex-wife's Bulgari necklace that goes 
                up for auction Tuesday.

     Looking down to Ethan, a touch of indignation:

<b>     LOOKING UP
</b>
     more or less, hands locked behind his neck as he rests against 
     the raked back of the tub, his eyes and nose inches from Nyah's 
     lower pelvic region as she straddles him.  Not exactly in the mood 
     to move:

     She stiffens - he knows too damn much.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                - right..where is it?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Far right. 

     She immediately switches her efforts from top left to the
     bottom right compartment.  She's utterly nonplussed:

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Where's the bloody -

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                        (plucking it off his chest,
                        offering it up like a mechanic
                        under the chassis)
                - torque wrench.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                - this is very disconerting..

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm
                told.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                - right..

     She unstraddles him and, with a few deft moves with the torque
     wrench and carbide pick - and it's open.  She withdraws a velvet
     pouch and opens the pouch.  Out spills the spectacular necklace.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                Lovely.
                        (starting to close the safe)
                Who are you and what's it going to cost me?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                        (having sat up)
                I wouldn't do that.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Do what?

     The alarm goes off.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                That.

     The bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards, gun drawn
     Senor de l'Arena, looking highly upset, pops in.

<b>                                SENOR DE L'ARENA
</b>                Oh, Senor Keyes, thank God it is you!
                        (in Spanish to security guards,
                        annoyed)
                It's Senor Keyes, the security engineer.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Well, Senor de l'Arena the goods news is
                that the heat sensors were activated.   But
                Miss Nordoff-Hall, my associate -

     Senor de l'Arena kisses Nyah's hand.

<b>                                SENOR DE L'ARENA
</b>                Mucho gusto, senorita.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                - did feel that she had rather too long to
                work on the safe before they triggered the
                alarm, isn't that right Miss Hall?

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Oh yes.  Absolutely.  Much too long I
                should yes.

     Nyah's initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary,
     intensified curiosity - about Ethan.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Under the circumstances I think we would
                recommend re-setting the senors to
                respond to a lighter load.  How do you
                feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Indeed.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason 
                to disrupt your party any longer.  we have
                some further concerns about the disposition
                of your security guards, which you'll
                receive in our written report by fax in the
                morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?

     He offers Nyah his arm.  They start out.  Ethan immediately stops.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                Miss Hall. Haven't you forgotten
                something?

     Nyah looking genuinely puzzled.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                The necklace?

     Nyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering
     string of diamonds and rubies from her bust.

<b>                                SENOR DE L'ARENA
</b>                        (a great kidder)
                What are you trying to do, senorita?  Rob
                me.

     They all laugh, and Ethan's got her out the door.

<b>     EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (LATE NIGHT - PRE DAWN)
</b>
     The stars dimming, the sky a gun metal blue.  Ethan and Nyah
     emerge from the villa, walking slowly.  Nyah's clearly
     preoccupied.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                I'm missing something here, aside from a
                500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I
                botched the job, I could've walked out of 
                there with the bloody thing.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                At least you walked.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                If you weren't going to let me get away
                with it, why did you let me go thru with
                it?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Wanted to see how good you were.
                I'm hoping we might work together.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                May I say something, no offence?  You
                look like a gigolo, you sound like a 
                thief, you act like a cop - what the
                bloody hell do you have in mind?

<b>                                ETHAN

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                You didn't do that badly.

     Her car arrives.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                        (as she moves to her car)

                Not really.  I triggered the alarm..

     One foot on the floorboard she freezes, back to Ethan.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Hey, the Bulgari job last week was

     She slides behind the wheel.

                cheeky bastards who set me up on their
                territory so they can poach on mine.

     She takes off, spewing bits of gravel and dust in her wake.
     Ethan smiles and shakes his head.

<b>     ON THE ROAD - NYAH (MOVING)
</b>
     around curves, hair flying, she's free.  Her car phone rings.
     Perplexed, she lets it ring once or twice picks it up:

     She hits the End button and disconnects.  The phone immediately
     rings again.  She refuses to pick up.  Ethan pulls alongside hers.
     She looks at him.  They speak through the open cars.

<b>                                ETHAN

                I deserved that.

<b>     SERIES OF DRIVING SHOTS - NYAH AND ETHAN
</b>
     Ethan rings her again.  And keeps ringing.  Her face becomes
     grim, her flight progressively more desperate and with Ethan's
     pursuit progressively more determined.  They are reaching the
     limits of adhesion around blind curves.

<b>     MORE SHOTS DRIVING (DAWN)
</b>
     The sky's battleship gray; Ethan pursues Nyah around hairpin
     turns high above the Costa del Sol; they rip thru patches of
     marine fog drifting on the road, obscuring it.

     Both are appalled by the other's willingness to escalate risk in
     this game of flight and pursuit until Ethan tears thru a fogbank
     and sees on his GPS what Nyah can't see thru the fog - 
     less than four hundred meters ahead is a turn she can't possibly
     negotiate and if she can't she'll plunge off the road hundreds of
     feet to rock and sea below.  Ringing her number again:

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                        (half to himself)
                Slow down, slow down.

     She turns up a mound and loses control.  She spins out and heads
     toward the edge of the cliff.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                        (realizing she's in trouble)
                Uh-oh.

     Ethan cuts her off and sends them both into a 540 degree spin.
     Her car stops just at the cliff's edge.

     Furious she wrenches open the car door and gets out.

</b>                No!

     Suddenly there's no Nyah.  Ethan leaps over to Nyah's car and
     sees Nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet
     below, holding the door handle.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Oh..oh..

     Taking a firm grip on her wrist.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Don't look down.  Just..look at me.
                That's it..that's it..

     He pulls Nyah up to the car, across the seat and half into
     his arms.  For a long moment it looks like she's in shock.  Then:
<b>        
</b><b>                                NYAH
</b>                What's you name?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Ethan Hunt.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to
                talk to me about?

     Thru the veil of morning fog, Nyah looks at Ethan.  Her dark eyes
     suggest wit, and willingness, and longing.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                ...more than I thought..

</b>     They scarcely to move to bring their lips together:

</b>                Awfully short notice..

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Care to wait a decent interval?

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Who wants to be decent?..

<b>     DISSOLVE:

<b>     CLOSE - ETHAN (INT-EXT. SAFEHOUSE - SEVILLE - DAY-EVE)
</b>
     sleeping.  His eyes open slowly.  He comes to full consciousness,
     his head still on the pillow.  Something approaching serious
     anxiety informs his features.  He lifts his head and looks at his
     left, angle widening.  Nyah lies on her side facing him,        
     sleeping serenely.  Anxiety on the order of oh-God-this-isn't-
     approved-recruiting-technique, confirmed.  He lets his head flop
     back on the pillow.  Then he turns so he and Nyah are profile to-
     profile.  As he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades, replaced
     by curiosity and even wonder.  He lifts his hand and just
     brushes her cheek.  Her eyes open.  She knows where she is.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                So what've you got against spooks?

     Nyah smiles.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                When they've got your recruiting
                technique?  Not a thing.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                They've got a book for this?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                They've got a book for everything.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                The only other spook I knew was a liar.
                Charming but absolutely incapable of
                telling the truth.  He'd lie about his
                favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an
                occupational hazard.  All spies really do
                is conceal the truth and tell lies.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Not revealing information doesn't
                necessarily make someone a liar.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                That's not the point.  In the end what
                spies rely on is the one thing they think
                they know that you don't.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Which is?

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                That they're lying.

     Ethan laughs.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                ..once they know that they can
                get very very..crosee..

     Nyah shoulder and moves into Ethan.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                So where did I got right?

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully
                good one..
                        (then)
                ..this thing these blokes pinched..

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                I don't know that they 'pinched' it.
                Don't even know that they're blokes.

     Nyah stops to think about this.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume
                I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to
                catch-a-thief..

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                So do I.  Sort of.

     Nyah looks at Ethan, a little worried.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Of what?

     Nyah laughs.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Ask a question, you get an answer!..

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Damn, you're beautiful.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                That's because I'm on my back.

     Quick as a cat Ethan flips Nyah over so she's looking down
     at him.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                I don't think so.

     She sinks into his arms.

<b>     EXT-INT - STREET - SEVILLE (VALENCIA FESTIVAL) (EVE)
</b>
     Ethan's step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along, making his
     way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the <i>Crema</i>
     portion of the <i>Fallas de Valencia.</i>  On this night great papier
     mache effigies, some serious, some comic, are placed all thru the
     city and torched in great bonfires.  Outside the bar Ethan's
     looking for there's a street vendor, hawking Fallas mementos and
     flowers.  He starts past the vendor, and it hits him - he's going 
     to buy some flowers.

     He chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be
     seen on the petals.  Ethan pays the vendor, starts into the bar,
     and thinks better of walking into Swanbeck with the bouquet.
     Turns back to the vendor.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Are you gonna be here a while?

<b>                                VENDOR
</b>                Si, senor.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                I'll pick'em up on my way out, okay?

     Ethan enter the bar and goes upstairs to the second floor where
     he passes security at a pair of double doors.

<b>     INT - IMF BRIEFING ROOM
</b>
     Swanbeck stands looking out the window.  Noisy crowds from the
     festival provides a constant walla, and during the sequence, the
     first effigies are lit, and smoke and flame provide a vivid
     background thru briefing room's window.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Fetival's a pain in the ass.  Honoring

                        (turning to Ethan)
                Sit down, sit down.

     Ethan sits.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                Let's you know what they think of saints,
                doesn't it?  Damn near set me on fire on
                my way over here.  As if I haven't been
                burned enough today.

     A moment where it's impossible to tell which way the wind is
     going to blow between these two.  Then civilly:

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                Sorry I barged in on your vacation.

<b>                                ETHAN

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Why did you phrase it like that?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Like what?

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                You gotta be kidding.

     Swanbeck turns to his computer and begins play on a DVD, and
     projected onto a computer screen staring back at Ethan is:

<b>     VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH
</b>
<b>                                NEKHORVICH
</b>                        (with exaggerate brio)
                Well, Dmitri!  How are you?..

     Nekhorvich pauses as if waiting for reply.  Ethan smiles.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                ..I'm fine..and you?

<b>                                NEKHORVICH
</b>                I'm fine..

     Ethan laughs.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                I'm fine and you're fine..

     With Ethan simultaneously whispering:

<b>                                NEKHORVICH
</b>                I'm fine too.. I'm fine and you're fine - do
                you remember, dear fried, how you got
                Sergei and I to repeat those lines from Dr.
                Strangelove and we gave you the name of that 
                silly Soviet Premier because we didn't know
                your name?..In those days, you not only
                saved our lives, you saved our sanity.  'Now,
                then Dmitri - we have this little problem':
                Every search for a hero must begin with
                something that every hero requires; a 
                villain.  Therefore, in a search for our
                hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster
                Chimera.  I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney
                and accompany me to Atlanta immediately.
                However we travel, I must arrive at me
                destination, within 20 hours of departure.
                Forgive this fanciful explanation, but for
                now prudence dictates that I communicate
                nothing but the gravest urgency.
                I fear I can entrust this to no one but
                you, Dmitri.  as we say, 'I'm sorry and
                you're sorry'..

     Swanbeck stops the DVD.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Let me ask you something.  You have any
                idea what the hell he's talking about?

     Ethan smiles.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                An idea, yeah.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Like?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a
                hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a
                commercial carrier.  So let's get on with
                it.  He's still in Sydney?

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his
                colleague, Gradski, but that happened
                earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight
                from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..

     Ethan sits back, heavily.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                - Hunt, are you listening?..

     Slowly looking up:

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                If he didn't want to go anywhere without
                me, how did you get him on the flight?

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                You were there.

     Swanbeck clears his throat.  He turns back to the computer and 
     punches in: <i>MISSION DOUBLE IMAGE.</i>  File open to computer scans
     of AMBROSE, SEAN, and HUNT, ETHAN, the computer scanning and
     comparing their features, millimeter by millimeter, stat by stat,
     as the computer then imposes, with the help of the physiognomy
     scan, Ethan's face on Ambrose: hence, mission double image.

<b>     ETHAN
</b>
     slowly looks up at Swanbeck.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                When I couldn't find you, I had to replace
                you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.
                He double you, what?  Two, three times?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Twice.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                What did you think of him?

<b>                                ETHAN 
</b>                You know we had reservations about each
                other.  Isn't it a little late in the day
                to be asking me that?

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Not necessarily.

     Swanbeck shows Ethan a photo of airline Captain.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Airline record list Captain Harold
                Macintosh as the pilot for Flt 2207.  as
                far as the media and all governmental
                agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh
                died on the flight, but in fact he missed
                it.  He did, however make the next flight -
                in cargo, stuffed into a rather small 
                suitcase considering his size.

     Another photo of an open suitcase, the body in it partially
     obscured by a ring of police and customs officers.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                Someone on that flight planned an
                operation designed to down the plane and
                make it look like an accident.  Someone
                skillful enough to bring the whole thing
                off without a hitch but - they don't
                always get your luggage on the plane, even
                when you fly first class.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                So there's one thing we know Ambrose
                doesn't.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Then you do think it was Ambrose.

     Ethan barely nods.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                And you're not surprised.

     Ethan gives Swanbeck a look.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean
                wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact
                that he took it.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred
                innocent passengers?

     Ethan smiles.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless
                he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                The question is why?  What was this
                Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?

     Ethan rises and moves to the window.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Right now only Ambrose knows that.

                which he took very seriously.  She walked
                away and he's wanting her back ever

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the 
                wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking
                her to resume a prior relationship, not do

     He pulls out a little Minolta digital camera (identical to the
     one in Nekhorvich's bag at airport security).  Swanbeck sets it on
     the table.  Ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye.

     The vendor holds up the spring bouquet.  Ethan seems genuinely
     surprised by them.

     lights low, flamenco music playing, and when she walks out onto
     the balcony Ethan sees the candlelit table and a bottle of

     The tide is too low for the boat to dock, making it necessary for

     end of the dock and onto the beach.

     sand - the boatman grumbles he can't get any closer.  The slender
     figure has moved to the shoreline and the angle of the light
     changes - Ambrose is waiting.

     Nyah hesitates only a flicker of an instant, slips over the side
     into thigh-high water without taking her eyes off Ambrose.
     Ambrose strides right on into the bay.  as they are just an arm's
     length apart:

     this last photo on the table on top the others.  He picks up
     Nekhorvich's digital camera, removes the film disk, and snaps it
     into its plastic case. He places the case into an envelope
     (NOTE: The same envelope seen at the track) and hands it to

     As he speaks, Ambrose pulls a cigar case and a cutter out of his
     robe.  Takes a cigar out of the case and clips the end of the
     cigar; the razor-sharp cutter decapitates the tip of the cigar 
     like a guillotine.

     Sean touches the nail of Stamp's left pinkie finger.  Stamp
     reacts by slightly withdrawing his hand.

                Or don't you think I can learn more from
                her than she can from me?

     Ambrose twists Stamp's wrist so that Stamp drops to one knee
     trying to alleviate the pain.

     around Stamp's pinkie.

     Ambrose closes the cutter on Stamp's finger and cuts the nail,
     just nicking the top of the finger and drawing blood.  Stamp
     cries out.  Ambrose tosses Stamp a napkin, light his cigar and
     exhale.

                Hold on.

     Ambrose grabs her arm, and she almost drops the envelope she's
     just lifted.  (NOTE: It is important not to see her actually lift
     it).  She's holding it, pinned between her right arm and side.  As
     it's slipping, she notes Stamp above her, looking down and has to
     conceal what she's holding from him as well:

     She takes it and as she does the envelope falls, but she manages
     to catch it with her left hand, blocking the move with her body
     as she does.

     Luther bursts out of the van, carrying the tiny camera and begins
     to thread his way thru cars and foot traffic.

</b>
     in dramatic contrast ambles at a conspicuously leisurely pace.

<b>     NYAH
</b>
     passes Stamp, not seeing him standing just a row above, blocked
     from her by one of the pillars.  Stamp idly regards her and then 
     decides: he follows.

<b>     LUTHER
</b>
     perspiring, approaches the betting table thru the last of the
     parked cars.

<b>     STAMP
</b>
     approaches the door thru which Nyah had gone and starts to open
     it - only to have the door slammed in his face and on his
     bandaged finger by Billy, in a track usher's uniforms.

                Sorry about that, mate, that must've
                really - aggrhh!..

     Even as Stamp winces in pain his arm has shot out and Billy finds
     himself pinned to the wall gasping for air.  If he'd been welded
     there by a band of steal he'd have more room to maneuver.

     Stamp looks around, Nyah's nowhere in sight.  He's lost her.  Sees
     his hand's bleeding and lets Billy go, who nearly drops to the 
     floor.

     Nyah turns and looks Ethan dead in the eye.

     She slips Ethan the envelope.  Ethan himself returns the look,
     holding it in spite of:

</b>                Stamp's out of the loo.

     Luther arrives, with the camera, opening for Ethan.  Nyah turns
     away.  Ethan pulls out the tiny memory card, slips it in the 
     camera.

     A sweaty Luther:

<b>                                LUTHER 
</b>                I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.

<b>                                BILLY'S VOICE
</b>                He's heading down the stairs, now..

     Ethan places the digital camera on play and begins to go thru the
     stills.  As they cliff off, Ethan is visibly affected.

<b>     LUTHER IN THE VAN
</b>
     watches the stills as well.  He's no less affected.

<b>     ETHAN WITH NYAH
</b>
     He mutters some expletive under his breath, then, evenly:

</b>                I want you out of Ambrose's place.

</b>                He's one tier from the bottom.

     Ethan glances over to the bottom of the stairs.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                What are you talking about?

     As he lowers camera and removes the memory card.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                I want <i>you out of there.</i>

     Slipping card back into envelope.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even

     Ethan's been talking to someone he's been urging to walk, not run
     to the nearest exit.  Now he drops all pretence:

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                I want you out of Australia!

                ..I don't know how much more plainly I can
                put it.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                How do you suggest I go about it?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                He's touched your heart.  You're
                overwhelmed.  You need to think it over.
                You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If
                You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in
                and getting you out.  Give me the ear
                piece.

     She just gets it out of her hear and gives it to Ethan when she
     reaches the bookie who warns her to get down her bet.  She gives
     him her money and gets the tickets just as the buzzer goes off -
     no more bets.  Flustered by it she picks up her tickets but drops 
     the envelope.  She quickly kneels and scrambles to recover it,
     tucking it away and looking up - to see Stamp standing over her.
     almost exactly where Ethan had stood when she looked away.

<b>     NYAH
</b>
     tries not to register alarm while she gauges how much Stamp had
     seen.

<b>                                STAMP
</b>                Get your bet down?

<b>                                NYAH

     She rises.  Stamp waits only a moment then follows.

<b>     AT THE PRIVATE BLEACHERS (DAY)
</b>
     everyone's on their feet, the horses are in the backstretch.

     Ambrose is watching the race through binoculars.  Nyah comes up 
     behind and puts her arms around him.  With her left hand she puts
     the envelope into his right jacket pocket.

                Bloody hell, Nyah!

     She's momentarily startled.  Then:

     01.27.99, the time in the right, 10:02:56 A.M.  Burned into the
     photo is '20 hours, 03 minutes after exposure.'

     Ethan paunches in.

                Twenty hours.

     Ethan doesn't say anything for a moment, then goes on to the next
     photo on the card: '25 hours, 40 minutes after exposure.'  It's
     Gradski again.  Gradski's eyes are darkly circled, his skull look 
     mottled.

     bleeding from nose, mouth and ears, the skin eruptions are
     pervasive, his body an open wound.

     body at rest.

     The victim's face shows a devastation undeniably like Gradski's.

     A long, long moment as Ethan, Luther, and Billy sit in silence.

     Ambrose enters, slips off his jacket and hangs it over a chair.
     He walks to a desk and brings up a computer the Biocyte website

<b>                                MCCLOY

     one pale yellow, one sunset red.  Behind them are monitors marked,

     VIRUS.  Behind these is a monitor screen with a blow-up of the
     contents of the vials &amp; the magnitude of the blow-up - 950,000x.

     These are X-Ray microscope blow-ups, i.e., allowing the viewer to
     see the motility of the virus and its metabolism, not dissimilar
     to an MRI this of Chimera in its three different cultures..

     temperature to a hundred.  The effect on the greenish hue in
     the bottle is subtle but immediate - not so subtle is the
     effect on the virus seeds viewed microscopically - they
     immediately appear agitated, their microscopic DNA innards
     contracting and expanding.

     Ethan fires the second injection gun.  Picks up the third and
     last.  He pauses as he's about to fire it, staring intently
     suddenly the gun is held by:

<b>     NEKHORVICH

     who turns the barrel from the hyper-thermal chamber and releases        
     into his wrist.

     whose vision of of Nekhorvich fades.  Still thinking of Nekhorvich he
     continues to stare at the gun for another moment and before he can fire:

     The bomb's LED readout shows 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.. As it reaches 0

     looks up just in time to see Ambrose and team arrive at the far 
     end of the lab.  They immediately open fire, shattering the
     room's walls and the glass injection gun chamber.  As the
     injection gun begins falling to the lab floor below, one of
     Ambrose's team runs to grab it, but before he can reach it he is
     shot by Ethan, who's falling to the floor below.

                Get it.

     As Ethan hits and dives for cover, Ulrich goes for the gun
     Ethan shoots Ulrich in the leg.  Ulrich hops back in pain.

     Ethan's crouching on the ground protected behind a series of
     vertical metal sheets.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                And you couldn't walk to tell me about it.

     Ethan moves to pick up the injection gun which lies in the
     shattered glass on the floor.  Ambrose, Wallis, and a couple of
     other Ambrose team members fire, kicking up broken glass.  Ethan
     backs off.

</b>                I would've thought the hardest part was
                exercising restraint.  Curbing that
                pressing need of your to get your gun 
                off.  You were in such a hurry to knock
                off that 747, you never figured out where
                the virus really was.

<b>                                AMBROSE
</b>                I knew where it was.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Oh.  then you knew the only way 
                could smuggle the live virus to the CDC
                scientists in Atlanta was by injecting
                himself and using his own bloodstream as a 
                Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty
                hours so he could take the anti-virus and
                still have it be effective.  You knew that
                while you were knocking him off and
                destroying the very thing you came for.

     Ethan has been using this exchange to ease a fresh seventeen
     round clip into his weapon and he punctuates this last with a
     spray of gunfire, attempting to cover his own effort to the reach
     the injection gun.  The return fire nearly hits the injection
     gun, kicking up glass and dust and making it move around on the
     floor.

<b>                                AMBROSE

                gun and you'll spray the bloody virus all
                over the place!

     Everybody's regained cover but the injection gun remains out of
     everybody's reach.

                opportunity to have both the bug and the

     Nyah walks out into view on her own.  Ethan sees her reflection in
     the mirror.  Enraged, but trying to control it.

<b>                                ETHAN

     Finger on the injection trigger, she rises and turns the barrel
     on her arm, firing.  The sound of the air pressure pushing the
     virus into her is unmistakable, as is the circle of tiny puncture
     wounds on her skin.  Nyah moves in front of Ethan, covering him,
     as she turns to face Ambrose.

<b>     ETHAN
</b>
     shocked by Nyah's gesture but as she addresses Ambrose he
     resets the 'Countdown' on his chronometer to twenty hours.  As
     it drops into the nineteen:

     fingers press a red button on a tiny detonator.  There's a bright
     heat flash from the hot zone and an explosion of gas and water --
     the plastique killing any airborne virus.

     Ethan uses the diversion to grab Nyah and run with her to the far
     side of the lab, behind a stock of horizontal cylinders.

     once in the open, he exchanges direct gunfire with Ambrose's
     team, wounding a couple men.  He reaches the wall and dives thru,
     camera with him as he drops 25 stories, the sound of gunfire in

     Ethan pulls a can of explosive material form his pack.  He
     rolls it towards the double doors, and it stops just before

     fires into the air.

     he stops.  As he turn, Ethan Lowers himself from a hiding place
     in the ceiling.  Stamp and Ethan pull their guns on one another.
     They're in a face-off until they both agree to drop their guns,
     but Stamp catches his in mid-air and points it back at Ethan.

     As Ethan raises his hands, he pulls the pin on a grenade and then
     kicks it between Stamp's legs.  The handle flies off:  It's live.
     When Stamp looks down in surprise at the grenade, Ethan kicks out
     his gun.

     Trying to escape the grenade, Stamp smashes into Ethan and seems
     to have hit him in the jaw.  Both hit the ground as the grenade
     explodes, with Stamp appearing to have the upper hand.

                Hunt.  whatever you've got to say, say it
                now.

     Ethan indeed makes some considerable effort to speak but can only
     manage a few guttural, progressively desperate sounds which
     continue as:
<b>

                No?  Well, then.  This is what's known as
                getting your gun off.

     With that Ambrose empties thirty four rounds from the two
     Berettas into Ethan whose body jerks crazily on the floor.
     McCloy nearly faints, and Ambrose laughs at his squeamishness
     until something on Ethan's body catches his eye: the top of the
     little finger on the right hand is bleeding.  Ambrose grabs
     Ethan's face, and rips off a latex mask: revealing Stamp, eyes
     wide open and thoroughly lifeless.  His jaw, under the mask had
     been taped carefully close with the same heavy tape Ethan has
     used to mount the drain-pipe shotgun on the tunnel wall.

                                AMBROSE (cont'd)
                Bloody hell!

     He looks around, but Stamp is gone.  So is the cannister and
     kevlar vest that had been on the table moments before.

     Ethan's on the motorcycle, heading toward the gates, which a pair
     of security guards are frantically trying to close.

     Billy and Luther in the copter are over the island, and bank so
     Luther can fire a grenade launcher and blow the back of Ambrose's
     boat.

     The guards close the gate, Ethan runs the motorcycle up the
     hillock and jumps the gate, over onto the bridge.  Ambrose follows
     in the SUV, crashing thru the gate.

     They race across the bridge and the road, onto the huge
     greensward opposite to and similar in shape to Bare Island.
     There, with the helicopter hovering, Ambrose manages to corner
     Ethan and after they expend whatever ammunition their weapons
     hold, they move into each other bare handed and engage in
     ferocious, no-holds-barred combat, the helicopter hovering low
     enough to keep away whatever's left of Ambrose's henchmen, the
     chopper's downdraft hitting them and flattening the grass around
     them.  Ethan prevails.

<b>                                BILLY
</b>                There she is.  I got visual.

<b>                                LUTHER
</b>                We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..

<b>     HIGH ANGLE - NORTH HEAD
</b>
     moving up behind Nyah who is walking purposefully to the edge of
     the bluff and a precipitous drop to rocks and surf a hundred and 
     fifty feet below.

     Camera drops to Nyah's shoulder level and moves with her to the
     bluff's edge.  As she's just a few steps away from stepping
     off, there's a roar and the helicopter rises into the shot,
     before her wild-eyed Billy gesturing, 'Stop!  Stop!' to Nyah.

<b>     EXT - ROADWAY
</b>
     Ethan passes narrowly between a car and oncoming truck.  Ambrose
     follows as soon as the truck clears.  Ethan fires backward using 
     his side-view mirror to aim, exploding Ambrose's windscreen.
     Ambrose skids until his wheel clips a rock, knocking him upright.

     Ethan turns into a side road and speeds through open scrub.  Back
     on the main road, Ambrose roars off to intercept Ethan.

<b>     EXT - CLIFFTOP - ROCK LEDGE
</b>
     On a clifftop clearing, Ethan races along as Ambrose moves to cut
     him off.  They head toward one another.

<b>                                LUTHER'S VOICE
</b>                Ethan, we've got her.  Tracking to you now.
                We're reading 5 minutes 19 seconds.

<b>     EXT - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING
</b>
     Ethan and Ambrose round a bend and face one another.  Without
     hesitating, they charge towards each other.  As they near one
     another, each leaps forward and off his bike, and they collide
     hard in mid-air.  They fall to the ground fighting as their bikes
     skid and Ethan's explodes, raining debris upon them.

     Ethan and Ambrose rush towards one another.  Ethan flips Ambrose
     to the ground.  Ambrose pulls a gun from his ankle holster.  As
     Ethan knocks it away, he loses his own gun and they both fall off
     a 30-foot cliff.

<b>     INT - IMF HELICOPTER
</b>
     at top speed over Sydney.  Nyah appears weak and shivers.

<b>                                LUTHER
</b>                        (to Billy)
                Bearing two one zero.  About 3 klicks.
                        (into microphone)
                Ethan, we're moments away..

<b>     EXT - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING - FIGHT
</b>
     Ethan and Ambrose rise from the fall.  Ethan jumps up and sweeps
     Ambrose, dropping him to the ground.  Ethan begins strangling
     Ambrose but gets knocked off, and when they both stand, Ambrose
     gets Ethan in a choke hold.

     Ambrose hits him and grabs a rock and hits Ethan in the
     midsection and the face.  Ethan kicks it out of his hand and
     connects with several punches, knocking Ambrose to the ground.

     Kneeling, Ambrose pulls a knife from a boot holster and cuts
     Ethan across the back and face.  Ambrose dives on Ethan and the
     knife is poised above Ethan's eye before Ethan grabs the knife
     and clears, holding it out toward Ambrose.

<b>                                AMBROSE
</b>                Go ahead.  Use it Hunt.  It's not a bad
                way to go.  A lot better than the way that
                bitch is going to die.

     Ambrose swings again and misses, and Ethan delivers a series of
     kicks, leaving Ambrose stunned and barely standing.  Ethan steps
     back, and with a running start, strikes Ambrose with a leaping
     kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his
     hand.

<b>     EXT/INT - IMF HELICOPTER - CLIFFTOP
</b>
     As they approach in the distance, Billy, Luther and Nyah finally
     gain sight of Ethan in hand-to-hand combat.

<b>     EXT - CLIFFTOP - CLEARING - FIGHT
</b>
     Ethan turns and walks away from Ambrose toward the cliff edge.
     The copter lands and Luther runs toward Ethan but pulls up,
     looking over Ethan's shoulder.  Ambrose has a gun aimed at        
     Ethan's back.

<b>                                AMBROSE
</b>                Hunt.  You should have killed me.

     Near Hunt's feet is his own gun, obscured from Ambrose's view by
     dust from the copter.  Ethan tosses the canister to Luther and
     then kicks his gun up out of the dirt and into the air.  He
     catches it, drops down and fires, killing Ambrose.

<b>     EXT/ INT - HELICOPTER ON CLIFFTOP
</b>
     Ethan reaches Nyah at the copter.  Inches apart, they can only
     stare silently at one another.

<b>     INT - CULTURAL MUSEUM
</b>
     Didgeridoo music.  A child admires a painting.  Swanbeck and Ethan
     face one another.  A long, long pause.  For a moment it appears as
     if Swanbeck has lost awareness of Ethan's presence.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to
                begin.  Any suggestions?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                You'd like me to conduct my own
                debriefing.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Why not?  You've done just about
                everything else on this operation.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was
                a compliment.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations
                requires the level of disinformation that
                yours do, is bound to get a little flak
                here and there.  You try flogging the
                stories on CNN I've had to come up with
                about what's been going on around here the
                last few days.  At any rate, it's been
                most instructive -- what they'll swallow,
                or what they'll broadcast with a straight
                face.
                        (picking up a file)
                Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has
                absolutely no elements of the Chimera
                virus.  Not even antibodies.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Yes, I gathered as much.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                And the only other remaining sample was in
                the canister you recover from Ambrose.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Yes.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                And that appears to have been destroyed.
                It also contained the anti-virus,
                Bellerophon.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only
                really effective against Chimera.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                But you were under specific instructions
                to bring back a living sample of the
                Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to
                know how, after you'd managed its recovery
                intact, it subsequently got destroyed.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                By fire.  That's the best way, really.


<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                So you didn't fail mission, you simply
                changed it.

     Ethan doesn't respond.

                                SWANBECK (cont'd)
                It's no longer enough for you to execute
                and implement IMF policy, you now wish to
                go in the business of creating it?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                No, I don't.  But in this case -

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In
                face, it was a pretty damn good idea.
                Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for
                Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her
                criminal records will certainly be
                expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                I do.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Where is she now, by the way?  Do you
                know?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                I don't.  No exactly.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Well, Hunt, what are your plans?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll
                let you know where I'm going.

<b>                                SWANBECK
</b>                Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't 
                be a vacation if you did.

     Ethan and Swanbeck exchange one final, knowing glance.

<b>                                SKY NEWSCASTER
</b>                This incident in the wake of rumors
                suddenly surfacing about Mr. McCloy and 
                Biocyte's financial difficulties --
                including criminal allegations of insider 
                trading, embezzlement, conspiracy to
                commit fraud, and stock parking -- have,
                understandably, sent stock prices of the
                pharmaceutical company plummeting.

<b>     EXT - SYDNEY (DAY)
</b>
     Ethan emerges to a very crowded street.  Billy and Luther are
     waiting.  Both look to Ethan.

<b>                                LUTHER
</b>                        (worried)
                So what did he say?

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Good job.  And thanks.

<b>                                BILLY
</b>                        (incredulous)
                That's it?  That's it? That's it?

<b>                                LUTHER
</b>                        (dryly, looking at Billy)
                And the check's in the mall.

<b>                                BILLY
</b>                Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy
                Baird's the name.  Anything you need to
                get, move or watch, I'm your man.

     And Billy's gone.  Ethan and Luther remain alone, both reluctant
     to say anything, both reluctant to leave.

     One quick bear hug, then:

<b>                                LUTHER
</b>                Always nice hearing from you man.  Stay in 
                touch..

     And Luther's off.  Ethan looks after him, a bit wistfully.  Then,
     curiously tentative he moves off into the crowd.  After a half-
     dozen steps, something catches his eyes.  He stops.

     One quick bear hug, then:

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                        (a tad wary)
                Do you know me?

<b>     NYAH
</b>
     is inches from him.  Without batting an eye.


<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                No.  Should I?

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                No.  You just looked as if you did.

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                No...

     She wraps her arms around him and kisses him with considerable
     conviction.

                                ETHAN (cont'd)
                ...just as if I'd like to.

<b>                                NYAH
</b>                Oh.  Well..

     He kisses her with a conviction that is more than a match for
     hers.

                                NYAH (cont'd)
                ..I think that can be arranged.

     Looks around at the swirling crowd:

<b>                                ETHAN
</b>                Let's get lost.

     And in a moment they've vanished from the frame and into the
     crowd.  Camera begins to pull back, the bustling crowd ever
     filling the frame - and in the distance, perhaps, just a splash
     of a bouquet of flowers can be seen, appearing to bounce along on
     its own, the rising beat of the MI theme:
