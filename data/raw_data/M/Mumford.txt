<b>               EXT. MAIN STREET, SMALL TOWN - DAY
</b>
               A freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of 
               the road in a small rural town. A handsome, well-built man 
               gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver. THE 
               NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up 
               suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his 
               shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps. He 
               wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around.

</b>                         I get outta the truck in this two-
                         bit town. I got no money and no 
                         prospects. What I need right now is 
                         a stiff drink, a cold shower, and a 
                         hot broad. I'll take 'em in any order 
                         they come...

<b>               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Old three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling 
               picket fence and a scruffy yard. The sign says -- ROOMS TO 
               RENT. The Newcomer goes in the gate.

<b>                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
</b>                         ...Oh yeah, one other thing I need -- 
                         an angle.

               He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing, 
               then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood.

<b>                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
</b>                         I was thinking -- if it weren't for 
                         bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck 
                         at all...

<b>                                     LANDLADY (O.S.)
</b>                         Can I help you?

               The Newcomer turns toward the door. Standing there, holding 
               the screen open, is the LANDLADY. She's a knockout in a cheap, 
               small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front 
               and clings with sweat to her generous curves.

<b>                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
</b>                         Either my luck had just changed, or 
                         Fate just bought me another round of 
                         trouble.

</b>
               The Newcomer's POV of the Landlady as she leads him up the 
               narrow, gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third 
               story / attic. She has a Monroe-like sway to her walk. We 
               can barely HEAR her DISTANT, ECHOEY DIALOGUE:

<b>                                     LANDLADY
</b>                         ...not very fancy... house needs 
                         repairs... We haven't had a man around 
                         here for so long...

<b>                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)
</b>                         She kept yammerin' the whole time, 
                         but her hips were doing all the 
                         talking...

               The Landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs 
               and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed, bureau and 
               tiny window. The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous 
               body to get inside and look around. It doesn't take long. 
               His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the 
               door, chest thrust forward. He focusses on her fingers, toying 
               with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage.

</b>                         It couldn't 'a been any clearer what 
                         the set-up was. The next move was up 
                         to me...

               The Newcomer takes a step in the Landlady's direction --

</b>
               CLOSE-UP of MUMFORD wincing.

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                              (softer)
                         -- That's all the time we have. 
                         Sorry...
                              (indicates his watch)
                         ...next time.

               We see Mumford's office: the office of a Psychologist, a 
               therapist with a doctorate. It's modest, comfortable, neat, 
               with a calm, relaxed ambience. [The movie is now in COLOR.] 
               His patient, HENRY FOLLETT, looks nothing like The Newcomer 
               in the soft-core fantasy he's been narrating. Instead, he's 
               a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding 
               hairline. Only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his 
               fantasy alter-ego. Follett has been lying on a couch, but 
               now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford.

                         any of this. You might as well not 
                         come.

</b>                         Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't 
                         want to come --

<b>               INT. LILY'S CAFÉ- DAY
</b>
               Lunch crowd. Mumford can be seen out the big front window, 
               crossing from the two-story building that houses his office 
               on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is 
               also called Mumford. He comes inside and goes to the counter 
               to pick up some take-out. The Proprietor is a woman around 
               forty named LILY, who talks to him as she works.

</b>                         Who was that?

               She comes over to the register with an order. Mumford is 
               am[...] her, likes her a lot.

               A Patron passes on the way out.

                              (Mumford gives her a 
                              look)
                         And you've already got more patients 
                         than those other two shrinks combined.

               Lily sees something out the window.

<b>                                     LILY
</b>                         Look at that guy...

               Mumford turns to look out the window. A young man of about 
               30, in jeans and a Hawaiian shirt, is skateboarding down the 
               street at high speed, weaving in and out amongst the cars. 
               He zips past the front of the restaurant.

<b>                                     LILY

                              (Mumford does not)
                         You really don't? That's Skip 
                         Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit 
                         by a truck, this whole town shuts

               LILY hands over Mumford's bagged order, rings it up. Back on 
               track:

               Mumford is smiling as he goes out. Another Patron, LIONEL 
               DILLARD, a lawyer, brings his check to Lily, watching Mumford 
               cross the street. Lily can't stand this guy.

               An overweight, teenage girl named NESSA WATKINS is on 
               Mumford's couch. She fidgets as she talks and can't decide 
               whether to lie down (so she's looking away from him) or sit 
               up and face him. She plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps 
               taking out a lighter, then stuffing it back in her big, sloppy

                         to have it removed. But while the

                         serious, immediate love. So in no 
                         time, he's gone from the most gorgeous 
                         model in the world to the most

                         There was this article my friends 
                         and I read. It was "25 Signs He's

                         fascinating.

<b>               EXT. HIKING TRAIL, MOUNTAIN FOREST - MAGIC
</b>
               The last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees 
               as Mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well.

<b>               EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC
</b>
               Mumford climbs out on the Big Rock, settles himself on the 
               edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle.

               WHAT HE SEES: far below at the foot of these hills, lights 
               just twinkling on, is the town of Mumford. He stares at it 
               for several long moments. Then he takes a small headlamp 
               from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks 
               like a miner's light). He twists the light on to test it and 
               turns his head to watch the beam move about.

               WE CUT BACK WIDE. After a beat, Mumford settles back and 
               turns off the light.

<b>               INT. SCATTERGOOD'S TAVERN - NIGHT

               The place is quietly busy with the regulars. Mumford has a 
               favorite spot at the far end of the bar. Right now he's 
               sitting alone, reading the remnants of a newspaper.

               SKIP SKIPPERTON, the man on the skateboard, comes in. Everyone 
               in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here. Several patrons 
               greet him as he makes his way deeper inside, looking around. 
               He's uncomfortable. He seems relieved when he spots Mumford 
               and heads back there. Mumford doesn't notice Skip waiting 
               for his attention.

               but nothing is clear to Mumford, yet. Skip keeps his voice 
               down; he doesn't want anyone else in the bar to hear him.

                         seen them in the wild. That's the

                         want to do these days.

               Skip stares into his beer for a moment, as though the thought 
               depresses him. He catches himself and snaps back --

               Skip beams. Mumford leans forward in the same confidential 
               way Skip did before; he indicates that Skip should lean in 
               too. Mumford is almost whispering --

                         gladly become Mrs. Skipperton for a 
                         while. Can you imagine that --

               Mumford is listening to Lionel, the arrogant lawyer who asked 
               about him in the restaurant. Lionel is lying on the couch, 
               talking with enormous energy; he has a serious superiority 
               complex. Mumford can't stand him and the session seems to be 
               lasting an eternity.

                         got some astronomer, this little 
                         limey know-it-all, and he's telling 
                         how, with this Himball telescope, 
                         they've discovered there are maybe 
                         400 million more galaxies than they 
                         thought there were. And I guess that's 
                         supposed to make me feel small? I'm 
                         supposed to feel insignificant? Is 
                         that the point? Because I can tell 
                         you it didn't.

               Mumfords eyes dart to look at --

               Lionel is twisting his neck around painfully to look back at 
               Mumford.

               As Lionel goes on, Mumford's eyes again dart toward -- THE 
               CLOCK: still 2:23! Hold on it. Finally, it moves. Mumford's 
               eyes dart toward his desk --

               A deadly-looking letter opener in the shape of Excalibur 
               stands GLINTING LIGHT in a marble rendition of Arthur's stone.

               Mumford's head rocks slowly back for a moment as if he's 
               going to drift off. He snaps back to life and stares hard at 
               the top of Lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting 
               to take hold. The sound of LIONEL'S VOICE begins to echo --

                         attended every class, so I'm totally 
                         prepared. Then I see myself running 
                         down the hall at school...

               MUMFORD'S GLANCE FLASHPANS from Lionel's bald spot to the 
               gleaming letter opener.

               ALTHEA BROCKETT, a woman in her forties, sits on the couch 
               reading a mail order catalogue for home furnishings. There 
               are several other catalogues sticking out of her jammed, 
               woven carry-all.

               The door to Mumford's inner office opens with some force. 
               Mumford stands looking back across his office at Lionel, who 
               is getting up from the couch in some confusion.

                         here.

               Lionel looks around, but there is no such sign. He does spot 
               Althea watching the show from the couch.

               Lionel bangs out the front door. Mumford motions Althea inside --

               Althea is sobbing. Mumford hands her a new Kleenex from the 
               box next to the couch. She wads it with her current one and 
               tries to stop crying. Mumford settles back in his chair, 
               patient.

<b>               EXT. MUMFORD'S STREET - MAGIC

               Mumford hurries up the sidewalk carrying two grocery bags. 
               He's late. The modest houses are close together on this pretty 
               street, which rises out of the main business district, seen 
               beyond Mumford.

<b>               EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC

               Mumford comes to the house where he lives. He heads down the 
               driveway toward the stairs that lead up to his apartment.

               The front yard is completely fenced. Lily, the owner of the 
               restaurant, is almost visible in there working among the 
               greenery of a lush garden. Her friendly dog, AINGE, sees 
               Mumford, leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around 
               Mumford, who has no free hand to pet him.

               The dog leaps gracefully back into the yard. Mumford hurries 
               up the stairs.

<b>               INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC

               Mumford comes in and puts the bags down on the kitchen 
               counter. He goes directly to the table by his main chair and 
               picks up the TV remote. He switches it on and changes the 
               channel. The opening segment of UNSOLVED MYSTERIES is just 
               beginning. It previews the stories on that evening's episode -- 
               disappearances and unclosed cases -- with Robert Stack 
               hosting.

               CLOSE ON MUMFORD'S FACE as he watches. Only when the whole 
               show has been previewed does he seem to relax. He leaves the 
               show on as he goes into the kitchen and begins unloading the 
               bags.

               Mystified, Mumford follows Cook through the door into the 
               back.

               BACK OF THE STORE. Cook motions for Mumford to take the seat 
               of honor in the work area, but Mumford prefers to stand. 
               Cook has a little trouble figuring how to start. Finally --

                         people who need to make a change.

               Cook is quick to agree; he doesn't want to make waves. But

               Mumford continues up the street. We STAY WITH Lionel, who 
               watches Mumford with a sour look, then turns to enter a small

               REVERSE ANGLE: The baseball diamond is sitting in the vast, 
               lush grounds behind the PANDA MODEM WORLD HEADQUARTERS, a 
               brand new, distinctively original, high-tech office park. 
               Wherever there is an opportunity for tasteful signage, it is 
               in the motif of a Giant Panda -- sweet white face, black 
               eyes and ears, round body.

               Skip is suddenly self-conscious, embarrassed.

                         made the Mumford High varsity.

               Mumford takes that in. SLAP... SLAP.

</b>                         Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.

               Skip is a little surprised to hear this from Mumford, but he 
               just throws the ball.

                         Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned 
                         ones, from back when people cared 
                         about atmosphere and character.

                         better than his real one. Nothing 
                         can live up to it. His wife got sick 
                         of it and left him. Took his kids 
                         with her.

</b>                         I wondered what happened to her...

               Skip is fascinated, but a little uncomfortable. Mumford seems 
               oblivious, unusually talkative --

</b>                         Of course, it's not that simple. 
                         There's something powerful going on 
                         there. We've got a lot of work to 
                         do.
                              (announcer voice)
                         It's hit to the warning track!

               For the first time, Mumford throws the ball way high, like a 
               long fly ball. Skip, delighted as a dog, takes off running 
               and just barely catches it on the run. He pegs it back to 
               Mumford.

                         played by a handsome guy with biceps. 
                         Can you imagine that? Where your 
                         self-esteem has to be?
                              (throws him the ball)
                         Man, I'd just like to move the guy 
                         to the point where he gets to appear 
                         in his own fantasies.

               Silence. Nessa sits staring at Mumford defiantly, an unlit 
               cigarette in her mouth. Mumford looks at the clock -- 3:00 -- 
               and stands up, session over. Nessa quickly lights her 
               cigarette with the lighter concealed in her hand and stands 
               up too. She exhales a huge cloud of smoke and walks quickly 
               to the back door of the office, which Mumford has opened for 
               her, and goes out.

               Mumford waves half-heartedly at the cloud of smoke as he 
               walks to the door to the waiting room and opens it.

               MUMFORD'S POV: As the door swings open, the first figure we 
               see is Mr. Cook; he twists around at the sound of the door. 
               He acknowledges Mumford and then sighs as he steps aside to 
               reveal, sitting exhausted in a chair, his daughter --

               SOFIE -- a young woman whose actual appearance is somewhat 
               disguised at present by her wan, ashen visage. She regards 
               Mumford with some resignation. Her father helps her out of 
               the chair. Sofie keeps her eyes on Mumford.

               CLOSE ON Mumford, watching her.

               LATER. Mr. Cook is gone. Sofie is sitting up on the couch, 
               facing Mumford. She looks like she might pass out at any 
               moment, but her voice is stronger than you'd expect.

                         sleep. I think it's too soon for me 
                         to be sleeping with you.

               A joke. Mumford smiles.

</b>                         What can you tell me about this?

</b>                         Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting 
                         to tell you...
                              (tiny smile, to herself)
                         ...about my exhaustion. I didn't 
                         really want to come. I'm not hopeful 
                         right now. But I couldn't take the 
                         look on my dad's face. He's a truly 
                         kind person, which is pretty 
                         extraordinary if you knew the story. 
                         He's the opposite of me, I guess -- 
                         all stamina and resolve.

               It's taken all her energy to say this and she sinks down a 
               bit into the couch.

                         now. God, it seems like years. What 
                         a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before 
                         this happened -- when I'd hear people 
                         talk about this kind of thing -- I 
                         thought it was a bunch of bullshit.

               She sees something in his face and suddenly laughs -- it's a 
               weak but magical sound.

               Mumford is knocked off balance -- she's right. She saw him 
               clearly.

               is the cardboard boxes of all sizes which are stacked 
               everywhere. Many are unopened, but the rest are spilling 
               their styrofoam-nugget and bubble-wrap guts to reveal some 
               hint of their contents: a huge variety of catalogue-ordered 
               housewares, clothing, linens, gadgets, and knickknacks. If 
               it can be ordered from an upscale catalogue (and everything

               They come out onto the wide porch, which commands a 
               spectacular view of the surrounding countryside. There's an 
               elaborate bar cart out here, which Althea points Mumford 
               toward.

<b>                                     ALTHEA
</b>                         I'm awful I know, but will you please 
                         help yourself. I just got a new copper 
                         sauciere from Williams-Sonoma and 
                         I'm afraid it'll be the death of us 
                         all if I don't get back in there...

               She disappears inside with a bang of the screen door. Mumford 
               gets a drink for himself, taking in the view. He sees 
               something out there.

               MUMFORD'S POV: Way in the distance, coming out of the woods 
               and down toward the house is a teenage boy.

<b>                                     KATIE (O.S.)
</b>                         You're the doctor, aren't you?

               Mumford turns to see that Althea's thirteen year old daughter 
               KATIE has silently appeared. Her jeans and little tee-shirt 
               are meant to be sexy; it seems sad on her. Mumford nods.

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         You must be Katie. People call me 
                         Doc.

<b>                                     KATIE
</b>                              (motioning urgently)
                         C'mere. Quick... c'mon!

               Mumford follows as she disappears around the corner of the 
               porch.

<b>               INT. SIDE HALL, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC
</b>
               Mumford follows Katie into a gloomy hall from a side entrance. 
               Here too, the walls are lined with boxes. She tiptoes to one 
               of two facing doors and waits for him.

               When he has joined her, she motions him back a foot for 
               safety, then carefully opens the door to a large walk-in 
               closet. Katie's caution becomes understandable: the space is 
               packed so fully and chaotically with catalogue item cartons 
               that it might come tumbling out the door with one careless 
               move. Katie closes the door, then pirouettes to the opposing 
               door, which she swings open freely -- REVEALING: what was 
               once a study is now completely filled with hundreds of 
               cartons, in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes.

               Mumford is taken aback. Katie points at packages and speaks 
               in a hypnotic WHISPER --

               Just as Mumford and Katie come back around the corner, MARTIN, 
               Althea's sixteen year old son, crosses the yard and comes up 
               onto the porch. He's wearing an old black leather jacket 
               with a lot of zippers, dirty jeans and black Converse All-
               Stars that are coming apart. In his hand, casually but 
               properly held, is a .22 caliber rifle. He looks Mumford over.

<b>                                     MARTIN
</b>                         Is this him?

</b>                              (nods)

                         Do you get it now? This is no joke.

               Mumford takes them both in and nods. He understands. Suddenly, 
               their manner changes, for the worse. What they can see that 
               Mumford cannot is JEREMY BROCKETT, Althea's husband, who has 
               come to the back screen door, with the bustle of a late 
               arrival.

<b>                                     JEREMY
</b>                         Hey, kids. Oh, hi.

               Seeing Mumford, Jeremy steps out onto the porch to shake his 
               hand. Jeremy is quite handsome and a fantastic dresser; his 
               Armani outfit cost $4200 all in. His tone: hearty and strained --

<b>                                     JEREMY
</b>                         You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. 
                         Jeremy Brockett.

                         I'll be back in five.

               Jeremy goes inside. Martin and Katie exchange a look with 
               each other, then to Mumford. Martin goes inside.

<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

<b>               EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               LATER. Dinner is over. Jeremy comes out onto the veranda 
               carrying two Cuban cigars. His casual outfit is as stylish 
               and pricey as his work outfit. He joins Mumford and Althea, 
               who immediately gets up.

<b>                                     ALTHEA
</b>                         I'll be back.

               She goes inside. The men each have a snifter of cognac. Jeremy 
               makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars --

<b>                                     JEREMY
</b>                         I think you'll like this. Know much 
                         about Cuban cigars?

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         Nope.

               Jeremy puts the cigars down, pulls a joint out of his cashmere 
               pullover and fires it up. After exhaling a huge cloud of 
               smoke, he offers the joint to Mumford, who declines.

<b>                                     JEREMY
</b>                         Makes the whole thing that much 
                         better.

               Jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down. He 
               gives a cigar and his gold lighter to Mumford, who begins to 
               light up --

<b>                                     JEREMY
</b>                         Just hold the flame a little bit 
                         below the end... that's it... now 
                         just turn it slowly as you draw...

               Mumford does as he's told. Jeremy lights his own cigar.

               The marijuana is kicking in now -- Jeremy gets a self-
               satisfied, condescending look on his face that no straight 
               mind would dare. His response includes their lavish immediate 
               surroundings--

                         from living out here in Mayberry.

               Jeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter, then takes a 
               mouthful of cognac, savoring the sensations. Mumford watches, 
               fascinated by this guy.

               Lily is walking Ainge as the Mercedes pulls up and Mumford 
               gets out. Ainge runs happily around the car and puts his 
               paws up on the driver's door to greet Martin; we HEAR the 
               clicking SCRATCH of his nails on the surface. Martin rubs 
               the dog's head.

               website has been called up on Mumford's office computer.

               Mumford is hunched over the computer, reading avidly. His

               Mumford comes out the front door and holds it open for Sofie. 
               He offers his arm and she takes it tentatively.

               Mumford looks out toward the street. A woman in her fifties 
               is turning into the front walk. She stares at them, unsmiling, 
               as the two parties converge. She is MRS. COOK.

               ANOTHER DAY. Mumford is leading Sofie through the lightest 
               set of calisthenics ever devised. Now they're doing waist 
               bends and arm waving. Even so, it's taking everything Sofie's

<b>               INT. BOARDING HOUSE (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - DAY
</b>
               The handsome Newcomer of Follett's fantasy comes down the 
               steps from the attic wearing a sleeveless undershirt, towel 
               thrown over his shoulder. He goes into the bathroom off the 
               second floor hall and begins to wash up. [Again, Follett's 
               fantasy world is in BLACK &amp; WHITE.]

                         found work my first day out down at 
                         Old Man Sutter's gas station and 
                         diner. I knew his stacked young wife 
                         was going to be a problem, but, hey, 
                         life is full of problems. Back at 
                         the boarding house, I was washing up 
                         when I heard a load of yellin' and --

               IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR, the Newcomer's POV: a nubile teenager, 
               17 going on 35, in a tight cheerleader's outfit, comes up 
               the stairs and stops at the top to turn and yell back down 
               at her mother. Her dialogue distant and echoey:

<b>                                     LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER

                         landlady's daughter.

               The LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER looks up and sees the Newcomer 
               watching her through the half-open bathroom door. She gives 
               him a petulant, white-hot look, then turns on her heel and 
               goes into her room at that end of the hall. She bangs her 
               door behind her, but it bounces open again about a foot. The 
               Newcomer, still watching in the bathroom mirror, now has a 
               view of the bureau mirror in the Landlady's Daughter's room. 
               In there, seemingly oblivious, the girl quickly strips off 
               the top of her outfit, revealing a '50's-era white bra.

                         but not too careful.

               Suddenly, in mirror reflection of mirror, the Landlady's 
               Daughter meets the Newcomer's smoldering stare and her lip 
               begins to curl.

               Mysteriously, the door to the girl's bedroom slams shut, 
               cutting off the Newcomer's view. He looks with surprise into 
               his mirror -- it suddenly shatters.

               Skip, even more unsure now, looks away, at the town below.

</b>                         That really relates to the thing I 
                         want to ask you... I've noticed that 
                         sometimes, not a lot, but sometimes, 
                         when we're hanging out, throwin' the 
                         ball... or that time we went 
                         bowling... sometimes you'll like --
                              (gets it out fast --)
                         -- tell me things about your other 
                         patients.

               Mumford lets that hang a few moments, then acknowledges it 
               silently. Now Skip is even more nervous.

                         anyone about your patients'

               It's getting dark fast now. Mumford reaches into his bag and 
               takes out the headlamp we saw earlier. He fits the straps 
               carefully over his head.

                         give it, say... a two.

               Mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the 
               dusk. Mumford turns the beam directly at Skip.

               Skip, hanging on every word now, agrees emphatically.

                         psychologist.

               At first, Skip thinks he's misunderstood Mumford. But in the 
               huge silence that ensues, he replays it and knows he's heard 
               right. Mumford looks around, adjusts his headlamp, and gets 
               up.

               The cramped interior is grimy and depressing. MUMFORD'S MOTHER 
               worse for wear, has just put a glass of liquor on the sink 
               and returned her attention to the smoking stovetop. She 
               glances briefly at Mumford and greets him pleasantly, clearly 
               drunk. Suddenly, her attention shifts and we -- PAN TO THE

               coal miner whose face still shows the grime of his work. But 
               it's his scary scowl that impresses. His eyes take in his

                         ahead and won their bonuses was by 
                         generating maximum payments. That 
                         meant the revenue officers had to 
                         use all their "collection tools" -- 
                         seizures, liens, levies -- even if a 
                         more reasonable compromise could 
                         have been worked out. The best way 
                         to reduce resistance from the 
                         taxpayers was to build a convincing

                         figured there was no point in leaving 
                         me and taking that along. After two

</b>                         ...Mickey Mumford was in Miss Rice's 
                         kindergarten class with me. He was 
                         killed with his parents in a wreck 
                         on their way back from a Steelers 
                         game. He was only six years old, 
                         which is a real plus, so there's a 
                         birth certificate if anyone checks -- 
                         but not much else. They died in 
                         Pennsylvania, so there's no death 
                         certificate in West Virginia... that's 
                         also good.

               ON A KITCHEN TABLE, the new birth certificate, now filled 
               out for Michael Mumford, is carefully lifted from a shallow 
               bowl of light tea (the tea bags are nearby). The paper has 
               taken on an aged, sepia look. CUT TO:

               A STACK OF BOOKS. The ones on top are lifted away. The bottom 
               book is opened to reveal the birth certificate. It has been 
               folded in an official way. Now Mumford unfolds it, then 
               refolds it differently -- with its smudges and creases, it's 
               starting to look old.

               Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first

               his neck. At each house, he consults the list in his hand, 
               then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper, which she throws -- with 
               varying success -- toward the front doors. The activity is 
               tiring for her, but she's committed.

               Mumford hands her another paper, which she heaves with all 
               her limited strength, missing the front porch badly. Mumford, 
               who can't get enough of watching her, doesn't notice at first.

               Sofie starts walking again, taking another newspaper from 
               his sack. He points to the next house.

               Sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch. She turns to 
               him with pride, but when she sees the way he looks at her, 
               she glances away, uncomfortable.

               TIGHT ON RAPID SERIES OF IMAGES on slick, glossy magazine 
               pages: each change of image is punctuated by the AMPLIFIED 
               SNAP of the page being turned, like a gunshot. We're SO CLOSE 
               to the images we can't tell when the magazines change -- 
               from Glamour to Vogue to Us to Mademoiselle to W to Vanity 
               Fair. And it doesn't matter. Whether the images are ads or 
               fashion spreads or celebrity candids, the look is the same -- 
               jaded, hip, disinterested, apathetic, either impossibly buff 
               or anorexic, but always severely beautiful. The PAGE TURNING 
               starts at a fevered pitch and becomes even more intense. 
               Finally --

               Mumford is sitting next to Nessa on the couch. At their feet 
               is a mess of magazines. Nessa discards one and immediately 
               starts flipping through a new one beneath it. She is very 
               agitated. Mumford stands up, walks over and sits in his chair.

               A look of panic crosses Nessa's face, but she instantly hides 
               it, busily taking out cigarette and lighter, which she doesn't 
               use. Instead, she lies down on the couch, balancing the closed

                         did you hear about it on an 
                         infomercial?

               Mumford waits. Nessa refers to the magazine beneath her chin.

                         Nobody's ever paid any attention to 
                         what I did, and I liked it just fine.

               Mumford crosses the street from his office. A huge bus with 
               "APPLEJACK TOURS" on the sides, is disgorging its passengers, 
               a large group of elderly JAPANESE WOMEN, all of whom file 
               neatly into Lily's Café. Lily stands on the sidewalk outside 
               greeting them merrily.

               Lily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand-lettered 
               sign in her front window -- "Closed for Lunch. See you

                         It's a tour.

               Mumford's attention is suddenly drawn to something across 
               the street. He glances thoughtfully at Lily for a moment, 
               then back out there.

               WHAT HE SEES: Skip is once again zipping down the street on 
               his skateboard in the midst of traffic. He has not noticed 
               Mumford.

               Skip looks over, then immediately changes course toward them, 
               barely checking the surrounding traffic. He is extraordinarily 
               skillful. When he gets to the curb, he pulls a snazzy board-
               flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk. 
               Some of the Japanese matrons react with delight.

               Skip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately 
               distracted by the presence of Lily, who's a little excited 
               to meet the local celebrity.

                         very nice... I heard your shower.

               Skip can't believe what he just said. Neither can the other 
               two, actually. Mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but 
               he cuts it off fast. Lily blushes, but Skip's agitation has 
               charmed her. Something's happening here.

               He's making a joke and it represents quite a recovery. They're

               "what about me?" sound. Lily, grinning, just points to the

               The town's upscale dining spot. Mumford, Delbanco and Sheeler

                         fear of death. It is, as Henry James

                         as we may to forget or ignore our

                         banquet."

               Mumford nods appreciatively. (He really is an extraordinary 
               listener.) Delbanco catches his own vanity in Sheeler's 
               adoring gaze and becomes self-conscious --

                         He liked to acquire things.

               Mumford looks away. Althea realizes what he's thinking.

               She takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her

               Follett is embarrassed to be discovered here. But that's

               Mumford is being escorted across the spectacular atrium by a

               Mumford looks that way. In the distance, Skip is descending 
               from an upper level on his skateboard via a unique system of 
               ramps designed for that purpose alone. None of the hustling 
               Panda Employees in the area take any particular notice of 
               the sight.

               Skip meets Mumford and his escort at the bottom of the ramp 
               with a spectacular stop.

               The Security Aide retreats as Skip (riding slowly alongside) 
               leads Mumford into a side corridor.

               Skip is pleased. They approach a heavy steel door, the 
               entrance to Skip's Workshop. A VERY OLD SECURITY AIDE sits 
               at the end of the intersecting hallway, watching this area.

               Skip puts his hand in a scanning device in the wall. Some 
               lights blink and the heavy metal door pops open a few inches. 
               Skip has to put all his weight into opening the door. He 
               hesitates, suddenly concerned --

               Mumford reassures him with a look. Skip pushes the door open 
               far enough for them to enter, then pulls it closed behind 
               them.

<b>               INT. SKIP'S WORKSHOP - DAY

               Mumford and Skip enter the large, windowless workspace. What 
               at first appears chaotic is, in fact, carefully organized. 
               Many different disciplines interface here:

               THE BODY SECTION: The first thing one notices -- some 
               incredibly life-like, anatomically correct, 
               sculpture/mannequins -- both male and female. You half expect 
               them to breathe. From there, a full wall of forms descends 
               from store mannequins and skeletons all the way down to a 
               huge variety of inflatable sex dolls.

               THE CYBER SECTION: A dizzying array of computers and screens, 
               some showing wire-form outlines of body parts in repeated 
               motion. Above them, on a huge corkboard, hundreds of computer 
               generated renderings of skin, eyes, limbs, sexual organs.

               THE BODY PARTS SECTION: Medical models of teeth, eyes, lips, 
               limbs. Hundreds of porn store samples: plastic dildos, rubber 
               vaginas, sucking machines and sundry genitalia.

               THE FORM-CASTING SHOP: All the machinery you need to make 
               rubber and acrylic forms of anything that can be computer 
               designed.

               All these weird objects are set upon shiny, spotless, high-
               tech work surfaces. Skip watches Mumford move about in awe, 
               picking up the odd item.

               Skip looks at Mumford, a wide grin on his face.

               Skip settles in front of the Body Parts section, framed by 
               an array of limbs and sex toys. There's an assembled pelvic 
               section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him.

               Skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a 
               button. The pelvic section begins to hump, slowly and 
               sensually, in place. It's amazingly life-like, but it makes 
               a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND. Skip fumbles to turn it off.

               Lionel is here with Delbanco and Sheeler. This time, Delbanco 
               is behind his desk, Sheeler across the room on the sofa.

</b>                         Don't you find it incredibly 
                         convenient that everyone who could 
                         possibly corroborate his story has 
                         recently died some exotic death?

                         certification exams? The records 
                         seem to be in order.

               Lionel's derisive snort is so obnoxious, it's hard to bear.

                         we listening to Lionel now?

               Sheeler jumps, so shocked is she by his outburst, and so 
               humiliated for Lionel to witness it. Fighting tears and trying 
               to maintain her dignity, she gathers up her things and walks 
               to the door. Delbanco, immediately contrite, stands up.

               She breaks into tears and rushes out of the office. Delbanco 
               is left facing Lionel, who gives him exactly the look the 
               doctor least wants to see.

<b>               INT. LILY'S CAFÉ - DAY

               Mumford is eating his lunch at the counter. He watches Lily

               Mumford follows Mr. Cook into the room. Mrs. Cook and Sofie's

               Mrs. Cook keeps knitting; Ben stands to shake Mumford's hand,

               MUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and talking 
               intimately. As they separate, we can see that it is Nessa 
               and Martin Brockett. Martin sees Mumford, but makes no sign. 
               Nessa twists to see what Martin's looking at just as the 
               view is interrupted by a wall.

               Mumford walks on, mulling what he's seen.

<b>               EXT. BACK DOOR, FOLLETT'S PHARMACY - DAY
</b>
               There is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to 
               the back room of the pharmacy, but the door inside is open. 
               When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there, Mumford raps on 
               the metal screen.

<b>               INT. HENRY FOLLETT'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
               Follett's private space is above and at the back of his 
               drugstore. When you sit at his desk and in front of it, as 
               Follett and Mumford are doing now, you can see down into the 
               store through a floor-to-ceiling, one-way mirror.

               The Fed-Ex box sits on the desk between the two men, unopened.

</b>                         It's a thought I had.

</b>                         Should I open it now?

               Mumford seems hesitant, but nods. Follett takes out an Exacto 
               knife and makes the first incision, but as he's about to go 
               on, Mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him.

                         help.

                         there's some kind of imagery that's 
                         haunting you and, I think, getting 
                         in your way --

</b>                         But you did come to me.

               Follett reacts. It's true, even if he keeps forgetting.

</b>                         My guess is these images were burned 
                         into your brain when you were young. 
                         Maybe if we could nail down the exact 
                         fantasies that are haunting you -- 
                         maybe you could get past them... 
                         Anyway, I thought we could try an 
                         experiment.

                         And the experiment is in here?

               Mumford nods, but suddenly looks depressed, distracted.

</b>                         You know what? I think this was a 
                         dumb idea...

               He starts to take hold of the box.

                         whole thing.

               Follett grabs the box back.

                         There's absolutely no reason to think 
                         this is going to have any impact on 
                         you. I'm embarrassed to have --

               Follett stands up and grabs the box, taking sole possession. 
               Loud --

<b>                                     FOLLETT
</b>                         Hey! I agree with you that you don't 
                         know what you're talking about. That's 
                         what I've been saying all along. And 
                         I can guarantee you that looking at 
                         the Lost Ark or whatever you got in 
                         here is not going to mean diddly to 
                         me...
                              (quieting down)
                         ...but if you think I'm going to let 
                         you walk out of here without seeing 
                         what's in this box, you don't know 
                         much about Henry A. Follett.

               Mumford gives up. Follett gestures to ask whether it's safe 
               to put the box on the desk; Mumford reassures him. Now, with 
               much more anticipation and ceremony than before, Follett 
               carefully cuts open the package.

               THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX is revealed as Follett opens the 
               flaps. There is an inner, brown paper wrapping upon which 
               has been set a low-rent catalogue: "METROPOLITAN COLLECTIBLES -- 
               Periodicals, Erotica, Adult Nostalgia." Follett lifts away 
               the wrapping --

               There are perhaps a dozen men's magazines of the late fifties 
               and early sixties: Nugget, Adam, The Adam Reader, Swank, 
               Dude. Plus several cartoon collections: Sex to Sexty, Stag 
               Humor. Plus trashy adult novels of the era, with provocative 
               illustrations on the covers: Night Call Nurse, The Neighbors 
               Have No Curtains, Secretarial Sluts, etc. Finally, two video 
               tapes, both of Russ Meyer films: MUDHONEY and COMMON-LAW 
<b>               CABIN.
</b>
               We stay CLOSE ON the contents of the box as Follett's hands 
               shuffle through it, rapidly flipping through the pages. Very 
               soft-core by today's standards, the common thread is clear: 
               voluptuous, heavy-breathing sirens in tight clothes (and out 
               of them) tempting muscular, he-man drifters or libidinous 
               businessmen. A world of lusty secretaries, siren babysitters, 
               and frustrated, neglected wives. In other words, exactly the 
               erotic ambience of Follett's fantasies.

               SLOW TILT UP TO FOLLETT'S FACE. He is transported, mesmerized, 
               galvanized. In fact, at this moment, as the MUSIC SWELLS, a 
               tear is rolling down his cheek. He dare not take his eyes 
               from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford. The only thing 
               that could wreck his mood now, is --

<b>                                     YOUNG PHARMACIST (O.S.)
</b>                         Mr. Follett --

               Follett jumps, startled from his revery. As the Young 
               Pharmacist steps tentatively into the office, Follett jams 
               everything back into the box as best he can and tries to 
               cover it.

<b>                                     FOLLETT
</b>                         What?! What the hell is so important 
                         I can't have five minutes --?

               The Young Pharmacist is cowed and doesn't advance into the 
               room.

<b>                                     YOUNG PHARMACIST
</b>                         It's her, sir. You told me to get 
                         you when she came to pick up her 
                         prescription.

               It takes Follett a moment to understand, but when he does, 
               his whole manner changes. He dismisses the Young Pharmacist 
               with a nod, then gives a quick, self-conscious glance to 
               Mumford.

<b>                                     FOLLETT
</b>                         Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...
                              (indicates box)
                         ...I really appreciate what you're 
                         trying to... uh, I can't thank you 
                         enough for...

</b>                         My pleasure.

               Follett heads for the door, pausing briefly at a mirror to 
               check his appearance, pushing at his hair with his palm.

<b>                                     FOLLETT
</b>                         I'll see you on... whatever...

               He hurries out. Mumford stands up to leave, but first looks 
               down through the one-way mirror.

               WHAT HE SEES: Follett hurries up behind the prescription 
               counter, where Althea Brockett is waiting; once again she 
               looks quite sexy. Follett brings her prescription up and 
               begins playfully flirting. Althea is responsive. Follett 
               motions Althea down the aisle, where it's more private. He 
               comes out from behind the counter, ostensibly to show Althea 
               something on the prescription bottle. Althea leans back 
               against some shelves in the same posture as the Landlady in 
               Follett's first fantasy.

               Mumford reacts, bemused.

<b>               EXT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY

               Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail. Despite 
               her labored breathing, it's clear Sofie has made enormous

</b>                         I thought only action movies had 
                         villains like that.

               Sofie gestures ahead.

                         I know why you were going to quit 
                         seeing me.

               Mumford slows at this. Sofie heads off the trail into the 
               woods.

<b>               EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - DAY

               Sofie appears first, but she waits for Mumford before she 
               steps tentatively onto the rock. Mumford takes firm hold of 
               her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle 
               herself.

               head -- no one wants to use the back anymore.

               Nessa opens the door to the waiting room. Martin Brockett is 
               sitting there. He makes a gesture to Nessa to underline the 
               fact that he is not reading any of the many magazines lying

               across the room and out onto the porch, to REVEAL Mumford in 
               his chair, nursing a beer, looking up at the starry sky.

                         must say, those of my wife.

               Mumford's head snaps up. He had no idea Delbanco was married.

               We (CAMERA) are being pummelled by three SMALL TOWN TOUGHS 
               behind Old Man Sutter's gas station/diner in the Follett's 
               fantasy town. [In BLACK &amp; WHITE.] Beyond them, Old Man 
               Sutter's stacked YOUNG WIFE watches in horror from the 
               backdoor of the building. We DO NOT SEE The Newcomer yet.

               One of the Toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace. 
               CUT TO BLACK, then FADE UP ON:

<b>               INT. ATTIC ROOM, BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               STILL IN SUBJECTIVE CAMERA as the concerned Landlady, cleavage 
               foremost, stands away from us, having patted the unseen 
               Newcomer's face with a washcloth. Beyond her, near the half-
               open door, stands her Cheerleader Daughter, worriedly chewing 
               on her thumb.

                         things, but doctoring wasn't one of 
                         them...

               CUT TO REVERSE and see the hero, who this time is actually 
               played by Henry Follett, appearing in his own fantasy for 
               the first time. He's lying in bed, his face bruised in the 
               manner of a fifties movie.

                         downstairs in the front room...

               BACK AT THE DOOR, the Cheerleader hears someone coming and 
               steps aside to make way for -- Althea Brockett, dressed now 
               in a nurse's uniform so tight the buttons are straining.

               As the Landlady and the Cheerleader retreat out the door, 
               Althea the Nurse sways forward toward the bed bearing bandages 
               and a bowl of steaming water, a lascivious look of concern

<b>               INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY
</b>
               Mumford sits beaming at Henry Follett on the couch. Mumford's 
               glance takes in the clock and he stands up, signalling the 
               end of the session. Follett snaps out of his revery and gets 
               up.

</b>                         I'm very happy for you, Henry.

               Mumford, surprisingly, takes Follett's hand and shakes it 
               vigorously.

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         I feel like we're making real progress 
                         here.

</b>                         Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you 
                         what that package meant to me --

               Mumford stops him with a "don't mention it" gesture. Follett 
               accepts and goes out the back door. Mumford is pleased someone 
               still wants to use that door.

               Mumford returns to his desk and begins reading some papers 
               when he HEARS the entry door to the waiting room. Not 
               expecting anyone, he checks the clock, then goes to his office 
               door and opens it.

               Sofie is standing there, very agitated, just about to knock. 
               She peers past him to see if he's alone.

<b>                                     SOFIE

</b>                         Of course.

               Sofie sits on the couch. Mumford sits in his chair, facing 
               her. Her voice is as strained as her manner.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         We haven't met in this office since 
                         that first time. This is how a real 
                         professional and his client are 
                         supposed to see each other.

               Mumford waits.

</b>                         It might've been more appropriate if 
                         we had followed a traditional approach 
                         to the doctor-patient relationship.

</b>                         Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. 
                         Mumford.

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         You're upset.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         How intuitive! That must take years 
                         of training right there. Maybe you 
                         can guess what has upset me.

               Mumford considers a long moment, several scenarios racing 
               through his mind. Finally, carefully --

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         Is it something you've heard about 
                         me?

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         No, it is not something I've heard 
                         about you! It is someth--
                              (stops suddenly)
                         Why? Is there something I should 
                         have heard about you?

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         Why don't you tell me what's on your 
                         mind?

               Sofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes, she 
               looks around frenetically for a moment. Then, indicating the 
               couch --

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         May I?

               Mumford gestures "of course." Sofie swings her legs up and 
               lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's 
               face. (It's the most vigorous movement she's yet shown us.) 
               This seems to help Sofie a bit.

                         what your shrink is for, right, so 
                         you can tell him what's bothering

                         First of all, I have been feeling 
                         much better lately. I don't know if 
                         the syndrome is over -- if it's just 
                         run its course or something -- but I 
                         feel a hundred per cent better than

                         realistic way.

               Mumford appears frozen in his chair. There is a heavy silence 
               in the room. Sofie does not look back there.

</b>                         I think you can understand why I 
                         have some serious questions about 
                         your methods. I mean, obviously it 
                         becomes much more likely that I'm 
                         going to have confusion about this 
                         when your idea of treatment is to go 
                         walking in the woods and up to make-
                         outs-ville and do all these highly 
                         romantic activities --

               Suddenly, Sofie's voice cracks. She is starting to cry, but 
               refuses to acknowledge it.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         -- We had a paper route together, 
                         for godssake! Do you understand how 
                         I might be a little resentful? Knowing 
                         that this so-called "love" I'm feeling 
                         is totally bogus, and just a pathetic 
                         case of... transference?

               Mumford doesn't know what to say. He's on the rack. Finally --

               Silence. Then Sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back 
               of her bare hand. Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, 
               but she ignores it. She will not meet his gaze.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         Maybe you ought to think about how 
                         you're going to fix this. And when 
                         you do...
                              (suddenly losing her 
                              will)
                         ...please get back to me.

               Sofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after a 
               step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back.

               Mumford comes up the street, lost in thought, and turns into 
               the driveway toward his stairs. Ainge leaps over the front 
               yard fence. Mumford pets the dog distractedly, still moving.

               Lily rises up suddenly from where she's been working in the 
               garden.

               Mumford reluctantly stops. Lily comes up to the fence.

                         you're in love.

               Mumford straightens, looks at Lily and acknowledges it.

</b>                         Then it's worth it.

               Mumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the 
               fence and kisses her on the forehead. Ainge jumps back over 
               to her side.

               Mumford turns and continues toward his stairs.

<b>               INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC
</b>
               Mumford comes in, drops his coat, gets a carton of orange 
               juice out of the fridge and drinks directly from it. 
               Distracted, he picks up the remote from the kitchen counter 
               and switches on the TV, then opens his freezer and stares 
               inside.

               UNSOLVED MYSTERIES comes on. The opening segment previews a 
               story about a couple who claim to have had a visitation from 
               Gianni Versace, then one about a yacht that went down near 
               Venezuela. ROBERT STACK, in his characteristic fragmented 
               delivery, intones the preview for the last story, accompanied 
               by appropriate footage:

<b>                                     ROBERT STACK
</b>                         ...A drug rehabilitation center in 
                         the lonely southwestern desert... 
                         run by reclusive monks... becomes 
                         the point of departure in a mysterious 
                         vanishing...

               A CLOSE-UP of an IRS identification card featuring a picture 
               of a younger Mumford, badly photographed in suit and tie. 
               His name is not visible.

<b>                                     ROBERT STACK
</b>                         ...as an intrepid government 
                         investigator disappears -- without a 
                         trace.

               In the kitchen, Mumford spins to look. DISSOLVE TO:

               LATER IN THE PROGRAM. Documentary shots of IRS Headquarters, 
               etc., are INTERCUT with hokey-looking re-enactments from 
               Mumford's life -- with a YOUNG ACTOR who looks vaguely like 
               Mumford playing him.

               IN MUMFORD'S APARTMENT the telephone is RINGING. Clearly, 
               it's not the first time. Mumford, watching the show intently, 
               lifts the headset an inch from the cradle and then hangs up. 
               When it immediately RINGS AGAIN, Mumford takes it off the 
               hook, cuts off the call, and buries the headset under a sofa 
               cushion.

               ON THE SHOW: scenes of tax investigation -- in the show's 
               version the IRS guys have drawn guns and are storming houses -- 
               are interspersed with scenes of sordid drug-taking.

                         fearless investigator... found himself 
                         on a downward spiral of drug abuse 
                         and dissolution...

               MUMFORD'S SISTER, the real thing, a plain, middle-aged West 
               Virginia woman, appears in a "dramatic", badly-lit interview. 
               (As with all the interviewees, she is identified by a supered 
               title.)

                         life had taken a wrong turn...

               A snapshot of some IRS-era party, happy revelers posing for 
               a flash. Camera PUSHES IN on Mumford, smiling and high, his 
               neck encircled by Gregory's arm. Candy is on the other side 
               of Gregory.

               IN AN ARIZONA TOWN, a monk with a clerical collar, BROTHER

               Mumford, in his apartment, watches with real emotion.

               His sister's face DISSOLVES into a new snapshot of Mumford, 
               dressed in an Orkin Exterminator uniform, as the MUSIC on

               Mumford comes out to the rail and looks off over the town of 
               Mumford.

               WHAT HE SEES (or imagines he sees): all across the nightscape, 
               one window in every house is glowing blue with flickering TV 
               light.

<b>               EXT. COOK HOUSE - NIGHT

               MOVING IN on the porch steps. Mumford runs into the shot. In 
               fact, he's run the whole way from his place and he's out of 
               breath. He takes the porch steps three at a time, rings the 
               doorbell, and waits.

               Mrs. Cook peeks out, then opens the front door, an especially 
               sour look on her face. She speaks through the screen door.

               Both Sofie and Mrs. Cook are set back for a moment. Mrs.

</b>                         Part of it. We were watching "ER" 
                         until someone called.

</b>                         You probably got the idea.

               Sofie comes outside. She doesn't get too close or look at 
               him as she walks to the other end of the porch.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         Do you know what a betrayal this 
                         is?...

               Mumford knows.

</b>                         ...How violated I feel?

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         You're not the only one...

               Sofie turns sharply to look at him, ready to blow up.

</b>                         Not me... all my other my patients. 
                         I smelled tar and feathers on the 
                         way over here.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         You deserve it.

               Mumford agrees. He watches her closely.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         I should be irate.

               Mumford immediately perks up. Sofie tries to correct --

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         I am irate!

                         But...

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This 
                         is a terrible thing you've done.

<b>                                     MUMFORD

                         that...

               Mumford steps closer to her.

</b>                         But, there is one... mitigating factor 
                         I want you to consider before you 
                         write me off.

</b>                         I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad 
                         mood.

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         I love you. More than I've ever loved 
                         anyone or anything in my life.

               She looks into his eyes.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         Oh.

                         with you... but I'm not sure you 
                         feel the same way.

               She regards him for several moments, her mind racing.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         I sort of do...

               Mumford feels joy. Now, finally, he takes her in his arms.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         ...but first, you have to tell me 
                         something...

               As Mumford breaks into a huge grin, CUT TO:

<b>               INT. COURTROOM, MUMFORD COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Mumford is at the defense table. Lionel is his lawyer. Sofie, 
               Mr. Cook and Ben sit right behind the rail.

<b>                                     JUDGE OTTO (O.S.)
</b>                         The defendant will rise.

               Mumford and Lionel stand up.

<b>                                     JUDGE OTTO (O.S.)
</b>                         Sit down, Lionel.

               Lionel sits down, squelched again. We see JUDGE OTTO for the 
               first time, a tough guy in his sixties.

<b>                                     JUDGE OTTO
</b>                         Clarence Norman White, do you 
                         understand how serious are the crimes 
                         with which you have been charged?

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         I do.

<b>                                     JUDGE OTTO
</b>                         Do you realize how insidious it is 
                         to invade the most private thoughts 
                         and secret lives of unsuspecting 
                         people?...

               WE SEE there's a pretty big turnout for this hearing. 
               Prominent among the onlookers: Lily and Skip, sitting 
               together; Nessa and Martin, holding hands; Dr. Delbanco and 
               MRS. DELBANCO. Gilroy, from the State Certification Board, 
               sits with the PROSECUTOR.

<b>                                     JUDGE OTTO
</b>                         ...People who have come to you with 
                         the faith that you know what you're 
                         doing... and that you are who you 
                         say you are?

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         Yes, your honor.

<b>                                     JUDGE OTTO
</b>                         It means absolutely nothing to me 
                         that so many of your patients have 
                         come forward with praise for you and 
                         your therapeutic skills. You 
                         understand that?

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         Yes.

               Follett is sitting in one of the back rows, apparently alone. 
               But now he looks down the row. Althea is sitting down at the 
               end in a stylish suit, completely appropriate, but a size 
               too small.

               She gives Follett a sidelong glance, then crosses her legs 
               provocatively. Whatever fantasy they're currently enacting 
               is working really well for both of them.

<b>                                     JUDGE OTTO
</b>                         Mr. White, I am frustrated that the 
                         criminal code in this state allows a 
                         maximum sentence of only six months 
                         and a maximum fine of only $2000.

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         I'm sorry, your honor.

<b>                                     JUDGE OTTO
</b>                         What?

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         I'm sorry you're frustrated.

<b>                                     JUDGE OTTO
</b>                         Are you disrespecting this court, 
                         Mr. White?

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.

<b>                                     JUDGE OTTO
</b>                         Maybe you can empathize with this -- 
                         Maximum fine. Three months in jail, 
                         three months house arrest. Sentence 
                         to begin immediately at the Orchard 
                         Valley Correctional Facility. Case 
                         closed. This court is adjourned.

               The judge slams down his gavel, stands up and stalks out. A 
               DEPUTY moves in to take custody of Mumford. Lionel stands up 
               and leans in --

<b>                                     LIONEL
</b>                         It's a country club. Don't worry 
                         about it.

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         Thanks for your help, Lionel.

               Mumford turns to face the Cooks. Mr. Cook and Ben shake his 
               hand like he's just won something. Lionel addresses them all 
               with his usual self-satisfaction --

<b>                                     LIONEL
</b>                         I'll have him out in half the time.

               WE PUSH IN on Mumford and Sofie, who embrace.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         You got off easy.

<b>                                     SOFIE
</b>                         We're only talking about six weeks.

</b>                         Of course... I haven't got the energy 
                         to get out of town that fast.

               They kiss. The Deputy takes Mumford's arm, and we --

</b>
<b>               INT. STATE CORRECTIONAL SEDAN - DAY
</b>
               Mumford is alone in the backseat, handcuffed to a metal 
               restraint. A lone COUNTY CORRECTIONAL OFFICER is up front, 
               driving. There's a heavy security screen divider between 
               front and back.

<b>                                     CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
</b>                         Better make yourself comfortable. We 
                         got a three hour drive here.

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         I'm fine.

<b>                                     CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
</b>                         You're the shrink, aren't you?

<b>                                     MUMFORD
</b>                         No, not really.

<b>                                     CORRECTIONAL OFFICER

</b>                         Not any more.

               They ride along in silence. At peace, Mumford watches the 
               town go by. Finally --

<b>                                     CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
</b>                         I'll tell you, Doc, the wife and I, 
                         we got a little bit of a problem. 
                         Would you mind if I just ran it by 
                         you?

               The Correctional Officer watches Mumford in the rear view 
               mirror, waiting hopefully. Mumford ponders the question a 
               long time, then gives a "what the hell" shrug.

<b>                                     MUMFORD

               The State Correctional Sedan heads out of the business 
               district toward the highway, leaving the town of Mumford 
               behind.
