   Garish purple light spills out of side-street porno houses,
   illuminating a silhouette, and little else, of a MAN leaning
   against an alley wall.

   He is waiting.

   Another silhouetted FIGURE appears and approaches the first.
   They size each other up as best they can.

<b>                                FIRST MAN
</b>                          MacLeod.

   The second nods.

   The first without hesitation raises a sword, the intended
   thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash
   of metal severs the agressor's head.

</b>
   A 15th century Scottish home.

   A haggard WOMAN, her small CHILD clinging to a tattered apron,
   stands hunched over a glowing hearth.  Her veined hands drag
   a wooden spoon around and around through a soot-covered pot
   of grey soup.

   From an adjoining room CONOR MACLEOD, a young man dressed up
   in his best traditional Celtic tartan, enters.

<b>                                MOTHER
</b>                          My, but are you the
                          picture.

<b>                                CONOR
</b>                          (surveying himself)
                          It's a bit tight.

   His FATHER enters with a pail of milk.

<b>                                FATHER
</b>                          Ah, Conor, how you look
                          a man.

<b>                                MOTHER
</b>                          Have you time for some-
                          thing to eat?

<b>                                CONOR
</b>                          No, Mother.  They'll be
                          here shortly.

   Conor's father looks him over with pride.

<b>                                FATHER
</b>                          Your grandfather wore
                          that in his service to
                          the King, and I to fight
                          for the Duke.

<b>                                MOTHER
</b>                          Must he go?

<b>                                FATHER
</b>                          Aye.  It is his duty.  All
                          of ours.

<b>                                MOTHER
</b>                          But Ian, he's still but a boy.

<b>                                FATHER
</b>                          He's a MacLeod.

<b>                                CONOR
</b>                          I'll be fine Mother.


<b>3  EXT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              3
</b>
   Several HORSEMEN gallop up through the early morning fog to
   the cottage door.

   Conor's father steps out to meet them.


<b>4  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            4
</b>
   A massive KNIGHT sits astride his horse, moorish dew cling-
   ing to his helmet and breastplate.  A CLANSMAN hikes up the
   heather-carpeted slope to him.

<b>                                CLANSMAN
</b>                          They march.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          Is the boy among them?

<b>                                CLANSMAN
</b>                          Aye.


<b>5  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                5
</b>
   The second kneels to examine the headless body of the first.

   With a CLACK a window, high on the alley wall, closes.


<b>6  EXT. HIGHLAND PLAIN - MORNING                                     6
</b>
   The DUKE is leading a brigade of CLANSMEN out onto the plain.
   Mounted VASSALS ride back and forth inspecting the line.  The
   low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards.  There
   is an erie, smothering silence.

<b>                                VASSAL #1
</b>                          Is a bad day for this.

<b>                                VASSAL #2
</b>                          The Duke has been compro-
                          mised.  He will have his due.

<b>                                VASSAL #1
</b>                          By day's end he will have
                          our heads.

<b>                                VASSAL #2
</b>                          We ride against the Suther-
                          lands.  That is all that
                          matters.

<b>                                VASSAL #1
</b>                          This makes no sense to me.

<b>   CONOR
</b>
   And a friend are marching through the moist heather.

<b>                                FRIEND
</b>                          The fog is bad.  We cannot
                          even see the sides of our
                          own ranks.

   Conor's nervousness is showing.

<b>                                FRIEND
</b>                          Is this your first?

<b>                                CONOR
</b>                          Aye.

  SHOUTING is heard on the plain.

<b>                                FRIEND
</b>                          It's begun.

<b>7  EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                            7
</b>
   The Knight, above the fog, hears the battle commence below.
   He spurs his horse and starts down into the mist.

<b>8  EXT. PLAIN - MORNING                                              8
</b>
   The two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan
   and clashing swords.  The air is charged with SHOUTS of ex-
   citement, agony, and the SHRILL of bag pipes.

   The fog has made each man's battle his own, each isolated with
   his opponent.

<b>   THE KNIGHT
</b>
   Rides calmly through the fracas.  He strikes and kills those
   that assault him, but appears disinterested in battle.

   He is looking.

<b>   CONOR
</b>
   Is standing above the twitching body of his friend.
   Alone and confused, Conor has become seperated from the clan.
   He stumbles through the fog, seeking help.

   Suddenly he is alone with the Knight.

   The face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy.  His fear turned
   to panic, Conor turns and flees.

   The Knight, his resolve steeled in a raised sword, kicks his
   horse into persuit.

   Conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the Knight
   brings his blade down hard into Conor's shoulder, slicing
   open most of the boy's back and knocking him face-first into
   the heather.

   As Conor watches his own blood spew forth, he rolls over in
   time to see the Knight dismount and start for him.

<b>   THE KNIGHT
</b>
   Leans down next to Conor, his metal face nearly against the
   boy's.  His voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          There can be but one.

<b>   A CLANSMAN
</b>
   Charges out of the fog and attacks the Knight, who cuts him
   nearly in half.  ANOTHER wanders in and meets the same fate.

   The battle is shifting to where they are.

   Not finished yet with Conor, the Knight is finding himself
   forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail-
   ants.

<b>   A VASSAL
</b>
   Sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now-mounted
   Knight.

<b>                                VASSAL #1
</b>                          Leave him!

   The clansmen obey.

   With the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed, the
   Knight disappears into the fog.

   The Vassal surveys the carnage before him.  His eyes fall a
   moment on the moaning, gurgling Conor.

   The Vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead.


<b>9  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                9
</b>
   A patrol car pauses at the mouth of the alley.

   The figure considers his situation, then quickly shoves his
   sword into a near-by drain.  He straightens up and waits.

<b>   AN OFFICER
</b>
   Steps out of his unit and cautiously walks forward.  His PARTNER
   switches on the patrol car's side lamps, bathing the alley
   in a harsh glare.

<b>   MAN IN ALLEY
</b>
   For the first time we can see his face.  RICHARD TAUPIN, clad
   in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor.

   The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively
   for his pistol.  He yells to his partner now coming into the
   alley.

<b>                                OFFICER #1
</b>                          Kevin!  Get is a backup.

<b>                                TAUPIN
</b>                          I was merely walking by
                          when-

<b>                                OFFICER #1
</b>                          Don't move.

   The officer has his pistol out and leveled.
   His partner runs up, shotgun in hand.

<b>                                OFFICER #2
</b>                          They're on their way.

   His voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe.

<b>                                OFFICER #2
</b>
                          Christ.

    Conor lies moaning on a cot.  Makeshift bandages wrap his
    body, stained and pasted by thick, dried blood.

    The family surrounds their dying son.

    A PRIEST is delivering the last rites.

<b>                                PRIEST
</b>                          ...Libera Domine Animan

    His sobbing mother holds a compress to Conor's forehead.

<b>                                PRIEST
</b>                          ...In mamus tuas domine

<b>11  EXT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              11
</b>
    A Vassal rides up to the hutch, dismounts, and approaches a
    CLANSMAN standing in the open doorway.

<b>                                VASSAL #1
</b>                          Has the boy died?

<b>                                CLANSMAN
</b>                          He is having the last rites
                          now.  It should be over by
                          morning.

<b>                                VASSAL #1
</b>                          Never seen anybody cut as
                          bad live so long.  He should
                          have died on the field.

<b>                                CLANSMAN
</b>                          Tonight or tomorrow, it's
                          all the same.

    The Vassal peers inside at the priest administering the
    sacraments.

<b>                                PRIEST

    There is a bustle of activity.  Setting up barricades, uni-
    formed OFFICERS are trying to keep NEW CREWS and curious
    ONLOOKERS at a distance.

<b>    DETECTIVE LT. MORAN
</b>
    Lean, fortyish, and comfortable with the gore in front of him,
    is inspecting the corpse with a MEDICAL EXAMINER.

<b>                                EXAMINER
</b>                             (studying body)
                          Real clean.  No sawing
                          action at all.  Whatever
                          it was did it in one
                          swipe.
                           (looks up at Moran)
                          Like the other one.

    Moran gestures to a sword, wrapped in plastic, lying nearby.

<b>                                MORAN
</b>                          What about that?

<b>                                EXAMINER
</b>                          Hasn't any blood on it.

<b>                                MORAN
</b>                             (looking around)
                          About the only thing
                          that doesn't.

<b>                                EXAMINER
</b>                          I'll give it a closer
                          look when I get back.

<b>    BRENNA CARTWRIGHT
</b>
    Pretty but not beautiful, thirtyish, she exudes a sort of
    insolent intelligence.

    An OFFICER sees her duck under a police barricade.

<b>                                OFFICER #3
</b>                          Come on Brenna, you know
                          better than that.

<b>                                BRENNA
</b>                          I'm invited.

    She walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his
    equipment.

<b>                                BRENNA
</b>                              (greeting)
                          Mr. Levine...

    The examiner turns and smiles.

<b>                                EXAMINER
</b>                          Hope this isn't past your
                          bedtime.

    Brenna looks to the now-sheeted corpse, blood flowing from
    where the head should be.

<b>                                BRENNA
</b>                          Doesn't have a head,
                          does he?

<b>                                EXAMINER
</b>                          This one came unassembled.

    Lt. Moran is standing near.

<b>                                MORAN
</b>                             (no warmth)
                          Just show her what she came
                          for, Tom.

<b>                                EXAMINER

                          Come on, this is more
                          your line of work.

    Brenna and the examiner walk the few yards from the corpse
    to the sword.

<b>                                EXAMINER
</b>                          How's your uncle?  I hardly
                          ever see him anymore.

</b>                          Fine.

    The examiner stops and gestures to the weapon clothed in
    forensic plastic.

<b>                                EXAMINER
</b>                          There you go.

    Brenna's expression changes to interest as she kneels down
    beside it.

<b>                                EXAMINER

    Moran reaches into a bag on the table and removes a large
    broad sword; old, but in mint condition.

    An empty mug is set on the counter of a medieval drinking
    establishment.

    CLANSMEN, their faces and clothes smudged with a day's work in
    the fields, relax and enjoy the company of their fellow VILLAGERS.

    The owner unenthusiastically fills Conor a mug.  Conor takes
    it and walks to where four other VILLAGERS sit.

    Silence.

    Angered, Conor approaches the second man.  As he looms above
    his chair the man in genuine fear pulls out a cross and thrusts
    it forward.

    He walks to the doorway where his mother and father wait.

    His mother, tears on her cheek, hugs him tightly.

    Taupin steps out of a Metro station and walks the few blocks
    to his brick townhouse.  Climbing the front stairs, he fishes
    his keys out of a coat pocket.  About to insert the key he stops,
    sensing something.

    Backing down the steps, Taupin slips around to the rear of the
    building.

    Like a spider Taupin pries open a window and slips silently
    inside.

    The home is dark and still.

    Taupin creeps down the hallway and peers into the entryway.
    There a MAN, dressed in a tuxedo jacket and nearly imperceptible
    in the dim light, is crouched at the front door.

    He is holding a sword.

    Taupin removes a knife from his pocket and JUMPS the intruder.
    The two STRUGGLE fiercely.

    Taupin pins the intruder against the carpet and shoves his
    knife firmly against the man's throat.

                          all the babies I delivered were
                          from local families.  Richard's

                          when his mother's time came.  I
                          did it right here at the house.

    a New England college diploma, and a police uniform hanging
    from the bedpost where Brenna lies with another man, DENNIS.

                          me, Lieutenant.

    In no hurry, Taupin leads his horse away.

    Brenna sits surrounded by books of old English law, colorful
    family banner plates, and a medieval caltrap sitting on her
    desk corner.

    Boring quickly, she shuts the book and sighs.  From another
    folder she pulls out a computer sheet.

<b>    INSERT COMPUTER SHEET
</b>
    The police sheet has Taupin's name and motor vehicle record.
    Below are listed four WILLIAM TAUPINS, their hometowns and
    driving records.  Richard Taupin's first driver permit was in
<b>    1967.
</b>
    Brenna looks down the list to a WILLIAM TAUPIN of Felton,
    Delaware, who stopped filling for driver permits in 1967, the
    year Richard started.

    removes and opens up a map of the State of Delaware.

    Brenna steps out of her car at a small town cemetary.

    Holding a slip of paper, she weaves her way through the shade
    covered tombs of revolutionary heroes and their descendants.

    On a small rise fresh dirt lies in careless piles around an
    open grave.

    Richard Taupin stands at the mouth of the pit.

    A coffin has been brutally pulled from the dirt and lies open
    and propped diagonally beside a marker that reads: "WILLIAM
<b>    MICHAEL TAUPIN".
</b>
    The casket is empty.

    A flash of interest, quickly suppressed.

</b>                          I don't know what you're talking

    He starts for the gate.

</b>                          I could find him.

    Taupin stops.

</b>                          I have friends.

                          Good day, Miss Cartwright.

    He walks on.

    After only a few paces Taupin suddenly shudders to an abrupt
    stop.

<b>                                BRENNA
</b>                          What's wrong?

    He holds up an open palm to silence her.

</b>                          Your help may be unneccessary.

    The air is still.

    Taupin's face is expressionless.  He listens intently.  Sensing.

    An unseen voice rides seemingly on the wind.

<b>                                VOICE
</b>                                (o.s.)
                          Good afternoon, "Mr. Taupin".

    Taupin whirls around to see a large man standing with broad
    sword in hand.  We have never seen the knight out of his armor
    before, but this man certainly seems to fit the bill.  Wearing
    Levis and leather jacket in contrast to Taupin's expensive
    business suit, he speaks with icy evenness from a face of stone.

    Taupin, naked without his own sword, is trapped against a
    marble wall.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          Long time.

<b>                                TAUPIN
</b>                          Not so long.

    The Knight is closing in on him, sword gripped in both hands.

<b>                                TAUPIN
</b>                          You've been here from the
                          start.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          My quarry grows clever with
                          age.  And the others, incompetent.

    The Knight throws Brenna a glance.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          Friend of yours?

<b>                                TAUPIN
</b>                          Of sorts.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          I do hope she enjoys a good
                          show.


    The Knight leans his whole body into a two-fisted swing,
    clanging out a chunk of marble as Taupin ducks.

    A second swipe also imbeds itself in stone.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          So now it ends.

    A thrust cuts only air.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          Generation upon generation.
                          Tens of thousands of miles.

    Taupin leaps behind a tree.  The Knight cuts it nearly in half.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          You're the last, MacLeod.
                          Romirez, Lacroux, Neuvich,
                          those fools that followed
                          me, their heads all line my
                          shelf.  All but yours.

    Taupin drops to the ground in a shoulder roll to avoid a swipe.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          Can you feel it, MacLeod?
                          Can you _feel_ it!

    Taupin grabs a tree branch and raps the Knight on the knee,
    knocking him over.

    The Knight quickly rights himself and cuts the branch from
    Taupin.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          There can be but one.

    He raises his blade.

    An elderly WATCHMAN, shotgun cradled in his arms, stands in
    the clearing.

<b>                                WATCHMAN
</b>                          Hey!  What's going on here?

    The Knight pauses a split second then with decision launches
    his sword spear-style firmly into the watchman's chest.

    Taupin pushes past him to Brenna.

<b>                                TAUPIN
</b>                          Run!

    Brenna is frozen in shock.
    Taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate.

<b>                                TAUPIN
</b>                          Run!

</b><b>                          MACLEOD!
</b>
    The Knight retrieves his sword from the watchman's body and
    lumbers after them.

    Taupin and Brenna bolt from the cemetary and into the surround-
    ing residential area.

    Taupin leads an exhausted Brenna in a gallop down the side-
    walk.

    They have apparently lost the Knight.  Taupin pauses at a
    corner.  He sees a church across the street.


<b>38  INT. CHURCH                                                     38

    Brenna enters and collapses into a pew, her labored breathing
    echoing off the high ceiling.

    Taupin walks the length of an aisle to see that they are alone.
    Satisfied, he leans against a banister and considers his sit-
    uation.

    Trying to recover her wind, Brenna has her eyes closed and
    head against the back of the pew.

</b>                          What the hell is going on?

    Taupin stares out the window, stained glass shining orange on
    his face.  He looks at Brenna briefly, then passes through the
    Church's doorway without a word.

    A glowing horseshoe HISSES wildly as it slips into a wooden
    cooling bucket.  Pulling it out with iron tongs, Conor lays
    it on a counter and pounds it even with a mallet.

    Sweaty and streaked with dirt, he tosses the mallet aside
    and walks out into the late afternoon sunshine.

    runs from Conor's shoulder blade to his waist.

    Romirez suddenly draws his sword and thrusts it into Conor's

    A shudder, then Conor slides off the blade and crashes to the
    ground.

    An old man, MR. NORTH, leads Taupin up the drive of a rural
    farmhouse somewhere in the hinterland of Pennsylvania.

</b>                          Most of the furniture was put

    Brenna sits alone.  Whatever nervousness she brought through the
    door with her has been turned into a comfortable cynicism by
    the three empty glasses in front of her.

<b>    A MAN

    With something less than perfect coordination, sits down beside

    Taupin's lager is drained.  Lost in thought, he drags a finger
    around and around the lip of the mug.

    He hand stops.  It twitches.  Shakes.

    Taupin pulls his hand from the glass and watches it shake slightly
    out of control.  A warning.

    He WHIRLS around suddenly to see LING KAHN, Asian, standing
    over him.

                          the quality of this year's collection
                          is well worth the time.

    The Knight BURSTS in with his leather carrying bag.  Brenna
    slides along the draped back wall to avoid him.

                          at 4,000 dollars.

    The Knight closes in on Brenna casually, without hurry.

    The guard notices she has no lapel number and starts for her
    very officially.

    Being closed in on from both sides, Brenna suddenly runs across
    the room to a fire exit, setting off an ALARM as she flies open
    the door.

    The Knight leaps after her, knocking over an OLD WOMAN in the
    front row.

    Brenna runs the sidewalk and disappears into a Metro station.

    Brenna runs down the platform and jumps into a subway car
    just as the doors shut.

<b>    THE KNIGHT

    is also now on the platform but can only watch Brenna through
    a window as the train pulls away.

    Brenna KNOCKS at the front door.  No answer.

    She KNOCKS harder.  The unlatched door pushes open.

    Brenna stands in the doorway.

    Before her is a disaster.  Furniture has been smashed like
    matchsticks.  A desk drawer's contents lie strewn in piles on
    the floor.

    Brenna enters slowly.

                          you.

    Nothing has been left unturned or unbroken.

    Brenna kneels and sifts through a pile of crumpled papers.
    She comes across an old black and white photograph.  Badly
    streaked and faded, it shows Taupin standing beside a farm-
    house.  Written in the corner is "Worstick, 1928".

    Brenna slips the photo into her pocket.  Standing, she turns
    smack into Taupin.

    He looks past her to the destruction of his living room.  It
    doesn't seem to surprise him.

    On a clear rise above the village Romirez and Conor spar with
    swords covered in heavy cloth.  Conor is having difficulty.

    Conor strikes.  Romirez easily blocks.

</b>                          Harder!  You swing like an impotent

                          now if only he had an arm.

    Ticked off, Conor leans himself into a two-fisted swing.
    Romirez knocks it aside, but Conor recovers faster than he,
    knocking Romirez flat on his back.

<b>                                CONOR

</b>                          Muy Bien!

    Conor drops the sword and wipes the sweat from his face.

    Romirez pours wine from a leather bag into a goblet pulled
    from his belt.  He offers it to Conor.

<b>                                ROMIREZ

                          girl's thigh.

    Conor accepts the cup.  Romirez pulls himself to his feet.

<b>                                ROMIREZ
</b>                          It will take less effort

</b>                          It's like to kill me first.

    Romirez puts his arm around Conor and refills his cup.

    Romirez put his arm around Conor and leads him away.

    A friendly horse race.  Their reflections bouncing off a clear
    glen, Conor and Romirez dodge moss-laiden ruts and leap fallen
    tree trunks.

    Beaming, Conor pushes through a last turn and stops to wait
    for Romirez, several lengths behind.

</b>                          Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.

    Both their eyes turn to the beauty in view.  Romirez pulls a
    leaf from a tree and studies it closely.

                          for that.

    He pulls the leaf's points from the stalk, one by one.

</b>                          As they age they contribute to a

                          to know it, is to be in touch with

</b>                          You must be.  You have responsibilities.
                          You must learn the rules.  You can never
                          attract attention to yourself, never
                          show the side that will draw others to
                          you.  You will always know when you are
                          in the presence of another.  Beware.
                          But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will
                          be your battle against time.  In the
                          coming years you will see kingdoms rise
                          then rot like wheat.  People will
                          become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The
                          only constant you will know will be
                          the others and the tradition their
                          greed and quest represent.  But life
                          without morality, without the ability
                          to truly taste the sweetness of wine
                          and love, is no life at all.  That is
                          how the others exist.  Nothing more
                          than walking corpses living only to
                          slaughter each other in an insane quest
                          to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed
                          to the earth.  Do not become one of them.

    Romirez enters and flops onto a cot.
    Settling down for a nap, he sets his sword beneath the bed
    and closes his eyes to the distant sound of CHILDREN playing.

    The room is still.
    Romirez begins to drowse.

    Suddenly his eyes leap open with full alertness.
    His hand moves under the cot.

    With an EXPLOSION the front door is lifted from its hinges
    and splintered into fragments.  Passing through a cloud of
    sawdust enters the Knight.  Without pause he topples a kitchen
    shelf onto a supine Romirez.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          Romirez.  What a surprise.

    Romirez is struggling under the debris.
    The Knight thrusts hard onto an exposed leg.
    The limb is severed.

</b>                          Madonna!

    The Knight begins casting aside the shelving.
    With lightning speed Romirez pulls the sword from beneath the
    bed and hammers it deep into the Knight's side.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          Bastard!

    He crashes back against the wall.

    Romirez tries to lift himself from the bed using his sword
    as a crutch.

    The Knight has regained a meager balance on his knees.
    Blood pours from the slice in his stomach,

    Romirez pushes himself across the bed, plants his sword into
    the floor and hobbles a few paces before collapsing.

    The Knight crawls across the bed and drops to his knees
    beside Romirez.

    doorway and tumbles into the street.

<b>    A CHILD SCREAMS.

    Pulling himself up, the Knight hobbles away.

    Conor rushes in and shudders to a stop.

    An entire wall is showered with blood.
    Conor walks slowly forward.  Dazed.

    As he looks down something takes his attention.

    It is Romirez's severed head.

    Conor moans in anguish and drops to his knees on the blood-
    stained floor.

    His head sinks to his chest as he begins sobbing.

</b>                          Regiment ready for review, sir.

    Dupont walks past the sargeant to the line.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                              (to soldier)
                          Stand straight, you are a soldier
                          of the King.

<b>                                SOLDIER #1
</b>                          Yes sir.

    Dupont continues down the line.  Another soldier's infantry
    jacket is almost hilariously mis-buttoned, one collar sticking
    up four inches higher than the other.

    Dupont with both hands rips open the soldier's coat, spraying
    brass buttons onto the ground.

    He moves on.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                              (to soldier)
                          Where is your bayonet?

<b>                                SOLIDER #3
</b>                          Lost it sir.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          Where?

    The soldier hedges.

<b>                                STAFF SARGEANT
</b>                          You heard the Major!  Where!

<b>                                SOLDIER #3
</b>                          Whorehouse sir.

    Dupont's face softens in exasperation, then toughens.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          Your rifle.  Hand it to me.

    The soldier obeys.  Dupont inspects the firing mechanism.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          The flint is cracked.  No spark
                          will reach your powder.  You will
                          die tomorrow.

    He throws the rifle roughly back into the soldier's hands.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          Tomorrow you go to _battle_!  And
                          you look like children!
                                (beat)
                          The General has charged me with
                          seeing that you are prepared, and
                          prepared you will be!  If necessary
                          you stand here all night!  Sargeant!

    The sargeant leaps to attention.

<b>                                SARGEANT
</b>                          Yes sir.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          See to it.

<b>                                SARGEANT
</b>                          Yes sir.

    Dupont turns briskly, then stops abruptly as if alerted by some-
    thing.  He whirls around and faces the young infantrymen.

    His expression is quizzical as he walks the line, checking
    each face carefully.

    One PRIVATE seizes his attention.  The private is cautious.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          Your name?

<b>                                MULET
</b>                          Mulet.

    It is as if Dupont knows him.  The two stare at each other.
    Dupont turns and leaves.


<b>90  INT. COTTAGE - EVENING                                          90
</b>
    Inside a small farmhouse commandeered for officer's quarters,
    Dupont (Conor) and several others eat their evening meal.

    A CAPTAIN finishes his story.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                                (amused)
                          ...And what a sight!  That old
                          mare just kept falling over her
                          own guts till someone finally
                          shot her.

    The OFFICERS LAUGH.  All but Dupont.

<b>                                MAJOR
</b>                              (beside Dupont)
                          Complete your inspection?

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          They're nothing but boys.  It
                          will be a slaughter tomorrow.

<b>                                MAJOR
</b>                                (laughs)
                          I doubt much can change that.
                          The enemy has five brigades
                          waiting for us.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          We need more time.

<b>                                MAJOR
</b>                          Won't get it.
                               (shrugs)
                          We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.

    Dupont pokes unenthusiastically at his plate.

<b>                                MAJOR
</b>                          Eat up Dupont.  It will probably
                          be your last.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                                (rises)
                          Not likely.

    Dupont goes to the window.  Dusk shines orange on his face.

    In the foreground the man Dupont encountered at the line-up,
    Mulet, is chopping firewood.


<b>91  EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                            91
</b>
    Several hours later.
    Most are asleep.  Mulet continues his wood splitting.

    From out of the dark cottage steps Dupont.

<b>                                DUPONT (CONOR)
</b>                          I thought I gave orders the
                          regiment was to drill.

<b>                                MULET
</b>                          Staff sargeant detailed me to
                          prepare firewood for the break-
                          fast cooking.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          What is your position?

<b>                                MULET

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          I understand you joined up in
                          Bremen.

<b>                                MULET
</b>                          You seem to understand a great
                          deal.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          I am a Major, Private.  You would
                          do well remembering that when
                          addressing me.

<b>                                MULET
</b>                          Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we
                          spoke as equals.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          Equals?

<b>                                MULET
</b>                               (shrugs)
                          If you wish to play games, Major.

    Mulet returns to his chore.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          Wait.  I think we understand each
                          other.

<b>                                MULET
</b>                          We have no understanding.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          Then it is time two of us did.
                          You are very young.  I was once
                          young.  I can help.

    Mulet LAUGHS.

<b>                                MULET
</b>                          Help?  I've seen others "help".
                          Somehow a head always ended up
                          on the counter.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          It can be different.  It must be.

<b>                                MULET
</b>                          It never changes, Major.

    Mulet turns to his chore.  Dupont grabs his arm.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          We must talk.

</b>                             (shakes him off)
                          Stay out of it.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                                (angry)
                          Don't threaten me, Private.

<b>                                MULET
</b>                                (disgust)
                          Who do you think I am?  One of your
                          freckle faced children waiting to
                          die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You
                          and I just living will always be a
                          threat.  Forever.  Look at your life,
                          Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there
                          but threat.  Threats and nothingness.
                          It's what we live for.

    Mulet turns his back on Dupont.
    Dupont draws his cutlass.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          Do not turn your back on me.

<b>                                MULET
</b>                          You are really going to force this,
                          aren't you?

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          Either you are with me or against me.

    Mulet turns slowly, axe in hand.

<b>                                MULET
</b>                          Have I a choice?

    The two stare into eyes empty of emotion.

    Mulet's hand flinches.  An attack?

    Dupont CUTS quickly, slicing open both of Mulet's arms.
    The axe drops to the ground.

    Mulet seems strangely calm.

<b>                                MULET
</b>                          You see Major?  You are not so
                          different.

    Dupont cuts off Mulet's head where he stands.

    Dupont drags the corpse across the meadow and dumps it into
    a swamp.

    It is very late.  Only a few OFFICERS are seated in the pews.
    Dupont tries to concentrate on prayer, but is distracted.

<b>                                MULET
</b>                             (voice flashback)

                          different...

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          I had no choice.

    Dupont sighs and looks to the altar.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          Who am I deceiving?

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          Certainly not me.

    Dupont whirls around to see the Knight, dressed as he in uniform,
    sitting one row behind.

    Dupont leaps to his feet.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          You needn't look so flushed,
                          Major.  You are quite safe in
                          church.

    Dupont eases his breathing.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          State of grace and all that.

<b>                                DUPONT

</b>                          It's all we have.

    Dupont has backed up a few paces.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          All this time and still a scared
                          little boy.

    Dupont sits down.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          Not so scared.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          Perhaps not.
                               (smiles)
                          You seem to have misplaced a
                          private.  No doubt by now his
                          head is stranger to his neck.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          No doubt.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          You surprise me.  Eliminating a
                          rival like that.  Such are the
                          actions of a man of conquest.  I
                          was mistaken.  300 years have
                          turned the boy's fear into ambit-
                          ion.

<b>                                DUPONT
</b>                          You're wrong.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          I know you very well, Conor MacLeod.
                          And I can see the truth beginning
                          to make itself clear to you.  Mulet,
                          Romirez, they were fools without
                          vision.  It was destined that the
                          board would be cleared for the real
                          players.

    The Knight almost seems proud of Dupont.

<b>                                DUPONT

</b>                          Romirez is dust.

    The Knight looks to the altar.

<b>                                KNIGHT

     She hugs him tightly.

     Conor's face softens as he brings up an arm to hold her.

     An auditorium has been transformed with colored lights and
     strung paper into a small town party.

     TEENAGERS in period dress control the floor, dancing to a
     decidedly un-period ROCK BAND.

     The OLDER GUESTS are gathered around the punch bowl talking
     crops or Pennsylvania politics.

     Fitted as well as can be expected in her lace dress, enters
     with Taupin, himself dressed in a formal suit complete with cape.

     His clothes fit perfectly.

     Mr. North, comically dressed as a pirate, greets them.

                          up.

     They go to the table.

     Taupin pours a glass of punch.  An ELDERLY WOMAN approaches him.

     The rock band finished as a PORTLY MAN in a union soldier's
     uniform takes the microphone.

<b>                                PORTLY

                          more traditional dancing.

     The rock band gives ground to a group of older MUSICIANS.  With
     a nod from the union soldier they begin a folk tune with fiddles
     and hammer dulcimer.

     The costumed guests take to the floor.

<b>                                BRENNA

     Taupin starts into it with perfect grace.  A faltering Brenna
     tries to keep up.

<b>                                BRENNA
</b>                          William Taupin seems to have left

     They do a final turn and finish.  The other DANCERS applaud.

</b>                          You're using your son's

                          grave with my name on it.
                          Twenty years later I
                          became the son.

     Brenna is staring at him.

     He leads her to a table.

</b>                          That's impossible.

     Several of the ELDERLY WOMEN are watching Taupin from across
     the room.

     A bus with "Gettysburg" across the front pulls to a stop at
     a dark terminal.  A lone passenger steps off into the mist.
     It is the Knight, bound up in a leather jacket and carrying
     only a long, narrow case.

     Brenna and Taupin walk alone in the night outside the hall.

</b>                          It's frightening sometimes the

     Brenna pulls away.

                          murderer.  A very old murderer,
                          but a murderer just the same.

</b>                          Just a little crazy.

     A thoughtful pause.

<b>                                TAUPIN
</b>                          Miss Cartwright, it's time I

     Taupin and Brenna descend the stairs to a seemingly flush wall.

     Taupin reaches behind a bookcase and pulls something.  A press
     from his hand and the wall becomes a doorway.

<b>                                TAUPIN

                          Miss Cartwright?

     Brenna steps uneasily into the darkness.  Taupin follows and
     switches on the light.

     Brenna's expression changes to awe.

     The room is massive, a cross between a museum and an old attic.
     Suits of armor, Italian statuettes, Czech ironworks, Persian
     fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras
     crowd the shelving and floor space.

     The room has the look of ownership, as if civilization had
     taken the time to keep a scrapbook.

</b>                          I had this room built some
                          time ago.

     Brenna picks up a Carolingian tapestry and runs her hand along
     its intricate weaving.

<b>                                BRENNA

</b>                          I'd like you to try.

     Taupin picks up a Byzantine icon, brushing the dust from its
     shoulders.

     RELATIVES in period dress watch as a family member is lowered
     into the ground.

     A very OLD WOMAN stands stoically, supported on both sides by
     her middle aged SONS.

<b>                                MINISTER

                          Jason, son of Katherine-

     The old woman.

</b>                          And brother to Howard and James-

     The two middle aged sons.

<b>     CONOR
</b>
     Watches the funeral quietly at a distance.

<b>     THE OLD WOMAN
</b>
     As the minister continues allows her gaze to wander.  She sees
     Conor standing at the treeline.  Her eyes crinkle in disbelief.

     Releasing herself from her sons, she hobbles toward Conor.
     Confused, the brothers watch their mother leave the ceremony.

<b>     CONOR
</b>
     Watches the woman approach but decides against moving.
     She stops a few paces away and looks over him.

<b>                                OLD WOMAN
</b>                          You.

</b>                          He never knew you.

     The two sons come up behind.  The three stand there: an old
     woman who could be 60 years Conor's senior and her two sons
     old enough to be his father.

     Taupin and Brenna lie together.

     Running her hands along the contours of his body she sees the
     countless faint scars of bullet and sword wounds.

     Taupin strokes her softly.

     of documents.

     into the car.

                          They found the receipt
                          in his townhouse.  It was

     Brenna is standing at a counter signing the last of a stack.

     The clerk fills out a small sheet and hands it to her.

<b>                                CLERK
</b>                          Just take this down

     A pair of Levis follow Brenna at a distance down the corridor.

     Sealed from the corridor by a pair of doors, two CLERKS
     sit in an office mostly cleared of employees.

     Brenna hands the slip to a clerk.

<b>                                CLERK #2
</b>                          I'll be right back.

     She disappears into the rear area.

</b>                          Around the corner.

     Brenna steps around and takes a drink.  She looks into her
     reflection on the stainless steel and spends a moment fiddling
     with her hair.

<b>     THE CLERK
</b>
     Still hasn't returned.  Brenna drums her fingers on the
     counter top and looks around the office.

     The second clerk is also gone.

     Brenna sees something unfamiliar on the second clerk's desk.
     She steps over to it.

     It is a large blood stain.

     Brenna shoots a glance to the double doors.
     They're closed.

     Brenna rushes to the doors.  Someone's locked them.
     She struggles with the handles, then turns to see the Knight
     walking to her with his stained sword.

     With a SCREAM she kicks a rolling office chair into him and
     runs down an opposite corridor.

<b>     THE KNIGHT
</b>
     Flings the chair aside and knocks open the door with a SLAM
     of his palm.

<b>     BRENNA
</b>
     Has run out of corridor.  She looks back at the Knight closing
     the distance.  CRYING in fear, she frantically searches for
     a way out.

     The Knight is nearly upon her.

     In desperation she runs into a janitorial closet, closing
     its heavy door.

<b>     THE CLOSET
</b>
     Is dark and full of old paint cans and mops.  Her BREATHING
     is at a PANIC.

<b>     THE KNIGHT
</b>
     Tries the door handle.
     Stepping back, he lifts his sword and HAMMERS it deep into
     the wood.

<b>                                BRENNA

     He STRIKES again.  And again.  Splinters smack against surround-
     ing walls.

<b>                                BRENNA

                          away!

     CRYING hysterically, Brenna presses herself against the far
     wall, sliding to the floor in a crouch.

<b>     THE KNIGHT
</b>
     Steps back and gives the door a last two-fisted swing.
     Brenna SCREAMS.
     The door collapses.

     A twenty-five foot bronze of Thomas Jefferson flanked by his
     quotations.

     A sword in one hand and Brenna in the other, the Knight stands
     at the statue's base.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          Welcome.

     Taupin stands at the entrance.

</b>                          Kahn sends his best.

     In a corner the Asian's head lies on its side, the horror of
     death still pressed into the face.  Taupin's eyes return slowly
     to the Knight and Brenna.

<b>                                TAUPIN
</b>                          Let her go.

    The Knight throws Brenna roughly against a wall.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          You disappoint me.
                             (looks at Brenna)
                          I thought you'd finally gotten over
                          that sort of thing.

</b>                          As you wish.

    The Knight holds his sword out at a ceremonial angle.  Taupin
    does the same.  The weapons are CLANKED together twice, then
    pulled back into battle position.

    The two begin walking a circle, poised swords waiting for an
    opening.

    The Knight leaps first, his clash of steel RINGING off the high
    walls.

    Another ATTACK without result.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          You can do better than that.

    Taupin swings.  The Knight jumps back.  Sweat gleams from their
    brows.

    The Knight and Taupin are PANTING heavily.

    The Knight goes low.  Taupin blocks.  The Knight comes overhead
    quickly.  Taupin misjudges and the blade slices deep into his
    shoulder and chest.  The impact knocks him flat on his back.

    The Knight looks down on his wounded prey.

    A SCREECH of brakes from outside the monument.  Two OFFICERS
    are coming up the steps.

<b>                                KNIGHT

    Taupin looks at Brenna and the dead policemen.  A resignation
    sweeps over him.

    Taupin struggles to his feet.  Blood pouring from his shirt, he
    stands uneasily with his sword at ready.

    The Knight swings.  Taupin blocks.

    Taupin is badly outclassed.

    He feebly fends off an attack, but the Knight returns quickly
    with a savage SLICE that rips open Taupin's stomach and throws
    him again to the floor.

<b>                                BRENNA

</b>                          You will be silent!!

    The voice is THUNDERING.

    Taupin kneels with his forehead pressed against the floor.  His
    teeth grind in pain.

    The Knight smiles.

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          I do hope you're enjoying this

    Moran draws his pistol.
    The Knight walks toward him,

<b>                                KNIGHT
</b>                          This is nothing that concerns you.

    The Knight raises his sword.

</b>                          You will leave!

    Two EXPLOSIONS as Moran FIRES.  The slugs slam into the Knight,
    blowing him off his feet.

    He lies still.

    Moran looks to Brenna.  To Taupin.  Then he walks closer to the
    Knight.

<b>                                TAUPIN

                          Don't.

    Taupin curls in a spasm of pain.
    Moran moves closer.

    The Knight lies face down, blood oozing from exit wounds over
    his heart.  He isn't breathing.

    Moran bends over slowly to see the Knight's face.

<b>                                TAUPIN
</b>                          Stop.  You don't understand.

    The Knight suddenly rolls over and plants his sword into Moran's
    chest.  The pistol DISCHARGES against a far wall.

    Taupin crawls for the Knight.

    Moran's mouth opens but no sound escapes.  The Knight, blood
    pouring from his mouth and nose, thrusts deeper then retracts
    quickly.

    Moran slides off the sword dead.

    Taupin CUTS hard against the Knight's chest.  The Knight GAGS
    in surprise and crumples.  Taupin CUTS again, then puts the
    blade against the Knight's GURGLING throat.

<b>                                TAUPIN

    He raises the sword.

</b>                          Requiescant in pace.

    And CUTS the Knight's head off.

    Taupin drops his sword.
    His breathing quickens.
    A sensation sweeps over him.

    Taupin drops to the floor WHIMPERING.  He sucks in painful gulps
    of air.

<b>                                BRENNA
</b>                          My God.

    Taupin bolts up and looks at her without seeing.

    Taupin is looking past her.

    A blood-stained hand suddenly GRABS Brenna's shoulder.  She
    SCREAMS.  The headless body of the Knight stands beside her.

<b>    THE KNIGHT'S HEAD

    Lies on the floor.
    The eyes open.  The face pulls into a smile.

    The eyes roll up into the skull.  The face slackens.

    The hulking mass standing beside Brenna sways, the collapses
    to the ground.

<b>    TAUPIN
</b>
    Is CRYING.  Not from wounds he no longer feels, but from something
    else.

    to force itself into him.

    Brenna tries to hold him.  He pushes her savagely away.

    it from the carriage and tears it to pieces.

    The thoughts won't come.

    Brenna sits on the expanse of grass throwing scraps to a group
    of wild park cats.

    A shadow covers her face.  She looks up.

    It is Taupin.

    Something has changed him.  His face is less cynical.  More
    vulnerable.  More human.

    He sits down on the grass beside her.

                          but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment
                          of love, is that not worth a lifetime?

    He holds her.  They hold each other.

                          long.

    A jogger runs by, unaware of any life but his own.
