<b>    SPACE
</b>
    Distant STARS, with vast tracts of darkness stretching
    between them. Move in on OUR SUN, dwarfed in the immense
    cosmic ocean.

<b>                    MUMBLE (VO)
</b>          You ever feel small?

    Moving in on....

<b>    PLANET EARTH
</b>
    The spinning blue marble.

    FADE IN: A strange cacophony of MUSIC, growing louder as the
    familiar CONTINENTS revolve below us and we spiral down onto
<b>    ANTARCTICA
</b>

<b>    THE ICE SHELF
</b>
    Vast, pristine, stupendous. Washed with dawn light. A few
    small BLACK-SUITED FIGURES are moving towards us.

<b>                    MUMBLE (VO)
</b>          Like you're no-one, cos the world is full
          of us, and everyone's the same

    Wait a minute. These aren't humans... they are PENGUINS!

<b>                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>          How do you stand out from the crowd?
          How do you find someone special?

<b>    A GREAT COMMUNITY
</b>
    EMPEROR PENGUINS all over the place, Its chaos - Grand
    central station - with everyone SINGING to each other.

<b>                    MUMBLE (VO)
</b>          I know. I know. "You sing your heart
          out." That's how mum found dad in the
          first place

    Follow a female penguin as she waddles through the massive
    crowd past an assortment of crooning males

She ignores him

<b>                       NEXT MALE
</b>                 (giving it his all)
             "When a man loves a woman..."

She keeps moving, until she sees the male of her dreams:

<b>                       WISHFUL
</b>             "Love me tender love me true, all my
             dreams fulfil.

He stands a bit apart from the rest. And what a voice. What a
hip movement. She sings along.

<b>                       NORMA J. AND WISHFUL
</b>             ...for my darling I love you and I always
             will.

<b>                       MUMBLE (VO)
</b>             With them it was love at first song.

Close up on the two penguins as their necks intertwine.

<b>                       MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D)
</b>             But with me everything was a different,
             right from the moment I was born


<b>THE ICE SHELF
</b>
With infinite care, THE EGG is passed from Norma J's feet
onto WISHFUL's.

<b>                       MUMBLE
</b>             First rule of survival: get yourself laid
             before winter.

WISHFUL covers the egg, glancing up at the darkening sky

<b>                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>             Apparently I only just made it.

Women are leaving and heading off over the ice. The community
resounds with sad songs of parting.

<b>                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>             Afterwards Mum went off to the sea to
             keep warm. Dad stayed home like dad's do,
             incubating.

Norma J is having difficulty tearing herself away. Finally
she pads off after the others.

<b>                       WISHFUL
</b>             Safe home baby....

As he watches her dwindle into the distance, where huge STORM
CLOUDS are building.

<b>                       WISHFUL (CONT'D)
</b>             I'll miss you.

<b>THE DARKNESS
</b>
Wind comes shreiking across the ice shelf to where THOUSANDS
OF MALES are huddled, ice crusting on their feathers.

<b>                       MUMBLE (VO)
</b>             Tell me what it is about the cold and the
             dark. Soon as the sun goes away, everyone
             gets religious

The huddled penguins are engaged in ritual chanting

<b>                       LEAD VOICE
</b>             When all others leave...

<b>                          CHORUS
</b>             We Remain.

<b>                       LEAD VOICE

<b>                          CHORUS
</b>             We Remain.

<b>INSIDE THE HUDDLE
</b>
The adult males are packed shoulder to shoulder, looking
downwards at the eggs balanced on their feet.

CU on the Lead male, a CARUSO




<b>                                                     (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED:

</b>             Deny the pangs of hunger.
             Seal the gaps. Share the warmth....

<b>                       MUMBLE (VO)
</b>             Caruso's the leader because he's so
             incredibly old. Some say more than 40,
             but you know how penguins exaggerate.

<b>OUTSIDE
</b>
WINDWARD PENGUINS peel off and walk around to the leeward
side. WISHFUL is among them

<b>                       CARUSO
</b>             ....Each one taking his turn to defy the
             wind.

<b>WIDE SHOT
</b>
The MASSED VOICES rise above the gale, the frosty plumes of
their breath forming a shared `thought bubble'...a benevolent
<b>ÜBERPENGUIN.
</b>
<b>                       CARUSO.
</b>             ...As we invoke the Great One, Penguin of
             Penguins

<b>                       WISHFUL
</b>                 (pushing back inside)
             OK. Invoke. But keep moving

<b>                       MUMBLE (VO)
</b>             My dad was never that devout. Often his
             mind was on other stuff.

As the chanting builds, a little thought-bubble appears next
to the communal imagination: An image of Norma J

<b>                       NORMA J.
</b>                 (Sings)
             "I wanna be loved by you, alone and
             nobody else by you boo boo pee doo"

WISHFUL raises his head, breaking the seal. A little puff of
steam escapes

<b>                       WISHFUL
</b>             Amen to that honey


<b>                                                        (CONTINUED)

Penguins around him start jostling to close the gap

</b>             ...Quit shovin'!
             ...Hey watch where you're putting your

<b>                       CARUSO
</b>             Brothers, BROTHERS! The Devotions!

An egg rolls out of the HUDDLE and onto the ICE.

<b>                       WISHFUL
</b>             Oh no! I dropped it! Where's my egg!

WISHFUL barges out of the huddle, retrieves the egg and
waddles back into the warmth again.

<b>                       WISHFUL (CONT'D)
</b>             S'okay. S'okay. No harm done.

<b>                       MUMBLE (VO)
</b>             I guess he was wrong about a lot of
             things.

Pulling back, till the powerful rhythmic chanting is drowned
out by the HOWLING GALE.

<b>                       WISHFUL
</b>             But I did learnt this from him:    the
             power of positive thinking

We are moving in again, towards the huddle, the voices of the
Great Male Gathering begin to cut through the wind blasts.

Louder and louder, until...

<b>                       ELDER
</b>             By the power of our Devotions...

<b>                       ALL PENGUINS

<b>                       ELDER

<b>                    ALL PENGUINS
</b>          We bring back the sun.

The CHANTING crescendos, awe-inspiring, as it rises above the
sound of the gale, and, as if in response

<b>THE EARTH TURNS!
</b>
The CURTAIN OF DARKNESS which overshadows Antarctica begins
to LIFT from the curvature of the southern hemisphere. The
vast ice-continent is BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED once more.

<b>ON THE ICE SHELF
</b>
The ICE itself is moaning and groaning, like a living thing.

A SINGLE CRACK appears and widens, then forks and forks
again.

The whole expanse of fast-ice is DISINTEGRATING, starting at
the sea-ice and progressing towards the ice-cliffs.

Somewhere an ICEBERG breaks free from the face of a glacier
and smashes down into the frozen sea below. At the same
time...

<b>THE EMPEROR COMMUNITY
</b>
An EGG cracks open, then another, then all in a rush, like
<b>POPCORN.
</b>
Fathers are calling out to each other as their fluffy CHICKS
emerge to greet the daylight.

<b>                          EXCITED FATHERS
</b>          ...It's   a   boy!
          ...It's   a   girl!
          ...What   a   peach!
          ...What   a   bruiser!

Amongst the excited crowd of males and hatchlings we find
WISHFUL staring down at his egg still balanced on his feet.

<b>                    FRIENDLY PENGUIN
</b>          Late opener, huh? You thinks its alive?

<b>                    WISHFUL

He taps the egg with his beak. Bending close they hear a
TAPPING SOUND in REPLY.

<b>                       FRIENDLY PENGUIN
</b>             Well, how about that?

WISHFUL taps again. The tapping comes back louder. A TINY
FOOT pops out of the egg. Then ANOTHER. The Egg flips and
lurches off in a giddy DANCE.

<b>                       WISHFUL
</b>             Whoa li'l buddy, slow down!

THE FRIENDLY PENGUIN'S chick giggles at the DANCING EGG,
which finally trips and cracks, depositing baby MUMBLE.

             before?
             ...is he damaged?
             ...is he deranged?

They gather round staring down at this strange little jigging
ball of fluff

<b>                       WISHFUL

Shovelling MUMBLE off the ice and into his BROOD POUCH.

Mumble SNUGGLES contentedly between his father's legs,
surveying his new world. The friend's chick, ELLA is staring
at him fascinated

<b>THE ICE
</b>
A LONG LINE of male penguins, thousands of them, all with
their chicks, stand staring expectantly across the ice shelf.

At the front, we find WISHFUL and MUMBLE, who is jiggling
with anticipation, hopping from one foot to the other.

<b>                    MUMBLE
</b>          Is she coming soon?

<b>                    WISHFUL

<b>LATER

MIST rises off the ice shelf. The males are still waiting
with their chicks. Over this: The sound of Chicks crying.

MUMBLE between his father's feet, follows his father's
concentrated gaze.

<b>                       MUMBLE

<b>STILL LATER
</b>
The baby penguins are HOWLING now.

Anxious fathers lean forward, peering into the distance.

Out of the thickening mist, a cluster of little BLACK DOTS
materialises.

The distant females look exhausted as they totter unsteadily
across the ice towards their partners. The MALES break ranks
and rush towards the distressed females.

<b>THE GREAT COMMUTE

             everyone was busy busy busy. Mom and dad
             were working so hard I didn't see much of
             them. Besides I had school to go to.

<b>THE CRECHE

MANY flippers go up.

Mumble looks astonished. What's more important than that

</b>             Your Heartsong. Yes. The melody you hear
             inside, the thing that makes you
             different from every other penguin. So.
             Let's all be very still now and listen.
             And when you hear your song, let it come
             out. Who's first.

<b>MRS ASTRAKHAN'S

Some distance from the creche, MUMBLE stands with MRS
ASTRAKHAN, a Russian-accented remedial teacher.

<b>                       MRS ASTRKHAN

MUMBLE closes his eyes.

Her voice is seductive, hypnotic.

She hears a strange TAPPING sound and looks down.

<b>                    MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
</b>          You take a big breath, good and...now! Now!

He's off again, DANCING LIKE A FOOL...wild, exuberant, totally
uninhibited and unselfconscious.

After some time, he remembers himself, stops and turns to the
Mrs Astrakhan who is BANGING HER HEAD against a lump of ice.

<b>                    MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Disaster! Catastroff! I never fail!
          Never!

<b>THE ICE SHELF
</b>
Follow Mumble as he wanders alone, back towards his class.

He stops some distance away, listening to the other kids who
are now performing with increasing virtuosity.

Ella is among them, her clear high voice borne to him on the
wind.

Mumble sighs and his little shoulders sink, no way he'll ever
be able to sing like that.

<b>                    MUMBLE
</b>          Its tough when you realise you'll never

          I just kept going.

Music over: Walk on By as he wanders through the vast colony
head down against the wind, little feet padding over the ice,

Gradually the colony begins to thin.

<b>                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>          Looking for what? I don't know? A
          different type of penguin?

The noise of the colony has faded behind him. He stops and
looks up.

<b>THE EDGE
</b>

Before him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with
broken eggs and bits of feather. There are very few penguins
here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird.

A Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to
himself. Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around
himself like a straightjacket. A troubled Penguin sings
angrily..."There's no business like show business.

CU on Mumble. As he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony
and then back out over the wasteland

<b>                       MUMBLE
</b>             Not the nicest place in the world but at
             least you could do what you liked here.

Fade in Music: (I'm Free by the Who) and Mumble is off,
skittering over the rubbish strewn ice, little feet dancing
to his hearts content until....

a shadow passes over him and

Whump! a huge SKUA BIRD, twice Mumbles size, with a cruel
flesh-eating beak, lands on the ice right on front of him.

<b>                       SKUA

<b>                       MUMBLE

<b>THE CRECHE

MUMBLE stands some distance back from where the other young
penguins are taking school lessons.

<b>                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
</b>             Most days I hid at the back, dreaming
             about the world beyond

MUMBLE looks up at a cloud that resolves itself into the
unmistakable shape of a FISH. As he watches, the cloud morphs
into something that resembles a WHALE. Then morphs again
into...a SEAL. Then into the shape of an upright CREATURE with
bulging eyes and tentacled hands.

<b>LATER. THE GRADUATION CEREMONY
</b>
Dozens of MATURE ADOLESCENTS...their coats almost fully moulted
to reveal the sleek, shiny black and white feathers
underneath.

They stand in a group talking excitedly until the lead
penguin, Caruso, walks up and everyone falls silent

and shouts.

<b>AWAY FROM THE CRECHE

Follow Mumble as he returns to his parents. In his adult
plumage he's distinguishable by a small birthmark, like a
bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head
which has not yet moulted off.

<b>THE HIGHWAY TO THE SEA

A high shot reveals the miles of frozen ice that the
GRADUATES have to cover to get to the sea.

Some are shuffling along on their feet; others are
tobogganing.

A long way behind them we see the lone figure of MUMBLE
racing to catch up.

<b>AT THE EDGE OF THE ICE

The juvenile penguins stand in a bunch, peering down looking
for somewhere to dive in.

pack, yelling

For a long moment he's airborne.

Then...he hits the water with a strangled squawk!...and
disappears.

Without hesitation ELLA follows him.

The others follow ELLA. A few at first, then all of them en
masse leap yelling and hollering.

Transformed into creatures of grace and exuberance, they
swoop and dive trailing plumes of bubbles.

Two PENGUINS shoot up through HOLES IN THE ICE...

Skidding out of control, they COLLIDE, ending up in a
breathless heap on top of each other.

<b>AN ICE-FLOE

We find MUMBLE on his own small ice-floe separate from the
others on their iceberg.

As their singing drifts across to him, MUMBLE does an
exquisite little SOFT-SHOE SHUFFLE.

<b>TIME LAPSE
</b>
As night slowly pales to a misty dawn and Mumbles lonely
floe drifts off, turning slowly in the current

Music Over: "The tracks of my tears"

<b>MORNING

He is woken by A NUDGE at his little raft of ice.

<b>                       MUMBLE

He looks around - an unfamiliar landscape of ice - then over
the side, seeing nothing but slowly spreading ripples.

A more VIOLENT NUDGE from behind almost makes him lose his
balance. A DARK SHAPE passes swiftly through the water.

<b>                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>             Saw you. Richard? Eddie? Ella....

The dark shape SHOOTS out of the water. Its GAPING JAWS
missing Mumble by an inch.

As he recoils, slips and tumbles into the WATER.

<b>UNDERWATER/ SURFACE

Choking, thrashing and gulping air, Mumble SCRAMBLES to get
back onto the ice.

<b>                       MUMBLE
</b>             Everybody out!! LEOPARD SEAL!! (glub)

The murderous creature comes at him, jaws open, baring rows
of sharp TEETH and MUMBLE swims for his life.

The LEOPARD SEAL is relentless, barging through smaller
floes, powering around larger ones.

Mumble just CAN'T SHAKE HIM OFF. Desperate, he shoots up into
the air, landing on a THIN PANCAKE OF ICE that cannot support
his weight.

<b>                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)

Mumble POWERS ahead, the ice above growing thicker, the
angled ceiling forcing him down, deeper into the BLACKNESS.

The Leopard Seal opens its mouth. Its GAPING JAWS are about
to engulf Mumble when...

a little SPECK OF LIGHT appears in the ceiling of ice. Mumble
makes a speedy sharp turn, climbing steeply.

He is in a FUNNEL OF ICE...getting narrower and narrower as it
rises to the surface. The Leopard Seal is CLOSING fast.
MUMBLE shoots THROUGH the hole in the ice and into the air...

<b>THE ICE-SHELF
</b>
A small group of ADELIE PENGUINS recoil as MUMBLE explodes
out of the hole, closely followed by the LEOPARD SEAL.

Mumble is quickly on his feet and out of the Leopard Seal's

SEAL is almost upon them.

<b>                       MUMBLE
</b>             Or how about ...

MUMBLE adds a neatly executed slide just as the LEOPARD SEAL
strikes. MUMBLE avoids the lunge and the creature's face
comes down hard on the ice

water.

A strange cacophony building as The four ADELIE AMIGOS and
MUMBLE crest the rise, to see...

A vast, boisterous ADELIE PENGUIN COMMUNITY. Thousands of

Imbedded in the base of the glacier, the rusting remains of,
An OLD YELLOW EXCAVATOR projecting out of the glacier.

It hangs there, inscrutable, like a great yellow totem.

Mumble, dwarfed by it, contemplates it for a while, then
ventures inside, into the body of the BEAST.

<b>INSIDE THE BULLDOZER

A rusting steering column, a perforated dashboard.

He pecks at the metal, trying to taste it, listening to the

Penguin ahead of Mumble steps forward.

<b>THE EMPEROR COLONY
</b>
It is autumn, the EMPEROR PENGUINS for the mating season.

It is just like the GREAT GATHERING we saw at the beginning
of our story. Males and females sing their Heartsongs. And
ONE SONG stands out from all the others.

Where NORMA J. once sang, stands ELLA, now sleek and fully
mature. Gathered around her in a semi-circle, a half a dozen
adoring MALES.

<b>                    ELLA
</b>          Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
          Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

Suddenly she becomes aware of a MELLIFLUOUS MALE VOICE
overlapping hers. It has a curious bossa nova rhythm.

<b>                    MUMBLE
</b>          Tall and tanned and young and lovely
          The Girl from Ipanema goes walking
          And when she passes each guy she passes
          goes `Aaaah'

Ella turns to see: a PENGUIN backlit by the sun, standing
HEROICALLY on a little rise, just as WISHFUL did.

Ella recognizes those TAPPING FEET. Could this be MUMBLE?She
moves closer to investigate.

<b>                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, and I want her so badly

Ella, suspicious moves to one side. Mumble moves to block her
view. She moves further tound and sees:

<b>                       THE ADELIE
</b>             ¡Hola bonita!

Obviously he's been singing while Mumble mimes

<b>                       ELLA
</b>             Mumble, that's just cheap

She turns and heads off. The Adelie starts after her.

<b>                         THE ADELIE
</b>             Wait up! You and me baby, we can make
             sweet music. I may be short but I'm a
             love god...Ooww!

Mumble smacks him with the back of a flipper and goes off
after Ella himself.

<b>                       MUMBLE
</b>             Ella. Wait!

She stops. He takes her by the shoulders Shes upset.

             thought he just doesn't care.

She walks off.

<b>                    MUMBLE

He TAPS an up-tempo, syncopated rhythm on the ice.

<b>                    MUMBLE

Ella begins to hum Never Can Say Goodbye ironically and
without conviction.

<b>                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay, that'll work. Just keep it going.

The singing ADELIE joins in...acapella, very rhythmic

<b>                      THE ADELIE

Curious, ELLA TURNS.

Framed between the Adelies, Mumble strikes a pose, holds it
for a moment... then lets rip.

He TAP DANCES...UNINHIBITED, WILD, JOYOUS. The ADELIES
accompany him. They know all the moves and it is INFECTIOUS

FEET are beginning to tap, couples are beginning to
improvise... singing along, trying out the dance steps.

MUMBLE and LOVEDAY keep trekking.

<b>                    ANOTHER ADELIE

And reluctantly, he trails after them. As do...

<b>THE BLIZZARD COUNTRY
</b>
MUMBLE, LOVEDAY and the ADELIES are tiny specks, struggling
over a series of great ridges.

<b>                    MUMBLE
</b>          So we walked ... and walked .. and kept
          walking. Over the hills and into Blizzard
          country

A SNOW STORM breakes over them. A screaming wind brings total
WHITE-OUT. The Penguins have to shout to make themselves
heard.

<b>                      THE ADELIES
</b>          ...Oh man! This is no place for a penguin!

He turns his back to the wind. Immediately the Adelies form a
STRAIGHT LINE down-wind from him.

<b>                         THE ADELIES
</b>             ...Oh yeah, nice.

<b>                       MUMBLE
</b>             I said a circle!

They form a little huddle, but as soon as Mumble moves from
the upwind position, the Adelies complain.

<b>                         AN ADELIE
</b>             ...No, no. This can't be right!
             ...It was better the other way.

They scurry back into a straight line behind Mumble who cops
the FULL BLAST of the GALE.

He gives up and marches off into the driving snow.

<b>FLARE OUT TO WHITE
</b>
The blizzard has passed. An eerie stillness.

One by one the Adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards
to where Mumble and Loveday stand, gazing into the distance.

They have finally reached the sea again

<b>                    MUMBLE
</b>          You think this is it? The Forbidden

Close to the waters edge, the outline of several buildings

<b>AN ABANDONED WHALING STATION
</b>
The PENGUINS venture through it, dwarfed by the old flensing-
sheds, the chimneys and boiling-vats. Its all now abandoned,
and half concealed by snow.

Around and above them, there are HOOKS, CHAINS, rusting
twisted METALWORK.

<b>                    MUMBLE

An ominous GROANING as some rusting metal plate moves in the

There, imbedded in the ice: another six pack holder.

<b>THE SEA ICE
</b>
Mumble and the Adelies venture out onto the weak ice beyond
the whaling station, finding more and more of the strange
artefacts: a piece of nylon rope, a soda can, a boot.

<b>                       MUMBLE
</b>             They must be here somewhere.
             They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying

</b>             Maybe they invisible.

<b>FURTHER ON
</b>
They've reached the edge of the sea-ice. LOVEDAY croaks a
warning. He points out to sea.

<b>                       AN ADELIE
</b>             What is that?

A WAVE has appeared on the glassy surface of the sea. It is
coming towards them, FAST like the bow wave of an IMMENSE
<b>UNDERWATER CREATURE.
</b>
<b>                        MUMBLE
</b>             A whale?

</b>             As long as it's a good whale, not the
             other kind.

The wave is coming CLOSER.

<b>                       ANOTHER ADELIE
</b>             What other kind?!!

A massive BLACK DORSAL FIN breaks the surface.

<b>                       MUMBLE
</b>             The ones with teeth!!

The PENGUINS are off and running...

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>
The DORSAL FIN keeps coming like the blade of a demonic
carving knife.

Then the monstrous fin disappears and KABOOM! The killer
whale breaches the ice AHEAD of them, cutting off their
retreat.

They are left stranded on a free-floating ICE FLOE

<b>                         THE ADELIES

             ...Swim for it!

<b>                       MUMBLE

</b>             ...You call this safe amigo?
             ...Maybe we should split up.
             ...You split up I'm staying right here.

The KILLER WHALE breaches again, rising like a tower block
out of the ocean.

<b>                       THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
</b>             Woooaaaahhh!!

The ICE PAD flips, flinging them into the water like a
handful of peanuts.

<b>IN THE SEA
</b>
The PENGUINS head for shore , swimming for their lives.
LOVEDAY, thrashing and wheezing, is unable to keep up.

<b>             LOVEDAY! LOVEDAY!!

He swims back. The KILLER WHALE is about to take them both in
one bite. MUMBLE pulls LOVEDAY aside, but he's not quite
quick enough: one of the Whale's outer teeth catches LOVEDAY
by the SIX-PACK PLASTIC and he is DRAGGED AWAY, tethered to
the KILLER WHALE like Captain Ahab.

The WHALE thrashes around wildly trying to dislodge the
hapless little penguin until...

</b>
LOVEDAY is FLUNG high, high into the air and...SPLASHES DOWN
some distance away.

The KILLER WHALE is left with the SIX-PACK PLASTIC lodged in
its teeth.

<b>ICE SHELF
</b>
MUMBLE and LOVEDAY scramble onto the ice exhausted.

Wondering where the next attack will come from, the AMIGOS
huddle nearby.

Suddenly the ICE SHELF CRACKS OPEN and the KILLER WHALE soars
right over the top of them

It hits the water but does not stop, just keeps going right
on out to sea. The Penguins have no time to reflect on their
good fortune.

Theres an EARTH SHATTERING NOISE behind them . Turning they
see a vast BLACK SHAPE, a hundred feet high, coming at them
through the fog.

The ADELIES flee across the ice. MUMBLE stands transfixed by
the BIG BLACK SHIP towering above him. On the deck he sees
<b>HUMAN FIGURES...
</b>
<b>                        MUMBLE
</b>             Aliens?!

<b>                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>             Stop! Please!....

From a safe distance the ADELIES stop and look on in
amazement as Mumble stands his ground, shouting up at THE
SHIP as it advances towards him.

<b>                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>             ...It's very important!

The ICE beneath his feet OPENS UP, Mumble topples into the
gap and The SHIP PASSES OVER HIM, huge propellers churning,
leaving a channel ninety feet wide.

MUMBLE resurfaces.

Already the ship is half a mile away.

<b>THE ICEBERG
</b>
Beyond the last of the ice floes is THE WORLD'S TALLEST
ICEBERG. MUMBLE hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling
up its precipitous sides. THE ADELIES follow, struggling to
keep up.

<b>THE SUMMIT
</b>
MUMBLE's POV: THE BIG BLACK SHIP has joined TWO OTHERS about
a mile away. The Adelies join him.

<b>THE OPEN SEA

MUMBLE PLOUGHS THROUGH a rolling sea: towering waves block
everything from view but on the crests he catches sight of...

THREE BLACK SHIPS, far ahead, but stationary, as if waiting
for him.

<b>LATER
</b>
He's getting closer. The ships are only half a mile away when
Something rises from the deep, threatening to engulf him: a
<b>HUGE NET, TEEMING WITH FISH.
</b>
Mumble shoots out of the way, just avoiding being caught as.

UP AHEAD The great NET FULL OF FISH breaks the surface of the
water and is winched on board.

</b><b>             THE SCARCITY! THE SCARCITY!!

As if in response the ship's ENGINES START UP again and the
sea around him erupts in churning foam.

Swamped by the wake, Mumble goes under. When he resurfaces,
THE SHIP is already on its way.

<b>OPEN OCEAN

The SEAS are MOUNTAINOUS. There is no sign of the ship now,
nor of land.

MUMBLE swims up the side of each wave, over its foaming crest
and down into the deep dark valley below.

<b>LATER

The air is full of spray. Choking, MUMBLE ducks under the
water.

<b>UNDERWATER
</b>
Its peaceful here. Then something moves beside him and turns
with a start to see: A MASSIVE EYE!!

A BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision. It sings a
few booming Wagnerian notes. Its voice is almost deafening.

<b>                         MUMBLE
</b>             Too loud.

He surfaces, spluttering.

<b>                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)

A VOICE calls to him from above. Mumble looks up. An
ALBATROSS hovers overhead.

The Blue Whale responds with a long mournful "NO-O-O-O" which
the Albatross does not need to translate.

<b>                    ALBATROSS
</b>          No way mate, he won't go anywhere near
          `em. And neither should you.

Mumble hesitates, bobbing on the water, weighing the
warnings.

He makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards
the convergence.

The Albatross, hovering on the wing, watches.

<b>                    ALBATROSS (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't say I didn't warn you

The ALBATROSS wheels away.

As MUMBLE fights on through the huge choppy waves, the
Whale's Wagnerian song booms out, EERIE and FORLORN.

<b>THE CONVERGENCE
</b>
We see from above, the BLUE WHALE turning as well, changing
course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the
water stretching in a line, as far as the eye can see. MUMBLE
swims RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE.

<b>A VAST OCEAN
</b>
MUMBLE is a mere DOT now as the GREAT CURRENTS capture him
and sweep him away.

We pull back through the clouds until the very CURVATURE OF
THE EARTH is visible: a blue horizon with no land in sight.

<b>SMALL POLLUTED BEACH
</b>
On the HIGH-WATER MARK, amongst the rubbish and the oil
slick, we see what looks like a dead animal. It is MUMBLE.

A creature in RED GUMBOOTS approaches. Its small hand reaches
down and nudges him with a stick. MUMBLE moans and the
gumboots RUN AWAY, shouting something unintelligible.

With great difficulty, Mumble raises his head to try to see
more. Sunlight flares, bleaching to white, as he LOSES
<b>CONSCIOUSNESS.

</b>

<b>A WHITE ROOM
</b>
Scientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on
shelves line the walls.

MUMBLE, eyes closed, is lying on a stainless steel table. He
opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp.

There is movement around him. Voices whispering in an alien
tongue. A FIGURE IN WHITE bends over him cleaning the oil
from his feathers with detergent. MUMBLE squawks.

<b>                    MUMBLE (VO)
</b>          When I finally saw one, the Alien was
          even more hideous than I'd imagined

A very pretty FEMALE SCIENTIST is smiling down at him.

<b>                      MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D)
</b>          ... frontways eyes, no feathers. Big teeth
          with blood around them. Strange fleshy
          beak. A meat eater

</b>              (terrified)
          The - fish - are - ours. Understand?

But all the SCIENTIST sees is a squawking penguin.

<b>                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>          We can't live without them!

The SCIENTIST produces a syringe and squirts some of it's
contents in the air.

<b>                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>          Speak Adelie? Skua-talk?

Another SCIENTIST holds him still while the needle is
administered.

<b>                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh no! Not the pointy thing!

Drowsy now, he is eased into a PADDED CAGE. The SCIENTISTS
close the lid, and secure it with straps.

<b>IN THE CARGO HOLD
</b>
We hear a feeble thumping from inside.

Like the light at the end of a tunnel. As if in a dream,
MUMBLE ambles towards it. Emerging into

<b>PENGUIN HEAVEN
</b>
Bright BLUE SKY, sparkling WHITE CLIFFS OF ICE.

<b>                       MUMBLE
</b>             Wow. They brought me home

His voice ECHOES back at him, with a mocking edge. There is
something unusual about this place. A plump penguin waddles
by

<b>                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)

A fish hits him on the head.

A moment later he's knocked flat by a sudden rush of
PENGUINS: Chinstraps, Rock-hoppers, Adelies, King penguins,
emerging from holes in the rock face

<b>                       PENGUINS

Lying on his back he sees fish tumble from the sky. It's

</b>
Fish hit the surface and sink

Mumble pursues one of them.

</b>             Sometime you got a live one but there was
             nowhere really to chase it

He swims SLAP BANG into a sheet of thick glass. ALIEN FACES
are pressed against it. Mumble yells and shoots to the
surface.

<b>THE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

High up he sees the viewing gallery. A great CROWD of ALIENS
staring and chattering

</b>             Aliens everywhere, watching you eat,
             watching you sleep

Mumble backs away and knocks into the PAINTED HORIZON. He
puts out a wing to steady himself and notices a metal tag on
it. This place is beginning to upset him.

Another day and another. Night follows day follows night.
Spectators come and go. The penguins stand like statues.

Though bubbles begin to appear above Mumbles head, snapshots
of his past experiences

<b>                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
</b>             Sometimes I thought about dad and mum.
             Sometimes the Amigos, and others I'd met

             Whether she had enough food to eat.
             whether she still remembered our song.

at him.

The little girl who is pointing at mumbles feet. Mumble looks
down, realizes what his feet are doing, looks up again.

He does a more elaborate step. The Mother shouts in
disbelief. Various other specators come back and join her.

Mumbles fellow captives are unimpressed.

<b>NEXT DAY

Theres a riot going on up there. People fighting to get a
view. Newspaper reporters, TV cameras.

The other penguins in the enclosure have moved back, giving

As he shouts his he is blown off his feet by a tremendous
gust of wind

Caruso tumbles head over heels as a massive Chinook
helicopter rises over the hirizon, its massive rotors mashing
the air.

It swoops down over the penguin nation and lands a little
distance away.

Music Over: Wanna Dance with Somebody.

HUMAN scientists disembark. Skidoos are kicked into life.

We TRAVEL WITH THE SKIDOOS across the ICE-SHELF to the colony

Scientists POV: As they stop, lower their hoods and gaze in
astonishment. One of them lifts a video cam to record

<b>THOUSANDS OF EMPEROR PENGUIN DANCING WITH PURE, ABANDONED

<b>                     MUMBLE (VO)
</b>          From that day on, No one quite knows how
          it happened, but the black icebergs began
          to disappear and the fish became abundant
          once more.

<b>A CONFERENCE ROOM
</b>
Suited figures are seated round a large table, watching as
IMAGES of the DANCING PENGUIN COLONY play on a video screen.

Without the music it's less obviously a dance.

<b>                    CHAIRMAN
</b>          ...So what do you reckon?

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>                       EXPERT
</b>             Yes, quite extraordinary. (stares at the
             screen) some kind of neurological
             disorder? a nutritional deficiency
             perhaps. We'd certainly back the
             long-term study.

<b>                       CHAIRMAN
</b>             And the international treaty?

<b>                       DELEGATE#1
</b>             Yes. This is exactly the leverage we need
             for an embargo. No fishing
             whatsoever...legal, illegal, sanctioned,
             whatever.

<b>                       DELEGATE#2
</b>             So we all step up policing of the pirate
             factory ships. And we pressure that
             country to stop their so-called
             `experimental' fishing.

<b>                       DELEGATE#3
</b>             Yes, if our government asks your
             government to approach their government
             to call off their fleet...

<b>                       DELEGATE#2
</b>             Better if their government hear it from
             our government via your government...

<b>                       CHAIRMAN
</b>             What the heck. The amount of publicity
             this is generating, they'd have world war
             three if they didn't stop.

<b>THE COLONY
</b>
In the confusion of penguins we find MUMBLE, ELLA and their
chick

<b>                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
</b>             Ella's gave up teaching to look after our
             chick. We take turns looking after her
             and going to get the fish.

As we watch, Ella moves off, joining the great to and fro of
penguins along the highway to the sea.

MUMBLE covers his chick protectively, watrching his wife walk
away.

<b>                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
</b>             I worry about her, sure. Theres so much
             big stuff out there it can be kind of
             frightening.

We are pulling back now, back from the colony, back from
Antarctica.

<b>                       MUMBLE (V.O)
</b>             But the way I see it. Theres so much out
             there we don't understand...,

<b>SPACE
</b>
Still pulling back


             ....the stuff you think is small stuff
             could actually be the big stuff.

Keep pulling back from the world, the solar system,       the
galaxy.

<b>                       MUMBLE (V.0
</b>             Or am I not making sense here?

Further back. Our galaxy is framed in something like a bomb-
sight.


<b>                       VOICE#1
</b>             Is there a problem? I thought this one
             was barren.

<b>IN THE DOME
</b>
We`re somewhere otherworldly, inside a clear dome the size of
a stadium, with a view of the heavens. In the centre of this
space, always just out of shot, two illdefined figures are
talking, subtitled:

<b>                       VOICE#2
</b>             More or less. But one of the stars we're
             harvesting supports these things here.

Projected somehow in mid-air A 3-D image of Times square in
winter with tiny people milling around in black coats

<b>                                                        (CONTINUED)
</b><b>                                                        85.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>                         VOICE#1
</b>             So...?

<b>                       VOICE#2
</b>             Well. Exactly. But what we didn't know
             about before was these things here

An image of the dancing penguins appears.

<b>                       VOICE#2 (CONT'D)
</b>             Just thought you'd want to see them
             before...you know.

The shadowy figure laughs, enjoying the image.

<b>                        VOICE#1
</b>             Hmm.   Charming

<b>                         VOICE#2
</b>             So.    We go ahead. Or...?

<b>                       VOICE#1
</b>             No. Better leave them be. See what
             sector twelves got to offer instead.

The bomb sight moves away from our galaxy to another part of
the universe

With that the two figures head off across the great shadowy
interior.

The projector beam catches them, briefly, throwing up the
giant shadows of these aliens They look very like huge
penguins.

As they walking solemnly out of shot with their hands behind
their backs one of them breaks step to do a little jig.
