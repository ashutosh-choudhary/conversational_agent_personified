</b>          beneath slate-grey sky. Frigid rock and stunted trees fall to an
          ice-choked coast. Congealed sea on a desolate beach.

<b>          MARKO ALEXANDROVICH RAMIUS
</b>          bare-headed in cold wind, studies the inclement coast. Bottomless
          eyes move slowly across the landscape, missing nothing.

          Ramius wears a tar black winter uniform of Captain First Rank in
          the Soviet Navy. Behind him, out of sight, someone SPEAKS:

<b>                         VOICE (OS)
</b>          Cold this morning, Captain.
          Ramius shivers. When he replies, he speaks not about the weather,
          but of the land:

<b>                         RAMIUS
</b>          It is cold.

<b>                         (BEAT)-
</b>          And hard.
          Turning his back on the icy coast, Ramius smi-I fondly at the man
          who just spoke to him

<b>          CAPTAIN SECOND., RANK VASILY BORODIN

          Stanley is Sally's bear. Ryan talks to it like it was alive.
          it makes Sally grin.

          There's a safe on the wall. Ramius spins the combination. Inside,
          another safe with four locks. Both Ramius and Putin have keys.
          Inside the second safe, a large envelope.
          it has an ornate. scarlet seal, marked 'Top Secret'. Ramius cracks
          the seeal, removing four pages of operation orders. Glancing at
          Putin; he reads:

          has no love in his heart for you. Why
          is that?
          Ramius pours two cups of steaming tea from a silver pot on a
          serving tray, offering it to Putin.. Putin takes the cup.

<b>                         RAMIUS
</b>          There is no room in Tupolev's heart

          Putin grins, heading for the door. He never makes it. In a sudden
          violent motion,, Ramius kicks Putin's left leg from under him.
          Surprised, the; big man tumbles sideways.
          Leaping to his feet, Ramius catches Putin, slamming him into a
          headlock, driving his thick neck downward, CRACKING his SKULL
          in the SHARP corner of the DESK.
          Putin gags. Cupping his chin, Ramius forces his entire bulk onto
          the man's chest. Putin struggles. His eyes bulge. Ramius strains,
          using all of his strength until..

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          PUTIN'S NECK SHATTERS
</b>          and his face goes slack. With surprising gentleness, Ramius lowers
          the shuddering body to the deck. Carefully, he checks the pulse in
          Putin's neck. Dying, Putin stares into Ramius' face.

          walk, you cannot fallow.
          Whatever his destination, Putin's on his way. Getting up, Ramius
          goes to the desk. Returning with the teapot, he drenches the body
          with scalding tea.
          Replacing the pot on the tray, Ramius puts the orders in a
          wastebasket and sets them on are. Removing a duplicate set of
          orders from his safe, he' places them on the floor by the dead man.
          Satisfied everything is the way he wants it, he moves to an intercom

<b>                         RYAN
</b>          Gentlemen, the last twenty four hours
          have seen some extraordinary Soviet
          naval activity. The first to sail was --

<b>                         (SLIDE)
</b>          this ship, the Red October. A variant
          of the typhoon class, she's some six
          hundred fifty feet long. Thirty-two
          thousand tons submerged displacement,
          roughly the size of a World War II
          aircraft Carrier.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Unlike the standard typhoon, equipped
          to fire long-range missiles from Russian
          waters, Red October carries fifty-six
          SS-311s, which is a short-range attack
          mis it with eight independent warheads.
          That's four hundred forty-eight warheads
          all spedfically designed to fire close in.

<b>                         (ANOTHER SLIDE)
</b>          We believe these doors on the bow, and
          here again on the stern, enclose a
          magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar,
          which may allow the sub to run totally
          silent.

<b>                         (ANOTHER SLIDE)
</b>          it is possible this new drive system
          allowed the captain, a man named Marko

<b>                         RAMIUS -
</b>          Ryan points out two photos on a bulletin board. One is of Ramius
          alone. The other is a wedding photo of Ramius and a beautiful
          woman.

<b>                         RYAN (CONT'D)
</b>          to elude one of ' our attack boats,

<b>                         (POINTKUY)
</b>          This drive, if it's working, could
          render Red October invvsihl8 to our
          SOSUS warning nets in the Atlantic.

<b>                         PELT
</b>          You would characterize this as a first
          strike weapon, Dr. Ryan?
          Ryan glances at Greer. Greer smi reassuringly.

<b>                         RYAN
</b>          There's no doubt about that, sir. She
          is designed to approach by stealth, and
          fire on a target with little or no warning.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         ADMIRAL
</b>          An offensive weapon. The kind you start
          wars with.

<b>                         RYAN
</b>          Precisely, Admiral..

<b>                         (RE: MAP)
</b>          if I may continue. Shortly after the
          Dallas lost contact, there were additional
          Soviet mailings from Pa tjarny, Leningrad
          and the Mediterranean. The Soviets have

<b>                         SOME --

<b>                         (CHECKING NOTES)
</b>          fifty-eight nuclei submarines headed at
          high speed into the Atlantic. And this
          afternoon's satellite pass over Policjarny
          found head blooms in the engineering plants
          of the Kirov, the Minsk and more than
          twenty cruisers and destroyers,, indicating
          that the bulk of their surface fleet is
          also preparing to sail.
          Flushed, Ryan sits beside Greer. Pelt turns to Greer:

<b>                         PELT
</b>          Conclusions?

<b>                         GREER
</b>          Absence of activity in the Pacific suggest
          this is probably just an exercise having
          nothing to do with the Red October.
          A General starts to object. He's cut off by JUDGE MOORE, a
          white-haired civilian near the top of the table:

<b>                         MOORE

<b>                         (PELT NODS)
</b>          Before sailing, Captain Ramius sent a
          letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin, Chairman
          of Soviet Naval Deployment.
          Painting at Ramius' wedding picture, Ryan whispers to Greer:

          Greer has no idea what Ryan's saying. Moore's still talking:

</b>          The contents of the letter are unknown,
          but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded
          a meeting with Premier Ligachev and
          within minutes of that meeting, the
          Soviet Fleet sailed with orders to find
          Red October --

          A spirited discussion ensues. Tuning it out, Ryan stares at the
          picture of Ramius and his wife. Urgently, he whispers to Greer:

</b>          This is the twenty-gird, isn't it?
          Greer nods. Order in the room has broken down. Generals and
          Admirals argue vehemently about appropriate. responses. Staring at
          the photos, a light goes off in Ryan's brain:
          SljenCel. Ryan realizes everyone in the room is staring at him.

          answer I got. was magma displacement.

<b>                         JONES
</b>          Yes sir. See, the system we are
          using was originally- designed to look
          four seismic events and although we
          adapted it. to hunt for submarines -

</b>          utto the chase, Jonesy._:.,

<b>                         JONES
</b>          Aye, aye, sir. Anyway,; I got curious,
          and. started tracking. the sound on our
          lateral array. I located it four
          different times. The fifth time it
          was gone and I couldn't find it. But
          I want to show you what I worked up.
          Picking up a grease pencil, Jones makes calculations on the status
          board overlaying the nautical map:

<b>                         JONES (CONT'D)
</b>          The first contact was at zero-nine-Been
          hours and the bearing was two-six-nine.

<b>                         (DRAWING LINE)
</b>          Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was
          bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine-
          forty-eight is was two-ive-zero.

<b>                         (ANOTHER LINE)
</b>          I came back to it at about ten-hundred
          and the bearing was two-four-two. The
          last signal was real faint and I didn't
          have a very good lock on it.

<b>                         MANCUSO
</b>          So?

<b>                         JONES
</b>          Well, I figure it couldn't be very far
          away from us, right? Let's say it was
          halfway between us and Iceland. That
          would put it on a course like this.
          Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso
          recognizes a pattern:

<b>                         MANCUSO
</b>          Headed directly into Red Route One.

<b>                         JONES
</b>          Exactly. Sir, I believe the sound I
          heard is the acoustical signature of some
          kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and
          he's taking the inshore track off the
          Iceland coast.

<b>                         THOMPSON
</b>          What do you think, captain?
          Mancuso stares-at the status board, then turns to Jones:

<b>                         MANCUSO
</b>          Let me see if I got this straight. The
          three minion dollar computer tells you
          you're chasing after an earthquake and
          you aren't convinced. So you get curious
          and came up with this theory: on your own?

          think you can track him down?

          Between his feet, Ryan can see the small white wake from a
          periscope.

</b>          in the Conn, Mancuso spins the scope. Thompson watches him.
          Both he and Mancuso wear life jackets:

</b>          Whoever this guy is, he's in far one

          Mancuso and Thompson move to a hatch by the helm.

<b>          IN THE CHOPPER
</b>          the saftors i nish strapping Ryan into the sling. One of them leans

<b>                         SAILOR
</b>          Pull this to release!
          Fighting. panic, Ryan glances down. A mitlion miles below, the sea
          bans- mine-grey.

</b>          I put Jonesy in the forward escape

<b>          IN THE CHOPPER
</b>          Teeth chattering, sta:ugg g with deja vu, Ryan is transfixed by, the

</b>          First the sail, then the foredeck EXPLODE high into the air, finally
          CRASHING back to the WATER.

<b>          ON THE DALLAS
</b>          The COB helps Jones climb into an escape trunk aft of the sail. It's
          cramped and brightly lit. Jones checks his equipment.

<b>          IN THE CHOPPER
</b>          Ryan watches Mancuso and Thompson climb out of the sail onto the
          lurching bridge.The sailer leans close, HOLLERING:

<b>                         SAILOR
</b>          Hang on!
          He trips a laver on the winch. Cable feeds out a few feet Holding
          his breath, Ryan inches into the abyss.

<b>          ON THE BRIDGE
</b>          Mancuso lays binoculars on Ryan. Thompson ties both of them to

          beneath waves.
          Fingers freezing, Thompson clamps one end of a jumper cable to a
          metal lip on the bridge to ground the sub against static generated
          by the helicopter's rut

          a top. Desperately, he trams to control the dizzying motion.
          Above, caught in an unexpected wind sheer, the chopper plummets
          seaward. Ryan's line goes slack. Angry sea rushes up at him with
          blistering speed.

<b>          IN THE CHOPPER
</b>          the pilot struggles for control. Behind him, loose equipment SLAMS
          into the WINCH, JAMMING the CABLE. CURSING, the pilot regains
          control. The chopper stabilizes.

<b>          IN THE AIR
</b>          CRACKING like a WHIP, the CABLE goes TAUT. Ryan feels like
          he's been hit with a sledgehammer. Unable to breathe, he RIPS off
          his HELMET.
          A rock in a sling, he tries to get his bearings. Everything's grey.
          Above, the chopper's rotors CHEW the SKY. Help] s, Ryan starts
          swinging like a pendulum.

<b>          ON THE BRIDGE
</b>          Mancuso and Thompson watch Ryan rocket by at Mach 10. A huge
          arc carries him way out over the angry sea. Slowing down, Ryan
          starts to spin again.

          Way out on the horizon, Ryan reaches the end of his arc and starts
          a comet-like ride back at the ship.

          The sailor keeps trying to rewind the cable. No go. sweating, he
          wraps gloved fingers around the emergency release on the drum.

<b>          IN THE AIR
</b>          Ryan watches the Dallas' saw rush at him with unbelievable speed, a
          towering black monolith on an ubiquitous canvas of grey.

<b>          ON THE BRIDGE

          BLASTS the DALLAS.

<b>          THE GROUNDING CABLE
</b>          rips free of the bridge. Surprised, Thompson goes overboard.
          Caught in his harness, he dangles helplessly above the water.
          Mancuso and Ryan reach for each other as Ryan hurtles at the
          bridge. All hell breaks loose:

<b>          A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY

</b>          There is another matter... One I am
          reluctant to -

<b>                         PELT
</b>          No. Please go ahead.

<b>                         LYSENKO
</b>          One of our submarines, an Akula, was
          last reported in the Reykjanes Ridge.
          We have not heard from her for sometime.
          Pelt stares at him blankly, time hangs suspended. Finally, Peat
          reaches far the bridge of his now as if to stave of a ]dtler

<b>                         HEADACHE:
</b>
<b>                         PELT
</b>          You've lost another submarine?

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Andre...
          Lysenko sits, hat in hand. Finally, he averts his gaze.

<b>          JUMP CUT TO:
</b>
<b>                         A DRIVER
</b>          standing beside a limousine outside the Executive Office Building.
          Fuming, Lysenko approaches. The driver smiles. Not a good idea.

<b>                         LYSENKO SNARL:
</b>
<b>                         LYSENKO
</b>          Shut up! Don't speak to me Boris. Don't
          ever speak to me unless I speak to you
          first. And wipe that smile off your face!
          Lysenko pBe into the limo, slamming the door as hard as he can.
          Locked inside, he starts shouting and hitting things.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>                         BRIGHT MOONLIGHT
</b>          on the tree studded bank of a large coastal river. A gentle breeze
          touches the trees and punctuates the silence. Crickets and frogs
          sing on the shore:

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          SUPER: ORICOKE RIVER
</b>
<b>                         PAMLICO SOUND
</b>
<b>                         NORTH CAROLINA
</b>
<b>          THE RED OCTOBER
</b>          glides quietly up the river's surface. Ramius and Ryan stand on
          the sail. Behind them, two junior officers, one American and one
          Russian, Conn the ship:

<b>                         RYAN
</b>          We're two hundred miles from the nearest
          naval base.

<b>                         RAMIUS
</b>          Interesting notion, hiding a submarine
          in a river.

<b>                         (EYEING SHORE)
</b>          How do you know this place?

<b>                         RYAN
</b>          I grew up not far from here.

<b>                         (PAINTING)
</b>          My grandfather taught me to f5sh right
          over there on that rock.
          Ramius spots a large rock on the shore. So warm and inviting, this
          land, when compared to the bitter cold coast he ]eft a ]ifetl,me ago.
          Ram hl studies Ryan in the stillness:

<b>                         RAMIUS
</b>          There is one question you have not
          asked me.

<b>                         RYAN
</b>          Why?

<b>                         (RAMIUS NODS)
</b>          I assumed you would speak when you were
          ready.

<b>                         RAMIUS
</b>          We. are standing on part of the reason.
          I've spent my life preparing to fight a
          war I hoped would never happen. This
          ship was not built to fight such a war.
          it was built to start one.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          And there were personal reasons.

<b>                         RYAN
</b>          Your wife?

<b>                         RAMIUS
</b>
<b>                         (NODDING)
</b>          it started there, perhaps.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Ramius glances at the rock. Beside it, a muskrat drops quietly into
          the water.

<b>                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
</b>          Or perhaps it was something that started
          long ago...

<b>                         RYAN
</b>          Fishing?

<b>                         RAMTUS
</b>          Fishing.
          Taking a deep breath, Ramius studies the surrounding hills. Lights
          from farms twinkle in the night air.

<b>                         RAMIUS (CONT'D)
</b>          "The sea will, grant each man new
          hope, as sleep doth dream of home."
          (on Ryan's look)
          Christopher Columbus.
          Ryan smilm.

<b>                         RYAN
</b>
<b>                         (QU`EDY)
</b>          Welcome to the new world, sir.

<b>                         DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>                         A STEWARDESS
</b>          walking down the aisle of an airplane, checking passengers.
          Stopping near the front of the cabin, she glances down at

<b>                         RYAN
</b>          sound asleep in his seat, empty tea cup on a tray beside him. A
          blanket hangs on one log. In the seat next to him

<b>          A TEDDY BEAR
</b>          smi&gt; out at passing clouds. The bear's got a red ribbon round his
          neck-and a seat belt fastened over his bulging tummy.

          Covering Ryan with the blanket, the stewardess leaves. Tea cup
          RATTLES. Ryan doesn't even twitch. Turbulence is a thing of the
          past.

<b>                         FADE OUT
</b>
<b>                         THE END
</b>
