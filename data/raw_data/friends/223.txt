Monica: Hey, let me tell them!
Joey: Sure.
Monica: Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game                            show!
Phoebe: Great!
Ross: Really? Which one?
Monica: (stopping Joey from answering) Ohh! Fish, seaweed,                            a sunken ship.
Ross: Things you find in the ocean, (to Joey) You're                            gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
Monica: Oh, that was our favorite game show ever!
Ross: Except for "Match game"...
Monica: Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
Chandler: What did I marry into?
Joey: Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and                            watch me tape the show?
Monica: Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette                            party.
Phoebe: Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
Ross: Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college                            alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny                            Osmond.
Joey: Seriously?
Ross: (very excited) Yeah-uh!
Monica: Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Chandler: You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Monica: Yeah, we used to perform for our family and                            friends.
Rachel: Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
Monica: (singing an old Donny and Marie song) "I'm                            a little bit country"...
Ross: (continues singing) "...and I'm a little                            bit rock 'n' roll"!
Chandler: (to Monica) I'm leaving you.
Chandler: Who?
Ross: He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out                            with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Chandler: (looking around) Did I go to this school?
Ross: Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember                            her.
Chandler: (looks over at her) Sure, nice.
Ross: Dude. You're married to my sister.
Chandler: You're right, by saying "nice"                            I'm virtually licking her.
Ross: Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I                            should ask her out?
Chandler: Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Ross: Yes please.
Chandler: Awesome, the name really stands out.
Ross: Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica                            Bold 24 point"!
Chandler: Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student                            union!
Missy: Hey guys!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: Hey, Missy...
Chandler: You know, our band is playing on Friday.
Ross: Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're                            called "Way! No Way!".
Missy: No way!
Missy: Right. I'll be there. (she leaves)
Chandler: Fresh!
Ross: Boss!
Chandler: Mint!
Ross: She's gone.
Chandler: I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask                            her out.
Ross: Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
Chandler: I said it first, bro.
Ross: Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
Chandler: (angrily) Look, if you did...
Ross: Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have                            is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean,                            we can get laid anytime we want.
Chandler: Totally. I had sex in High school...
Ross: Me too. I'm good at it.
Chandler: All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither                            of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
Ross: You got it.
Chandler: All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe                            Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out                            with.
Ross: Those are the pacts!
Chandler: Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't                            get her anyway.
Ross: Oh, oh... maybe not you!
Ross: Thank you. (they shake hands) All right, here                            I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up                            to girls in college?
Chandler: Your hands are shaking.
Ross: I know, and I can't stop sweating. (he walks                            towards Missy)
Joey: (to Gene) I know it could be intimidating for                            regular people to be around celebrities but... relax,                            I'm just like you! (pause) Only better looking and richer.
Donny: ...should be playing with the star of "General                            Hospital" Leslie Charleson. (applause) Welcome                            everybody. Good luck to all of you. Let's play Pyramid.                            All right? Now... we flipped a coin before the show,                            Gene, you won the toss, so you're gonna start. Which                            category would you like?
Gene: I'll take "You crossed the line".
Donny: You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene                            these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on                            the clock, please. Ready, go!
Joey: (on the screen there's the word "Supermarket")                            Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. (there                            is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he shouldn't                            have said 'supermarket'. The next word appears, "notebook")                            Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm                            writing in my...
Gene: Diary.
Joey: Noo, (whispering) more like a notebook... Damn                            it! (next word appears: "blueprint") Oh, if                            I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'...                            Can't say that either? Woha... hey... (the last word                            is "Football field" and there are 5 seconds                            left) In high school, I once had sex with a girl right                            in the middle of the...
Gene: Cafeteria.
Joey: Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for.                            (time's finished) OOOH!
Rachel: Oh, d'you like it?
Phoebe: Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the                            dirty stuff starting?
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing,                            and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
Rachel: Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying                            about! We actually thought we were a little too mature                            for stuff like that.
Phoebe: Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine.                            This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. (she drinks                            her tea) Hmmmm... raunchy!
Rachel: Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind                            of a party.
Phoebe: Really? So this is... this is my big send off                            in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette                            party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of $1s                            in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
Rachel: Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean,                            I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the                            pee-pee's!
Joey: Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
Donny: Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready?                            Go!
Gene: You put this in your coffee.
Joey: A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
Gene: It's white!
Joey: Paper, snow, a ghost!
Gene: It's heavier then milk!
Joey: A rock, a dog, the earth.
Gene: Pass!
Gene: You put this on a sandwich.
Joey: Salami, anchovies, jam!
Gene: It's white!
Joey: Paper, snow, a ghost!
Gene: It's made from eggs!
Joey: Chickens?
Gene: Pass!
Joey: Oh!
Gene: You put this on a hamburger!
Joey: Ketchup!
Gene: Yes!
Joey: Relish!
Gene: Stop!
Joey: Oh.
Donny: Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on                            a roll there...
Joey: Yeah...
Donny: Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to                            the winner circle in the second half. But right now                            Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try                            your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this,                            don't go away.
Joey: Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the                            game, right?
Gene: Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get                            surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!
Joey: Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do                            better next time!
Gene: Well, I will, because I won't be playing with                            you.
Joey: Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard!                            Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? (pause)                            . Yeah!
Missy: I'd love to!
Ross: Great!
Missy: So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Ross: Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly,                            but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
Missy: Sure, he was in your "band"? (she                            air quotes band)
Ross: It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still                            hurt.
Missy: Sorry.
Ross: That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really                            liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to                            jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact,                            that neither of us could ask you out!
Missy: Really?
Ross: Yeah, why?
Missy: Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
Ross: You did?
Missy: Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
Ross: (angrily) AND ON MY TURF?
Rachel: Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would                            get here as fast as he could!
Monica: Who is it?
Man: It's the police!
Rachel: (pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!
Phoebe: (Excited, running back to her seat) Oh!
Man: That's right, it's officer Goodbody.
Monica: What's the matter, officer? Has someone been                            bad? (looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and                            to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat                            guy who looks exhausted)
Roy: Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator!                            I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
Monica: Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
Roy: Goodbody!
Monica: ...If-you-say-so.
Roy: So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to                            take (he shakes his hips) downtown! (Monica points Phoebe)
Phoebe: Oh, God!
Roy: All right, somebody show me where to plug in my                            box, and we'll get this party started! (he thrusts his                            pelvis towards Phoebe) Whaaaa... (walks back to plug                            in his cd player) Here? All right.
Phoebe: Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah?
Phoebe: Are you kidding?
Rachel: All right, look, we did not know that you wanted                            a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the                            first name we could find!
Phoebe: How old is your phonebook?
Monica: Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my                            apartment!
Phoebe: Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes                            off!
Roy: Are you talking about me?
Monica: Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you                            take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
Roy: Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please?                            (pause) Did someone call for the long arm of the law?                            (He extends his arm from around his crotch and then                            upward and outward, towards Phoebe) I should warn you,                            I have a concealed weapon! (Puts his hands over his                            crotch) I hope you're familiar with the States penal                            code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!
Roy: Whoa, whoa, whoa (he turn off the music) . She                            cringed!
Phoebe: This is how I look when I'm turned on!
Roy: You were talking about me before! Look, I don't                            need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? (goes to                            get it) Look, I've been in this business for a long                            time!
Phoebe: Shocking!
Roy: Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars,                            I'll be on my way!
Phoebe: Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
Rachel: No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
Phoebe: No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do                            anything!
Roy: Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from                            Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs...                            It's not like I can take them two at a time!
Phoebe: I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars                            for this.
Roy: Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight                            to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
Phoebe: Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why                            I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around                            in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!                            (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they                            feel very sorry for the stripper)
Roy: I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let                            me assure you, what's underneath (points at his groin)                            ... is all man.
Phoebe: I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
Roy: (making a crying face) Oh, you're mean!
Monica: (walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh,                            look, officer... uhm Sir...
Roy: Damnit. OH! (To Phoebe) Big surprise! The hunk                            of beef has feelings!
Joey: (To Henrietta) My friend Rachel has a kid. I                            totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign)
Donny: Joey describe these things associated with the                            United States congress. (Joey goes form looking very                            confident to looking very shocked the instant the word                            congress is said) Give me 20 seconds on the clock please.                            Ready? Go!
Joey: Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. (Next word: "Rotunda")                            Pass. (Next word: "Filibuster" stares at it                            a moment) Pass. (Henrietta is looking very confused)                            (Next word: "Addendum" 4 seconds remaining)                            Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of                            your throat.
Henrietta: Uvula!
Joey: Oh, then pass. (Next word: "Joint session",                            but time's up, Joey acts very disappointed)
Donny: O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points                            you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the                            winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! (Gene                            is clapping his hands looking very happy and so is Joey)                            And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani                            (Both of their smiles fade away instantly)
Chandler: (to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and                            Ross move away from them) . That didn't make us sound                            gay at all!
Ross: You broke the pact!
Chandler: Ross, that was 16 years ago!
Ross: That doesn't matter! We're talking about the                            foundation of our friendship.
Chandler: I believe the foundation of our friendship                            was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All                            right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not                            like you never broke one of the pacts.
Ross: I didn't.
Chandler: Oh really?
Ross: No.
Chandler: Oh really!?
Ross: NO!
Chandler: ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns                            around)
Adrienne: Yes?
Ross: I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Chandler: Oh please, and you knew how much I liked                            her.
Ross: I don't know what... you're talking about.
Chandler: Really?
Monica: I can't believe we are at a real college party!                            (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to pee so bad!
Rachel: This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
Monica: Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
Rachel: I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey                            Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!                            (They spot Chandler)
Monica: Look, there's Chandler, you know, that stupid                            friend of Ross' who said I'm fat. You know I've already                            lost 4 pounds!
Rachel: It... You can so totally tell.
Monica: I KNOW!
Rachel: Well let's see. Maybe he knows where Ross is.                            (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries                            to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking                            out her nails) .
Chandler: Aren't you...?
Rachel: Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is                            Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks                            around the room as if searching for something more interesting                            to do) .
Chandler: (smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So                            how're you doing?
Rachel: Bitchin'
Chandler: Hi Monica.
Monica: Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls                            her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler                            looks unimpressed)
Chandler: O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes                            off to find Ross.)
Monica: Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Rachel: Oh.
Monica: Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be                            here for days.
Ross: Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about                            this.
Adrienne: Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody                            about this.
Ross: Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler                            looks shocked)
Chandler: Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards                            the bar) That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal                            In The Common Room".
Ross: (looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... I'm                            sorry.
Chandler: Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong                            time ago.
Ross: So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made                            out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
Chandler: (smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..
Ross: We are even, right?
Chandler: (sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed                            at you that night that I wanted to get back at you.                            So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
Ross: (thinks about it for a few seconds) What did                            you do to my mom?
Chandler: Not her!
Monica: That's weird. I've had the same number of beers                            as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)
Chandler: Soo... you girls having fun?
Monica: For your information, ass munch, I've lost                            four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A                            guy enters holding a pizza box)
Pizza guy: SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
Monica: Oh THATS ME! (she runs to the pizza guy)
Rachel: (finishing the last of her drink) I am soo                            not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Chandler: Well maybe if you go to school here next                            year we can totally hang out.
Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't                            I just start taking my smart pills now?
Chandler: Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
Rachel: (blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards                            the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and                            whispers "Oh my God!")
Chandler: So where are you applying to?
Rachel: Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really                            important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so                            I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She                            pulls away) Hey!
Chandler: I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Rachel: (She considers it for a second) Yeah okay.                            (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing                            again)
Phoebe: You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
Roy: No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should                            have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What                            am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty                            two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people                            is all I know.
Rachel: No, wait. No there's gotta be something else                            that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
Roy: I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I                            can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can                            go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
Rachel: So maybe something in an office.
Phoebe: Or you could teach stripping. You know, share                            your gift, pass the torch.
Roy: You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can                            do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would                            mind.
Phoebe: There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna                            be okay?
Roy: Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean,                            you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And                            I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
Phoebe: (after a pause) Finish it!
Roy: What?
Phoebe: Your last dance. Do it for us.
Roy: Really?
Rachel: (to Phoebe) Really?
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he                            loves one last time.
Roy: Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!
Phoebe: Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
Phoebe: Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
Roy: (out of breath) Have to...
Joey: (nervously) Yeah...
Gene: (irritable) Sure. (Joey gets even more nervous)
Donny: Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please...                            Ready, GO! (runs off)
Gene: Oak, maple, elm, birch...
Joey: I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?
Joey: (sympathetic) Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know                            any Spanish words.
Gene: A match, a candle...
Joey: Things that go "tssst" when you put                            them out.
Gene: A torch, a bonfire... (Joey seems lost) uhm,                            your pee...
Joey: Things that burn.
Gene: "I'd like to go for a walk", uhm "scratch                            my belly".
Joey: Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
Gene: Uhm, "I have fur", "I like to                            bark".
Joey: Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
Gene: Pepperoni...
Joey: (instantly) Pizza toppings, next!
Gene: Cindy Crawford, Christie Brinkley, Heidi Klum,                            Claudia Schiffer...
Joey: Oh, oh, oh... (5 seconds left)
Gene: Christie Turlington, Kate Moss...
Joey: Girls Chandler could never get?
Gene: (irritated) Supermodels!
Joey: Where? (looking around)
Monica: She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Ross: Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Monica: What? When was this?
Ross: Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited                            me at school.
Monica: Oh my God! That's wild!
Chandler: Yeah, but it was like a million years ago,                            so it doesn't matter.
Ross: Well, it matters to me.
Chandler: Why?
Ross: Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the                            night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Chandler: You kissed her that night too?
Monica: Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became                            a slut after she got her nose fixed.
Chandler: Seriously, where did this happen?
Ross: Okay, after you told me she was passed out in                            our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right.                            She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples' coats.                            Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know.                            But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started                            to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back.                            It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And                            now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
Chandler: Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Ross: Mine.
Chandler: I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Ross: No, she was definitely on my bed.
Chandler: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her                            on your bed?
Ross: Well, then who was on my bed?
Monica: (screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand                            in front of her mouth)
Ross: (realizing) NO! No, no!
Monica: YES! (Chandler gets an "oh no!" look                            on his face)
Ross: You were under the pile of coats?
Monica: I was the pile of coats!
Ross: OH MY GOD!
Monica: You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Ross: You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Monica: You were my first kiss ever?
Chandler: What did I marry into?
Monica: Oh, crap!
