</b>
               LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her early-
               thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very pretty 
               and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift.  She 
               is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus 
               tray underneath the counter.  It is making a lot of RACKET, 
               which she is oblivious to.  There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the 
               b.g., which she hums along with.

</b>
               THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming 
               coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, 
               which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left 
               from last night's dinner which had to "soak".  She is still 
               in her nightgown.  The TV is ON in the b.g.

               From the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering 
               project going on in the dining room, an obvious "do-it-
               yourself" attempt by Thelma.

<b>               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING

               Louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number.

               Phone RINGS.  Thelma goes over to answer it.

                         I hope you're packed, little 
                         housewife, 'cause we are outta her 
                         tonight.

</b>                         Well, wait now.  I still have to ask 
                         Darryl if I can go.

<b>                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
</b>                         You mean you haven't asked him yet?  
                         For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your 
                         husband or your father?  It's just 
                         two days.  For God's sake, Thelma.  
                         Don't be a child.  Just tell him 
                         you're goin' with me, for cryin' out 
                         loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous 
                         breakdown.

               Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out 
               coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board 
               already covered with them.  We see various recipes torn out 
               from women's magazines along the lines of "101 Ways to Cook 
               Pork."

<b>                                     THELMA
</b>                         He already thinks you're out of your 
                         mind, Louise, that don't carry much 
                         weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?

<b>                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
</b>                         No, I'm callin' from the Playboy 
                         Mansion.

<b>                                     THELMA
</b>                         I'll call you right back.

               Thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the 
               stairs and leans on the banister.

<b>                                     THELMA
</b>                         Darryl!  Honey, you'd better hurry 
                         up.

               DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs.  Polyester was made 
               for this man, and he's dripping in "men's" jewelry.  He 
               manages a Carpeteria.

<b>                                     DARRYL
</b>                         Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like 
                         that!  Haven't I told you I can't 
                         stand it when you holler in the 
                         morning.

<b>                                     THELMA
</b>                         I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want 
                         you to be late.

               Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and

               it's obvious he likes what he sees.  He exudes over-confidence 
               for reasons that never become apparent.  He likes to think 
               of himself as a real lady killer.

               He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed 
               hair.  Thelma watches approvingly.

</b>                         No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what 
                         we have for dinner.  I may not even 
                         make it home for dinner.  You know 
                         how Fridays are.

<b>                                     THELMA
</b>                         Funny how so many people wanna buy 
                         carpet on a Friday night.  You'd 
                         almost think they's want to forget 
                         about it for the weekend.

<b>                                     DARRYL
</b>                         Well then, it's a good thing you're 
                         not regional manager and I am.

               He's finally ready.  He walks to the door and gives Thelma 
               the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek.

<b>                                     THELMA

</b>                         See ya.

               Darryl leaves.  We see his Corvette parked out front.  As he 
               closes the front door, Thelma leans against it.

<b>                                     THELMA
</b>                         He's gonna shit.

               Thelma laughs to herself.  She goes back into the kitchen 
               and picks up the phone and dials it.

<b>               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING

               The pay phone on the wall RINGS.  ALBERT, a busboy in his 
               50's, answers.

<b>                                     ALBERT

                         gonna run away with me?

               Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand.

                         does it, how hard can it be?  I'll 
                         see you later.  Be ready.

               They both hang up.

               Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition.

<b>               INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY
</b>
               Going into the suitcase is bathing suits, wool socks, flannel 
               pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way 
               too much stuff for a two-day trip.  REVEAL Thelma, standing 
               in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, 
               as if she's forgotten something.  The room looks like it was 
               decorated entirely from a Sears catalog.  It's really frilly.

<b>               INT.  LOUISE'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY
</b>
               A perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and 
               orderly.  Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long 
               underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, 
               one nightgown.  She could be packing for camp.

               REVEAL Louise.  Her room is as orderly as the suitcase.

               Everything matches.  It's not quite as frilly as Thelma's, 
               but it is of the same ilk.  She is debating whether to take 
               an extra pair of socks.  She decides not to and closes the 
               suitcase.  She goes to the phone, picks it up and dials.  We 
               hear:

<b>                                     ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)
</b>                         Hi.  This is Jimmy.  I'm not here 
                         right now, but I'll probably be back 
                         'cause... all my stuff's here.  Leave 
                         a message.

               Louise slams down the phone.  A framed picture of Louise and 
               Jimmy sits on the table next to the phone.  She matter-of-
               factly slams that face down, too.

<b>               INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
               Thelma is still throwing stuff in, randomly now.  She talks 
               to herself quietly the whole time.

               She is taking stuff off of her nightstand, a small clock, 
               fingernail scissors, etc.

               She opens the drawer of her nightstand.  Her attitude is 
               purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's 
               doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision 
               is completely arbitrary.  As she rifles through it, plucking 
               various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there 
               is a gun in there, one Darryl bought her for protection.  It 
               is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets.  She picks up 
               the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse.

                         Psycho killers...

               She grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too.  She 
               tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out 
               all over the place.  She stuffs things back in the sides and 
               heaves all her weight against the top.

<b>               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Louise's green '66 T-Bird convertible pulls into the driveway 
               of Thelma's house.  The garage door goes up and Thelma is 
               standing in the garage with all her gear.  A suitcase that 
               looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a 
               lantern.  Thelma's car, a beat-up gray Honda, is parked in 
               there, too.  Louise gets out of the driver's seat.

                         electricity off and tries to come in 
                         and kill us.

                         Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern 
                         will come in real handy.  Maybe we 
                         could tow your car behind, in case 
                         he steals the spark plugs.

                         makes it down the driveway.

               They load everything into the car.  The trunk barely closes.  
               Thelma heaves all her weight against it.  They get into the 
               car and pull out of the driveway.  As they drive down the 
               street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl.

               She is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the 
               air.

               They are driving down the interstate.  Thelma reaches for 
               her purse and finds the gun.

               Louise shrieks at the sight of it.

               Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive.

                         how to use it.  So will you take 
                         care of it?

               Louise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse 
               and holds it in her hand.  She tests the weight of it, and 
               then puts it under the seat.  Thelma puts the bullets under 
               the seat.

               They are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring.  
               Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&amp;B MUSIC.

               A huge semi-tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway 
               and HONKS.  The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked 
               women.  There is a bumper sticker on the back that says:

               Louise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager

               This place is jumpin'.  There are ten pool tables with crowds

               There are tables and booths.  The room is dense with smoke.  
               There is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because 
               the band is still setting up.  There are a lot of single

               Thelma knocks back her shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her 
               glass to the Waitress to bring her another one.  The Waitress 
               sees her and nods.  She turns back to face her friend.

                              (pause)
                         I wonder if Darryl's home yet.

               They both drift off momentarily, contemplating their domestic

                         This one's on Harlan.

               Thelma looks over at the bar where Harlan is grinning at 
               her, making dancing motions.  She smiles and waves at him.

               Her face becomes serious again as she turns back to Louise.

                         the ground you walk on.

               Thelma's mind goes too fast for her mouth, and the speed at 
               which she speaks can be staggering.  Louise is used to it.  
               Louise smiles wistfully at Thelma's assessment of the 
               situation.

                         some!

               She again drinks her whole shot of Wild Turkey and holds up 
               her glass, as the BAND strikes up a lively tune.

               Practically the whole place "whoops" and heads for the dance 
               floor.  Louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her 
               glass, too.

               Thelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while.  
               Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named DAN.  Thelma 
               is breathless, drunk and giggly.  She holds a beer bottle in 
               one hand.  She is laughing a lot about nothing, and Harlan 
               is studying her closely.  Louise notices this.

                         I don't feel so good.

               She stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle.

               Louise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a 
               line of at least fifteen women in front of her.

               Harlan is hauling Thelma out the door into the parking lot.  
               She is pretty limp.

               The Waitress is going over to their table.  She picks up 
               Thelma's purse off the floor and puts it on her chair.

               She sets the check on the table, looks around to see if she 
               can see them and walks away.

<b>               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Louise goes into the bathroom.  She stands in front of the 
               sink and looks at herself in the mirror.

<b>               EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
               Thelma has been sick.  She has Harlan's handkerchief and is 
               wiping her mouth.  Harlan has backed off for this part, but 
               he's right back in there.

               Harlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her 
               head away.

               He pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her.  
               Thelma pulls away.

               Louise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in.  
               She scans the room looking for Thelma.  She doesn't see her.  
               She goes over to the table and sees Thelma's stuff there.  
               She picks up the check and looks at it.

               Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot.  
               He is trying to kiss her now.  He is pushing her arms down 
               and turning her head away.

               Harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning 
               to push him away harder.

               Louise is paying the Waitress.  The Waitress is shaking her 
               head, indicating she hasn't seen Thelma either.

               Louise picks up Thelma's stuff and heads towards the door.

               Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and 
               is kissing her neck.  He has her ass in his hands.  He is 
               beginning to hump her.  She is pushing him away as hard as 
               she can, but he is relentless.

               grabs her face, squeezing it hard.

               There is no trace of friendliness in his face now.  He looks 
               mean and dangerous.  He lets go of her face and pins her 
               arms behind her.  He holds both of her arms with one hand.

               With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her 
               dress up.  Thelma is still struggling and there are tears 
               running down her face.

               He turns her around, pushing her face down onto the back of 
               the car.  He holds both her arms in one hand and continues 
               pulling her dress up over her hips.  He starts to undo his 
               pants as we hear the CRUNCH of gravel.

               Harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and Thelma darts 
               out, pulling her dress down.

               Louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to 
               his face.  His pants are undone in the front.  She is still 
               backing away with the gun raised.  Thelma is inching away as

               Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second.  Then 
               she turns and walks away.  Thelma does, too.

               gun and FIRES a bullet into his face.  We hear his body HIT 
               the gravel parking lot.  LOUISE'S POV.  The car behind him

               Thelma is rummaging through her purse.  She finds her wallet 
               and takes it out.  Thelma finds some bills stuffed in the 
               change compartment and takes them out.  She straightens the 
               money out.

               As she is counting it, one of the bills flies out of her

               with Harlan all over it for prints.  Hal looks closely at 
               the back of the car.  He holds his hands over two sets of 
               hand prints.  He moves his hands to the outside of the prints 
               so as not to smear them, and puts his hands on the car.  His 
               face is one inch away from the trunk.  He sees a very clear 
               drop of blood.  It's different than any of the other blood 
               splatters on the car.  He calls the identification technician

               Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching

               Both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of

               and is drying her eyes, looking in the side mirror.  In the 
               mirror she sees the Hitchhiker come back around from the 
               side of the building.  He is several feet behind the car, 
               and she watches him as he removes his long-sleeved shirt and 
               stuffs it into his duffel bag.  Now he is just in T-shirt 
               and jeans.  He looks good.  Really good.  She watches in the 
               mirror as he picks up his stuff and heads towards the road.  
               She can see him as he's walking.  He stops.  He's thinking.  
               He heads over to the car.

                         have to ask my friend, but she'll 
                         probably say no.  She's a little 
                         uptight.

                         But thank you anyway.

               Now she wants him to come.  He starts to walk away from the

               Just then Louise comes out of the store.  She sees Thelma 
               talking to this guy and, for one moment, stops dead in her 
               tracks as she takes this in, then continues toward the car.  
               Although her face is basically expressionless, we see that 
               it's possible she might kill Thelma.

               The guy does seem really nice and Thelma is really frustrated 
               that Louise wouldn't give him a ride, but decides not to 
               confront her.

               Louise lowers the top and backs the car out.  They watch him 
               walk away.

               Louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road.  They 
               pass the Hitchhiker.  Thelma waves.

               She turns around in the seat to continue waving.  He smiles 
               and waves.  They drive down the road.  TIGHT SHOT of the 
               Hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face.

               Louise is completely unreasonable on this subject and Thelma

               press her further.

               Louise looks very shaken up.  She keeps her eyes on the road 
               but she's holding the steering wheel so tightly, her knuckles 
               are white.  She does not look at Thelma.  Suddenly she reaches 
               over and locks her door.  Thelma flinches imperceptibly at 
               this gesture.

               Louise and Jimmy walk outside and catch Thelma sitting very 
               close to J.D.  Thelma sees Jimmy and is so startled she 
               screams and involuntarily slams herself across the back seat 
               to the other side of the car.  She tries to look nonchalant.

               J.D. is climbing out of the car, looking very uncomfortable.

                         and then he'd have to go.  And that's

               Louise shoots Thelma a look.  The three of them drive around 
               to the back of the motel.  Thelma turns and looks at the 
               road.  J.D. is standing there.  He blows her a kiss.

               Thelma is taking their luggage out of the trunk.

               Jimmy helps carry the luggage to Thelma's room.  He stops at 
               the door.

               Louise smiles at him quizzically as if she can't believe 
               he's acting this way.  He turns on his heel and slinks away.

                         chase and that's it.  Once he's caught 
                         you, he don't know what to do.  So 
                         he runs away.

               They close the door to their room.  Louise sets the envelope

               Louise gets her purse and starts taking out her makeup.

               She stands very close to the mirror.  She is putting on lip 
               liner.  Thelma is watching.

               It's raining out.  Louise goes to Jimmy's room.

               Louise knocks on the door to room 115.  The door opens 
               slightly and one red rose pops out.

               The following eleven roses are held out the door, then Louise

               Thelma has taken a shower and is dressed in cut-offs and a T-
               shirt.  Her hair is still damp but she looks better than she 
               did when she arrived.  Thelma is fixing a drink of Wild Turkey 
               and Diet 7-Up in one of the motel room glasses.  There is a 
               KNOCK on the door.  She stops what she is doing and is 
               completely still.

               Thelma opens the door and there stands J.D., soaking wet 
               from the rain pouring down behind him.

               there.  Thelma just stands there looking at him.

               You can tell he does want to but doesn't want to say so.

               So instead he just kind of stands there with a reticent grin 
               on his face.

               wearing only his jeans, the top button of which is still

               Thelma has poured a drink for J.D. who's sitting on the edge 
               of the bed.  She walks over and hands it to him and as she 
               does, he takes the drink with one hand and her hand with the 
               other.  He sets the drink down on the nightstand and holds 
               her hand with both of his.  He closely studies her wedding 
               ring.  He suddenly looks up at her and gazes at her just as 
               intently.  He slowly shakes his head as he removes her ring 
               as if to say, "This is not right for you.  This isn't going 
               to work."  He looks at the ring as he moves it through space 
               finally stopping when the ring is directly over his drink.  
               He drops it in.  He looks back at Thelma and smiles as if to 
               say, "There.  Now don't you feel better?"  He smartly kisses 
               her hand.

               TIGHT SHOT of coffee beginning to drip into an empty coffee 
               pot.  Louise and Jimmy are sitting in a booth, both on the 
               same side.  They are both playing with their wedding rings.

               They look at each other, into each other and Jimmy can see 
               that Louise is already gone.  Louise is really touched that 
               he asked her that but she knows it's impossible.  She is 
               very kind to him.

                         up with you later, on down the road.

               In her hand she's been holding the ring in the black box.  
               She puts it on the table and slides it back to him.  He stops 
               her, suddenly.  He covers her hand with his.

               Jimmy is trying not to seem upset, so he's completely still.  
               A taxi pulls up outside.

               Jimmy pulls her to him and kisses her so passionately that 
               employees in the coffee shop look away.  A cook fans himself 
               with a spatula.  The taxi driver, who can see in, looks at 
               his watch.

               Louise looks at her hand and Jimmy's hand.

                         be.

               Jimmy gets up and leaves the coffee shop.  Louise watches 
               him go.  A WAITRESS comes over and fills her coffee cup.

               The Waitress chuckles and the other waitresses do too.  Louise 
               waves to Jimmy in the back of the cab.  The cab driver winks 
               at her.  She smiles to herself.

               hurrying by.  She looks disheveled but is grinning like an 
               idiot.  She sees Louise and charges into the coffee shop.

               Her energy and volume is several notches higher than the 
               rest of the people in the coffee shop.  There are a couple 
               more customers in there now.  Thelma slides into the booth 
               seated directly across from Louise.

               Thelma is just about to shriek when the Waitress comes over 
               and puts a coffee cup on the table and pours some.

               Thelma gets a grip on herself for a moment then loses it as

               Louise sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room.  Thelma 
               comes and sits beside her.  Neither one says anything for a 
               moment.

               Thelma marches off to the store.  Louise puts a tape in the 
               deck and is listening to loud R&amp;B MUSIC.  She checks herself 
               in the rearview mirror.  She takes her lipstick out and is 
               about to put it on.  She makes eye contact with herself and, 
               instead, throws it out the window, closes her eyes and leans 
               her head back on the seat.  She's in a world of shit.

               The car is SCREAMING down the road.  They drive through a

               Patrolman gets in the driver's side.  He picks up a clipboard

               They are both quiet for a second.  Louise goes a little 
               faster.

               Thelma is digging through her bag.  She hands Louise a piece 
               of beef jerky.

               They are both laughing.  The car is still flying down the

               to an intersection in the middle of nowhere.  Louise stops 
               and looks at the map.

               Louise bears down really hard and passes him.  Again as they 
               get right next to him, he blows kisses down at them.

               He is leering at them and laughing.  Louise and Thelma drive 
               further down the road.

               Louise pulls the car off to the side of the road.  As the 
               truck gets close they start waving to him to stop.  He pulls 
               his truck off the side of the road and stops.  ANGLE ON Louise 
               and Thelma smiling up at him.  He chuckles to himself.  He 
               leans out the window.

               the gun at it, takes a second to get a bead, then SHOOTS two

               Thelma and Louise are just waiting for the cars to catch up.  
               The police cars stop in a line about two hundred yards behind 
               them.  The dust from the cars is blowing across them.  They 
               just sit looking at the Grand Canyon.

               From the canyon, the FBI helicopter rises up in front of the 
               car.

               Hal sees Thelma and Louise for the first time.  They are 
               sitting in the car, oblivious in a way, to all the activity 
               around them.  He only takes his eyes off of them long enough 
               to look at Max.

</b>                         All this for us?

               Thelma starts to laugh.  Louise is only concerned with missing 
               the cacti and other obstacles that lie before her.

</b>
               The helicopter lands behind the row of police cars.

<b>               HAL'S POV
</b>
               He sees Thelma and Louise facing each other.  They look so 
               nice.  He can't stop looking.  He borrows the binoculars 
               from Max.  He sees Thelma and Louise in the car.  Some of 
               the police sharpshooters are sporting semi-automatic rifles.  
               Hal looks at Max.

<b>                                     HAL
</b>                         Hey!  Don't let them shoot those 
                         girls.  This is too much.  They got 
                         guns pointed at 'em!

                         standard.  Now you stay calm here.  
                         These boys know what they're doin'.

               Max climbs out of the chopper.  Hal sits for a moment and 
               then leaps out and follows Max.

               Thelma is smiling at her.

               They look at each other, look back at the wall of police 
               cars, and then look back at each other.  They smile.

               Hal is about to crawl out of his skin.  He can't believe 
               this thing is getting out of control.  He jumps in front of 
               Max.

                         something here!

               Max goes around Hal and continues walking.  Hal jumps in 
               front of Max again and blocks his way.

               Hal walks along with a look of total disbelief on his face.  
               He's shaking his head.  Slowly he breaks into a trot and 
               starts heading toward the front line.

               Hal is running now and clears the front row of cars.

               There is a lot of confusion among the officers on the front 
               row.  Some shout, some lower their guns to look.

               Hal's eyes widen for a moment at what he sees, and then a
