<b>                                                          FIRST DRAFT
</b>



          HAZEL GRACE LANCASTER (16) lies in the grass, staring up at
          the stars. We're CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear:

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           You have a choice in this world, I
           believe, about how to tell sad
           stories.

          CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES:
          - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS "GUS"
          WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.
          [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.]

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           On the one hand, you can sugar coat
           - the way they do in movies and
           romance novels.

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus sit on a BENCH
          overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country.
          She rests her head on his shoulder.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           Where villains are vanquished
           and... heroes are born and...
          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus kiss in a dark room.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           ... beautiful people learn
           beautiful lessons...

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus fall onto a bed together.
          They look deep into one another's eyes.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           ... and nothing is too messed up
           that can't be fixed with an apology
           and a Peter Gabriel song.

          BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were
          those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           I like that way as much as the next
           girl, believe me. It's just not the
           truth.

          Hazel closes her eyes.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           This is the truth.
          And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR:

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           Sorry.

<b>           FADE IN ON:
</b>
<b>           2.
</b>
                         

<b>          INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>          The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           Late in the Winter of my 17th
           year...

          There are, however, some key and obvious differences.
          First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which
          help her to breathe.

          Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the
          grass. It's much shorter than the "Perfect" version, the
          result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
          years before.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           ... my mother decided I was
           depressed.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm not depressed.

          Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her
          mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains
          to the DOCTOR:

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           ... she eats like a bird. She
           barely leaves the house,

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm not depressed.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           ... she reads the same book over
           and over...

<b>                          DOCTOR
</b>           She's depressed.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm not depressed!

          Off her look, CUT TO:
          QUICK SEQUENCE, which play over:

<b>                          HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           The booklets and web sites always
           list depression as a side effect of
           cancer...

          - A SHOPPING MALL. Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossipping,
          laughing - being teenage girls, basically. And here's Hazel.
          With her Mom. And her oxygen tank. Just another day.

<b>           3.
</b>
                         

<b>                          HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           Depression's not a side effect of
           cancer...

          - HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM. She sits watching game shows in the
          middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A
          glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.
          Hazel eyes them with indifference.

<b>                          HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           ... it's a side effect of dying.

          - A STARBUCKS. Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily
          underlined copy of a novel ("An Imperial Affliction" by Peter
          Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of
          delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his
          shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat
          - goes back to the book.

<b>                          HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           Which is what was happening to me.

          And we CUT BACK TO:

                         

<b>          INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - SAME
</b>
          Frannie continues to talk to the doctor. Hazel continues to
          dangle her feet.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           ... some days she won't even get
           out of bed.
          The Doctor scratches his beard, thinking.

<b>                          DOCTOR
</b>           I may switch you to Zoloft. Or
           Lexapro. And twice a day instead of
           once.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Why stop there?

<b>                          DOCTOR
</b>           Hmm?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm
           like the Keith Richards of cancer
           kids.
          The Doctor looks at Frannie who just shakes her head.

<b>                          DOCTOR
</b>           Have you been going to that Support
           Group I suggested?
          Instead of answering, Hazel looks at her Mom.

<b>           4.
</b>
                         

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           She's gone a few times.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm not sure it's for me.

<b>                          DOCTOR
</b>           If you're depressed --

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>
<b>                          (EXASPERATED)
</b>           I'm not de--

<b>                          DOCTOR
</b>
<b>                          (IGNORING HER)
</b>           -- support Groups are a great way
           to connect with people who are...

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           What?

</b>
<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           On the same journey.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           "Journey?" Really?

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Hazel.

<b>                          DOCTOR
</b>           Just give it a chance, ok? For me.
          Hazel rolls her eyes, knows she's lost this battle.

<b>                          DOCTOR
</b>           Who knows? You might even find
           it... enlightening.

</b>           ... we are gathered here today -
           literally - in the heart of Jesus.
          ANGLE on Hazel who just shakes her head. This is the lamest
          thing she could be doing right now.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Who would like to share their story
           with the group?
          The basement is filled with SICK PEOPLE. Hazel among them.
          Most are under the age of 18. QUICK CUTS:

</b>           Patrick. 34. Testicular. It started
           a few years ago, when I was...
          As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear:

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           I'll spare you the gory details of
           Patrick's ball cancer. Basically,
           they found it in his nuts, cut most
           of it out, he almost died, but he
           didn't die, and now here he is -
           divorced, friendless, addicted to
           video games, exploiting his
           cancertastic past in the heart of
           Jesus - "literally" - to show us
           that one day - if we're lucky - we
           could be just like him.
          They all say:

<b>           ALL IN UNISON
</b>           "We're here for you Patrick."
          Hazel says it the least enthusiastically. She locks eyes with
          her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye
          patch, ISAAC. He's also shaking his head.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Who else would like to share?

<b>                          (NO RESPONSE)
</b>           Hazel?
          Oh no. Patrick gestures for her to speak. Reluctantly she
          stands, sighs...

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm, uh, Hazel. 16.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Thyroid originally but with quite
           the impressive satellite colony in
           my lungs.
          Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           And how are you doing Hazel?
          Hazel has no idea how to answer that.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           You mean besides the terminal
           cancer?

<b>           6.
</b>
                         
          But that's not what she says. She says:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Alright? I guess...?
          Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down.

<b>           ALL IN UNISON
</b>           "We're here for you Hazel."
          Hazel exhales. This is not at all helpful. A few more beats.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Maybe now I'll play a song...

                         

<b>          EXT CHURCH - LATER
</b>          Frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a
          book, waiting for Group to be over. She sees the church door
          open and puts the book away. Hazel comes out. Frannie looks
          at her like "well, was it great?" Hazel just exhales and gets
          in the car. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
</b>          "America's Next Top Model" is on the TV. Hazel sits on one
          side of the L-shaped couch, flipping through her novel.
          Frannie and Hazel's dad MICHAEL (40s, kind, doing his best to
          stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her - but
          trying not to make it seem that way. After a few beats:

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           It's Friday night.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Hmm?

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           I was just thinking... you should
           call your friends, see what they're
           up to.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>
<b>                          (DISINTERESTED)

          Frannie and Michael look at one another, don't say anything.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           Wanna see a movie?
          Hazel looks up from the book. Sees her parents. Gets an idea.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Why don't you guys go to a movie?

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Love you.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Love you too Mom.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           The only thing worse than biting it
           from cancer - is having a kid bite
           it from cancer.
          As Frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter:

<b>           9.
</b>
                         

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Make some friends!
          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT CHURCH - SAME
</b>          Hazel walks towards the elevator. An EXTREMELY SICK LOOKING
          KID holds it open for her. Hazel thinks better of it.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'll take the stairs.
          The KID nods. The doors shut. Hazel is reminded - it could
          always be worse. She turns to go, walking right into:

                         

<b>                          GUS HAZEL
</b>          Ooph. Sorry!

                         
          A SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL BOY (we will come to know him as GUS).
          Tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue
          eyes. Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life.

<b>                          GUS HAZEL
</b>          My bad. No, it's...

                         
          For a brief moment, the Earth stops. They stand looking at
          one another. Hazel is speechless.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Excuse me.
          With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face,
          Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:

                         

<b>          INT BATHROOM - SAME
</b>          Hazel catches her breath. Shakes her head. Surprised at
          herself.
          She looks in the mirror. So doesn't like what she sees. The
          Earth starts moving again. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT CHURCH BASEMENT - LATER
</b>          Hazel sits in the Circle of Sick.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Who would like to begin?
          No volunteers. Hazel catches sight of the Beautiful Boy,
          sitting next to Isaac. He seems to be watching her, that same
          flirty smile on his face. She self-consciously looks away.

<b>           10.
</b>
                         

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Isaac, I know you're facing a
           challenging time. Perhaps you would
           like to say something...
          Isaac nods, rises.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           Yeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye
           cancer.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           It's looking like another surgery
           in a couple weeks. After which,
           well, I'll be blind...
          Hazel tries to focus on what Isaac's saying but it's
          difficult. She still feels the Beautiful Boy's gaze on her.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           Not that I'm complaining or
           anything. I know a lot of you have
           it way worse but, still, I mean,
           you know, being blind's gonna
           suck...
          As Isaac shares, the Beautiful Boy doesn't look away from
          Hazel. Hazel finds this intimidating. And intimidation
          irritates her. So she decides to play the game with him,
          meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly.
          A staring contest.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           ...My girlfriend helps. And friends
           like Augustus here...
          Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name -
          AUGUSTUS. He still doesn't look away from Hazel.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           So... yeah. That's what's up.

<b>           ALL IN UNISON
</b>           "We're here for you Isaac."
          The staring contest continues another few beats until:

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           And does your friend want to speak?
          This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away. Aha,
          he's lost the contest! Hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up
          as if to say "Victory is mine!" He smiles back at her, the
          most radiant smile on the planet. He turns back to the Group.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Hi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a
           touch of osteosarcoma bout a year
           and a half ago - lost this baby as
           a result...

<b>           11.
</b>
                         
          Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           But really I'm just here at Isaac's
           request.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           And how are you feeling Augustus?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller
           coaster that only goes up, my
           friend.
          Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops
          smiling and looks away.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Perhaps you'd like to share your
           fears with the group, Augustus.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           My fears?
          Gus thinks about this.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Oblivion.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Oblivion?
          ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Yeah, see... I intend to live an
           extraordinary life. To be
           remembered. If I'm scared of
           anything it's... not doing that.
          Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Would, uh, anyone like to speak to
           that?
          And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>           Hazel! That's unexpected.
          Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus
          watches her, waits for it.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I just wanna say... there will come
           a time when, you know, all of us
           are dead.
          Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.

<b>           12.
</b>
                         

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           It might be tomorrow. Might be a
           million years from now but... it's
           gonna happen. And when it does,
           enough generations will come and
           go, there'll be no one left to
           remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or
           Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us,
           right?
          The look on Gus's face is unreadable.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oblivion's inevitable. And if that
           scares you, well, I suggest you
           ignore it. God knows it's what
           everyone else does.
          A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face,
          not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER
</b>          Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear.
          Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a
          redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow
          against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between
          kisses, we can hear:

<b>                          ISAAC MONICA
</b>          Always. Always.

                         
          And Hazel hears:

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Literally.
          Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing
          right next to her.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I thought we were in a church
           basement but apparently we were
           literally in the heart of Jesus.
          Hazel smiles.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Someone should probably tell him,
           don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda
           dangerous keeping all these kids
           with cancer in your heart.
          Gus laughs.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           What's your name?

<b>           13.

<b>                          (CONFUSED)
</b>           Hazel Grace Lancaster.
          Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           What?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I didn't say anything.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Why are you looking at me like
           that?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Because you're beautiful.
          Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I enjoy looking at beautiful people
           and I decided a while back not to
           deny myself the simpler pleasures
           of existence. Particularly given
           that, as you so astutely pointed
           out, we're all gonna die pretty
           soon.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           I'm not beaut --
          A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them.

<b>                          YOUNG GIRL
</b>           Hey Gus.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Hey Alisa.
          Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course
          they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at
          each other. She hears:

                         

<b>                          ISAAC MONICA
</b>          Always. Always.

                         

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           What's with the "always?"

<b>           14.
</b>
                         

<b>                          GUS
</b>           "Always" is their thing. They'll
           "always" love each other and
           whatnot. Must have texted "always"
           to each other at least four million
           times this year.
          They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac
          squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           He's gotta be hurting her boob.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Let's watch a movie.
          Hazel is again surprised.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oh. Um. Uh...
           (yes!)
           Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free this

<b>                          WEEK--

<b>                          GUS
</b>           No I mean now.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           What?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Hmm?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           What do you mean "now?"

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I've got a car.
          He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           You could be an axe murderer.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           There is that possibility.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk.
          As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in
          disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between
          his lips.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're
           kidding right?
           (off his look)
           You just ruined the whole thing!

</b>           Whole thing?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           What, you think that's cool? Oh you
           idiot! There's always a hamartia,
           isn't there? And yours is - even
           though you had FREAKING CANCER you
           give money to a corporation for the
           chance to acquire EVEN MORE
           CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so
           well.
          As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on
          his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Let me tell you... not being able
           to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Hamartia?
          Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           A fatal flaw.
          Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still
          etched on his face.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           They don't hurt you unless you
           light them.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Sorry?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I've never lit one.
          Hazel turns back to him.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It's a metaphor. See? You put the
           thing that kills you between your
           teeth. But you don't give it the
           power to do the killing.
          Hazel is floored. And impressed.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Metaphor.
          Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Hi sweetheart. Ready for some
           "Model?"

<b>           16.
</b>
                         
          Hazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. Cool as
          anything. Handsome as hell. She looks back at her mom.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Can't tonight.
           (off her confused look)
           I've made plans with Augustus
           Waters.
          And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with
          the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or
          awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT GUS'S CAR - LATER
</b>          Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world's worst
          driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the
          seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck
          snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face.

<b>                          GUS

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Tell me about it!
          Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           The fourth time I took the test...
           it was going about how this is
           going... and when it was over, the
           instructor looks at me and goes,
           "your driving, while unpleasant...
           is not technically unsafe."

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Aha. Cancer perk.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Total cancer perk.
          A few beats of silence.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           So what happened to you?
          Hazel takes a deep breath. She's told this story before but
          somehow this seems different.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I was 13 when they found it.
          And as she speaks, we see it unfold. SMASH CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT HOSPITAL BED - FLASHBACK
</b>          13-YEAR OLD HAZEL has a biopsy.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           Stage IV thyroid cancer.

                         

<b>          INT OPERATING ROOM - FLASHBACK
</b>          13-YEAR OLD HAZEL on the operating table. It's a nightmare.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           I had surgery first.

                         

<b>          INT SEVERAL MORE HOSPITAL ROOMS - FLASHBACK
</b>          This poor little girl is taking a beating. And it's just
          getting started.
          - Radiation treatment.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           Then Radiation...
          - Having her head shaved by Frannie.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           Then Chemo...
          - With a PICC line in a chemo chair.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           All of which worked for a while.
          - A RADIOLOGIST looks at an X-ray. He's not pleased.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           And then stopped working.
          - 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe.
          Frannie runs her fingers through her hair. Dad calls 9-1-1.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           And then my lungs started filling
           up with water.
          - In the ICU, her parents standing over her.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           That should have been the end.

<b>           18.
</b>
                         

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           (through the tears)
           Are you ready, sweetie?
          14-Year Old Hazel nods. Michael can't keep it together any
          longer. He completely breaks down.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           But it wasn't.

                         

<b>          INT ICU - THE NEXT MORNING
</b>          The sun shines in the room. 14-year old Hazel eats ice chips,
          the color has returned to her cheeks.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           The antibiotics kicked in. They
           drained the fluid from my lungs.
           And in time I got better. Stronger.

                         

<b>          INT YET ANOTHER HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b>          Slightly older Hazel is getting more intravenous medication.
          It's never ending.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           I even found myself in an
           experimental trial. You know the
           ones that are famous in the
           Republic of Cancervania for not
           working.
          - A SECOND RADIOLOGIST examines a second X-ray.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           It's called Phalanxifor. Didn't
           work in over 70 percent of patients
           but, for some reason...
          The Radiologist looks surprised.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           ...it worked in me. They called it
           "The Miracle."
          And finally, BACK TO:

                         

<b>          INT GUS'S CAR - SAME
</b>          Gus has one eye on the road, the other on Hazel. He was
          impressed with her before. He's totally dazzled now.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly
           grown since...

<b>                          HAZEL (CONT'D)
</b>           Of course my lungs still suck but,
           theoretically, they could continue
           to suck in just this way for, I
           dunno, a while maybe.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Wow.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Yeah.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           So are you back in school or...?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Can't.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Why not?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Got my GED.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           A college girl! Well that explains
           the aura of sophistication...
          He smiles at her. She smiles back. Shoves his upper arm
          playfully. They're easing into each other.
          Eventually Gus's car pulls into his driveway.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           We're here.
          He's as good at parking as he is at driving. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          EXT/INT GUS'S HOUSE - SAME
</b>          Hazel follows Gus inside. She quickly notices all sorts of
          engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like "Home is
          Where the Heart Is" and "True Love is Born from Hard Times."
          Hazel looks at Gus quizzically.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           My parents call them
           "encouragements."
           (rolling his eyes)
           Don't ask.
          Gus's MOM and DAD (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Hey guys.

<b>                          GUS'S MOM

<b>           20.
</b>
                         
          Gus's parents don't seem surprised to see Gus with some
          random girl in their house. Hazel takes note of that.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           This is Hazel Grace.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           It's just... Hazel.

<b>                          GUS'S DAD
</b>           How's it going, Just Hazel?

<b>                          GUS
</b>
<b>                          (ABRUPTLY)

          Gus drags Hazel to the next room. As she's pulled:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Nice to meet you!
          They walk down the carpeted stairs - Gus having an easier
          time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and
          weak lungs.
          Eventually they arrive at Gus's basement bedroom. There's a
          TV with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole
          host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers, school
          trophies, framed images etc.) Gus sees her looking at them.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I used to play.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Must have been pretty good.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           These are mine. And these. The rest
           of it's just cancer perks.
          Gus grabs a DVD from his stack of DVDs. Hazel sits down on
          the bed, her breathing noticeably heavier.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Need to sit.
          Gus sits down next to her on the bed.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Don't get any ideas.
           (catching her breath)
           All that standing... and stairs...
           and then more standing... lotta
           standing for me.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I understand.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'll be fine in a minute. Unless I
           faint. I'm a bit of a Victorian
           lady, fainting-wise.
          Gus smiles. He waits for her breathing to slow down. In time:

<b>                          GUS
</b>           You ok?
          Hazel nods, smiles.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           So what's your story?

<b>                          HAZEL

           people who becomes their disease.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           No. I'm just... I don't know... un-
           extraordinary.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I reject that out of hand.
           (beat, Hazel shrugs)
           Think of something you love. First
           thing that comes to mind.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           "An Imperial Affliction."

<b>                          HAZEL

           (off his look)
           But not in that way, trust me. The
           guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten,
           he's... well, the only person I've
           ever come across who seems to a)
           understand what it's like to be
           dying and b) not have died.

           this horrible book with the boring
           title that does not contain zombies
           or stormtroopers. And in
           exchange...
          Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           ... all I ask is that you read this
           brilliant and haunting novelization
           of my favorite video game.
          Hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella. She laughs.
          She's adorable when she laughs. She takes the book from him
          and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a
          brief, charged moment.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Your hands are cold.

<b>                          HAZEL

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           That's different.
          Hazel shrugs. Frannie looks intrigued.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Did he give it to you?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           By "it" do you mean herpes?
          Frannie rolls her eyes. Hazel's phone buzzes. She excitedly
          checks it - only to be disappointed. Frannie notices.

<b>                          FRANNIE

           anything. I just... we hung out. No
           big deal.
          Frannie says nothing to that. Her silence says it all. Hazel
          rolls her eyes. CUT TO:

<b>          QUICK SERIES OF SCENES:

          - Watching TV. And checking her phone.
          - Eating breakfast. And checking her phone.
          - Looking out the window on a rainy day. Trying not to check
          her phone. Willing herself to not check the goddamn phone.
          And checking the phone.

          Hazel's phone buzzes. She tries not to seem too eager to
          check it, what with her parents watching and all. She subtly
          looks down at her lap. And sure enough: a text from Gus! Her
          eyes bug out. We see:

          Hazel smiles. Goes back to eating. Frannie and Michael share
          a quick glance. A second later, there's a follow-up text.
          "Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book!"
          Hazel smiles again.
          And then a third text:

<b>          "A BOOK CAN"T END IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE?! WHAT IN GOD'S

           make this better or worse?
          Hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Isaac! Focus. On. Me.
          Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on. Finally:

<b>                          (TO HAZEL)
</b>           How fast can you get here?
          Hazel thinks about this. And on her face, CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT GUS'S BASEMENT - LATER
</b>          Hazel descends the steps. She hears an ungodly moan before
          she sees anyone. What has she gotten herself into? Gus
          appears at the base.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           (calling to Isaac)
           Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is
           coming downstairs.
          Gus waits for a response. None comes. He gestures for her to
          follow him into the room. Before he does:

<b>                          GUS
</b>           A gentle reminder: Isaac is in the
           midst of a psychotic episode.

<b>                          (HAZEL NODS)
</b>           You look nice, by the way.
          Hazel blushes, follows Gus into the room to find Isaac
          sitting upside down in a gaming chair. Tears are flowing down
          his reddened cheeks. Empty soda cans and bags of junk food
          lie around him.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           How ya doing Isaac?
          Again, no response. Hazel looks to Gus for an explanation.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Seems Isaac and Monica are no
           longer a going concern.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oh I'm sorry.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Do you want to talk about it?
          Isaac starts to sob again.

<b>           26.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           He just wants to cry and play video
           games.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Fair enough.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It doesn't hurt to talk to him,
           however. If you have any sage words
           of feminine advice...

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I actually think his response is
           appropriate.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           "Pain demands to be felt."

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           (lights up at that)
           You're quoting my book!
          Gus winks at her. At which point, Isaac lets out another
          howl. Gus gestures for Hazel to sit. The two of them flank
          Isaac. He finally speaks.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           She didn't want to do it after the
           surgery. Said she couldn't handle
           it. I'm about to lose my eyesight
           and she can't handle it.
          Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           I kept saying "always" to her.
           Always, always, always. And she
           just kept talking over me and not
           saying it back. It was like I was
           already gone, you know? "Always"
           was a promise! You can't break
           promises.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Sometimes people don't understand
           the promises they're making when
           they make them.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           Right, sure, but you keep the
           promise anyway. That's what love
           is. Love is keeping the promise
           anyway.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           That could be an "encouragement."
          It's silent for a beat. And then Isaac stands up, a funny
          look on his face.

<b>           27.
</b>
                         

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Isaac...?
          Suddenly Isaac starts kicking his chair across the room.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Here we go...
          The chair lands against the bed. Gus hands Isaac something
          else to throw, a pillow. Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it
          against the wall. He dives on it and beings pummeling the
          pillow like a maniac.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           That's it! Punch that thing.
          And so he does. As he continues to, Gus looks at Hazel,
          cigarette dangling from his mouth.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I've been wanting to call you on a
           nearly minutely basis but I have
           been waiting until I could form a
           coherent thought in re: "An
           Imperial Affliction."

<b>                          (SHE SMILES)
</b>           I can't stop thinking about it.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I know, right?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           The only problem is the ending.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           It is rather abrupt.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It's torture! I mean, I totally get
           that she died or whatever - Anna.
           But there is an unwritten contract
           between author and reader and I
           think ending your book in the
           middle of a sentence kind of
           violates that contract.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           But that's part of what I like
           about it. It portrays death
           truthfully. You die in the middle
           of your life, in the middle of a
           sentence. But I do - God, I do want
           to know what happens to everyone
           else.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Yeah like her Mom.

          Hazel beams. Gus totally gets the book. A bond between them.

<b>                          GUS

           Peter Van Houten?

<b>                          HAZEL

           Amsterdam, became a recluse. Hasn't
           published anything. Doesn't do
           interviews.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Sad.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Hang on.
           (turns to Isaac)
           Isaac!
          Gus stands and takes the pillow out of Isaac's hand.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Pillows don't break.
          Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball TROPHIES.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           You need to break something.
          Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission.
          Gus nods. Isaac holds it over his head and SMASH! The trophy
          breaks into a million pieces. Isaac almost smiles. Gus hands
          him another.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Go to town, my friend.
          And Isaac does. Smashing them one by one. Hazel looks at Gus.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I've been looking for a way to tell
           my Dad that I kinda hate
           basketball. Think maybe we've found
           it.
          Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES, smashing them to pieces.
          Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle. When there are none left
          Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Feel better?
          Isaac thinks about it. Shakes his head no. Gus puts his arm
          around him but looks at Hazel.

           demands to be felt.
          Hazel smiles. And on her face, we CUT TO:

          Hazel nods. This could be a source of worry but she's not
          going to think about that right now. She's upbeat. And she's
          actually eating, which her parents can't help but notice.

          enthusiastically telling a story and she's enjoying every
          moment of it.
          - Hazel helping Gus become a better driver. It's no use.

          And finally, back in Hazel's bedroom. She finishes reading

           or whatever, but everybody should
           have true love. Don't you think?
          Hazel thinks about it as Isaac presses the button on his pain
          pump, self-administering morphine.

<b>                          ISAAC

</b>           Speaking of which...
          Gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. He
          clears his throat.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           You're probably wondering why

           cheese sandwich and drinking orange
           juice with a guy in a Rik Smits
           jersey.

</b>           Hazel Grace, like so many before
           you - and I say this with great
           affection - you spent your Wish...
           moronically.

</b>           Sorry. Please, continue...

<b>                          GUS
</b>           You were young. Impressionable. The
           Grim Reaper staring you in the
           face. And the fear of dying with
           your one true Wish left ungranted
           led you to rush into making one you
           didn't really want, for how could
           little Hazel Grace, having never
           read "An Imperial Affliction" ever
           know that her one TRUE wish was to
           visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his
           Amsterdamian exile.
          Hazel nods in agreement.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           If you were smart, you would have
           saved your wish til the time in

          Gus stops talking. Hazel is confused.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           But I... didn't save it.
          Gus smiles.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Good thing I saved mine.
          Hazel cocks her head to one side. What is he talking about?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Got it in exchange for the leg.

<b>                          (BEAT)

          She starts to realize.

</b>           Are you saying --

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I'm not gonna give you my Wish or
           anything. But I too have an
           interest in meeting Peter Van
           Houten and it wouldn't make much
           sense to meet him without the girl
           who introduced me to his book, now
           would it?
           (Hazel's eyes widen)
           I talked to the Genies and they're
           in total agreement.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           We leave on May third.
          Hazel is so excited that she grabs Gus and pulls him into a
          hug. Their faces close, lips inches apart, and just when it
          looks like something might happen --

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Wait a minute.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Are you only doing this so I'll
           kiss you?
          A beat. Gus blinks a few times.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Cause I'd totally kiss you either
           way.
          And kiss him she does. He's surprised. And when it's over,
          they sit back, look at one another. A magic moment.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Seriously... why are you doing
           this?

</b>           It's too much, Haze. We can't

</b>           The PET scan is encouraging. We

           So you'll come too.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           What?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           The Genies can hook it up. They're

          And judging from her face, seems she'd kinda like to. Dr.
          Maria looks at Frannie, shrugs - kid's got a point.
          Hazel smiles. And on that smile, we SMASH CUT TO:

<b>           BLACK.
</b>          Over which, we HEAR:

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           And then this happened.

                         

<b>          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>          [Note: There's no sound in this sequence. Just images.]
          Hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, shaking
          and holding her head.
          Frannie and Michael burst in. Mom grabs her crying daughter,
          frightened beyond belief, waves to Michael to call for help.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           People talk about the courage of

           that courage...
          He leaves the room to do so and Fran stays behind, rocking
          with her daughter, promising her it'll all be ok. Whatever
          nightmare this is, it's going to end. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT FRANNIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

<b>           45.
</b>
                         
          Hazel continues to scream in silence, whether from pain or
          terror, we do not know.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           I'd been poked and stabbed and
           poisoned for years and still I trod
           on.

                         

<b>          INT EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          They're practically running. There's still no sound.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           But make no mistake...
          The doctors rally to assist the screaming, crying child.
          She's wheeled away from her family who can only watch. We
          stay with her and WE HEAR:

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           In that moment I would have been
           very, very happy to die.

<b>          END SEQUENCE.

<b>          INT HOSPITAL ROOM - ICU - MORNING
</b>          The sound returns. And it's the sound of a heart monitor.
          BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It's also the sound of a working heart.
          Hazel has made it through. Her eyes open. A NURSE is there.

<b>                          HAZEL'S NURSE
</b>           Hello.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Hi.

<b>                          HAZEL'S NURSE
</b>           You're ok, Hazel.
          Even Hazel seems surprised by that.

<b>                          HAZEL'S NURSE
</b>           Would you like to see your parents?
          Hazel nods. The Nurse goes to get them. Soon they come
          bounding in, crying and kissing her repeatedly. So much
          relief. CUT TO:
          LATER. Hazel's bed has been raised up so she can talk to her
          parents "comfortably."

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           They thought it was a brain tumor.

</b>           It wasn't - thank god --

<b>           46.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           So what happened?

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           The usual. Fluid in the lungs,
           preventing oxygenation. They put
           that in...
          There's a TUBE in Hazel's side draining fluid into a plastic
          bladder that hangs off her bed.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Drained a liter and a half last
           night.
          (That's a lot of fluid.)

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           The good news is... no tumor
           growth. No new tumors in your body.
          Hazel nods. That is a relief.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           We're all so relieved.
          Frannie embraces her daughter.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           This is just a thing Hazel. It's a
           thing we can live with.
          Hazel nods again. Only in the universe of Hazel Grace
          Lancaster is something like this just a thing. Meanwhile:

                         

<b>          INT HOSPITAL ICU - WAITING AREA - LATER
</b>          Here's Gus, his foot tapping nervously on the floor. It's
          unclear how long he's been waiting there. He sees Michael
          walk down the hall. Races after him.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Mr. Lancaster! How's she doing?

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           Better, thank you. Much better.
          Gus nods, as relieved as the rest of them.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           They won't let me in. Family only.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           I'm sorry --

<b>                          GUS
</b>           No I get it. Will you just... will
           you tell her I was here?

<b>           47.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           Of course I will.
          Gus smiles. And sits back down. Though he won't get to see
          her, he still wants to stay.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           Gus.
          Michael really likes this kid.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           Why don't you go home, get some
           rest?

<b>          INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYS LATER
</b>          Hazel and her Parents sit at a very large conference table
          along with Dr. Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole
          "Cancer Team."

<b>                          ONCOLOGIST #1
</b>           The great news is... Phalanxifor
           continues to control your tumor
           growth.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           The not so great news is we're
           still seeing serious problems with
           fluid accumulation.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           So how should we proceed?
          Silence. Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to
          answer. No one does.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Um, I feel like I'm not the most
           qualified person to answer that.

<b>                          ONCOLOGIST #1
</b>           I was talking to Dr. Simmons.
          DR. SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next.

<b>           DR. SIMMONS
</b>           It's a strange case. Normally the
           tumors start resisting the
           treatment. But that hasn't happened
           here - yet.
          Hazel hears the "yet" the loudest.

<b>           DR. SIMMONS
</b>           Unfortunately, the drug may be
           worsening the edema.

<b>           48.
</b>
                         

<b>           DR. MARIA
</b>           But if we stopped it entirely,
           we're likely to face even graver
           dangers.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           So we're gonna do nothing?

<b>           DR. MARIA
</b>           That's what we have to decide. The
           truth is... very few people have
           been on Phalanxifor as long as
           Hazel has. We don't really know the
           long term effects.
          That comforts no one.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Can't I just get like a lung
           transplant or something?
          The Doctors look at one another like "who wants to take that
          one?" Eventually:

<b>           DR. MARIA
</b>           You would not be considered a...
           strong candidate for a transplant.
          Hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn't bother
          her. Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a
          little bit. He grabs Frannie's hand.

<b>           DR. SIMMONS
</b>           We're trying to prevent endothelial
           growth while at the same time
           preventing immunosorbent...
          As Dr. Simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook,
          Hazel's eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents. She hates
          what she's doing to them. And seeing them holding hands,
          crying but trying not to cry - it jogs a memory. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT HOSPITAL ICU - FLASHBACK

          old Hazel. Her father is weeping off to the side while her
          mom stands over her, holding her hand, and asking:

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           (through the tears)
           Are you ready, sweetie?
          13-year old Hazel nods. The doctors get to work. The
          anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under. But not enough.
          Cause she totally hears her mother say:

<b>                          FRANNIE

</b>          Hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her
          staring at them. She tries to shake it off. Dr. Simmons is
          still talking nonsense when:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I have a question.

<b>           DR. MARIA
</b>           Yes Hazel.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Can I still go to Amsterdam?
          Dr. Simmons can't help himself. He laughs. Everyone looks at
          him. He clears his throat.

<b>           DR. SIMMONS
</b>           That would not be wise at this
           juncture.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Why not?

</b>
<b>                          I --
</b>          The doctors are trying to be delicate here.

<b>           DR. MARIA
</b>           It would... increase some risks --

          Hazel nods. Her phone buzzes. She looks at it. A text from
          Gus that reads: "ok?" Hazel looks at it.
          And she doesn't write back. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHT

          comes in from another room with the phone in hand. Whispers:

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           Gus again.
          Hazel thinks about it - silently shakes her head, no. Michael
          says into the phone.

</b>           I'm sorry Gus, she's asleep.
          Hazel stands and goes into her bedroom, clearly depressed.

</b>          Hazel reads from "An Imperial Affliction." Her phone buzzes
          again. "Augustus." It just says "hello?" Again she ignores
          it.
          And then a second text. She looks at it. "The silence is
          deafening." She puts the phone back down.
          Hazel's heart breaks. She can't take it anymore. She picks
          the phone back up. She texts the following:
          "I don't know if you'll understand this but I can't see you
          anymore. I mean I want to. I just..."
          She thinks about the rest. She writes:
          "I'm a grenade."
          She sends the text. Waits.
          And then there's more to say. She sends a second text.
          "When I look at you, all I can see is what I'm going to put
          you through. I can't have that. I'm sorry."
          She sends that text. Waits.
          He writes back.
          "Ok."
          Hazel reads it. Writes back: "Ok."
          A beat. Gus responds: "oh my god, stop flirting with me!"
          Hazel smiles - she can't help herself! - but she must. She
          gets her emotions in check. Puts the phone away. CUT TO:

</b>          Hazel walks out back. Looks up at the clouds, threatening
          rain but not yet delivering it. She sits down in the grass,
          on the verge of tears. She looks at the old rusty SWING SET
          that's been in her backyard for years.

          And starts to cry. Just for a few brief moments, she lets
          herself cry.
          Then she wipes the tears. Becomes strong again. And makes a
          decision.
          Hazel dials her phone. We hear:

           Dad made for me when I was a kid.
           It's just... everything.
          Hazel is on the verge of losing it again. A few beats of
          silence pass by.

          Gus is silent. He can't argue. They stand there quietly a few

          as the truck drives off.
          Then he sneaks a quick kiss on Hazel's cheek. She shoots him
          a look. Gus throws up his hands.

          As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside. A
          WOMAN'S VOICE yelling something unclear, followed by:

<b>           GUS (O.S.)
</b>
<b>           BECAUSE IT'S MY LIFE, MOM. IT
</b>
<b>           BELONGS TO ME!
</b>          Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly
          spins her back to the car.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Mom?

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           We can't eavesdrop, Hazel.
          Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure
          what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn.
          A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel
          bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips.

<b>                          GUS
</b>
<b>                          (TO FRANNIE)
</b>           Always a pleasure to see you ma'am.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Hello, Hazel Grace.

<b>           58.
</b>
                         

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Ok...?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Ok.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Ok.
          Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just
          says, when they stop and look at her:

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Amsterdam!

                         

<b>          EXT AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING
</b>          A SKYCAP helps Hazel, Gus and Frannie with all their bags and
          equipment.

                         

<b>          INT AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER
</b>          They wait in line for the security checkpoint. When it's
          Hazel's turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose.
          Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt.
          Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector.
          She seems determined to get through this without any help.
          But upon reaching the other side it's clear that even these
          few steps without oxygen were a struggle.
          Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady
          herself. As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula
          back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and
          focuses on her breathing. She catches her mom looking at her,
          nervously.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           (with some difficulty)
           Amsterdam!

                         

<b>          INT AIRPORT GATE - LATER
</b>          Arriving at the Gate area they draw curious looks from the
          OTHER PASSENGERS: Hazel with her oxygen tank, Gus with his
          noticeable limp and Frannie helping with the equipment.
          A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oh that's not necessary.
          But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them.
          We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the
          attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6, cute braids) appears.

<b>           59.
</b>
                         

<b>                          LITTLE GIRL
</b>           What's in your nose?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           It's called a Cannula. These tubes
           give me oxygen and help me breathe.
          The GIRL'S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic.

<b>                          GIRL'S MOTHER
</b>           Jackie... Oh, I'm sorry.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>
<b>                          (SINCERE)
</b>           No, no. It's alright.

<b>                          LITTLE GIRL
</b>           Would they help me breathe too?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I dunno. Wanna try?
          Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it.

<b>                          LITTLE GIRL
</b>           Tickles.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Right?

<b>                          LITTLE GIRL
</b>           I think I'm breathing better.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Well... I'd love to give you my
           cannula but... I kinda really need
           the help.
          The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly
          reattaches it.

<b>                          LITTLE GIRL
</b>           Thanks for letting me try it.
          They smile at each other before the Little Girl walks back to
          her family. She waves. Hazel waves back.

<b>           AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT (O.S.)
</b>           We will now begin pre-boarding
           Flight 144 to Amsterdam. For those
           passengers in need of extra
           assistance...

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I think that's us.

<b>           60.
</b>
                         

<b>          INT AIRPLANE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>          Hazel sits in the middle with Frannie on the aisle and Gus at
          the window. He looks around, antsy.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Have you never been on a plane
           before?
          Gus shakes his head, he has not. And he's nervous. He pulls a
          cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Within
          seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over.

<b>                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>           Sir, you can't smoke on this plane.
           Or... any plane.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           (cigarette in his mouth)
           I don't smoke.
          The Flight Attendant shoots him a look.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           It's a metaphor. He puts the
           killing thing in his mouth but
           doesn't give it the power to kill
           him.

<b>                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>
<b>                          (NO NONSENSE)
</b>           That metaphor is prohibited on
           today's flight.
          Gus nods and puts the cigarette away.

<b>                          PA SYSTEM
</b>           "Flight attendants, prepare for
           departure."
          The engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards
          take off. Gus is getting more worried by the second. He grabs
          the arm rest, his eyes wide.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Ok?
          Gus doesn't say it back. Hazel laughs.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           This is what it feels like to ride
           in a car with you.
          Gus grabs Hazel's hand as the plane lifts off. He looks out
          the window - they're flying! - and then back to Hazel.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           We're flying! Look!
          Hazel smiles at his enthusiasm.

<b>           61.
</b>
                         

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Holy -- look at that?! NOTHING HAS

<b>           EVER LOOKED LIKE THAT EVER IN ALL
</b>
<b>           OF HUMAN HISTORY!
</b>          He's adorable at this moment. Hazel can't resist leaning over
          to give him a kiss on the cheek.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           (not looking up from her

<b>                          MAGAZINE)
</b>           Just so you know, I'm right here.
           Sitting next to you. Your mother.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           We're just friends, Mom.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           She is. I'm not.
          Hazel shoots him a look. Gus shrugs - "what, it's the truth."
          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:
          LATER. Mid-flight, the plane is dark, Frannie's asleep. Hazel
          and Gus watch the same gory action movie. Actually, he
          watches the movie. She just watches him watch it. He watches
          it with gusto.
          Hazel continues to watch him. Try as she might, she's falling
          in love. CUT TO:
          SFX: the PLANE touching down. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          EXT/ INT AMSTERDAM HIGHWAY - TAXI CAB - MORNING
</b>          Hazel, Gus, and Frannie ride in the back of a YELLOW CAB.

<b>                          CAB DRIVER
</b>           Americans?

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           We're from Indiana.

<b>                          CAB DRIVER
</b>           Indiana. They steal from the
           Indians but the keep the name, yes?
          Hazel and Gus share a look.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Something like that.
          Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt
          tracks and the occasional concrete building. In other words,
          it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           (to the Driver)
           This is Amsterdam?

<b>           62.
</b>
                         

<b>                          CAB DRIVER
</b>           Yes and no. Amsterdam is like the
           rings of a tree. It gets older as
           you get closer to the center.
          Soon enough, the cab takes an off-ramp and turns a corner and
          suddenly, it's as if they're transported - not only to
          another universe but to another time as well.
          We see MULTI-COLORED ROW HOUSES lined on both sides of a
          windy CANAL. HOUSEBOATS float against the edges and everyone
          rides BICYCLES down cobblestone streets. They're astounded.

                         

<b>          INT HOTEL - LATER
</b>          Gus helps Hazel and Frannie bring their stuff into the room.
          We see a WICKER BASKET of gifts - presents from the Genies -
          welcoming their arrival. Hazel, exhausted, sits on the bed.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I'll be right down the hall.
          Hazel nods, already drifting off to sleep. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT HOTEL ROOM - HOURS LATER
</b>          Some time later. Hazel stirs. Her Mom is seated in a sagging,
          paisley CHAIR across from the bed reading a TRAVEL GUIDE.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Good morning.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Actually, it's five o'clock.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           How was the park?

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Never made it.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Mom!

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           What? I like watching you sleep.
          Hazel shoots Frannie a look. Even in an exotic city, her Mom
          still can't enjoy herself.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           I promise I'll do crazy Mom stuff
           tonight while you and Gus are at
           dinner.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           What do you mean?

<b>           63.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           You have reservations at a place
           called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set
           it up. Very fancy according to the
           Book. And romantic.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Mom...

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           I'm just saying...

<b>                          HAZEL

           with an older boy on the streets of
           a foreign city famous for its vice
           and debauchery... is totally cool
           with you. Is that what you're
           saying?

          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT HOTEL ROOM - LATER
</b>          Frannie opens the door to find Gus in a perfectly tailored
          BLACK SUIT, cigarette dangling from his mouth.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           (calling to the bathroom)

</b>           Looking sharp.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Thank you ma'am.
          A few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom. She wears
          a knee-length, pale blue SUNDRESS. And she looks...

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Wow.

<b>                          HAZEL

<b>           I...

</b>           Am I under-dressed?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           You look gorgeous.
          Gus offers Hazel his arm. She takes it. They're ready to go.

<b>           64.

<b>          INT/EXT AMSTERDAM - ON THE TRAM - LATER
</b>          Hazel and Gus ride the crowded tram through the city. ELM
          TREES line the canals, their pale petals blowing into the
          wind like a spring snowstorm.
          An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens
          all the time. Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls
          on deaf ears. She and Gus sit. They look out the window onto
          the city. Excited. The night just beginning.

                         

<b>          EXT ORANJEE RESTAURANT - LATER
</b>          At the edge of the canal, near an ancient bridge. Hazel and

<b>                          HOSTESS
</b>           Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters.
          Gus pulls out Hazel's chair for her. A WAITER brings them a
          bottle of CHAMPAGNE as they sit.

<b>                          HOSTESS
</b>           The champagne is our gift.
          Hazel and Gus look at each other. Is this a dream? The
          champagne is poured and Gus raises his glass.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Ok.
          Hazel raises hers.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Ok.
          They clink glasses and sip.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Wow that's good.

<b>                          WAITER

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           `Come quickly,' he said. `I am

          Hazel and Gus smile.

<b>                          WAITER

          Gus looks at Hazel. She shrugs.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           The chef's choice sounds lovely.
           (the Waiter nods)
           And can we get more of this?

<b>                          WAITER
</b>           We have bottled all the stars for
           you this evening, my young friends.
          The Waiter leaves. Hazel and Gus look at each other.

<b>                          GUS

</b>           Thank you for wearing that dress
           which is like whoa.
          Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to.
          The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate:

<b>                          WAITER
</b>           Belgian white asparagus with a

          Gus takes a bite.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I mean...

<b>                          GUS
</b>           That is just...

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           There are no words.
          Meanwhile, down on the water a BOAT passes, filled with
          merry, drinking LOCALS. One of them raises a glass to them
          and says something in Dutch.

<b>                          GUS

           beautiful!"

          Hazel and Gus smile. This night could not be going any better
          so far. CUT TO:
          LATER. Hazel and Gus enjoying their second courses.

</b>           I want this dragon carrot risotto
           to become a person so I can take it
           to Vegas and marry it.
          Hazel leans back in her chair, in need of a breather.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I like your suit.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Thanks. First time wearing it.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           That isn't the suit you wear to
           funerals?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Oh no. That one's not nearly this
           nice.
           (off her look)
           When I first found out I was sick -
           I mean, they told me I had like an
           85% chance to be cancer-free. Great
           odds, sure. But that meant a year
           of torture, the loss of my leg, and
           still a 15% chance it might fail.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           So right before the surgery I asked
           my parents if I could buy a suit,
           like a really nice suit, just in
           case I didn't make it.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           It's your death suit.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           That's what it is.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I have one of those. Bought it for
           my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd
           wear it on a date, though.

<b>                          GUS

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Absolutely.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Really?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Oh for sure. I mean, not like a
           heaven where you ride unicorns,
           play harps, and live in a mansion
           made of clouds but, yeah, I believe
           in something.
          Hazel is surprised.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Something becomes of us. It has to.
           Otherwise what's the point?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Maybe there is no point.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I refuse to accept that.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           I won't accept it.
          Hazel thinks about it. She appreciates his conviction but is
          still not sure she agrees. The hand they've been dealt too
          unfair. Hazel looks out at the water as she says:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I hope you're right.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I'm in love with you.

<b>           68.
</b>
                         
          That gets her attention.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           You heard me.

<b>                          HAZEL

</b>           I'm in love with you. And I know
           that love is just a shout into the
           void, and that oblivion is
           inevitable, and that we're all
           doomed and that there will come a
           day when all our labor has been
           returned to dust, and I know the
           sun will swallow the only earth
           we'll ever have, and I am in love
           with you.
           (shrugs, matter-of-fact)
           Sorry.
          At which point, the Waiter reappears.

<b>                          WAITER
</b>           More stars?
          Hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on
          Gus. Eventually Gus answers for them.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Just the check, please.

<b>                          WAITER
</b>           No, sir.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Your meal has been paid for by Mr.
           Van Houten.
          Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel. This Van Houten guy is
          something else.

                         

<b>          EXT AMSTERDAM CANALS - LATER
</b>          Hazel and Gus on a park bench, his arm around her, looking
          out over the water. Seeds blow from the elm trees and the
          reflections of the city ripple in the water below them.
          Hazel leans into his body, just a little. They stay like
          that, savoring the best night of both of their lives. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          EXT AMSTERDAM - HOTEL - ESTABLISHING
</b>          A crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam. The buzz in the air
          outside is equalled by the buzz in:

<b>           69.
</b>
                         

<b>          INT HOTEL ROOM - SAME
</b>          Where Hazel excitedly paces through the room.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           I really don't get that shirt.
          Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte's "Ceci N'est
          Pas Une Pipe." (A painting of a pipe with words below that
          mean "This is not a pipe.")

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Van Houten will get it. Trust me.
           There are like fifty Magritte
           references in "Imperial
           Affliction."

<b>                          FRANNIE

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Exactly.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           But it is a pipe.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           No it's not. It's a drawing of a
           pipe. See?

<b>                          (SHE DOESN'T)
</b>           All representations of a thing are
           inherently abstract. A drawing of a
           thing is not the thing itself. Nor
           is a t-shirt of a drawing of a
           thing the thing itself.
          Frannie is still at a loss but she's impressed.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           When did you get so grown up? I
           feel like it was yesterday I was
           telling 8-year old Hazel why the
           sky was blue. You thought I was a
           genius back then.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Why is the sky blue?

          A knock on the door. Gus pokes his head in.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Who's ready for some answers!

<b>           70.

<b>          EXT. VONDELSTRAAT ROW HOUSES - LATER
</b>
          Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm so excited I can barely
           breathe.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           As opposed to other days...?
          She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen
          tank, and up they go towards his front door.
          As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from
          inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud.
          Like, obnoxiously loud.
          Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's
          no response.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Maybe he can't hear over the music?
          Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He
          tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait.
          Still excited.
          A moment later the door swings open.
          It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning
          hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is:

<b>           MAN IN PAJAMAS
</b>           What?!
          Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Mr. Van Houten?
          At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces.
          Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed
          door, they hear this:

<b>           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
</b>
<b>                          (SHOUTING)
</b>
<b>           LEEE-DUH-VIGH!
</b>
<b>           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           Are they here, Peter?
          So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN. Gus and Hazel can't believe it.

<b>           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
</b>           There are two --

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Who the hell's "they?"

<b>           71.
</b>
                         

<b>           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           They are Augustus and Hazel, the
           young fans with whom you've been
           corresponding.
          Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names. Perhaps this will
          help things take a turn for the better.

<b>           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
</b>           The Americans?

<b>           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           You invited them, remember?

<b>           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
</b>           You know why I left America,
           Lidewij? To never have to encounter
           Americans. Get rid of them.
          Hazel and Gus can't believe it. This is terrible!

<b>           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           I will not do this Peter. Be nice.
          At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose
          voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant LIDEWIJ
          (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves
          Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.
          And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,
          two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally:

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Which of you is Augustus Waters?
          Gus raises his hand tentatively.
          Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and
          walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           Please. I am sorry. Come in.
          Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes
          a step. Hazel follows. They walk:

                         

<b>          INT VAN HOUTEN'S HOME - SAME
</b>          Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile
          it's creepy. The walls are empty and white, there's a single
          couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That's it.
          Van Houten sits in the chair.
          Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and
          twist-tied.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Trash?

<b>           72.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never
           opens it.
          Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his
          slippers. He motions for them to sit on the couch.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Yours are the first missives to
           which I've replied and look where
           that got me.
          Hazel and Gus take their seats.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Scotch?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Um, no thanks.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Augustus Waters?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It's 11am.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and
           soda.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           Perhaps some breakfast first Peter?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           She thinks I have a drinking
           problem.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           I also think the Earth is round.
          Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it
          to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           So you like my book.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made
           meeting you his Wish so that we
           could come here and talk to you.
          Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Did you dress like her on purpose?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           (looks at her shirt)
           Kinda.

<b>           73.
</b>
                         
          Van Houten says nothing to that.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           I do not have a drinking problem. I
           have a Churchillian relationship
           with alcohol: I can crack jokes and
           govern England and do anything I
           want to do. Except not drink.
          He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Incidentally, thank you for dinner
           last night.

</b>           We have some questions --

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Uh-huh...

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           About what happens, you know...
           after... the end of your book.
           Specifically to those who Anna
           leaves behind. Like her Mom, the
           Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>
<b>                          (INTERRUPTING)
</b>           How familiar are you with Swedish
           hip-hop?
          Hazel looks at Gus. Is he kidding?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I would say... limited?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           But presumably you know Afasi Och
           Filthy's seminal album "Flacken."

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Um...

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla'
           immediately.

<b>           74.
</b>
                         
          Lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. A few seconds
          later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers.
          Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           (yelling over the music)
           I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak
           Swedish.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>
<b>                          (YELLING)
</b>           Who the hell speaks Swedish? The
           important thing is not what
           nonsense the voices are saying, but
           what the voices are feeling.
          The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before
          Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Are you messing with us?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Pardon?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Is this some kind of performance?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Rudolf Otto said that if you had
           not encountered the numinous then
           his work was not for you. And I say
           to you, my friends, if you cannot
           hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic
           response to fearfulness, then my
           work is not for you.
          Hazel is really getting worried at this point. They came all
          this way for this?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           So anyway... when the book ends,
           Anna's mom --

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           (raising a hand to silence

<b>                          HER)
</b>           Let us imagine that you are racing
           a tortoise.
          Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly
          feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           The tortoise has a ten yard head
           start. In the time it takes you to
           run ten yards, the tortoise has
           moved maybe one yard. And so on,
           forever.

</b>
<b>           VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)
</b>           You are faster than the tortoise
           but you can never catch him, you
           see, you can only decrease his
           lead. Now certainly you can run
           past the tortoise as long as you
           don't contemplate the mechanics
           involved but the question of how
           turns out to be so complicated that
           no one really solved it until
           Cantor's proof that some infinities
           are bigger than other infinities.
          Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           I assume that answers your
           questions.

</b>
<b>                          (TO HAZEL)
</b>           I don't know what's going on.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           And yet you seemed so intelligent
           in print, Mr. Waters.

          Gus could throw a punch right now. Hazel tries to calm the
          situation.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Can we please, maybe, talk about
           Anna for a sec? I mean, I
           understand that the story ends mid-
           sentence because she dies or she
           becomes too sick to continue --

</b>           - but that doesn't mean her family
           and everyone she loves doesn't have
           a future, right?

<b>                          HAZEL (CONT'D)
</b>           Mr. Van Houten, you said you would
           tell us what happens and that's why
           we're here. We... I need you tell
           me. Surely you've thought about it.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Nothing happens to them! They're
           fictions. They cease to exist the
           moment the novel is over.
          This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear. She won't
          accept it.

<b>                          HAZEL

           (again, has to calm

<b>                          HERSELF)
</b>           I mean, I understand. In a literary
           sense. But it's impossible NOT to
           imagine some future --

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           I can't do this. Lidewij, get rid
           of them, please.
           (Lidewij doesn't move, he
           turns back to Hazel)
           I won't indulge your childish
           whims. I refuse to pity you in the
           manner in which you're accustomed.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I don't want your pity --

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Of course you do. Like all sick
           kids, your existence depends on it.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ

           You are fated to live out your days
           as the child you were when
           diagnosed, the child who believes
           there is life after a novel ends.
           And we, as adults, we pity this, so
           we pay for your treatments, for
           your oxygen machines. We give you

          She rises from the couch.

          After a beat:

</b>           Oh don't be ridiculous.
          No one moves. Van Houten realizes he's alone in this.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           I'd like you to leave now.

<b>                          HAZEL

<b>           78.

          Hazel is furious. Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is
          if to say "come on, enough of this guy." CUT TO:

                         

<b>          EXT VAN HOUTEN'S HOUSE - SAME
</b>          Gus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. As
          they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Have you ever stopped to ask why
           you care so much about your silly
           questions?
          A beat.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Go fuck yourself.
          Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the
          door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Hey. It's ok. It's ok...
           (beat, an idea)
           I'll write you a sequel.
           (she cries harder)
           I will. Better than any shit that
           drunk could write. With blood and
           guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.
          Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus
          gives her a hug. Afterwards:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I spent your Wish on that asshole.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           You did not spend it on him. You
           spent it on us.
          They embrace once more.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I wanted...

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I know... I know. Apparently the
           world is not a wish-granting
           factory.
          This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes
          outside. Clearly she's been crying too.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made
           him cruel. I thought meeting you
           would help him, if he would see
           that his work has shaped real
           lives, but... I'm very sorry.

<b>           79.

          Hazel says nothing. Gus holds her in a very protective way.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           Perhaps we can do some sightseeing.

<b>          EXT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - LATER
</b>          Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           I'm afraid there's no elevator.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oh, um, that's alright.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           No, there are many stairs. Steep
           stairs.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I can do it.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I can do it!
          Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments
          today. They are going inside. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
</b>          A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of
          Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of
          BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of
          them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           Shall we?
          Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So
          far so good. They find themselves in an office space.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           This is the bookcase that hid the
           Frank family and four others.
          The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set
          of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.

<b>           80.
</b>
                         
          Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks
          at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the
          climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen
          tank.
          Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored
          breathing the entire time.
          ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.
          Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.
          Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's
          definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall
          to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           You're a champion.
          Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the
          next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more
          narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this
          he looks at Hazel:

<b>                          GUS
</b>           That's enough --

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>
<b>                          (RESOLUTE)
</b>           I'm ok.
          Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her
          every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult.
          Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull
          herself through.
          Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the
          wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           We're at the top. That's it.
          Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.
          She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.
          And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.
          This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding
          for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing
          their story.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           The only member of the whole family

          Gus takes Hazel's hand.

<b>                          LIDEWIJ
</b>           I don't know how you go on, without
           your family.

          Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads
          Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO
          details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear
          a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary.
          The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the
          same. The room is dark.

<b>           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           "At such moment's, I don't think
           about the misery..."
          Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the
          cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.

<b>           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           "...but about the beauty that still
           remains."
          Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she
          watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.
          Their eyes meet. The emotions build...

<b>           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           "Try to recapture the happiness
           within yourself. Think of all the
           beauty in everything around you...
           and be happy."
          And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-
          against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've
          experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a
          small eternity.
          Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly
          notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,
          they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...
          When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the
          whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts "bravo!" Hazel blushes,
          Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT GUS'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER
</b>          They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the
          moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It's above my knee.
          She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It tapers a little and then it's
           just skin --

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           What?

<b>           82.
</b>
                         
          Hazel pulls away from him.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           My leg.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           Just so you're prepared --

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oh get over yourself.
          Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off
          but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure
          it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They
          shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical
          Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I love you, Augustus Waters.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I love you too, Hazel Grace.
          They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:

                         

<b>          INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
</b>          Gus wakes up in the bed. He looks around for Hazel but she
          isn't there. On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.
          It reads: "Dearest Augustus..."
          Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled "Virgins." And in that
          circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled "17 year old dudes
          with one leg." We'll notice part of that circle is now
          outside the bigger circle. Gus flashes that signature smile.

                         

<b>          EXT CAFE - DAY
</b>          Hazel and Gus sit with Frannie drinking coffee in the sun at
          an outdoor cafe. They're re-enacting yesterday's events.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           "Get up you fat bastard."

<b>                          GUS

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I said "get up."

<b>                          GUS
</b>           "Standing is for fools!"

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           God, what an asshole.
          They both giggle at the whole thing.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           It was awful, Mom. You can't
           imagine.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           And then what happened?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Then we went to the Anne Frank
           museum.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           And after that?
          A quick glance between Hazel and Gus.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           We just... walked around.
          Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it
          in check in front of her Mother.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Sounds lovely.
          A few beats later.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Listen... I'm gonna stretch my legs
           a little. Give the two of you some
           time to talk.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>
<b>                          (THAT'S WEIRD)
</b>           Um... ok...
          As she stands up to leave, Hazel thinks she catches Gus and
          Frannie making eye contact for a brief second. Once Frannie
          has left them:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           That was weird.
          Gus doesn't respond except to say:

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Shall we?

                         

<b>          EXT AMSTERDAM STREET - LATER
</b>          They start to walk. Gus takes a cigarette out of his pack,
          sticks it between his lips. Hazel notices he's struggling
          with something.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Augustus?

<b>           84.

</b>           There's something I have to tell
           you...
          They walk in silence a few beats.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Just before you went into the
           hospital... There was this... I
           felt this... ache in my hip.
          Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oh no...
          Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth
          tightly, trying not to cry.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I had a PET scan.
          Gus sits down on a BENCH. Looks up at her. Tries to smile.
          Before he even says it, she knows.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It lit up like a Christmas tree,
           Hazel...

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oh god.

<b>                          GUS

           everywhere.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Oh my god no!
          Hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging
          him for dear life, her head in his lap.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so so

<b>                          SORRY --

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           It's so fucking unfair!
          A beat. Gus still trying not to cry.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Apparently the world is... not a
           wish-granting factory.
          And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be
          sad and feel awful.
          But just for a second. Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's
          face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Don't you worry about me, Hazel
           Grace. I'll find a way to hang
           around and annoy you for a long
           time.
          She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Does it hurt?

<b>                          GUS
</b>           It's ok.

</b>           Ok.
          But of course it's not ok. Not by a mile.
          Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           What?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm just... I'm very fond of you.
          He grabs her hand and holds it.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I don't suppose you can forget
           about it, treat me like I'm not
           dying.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I don't think you're dying,
           Augustus. You've just got a touch
           of cancer.
          Gus nods. Squeezes her hand.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Would it be absolutely ludicrous to
           make out right now?

<b>           86.
</b>
                         
          Hazel doesn't answer. She just kisses him, hard. And on the

<b>          INT INDIANAPOLIS AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY

          instead of someone's last name - "My Beautiful Family (and
          Gus)."
          Upon seeing them, he immediately starts to cry of course. He
          kisses his wife, gives Hazel a big hug. Gus goes to shake his

          Hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands Gus an egg. Gus puts
          it in Isaac's hands. Positions Isaac - who, of course, can't
          see a thing - towards the Firebird.
          Isaac winds up and tosses the EGG.
          It misses the car by a mile. After a beat:

          Gus hands him a SECOND EGG. Isaac winds up and hurls it -
          missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE.

          Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He's a
          throwing machine. Most of them miss but at least he's
          enjoying himself. Finally there's a DIRECT HIT on the car
          door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses.

          Monica's Mom is very confused. A beat. Without another word,
          she turns and goes back inside. The three of them celebrate.
          As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus
          on the cheek. And over we hear:

          Mrs. Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy

          and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and

          a book. Gus just sits there. His eyes staring off into
          nothing. Hazel waves to him. Gus looks over, as if waking
          from a dream. She manages a smile. He manages one back.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           ... when it seems like the
           inexorable decline has suddenly
           plateaued, when the pain is for a
           minute bearable.

                         

<b>          INT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
</b>          Hazel sits at dinner with her parents. She is barely touching
          her food.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           The problem, of course, is that
           there's no way of knowing that your
           last good day is your "Last Good
           Day." At the time, it's just
           another decent day.
          The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Hi, Augustus.

<b>           GUS (O.S.)
</b>           Good evening, Hazel Grace.
          His voice is strong today, and Hazel is happy to hear it.

<b>           GUS (O.S.)
</b>           Quick question for you. Did you
           ever write that eulogy I asked you
           to prepare?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I may have...

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Excellent. Do you think you could
           find yourself at the Literal Heart
           of Jesus in 20 minutes.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Um... sure. Is everything --

<b>           GUS (O.S.)
</b>           I love you Hazel.
          The call ends. Hazel, confused, stands to go.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I gotta go.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           Hazel, listen to your mother.
          Hazel tries to push past her but Frannie grabs her shoulders.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           You have to eat, Hazel. You're not
           gonna starve yourself to death just
           because Gus is sick. You have to
           stay healthy --

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I can't! I can't stay healthy
           because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am
           dying. I am going to die and leave
           you here alone and you won't have
           me to hover around and you won't be
           a mother anymore, and I'm sorry,
           but I can't do anything about it,
           ok?! Just leave me alone!
          Upon seeing her mother's face change, Hazel immediately
          regrets this.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           You heard me?
          Frannie has tears in her eyes. Hazel looks away, feeling
          terrible.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           You heard me say that to your
           father?
          Frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter.

<b>           99.
</b>
                         

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Oh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was
           wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not
           something I believe.
          Michael sits across from them.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           As long as either of us is alive, I
           will be your mother. Even if you
           die, I --

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           When.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Even when you die, I will still be
           your mother. I will always be your
           Mother.
          By now Michael is crying too. They all are.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I worry that you won't have a life.
           That you'll sit around all day with
           no me to look after and stare at
           the walls and be miserable or off
           yourselves or something.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           We're not gonna off ourselves. It's
           gonna hurt like hell to lose you

           possible to live with pain.
          She takes that in. It rings true to her. Hazel nods.

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           I don't just sit around, you know.
          Hazel is confused. Frannie looks at Michael like, "should I
          say something?" She goes for it.

<b>                          FRANNIE

</b>           You are?
          Hazel is stunned.

<b>                          HAZEL

</b>
<b>                          HAZEL

          Frannie and Michael don't quite know what to say.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           We didn't want you to feel

<b>                          ABANDONED --

           awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my
           god!
          Hazel grabs her Mom for a hug.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'm so excited! You're gonna be so
           great, Mom!

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           Thank you. That means everything to
           me.
          Mom and Daughter hug. And when it's over:

<b>                          FRANNIE
</b>           I'd still really like you to eat.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I know Mom. And I will. I promise.
           But right now... I really gotta go.

                         

<b>          INT CHURCH - LATER
</b>          Hazel enters the Literal Heart of Jesus room which is now
          empty except for Isaac, up on a dais, and Gus, in his
          wheelchair. Gus is thinner than we've ever seen him, thinner
          than any young man should be. But for now, he's happy.

<b>                          GUS

          Gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           I wanted to attend my funeral. By

          Hazel looks at him like "of course, silly" and then kisses
          him on the mouth.

<b>                          GUS
</b>           Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to
           attend as a ghost, but just to make
           sure, I thought I'd - well, not to

           I'd arrange a pre-funeral.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Why now?

<b>                          GUS

<b>                          GUS
</b>           As well you shouldn't.
          He smiles and for a brief moment it's old Gus. Hazel laughs.
          Isaac clears his throat.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           "Augustus Waters was a self-
           aggrandizing bastard. But we
           forgive him. We forgive him... not
           because he had a heart as
           figuratively good as his actual one
           sucked, or because he got 18 years
           when he should have gotten more."

          Hazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais. Takes
          a beat to ready herself.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           "Augustus Waters was the great star-

           "I can't talk about our love story
           so instead I will talk about math.
           I am not a mathematician, but I
           know this: there are infinite
           numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1
           And .12 And .112 And an infinite
           collection of others. Of course,
           there is a bigger infinite set of
           numbers between 0 and 2, or between
           0 and a million. Some infinities
           are bigger than other infinities. A
           writer we used to like taught us
           that. I want more numbers than I'm
           likely to get, and God, I want more
           numbers for Augustus Waters than he
           got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot
           tell you how thankful I am for our
           little infinity. You gave me a
           forever within the numbered days,

          music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the
          horrors of the world. Over which we hear this:

</b>           One of the first things they ask
           you in the ER is to rate your pain

           asked this question hundreds of
           times and I remember once, early
           on, when I couldn't catch my breath
           and it felt like my chest was on
           fire, and the nurse asked me to
           rate the pain and though I couldn't
           speak, I held up 9 fingers.
          The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped.
          She falls apart nonetheless.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           Later on, when I'd been feeling
           better, the nurse came in and she
           called me a fighter. "You know how
           I know," she said. "Because you
           called a ten a nine."

                         

<b>          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER MORNING
</b>          Hazel puts on her funeral dress. She looks in the mirror.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           But that wasn't the truth. The
           reason I called it a nine was... I
           was saving my ten.

<b>          INT CHURCH - DAY
</b>          The place is filled today with mourners for Augustus Waters.
          Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back,
          watching people she's never seen before approach the Waters
          family and extend their deepest condolences.

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           And this was it. The great and
           terrible ten.
          When Mr. and Mrs. Waters see Hazel, they open their arms.

<b>           MRS. WATERS
</b>           He loved you so much.
          Hazel nods. Hugs them back.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           He loved you so much too.
          More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in
          the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's
          not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep
          breath, wills herself to walk towards it.
          Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee.
          Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches
          herself.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           It's ok, you hear me? It's ok.
          She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around.
          Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights
          and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of
          the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.

<b>                          MINISTER
</b>           I think we're ready to begin.
          Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in
          the middle of the room.

<b>                          MINISTER
</b>           Augustus Waters fought hard for
           many years. His battle was a
           courageous one and his strength was
           a source of inspiration for each
           and every one of us...
          Hazel frowns. This is all such bullshit. And she hears:

<b>                          MALE VOICE
</b>           What a load of shit, eh kid?
          Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn't make sense. She
          turns around and, sure enough, it's Peter Van Houten.

<b>           106.
</b>
                         

<b>                          MINISTER
</b>           Let us pray.
          Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps
          staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           We need to fake pray now.
          Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns
          back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected
          appearance.

<b>                          MINISTER
</b>           Now I call on Augustus's close
           friend Isaac to say a few words.
          Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help.
          Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten. Yup, it's really
          him. That makes no sense to her. Isaac starts to speak.

<b>                          ISAAC
</b>           Of all the things I've lost in my
           life, this hurts the most.
          And Isaac stops talking. It's unclear if that was the end or
          if he just can't go on. He returns to his seat. The Minister
          walks back up.

<b>                          MINISTER
</b>           And now we'll hear from Gus's...
           special friend Hazel Lancaster.
          Hazel stands, walks up to the podium. A few titters in the
          room at the words "special friend."

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I was his girlfriend.
          Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           There's a beautiful quote in Gus's
           home that reads "if you want the
           rainbow, you gotta deal with the
           rain."
          Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:

<b>           HAZEL (V.O.)
</b>           I didn't believe a word, of course.
           But that was ok. Funerals, I'd
           decided, aren't for the dead.
           They're for the living.
          Gus's Parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word. CUT TO:

<b>          EXT CEMETARY - DAY
</b>          Everyone is watching Gus's body be lowered into the ground.
          Everyone but Hazel. She looks off into the distance.
          Off to the side, we see Van Houten, also not watching the
          burial. He's watching Hazel. CUT TO:
          LATER. Ceremony over, we see Hazel with her parents.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           I'll be fine.

<b>                          FRANNIE

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for
           a while.
          Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot.
          As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Could I hitch a ride?
          Hazel doesn't want to help this man.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Just to the bottom of the hill.
          Hazel exhales. Fine. Once they're both in the car:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           How did you even --

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           The internet.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           And you just... bought a ticket?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           The drinks are free drinks in First
           Class.
          Van Houten removes a FLASK from his coat pocket. Takes a
          swig. Hazel shakes her head in disgust. Starts driving.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Omnis Cellula e cellula.
          Hazel ignores him.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Your boy Waters and I corresponded
           quite a bit in his last --

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           I would hardly call him a fan. He
           despised me. But he was quite
           insistent I attend his funeral and
           tell you what became of Anna and
           her mother. So here I am and that's
           your answer: omnis cellula e

<b>                          HAZEL

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           "Life comes from life."

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Goodbye Mr. Van Houten.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           You don't want an explanation?

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Nope. Thanks though. Have a great
           life.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           You remind me of her.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>
<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           I remind a lot of people of a lot
           of people.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           She was eight, my daughter. She
           suffered... beautifully. For so
           long.
          Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           She had leukemia? Like Anna?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Just like her, yes.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Were you married then?

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Not when she died, no. I was
           insufferable long before Anna, my
           dear. Grief doesn't change you,
           Hazel, it reveals you.
          Hazel takes that in.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Well I'm sorry for your loss.

<b>           109.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           And I'm sorry for yours. I'm sorry
           for everything, for being so rude
           to you two, for ruining your trip --

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           You didn't ruin our trip, you
           asshole. We had an awesome trip.

<b>                          VAN HOUTEN
</b>           Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You
           asked me to tell you what happens
           and I wish I could do that. I wish
           that I could. But I can't. No one
           can. No one knows, Hazel. They
           don't talk to us. Unless...
          Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to
          Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           You think I care about that? I
           don't give a shit, Van Houten.
          Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten.

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           You're a drunk and a jerk and a
           failure. And I'd like you to get
           out of my car right now so I can go
           home and grieve.

          Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told,
          stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands
          there as Hazel peels out.
          In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if
          toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO:

          she's lost in her own world. Tears fall from her eyes and she
          can't do anything to stop it. Hazel gets up.

</b>           Can I come in?
          Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down
          next to her, putting her head on his shoulder.
          Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more.
          Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn't cry.

<b>                          MICHAEL
</b>           I'm so so sorry.

</b>           It was a privilege to love him,
           though, wasn't it?
          Hazel nods into his shirt. Then looks up at her Dad.

<b>                          MICHAEL

          give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath
          the passenger's seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and

           little flair. See the thing is...
           we all want to be remembered.
          She smiles to herself, remembering:
          - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other.
          - The staring contest in Support Group.

<b>                          GUS'S VOICE
</b>           We all want to leave a mark.
          - Driving (badly) in Gus's car.
          - Their first kiss at the picnic by "Funky Bones."

<b>                          GUS'S VOICE
</b>           But not Hazel. Hazel is different.
           Hazel knows the truth. She didn't
           want a million admirers, she just
           wanted one. And she got it. Maybe
           she wasn't loved widely but she was
           loved deeply. And isn't that more
           than most of us get?
          - And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter, tears in her eyes.

<b>                          GUS'S VOICE
</b>           When Hazel was sick, I knew I was
           dying. But I didn't want to say so.

<b>           113.
</b>
                         

<b>          INT ICU - FLASHBACK
</b>          Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazel's single room in the ICU.
          She sleeps. He kneels by her side.

<b>                          GUS'S VOICE
</b>           She was in ICU and I snuck in for
           ten minutes and sat with her before
           I got caught. Her eyes were closed,
           her lungs were intubated...

          Gus takes her hand and holds it.

<b>                          GUS'S VOICE
</b>           ... but her hands were still her
           hands, still warm, and the nails
           painted this dark blue back color
           and I just held her hands and I
           willed myself to imagine a world
           without us and what a worthless
           world that would be.
          - AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter. She never knew that
          story, never knew he was there. CUT TO:

                         

<b>          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER
</b>          Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen
          tank dragging behind her. She lays down on the grass and
          looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.

<b>                          GUS'S VOICE
</b>           She's so beautiful. You don't get
           tired of looking at her. You never
           worry if she's smarter than you
           cause you know she is. She's funny
           without ever being mean.

<b>                         SHE REMEMBERS:
</b>          - The magical dinner at Oranjee.
          - The bench in which they sat overlooking the water.
          - The passionate kiss in Anne Frank's house.
          - Falling onto the bed together.

          [All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the
          movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus's leg, we
          SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don't make
          these images less beautiful. They make them twice as
          beautiful - because they're real.]

<b>                          GUS'S VOICE
</b>           I love her, god I love her. I'm so
           lucky to love her, Van Houten.

<b>                          (MORE)
</b>
<b>           114.
</b>
<b>           GUS'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>           You don't get to choose if you get
           hurt in this world but you do have
           a say in who hurts you.

          - AND BACK ON Hazel in the grass. She holds the letter to her
          chest. A single tear falls onto her cheeks.

<b>                          GUS'S VOICE
</b>           I like my choices. I hope she likes
           hers.

          Hazel CLOSES HER EYES.

<b>                          GUS'S VOICE
</b>           Ok, Hazel Grace?

          A beat. Another.
          Hazel OPENS HER EYES. And she says to the universe:

<b>                          HAZEL
</b>           Ok.

<b>           BLACK.
