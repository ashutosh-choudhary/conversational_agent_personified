<b>          INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - VERY EARLY MORNING
</b>                         
          MARK SCHULTZ (27, 180 lbs., cauliflower ears) lifts a human-
          sized, leather WRESTLING DUMMY from the mat to stand in front
          of him. He performs a series of repetitive moves - hooking
          one arm under the dummy's arm, then the other; one side, then
          other. Again and again. It looks almost as if he's dancing
          gently with it.
                         
          Then, very fast, Mark spins quickly around behind the dummy,
          grabs it in a bear hug, arches his back, lifts and SLAMS it
          to the mat, landing on top.
                         
          QUICK CUTS: Mark spinning, lifting and slamming the dummy -
          first one way, then the other - first one hold, then another -
          SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM - over and over and over again.

          Mark pulls his beat-up car into a space in the parking lot of
          this nondescript, 1960s-era suburban brick-facade school.
          He's freshly showered, wears a short-sleeve dress shirt, clip-
          on tie, slacks. He reaches behind the front seat and pulls
          out a battered BROWN VINYL BRIEFCASE.

          hangs on the painted cinder block wall. A clock ticks.

          The students are open-mouthed - they have no idea what to
          make of him. Mark's not being willfully over-the-top with
          these kids. This is just what's on his mind. All the time.

           Because that's where the Olympic
           games are.
                         
          Mark reaches into the briefcase at his feet and pulls out a

           my best friend - won one too, just
           23 hours and 16 minutes before I
           did. That's unprecedented - two

          Dave looks at the BACK OF HIS HAND, where he's written down a

          Seven HIGH SCHOOL BOYS plus a couple of PRE-TEENS, all in

          Dave and the two men see Mark, WAVE to him - but Mark
          pretends not to notice, busies himself loosening his wrists,
          hands, neck. Dave walks over to him.

          who slams Mark to the mat - dripping blood onto him.
                         
          VARIOUS SHOTS of the increasingly brutal match, ending with:

          grappling for a hold. Mark glances up to SEE:

          woods behind Mark, running. Dan Bane leaves the other two.

          Zerega and Popper jog off. Dan comes to stand next to Mark,
          who has taken his little pair of BINOCULARS from the pocket
          of his sweats and is looking through them. After a moment, he
          hands Dan the binoculars. Dan looks through them.

          BINOCULARS POV: A VERY OLD WOMAN stands in front of her
          wheelchair, with the help of an attendant. When the horses
          reach her, she TOUCHES THEM LOVINGLY, tenderly stroking their
          faces, feeding them treats from her hands. She's completely
          at home with these animals, as they are with her.

          directly onto the mat, straight to the center, faces off with

          Mark and Nanev wrestle the final seconds - Mark ahead by a
          point. Nanev tries desperately to turn Mark, to gain any
          advantage. The whistle blows.

          them around, raises Mark's hand again.
                         
          Mark does a BACK FLIP. He trots over to the opposing coach,
          shakes his hand. He trots to his corner where Dave - beaming,
          his arms open wide - embraces him. Mark hugs his brother
          quickly, then turns to LOOK OUT into the stands.
                         
          He SPOTS du Pont, who's coming down the steps toward the
          platform. Mark walks toward him. The enormity of what he's
          just accomplished STARTS TO HIT Mark. His face is red. He
          reaches du Pont, and from a step below him, THROWS HIS ARMS
          around him, clings to him. Mark starts to SOB.
                         
          Du Pont holds him as he looks out toward the wrestling mat,
          where Dave watches.

           (to them all)
           The gold medal Mark won in 1984 was

           Carter. Tarnished by the

           entire Eastern bloc to boycott our

           medal at the World Championships in

          Du Pont stands up. Expressionless, he disappears through the
          sliding glass doors into the house. Mark LOOKS OUT over the
          dark grounds of Foxcatcher. Quiet.
                         
          Then Mark jumps out of his skin as a MACHINE GUN FIRES
          several rounds behind him.

          When he turns around, there's du Pont, a determined look on
          his face, pointing a semi-automatic MACHINE GUN out into the
          rolling landscape.

          He FIRES again, a short burst of bullets into the dark. Du
          Pont fires again, a sustained volley into the dark...

          Du Pont ceases fire and looks out. He begins lowering the gun
          when it accidentally goes off, firing a few bullets into the
          wood deck - though he doesn't seem to notice.

          An exhausted du Pont, in his Foxcatcher singlet, is slumped
          in his chair, encouraging Mark to massage his shoulders. Mark

          of him. Mark watches.
                         
          The REF blows the end of match whistle. The wrestlers stand,
          du Pont struggling to his feet. The ref takes each of their

           with me to the Olympic Trials in
           Pensacola next week. From the

           competition. There's no lying in a
           fight. Who you think you are in the
           moments leading up to a fight, and
           who you are when the fight begins -
           the truth will become abundantly
           clear.

          The official looks at them, OPENS his log book. Dave helps
          Mark peel off his sweats. Soaked, they hit the floor with a

          He's 30 GRAMS OVERWEIGHT (5 ounces). He steps off, and Dave
          helps PEEL his singlet off. He gets back on the scale naked.

          stops close to Mark.
                         
          Mark looks to Dave to save him from this. Dave's clearly
          caught in the middle.
                         
          Mark looks down, closes his eyes as if in pain. Du Pont moves
          close to Dave, speaking to him so Mark can hear -

          door, working on the FUSE BOX under the steering column.
                         
          Dave rises out of the car to see who's pulled up.
                         
<b>                          DAVE
</b>           Hey, Coach.
                         
          Dave takes a step toward du Pont's car. Du Pont just looks at
          him through his open driver's window.
                         
<b>                          DAVE (CONT'D)
</b>           What's up, John?
                         
          Du Pont picks up his PISTOL from the seat.
                         
<b>           LARGE SECURITY GUARD
</b>           Oh. Hold on there -
                         
          Du Pont POINTS the pistol at Dave.
<b>           104.
</b>                         
                         
<b>                          DU PONT
</b>           You got a problem with me?
                         
<b>                          DAVE
</b><b>                          JOHN -
</b>                         
          Dave holds out his hand - on his palm is the word "KIDS" -
                         
          Du Pont SHOOTS Dave. The bullet goes through Dave's hand,
          smashing into his chest, throwing him to the ground.
                         
          The Security Guard scrambles out the car door and ducks
          behind the passenger side fender.
                         
          Dave tries to crawl away.
                         
<b>                          NANCY
</b>           Dave!.... David!...
                         
          Nancy runs onto the porch and is screaming for her husband.
                         
          Du Pont POINTS the pistol at her. She RUNS inside.
                         
          Du Pont SHOOTS Dave in the back. Then he SHOOTS him in the
          back of the head.
                         
          After a few moments, he drives away.
                         
          Nancy runs outside. She cradles her husband as he bleeds out
          in the snow.

<b>          INT. MAKESHIFT LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
</b>                         
          Mark, his HEAD SHAVED, sits in a chair too small for him.
          He's in front of a painted cinder block wall. He wears only
          shorts, no shirt. A CLOCK ticks on the wall behind him.
                         
          After several moments, we START TO HEAR crowd-pumping MUSIC
          in the background. LOUDER. LOUDER.

</b>                         
          Mark walks out of the tunnel into the ARENA. HUGE SOUND -
          loud, crowd-pumping music. Strobe lights. Mark's bare-
          chested, no shoes. He looks straight ahead as he walks.
          There's something missing behind his eyes.

</b>                         
          Mark fights a Japanese martial artist. Mark's destroying him
          in a brutal, uninhibited display of aggression. He's got his
          opponent on his back and he pounds his bloody face repeatedly.
                         
          The REF stops the fight. Mark stands.
                         
          He's completely still, except for his heavy breathing. The
          other man's blood is on him. The crowd is wild, CHANTING,
