</b>


<b>            INT. STARBUCKS - 7:30 A.M.
</b>
            We're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets,
            blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small
            containers.  With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up
            colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little
            color-coded rows.  Wait, this container has three Equals and
            four Sweet 'n' lows.  The hand quickly plucks the mutant
            Sweet 'n' Low.  There.  Symmetry.

            We move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his
            domain.  Something about him.  He's extremely compelling,
            uniquely handsome.  But it's more than that.  Those eyes,
            they sparkle with the wonder of a child.  Life's cynical edge
            has not etched it's path across this face.  They light on a
            COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars.

<b>                                SAM

            Sam moves along, commenting to CUSTOMERS as he places Sweet
            'n Lows on tables, the self-appointed host of Starbucks.

<b>                                SAM (CONT'D)

                      good choice.

            He stops in front of sale mugs and turns them so that the
            logos all face the same way.  His boss GEORGE approaches.

<b>                                GEORGE
</b>                      Sam, they called.  It's time for you to
                      go.

            Sam FREEZES, but doesn't turn around.

<b>                                GEORGE
</b>                      Good luck.

            Without another word, Sam walks straight out the door.

<b>            EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY
</b>
            Sam, still in his white apron, walks down the busy street. 
            He has a fast, loping gait that doesn't slow or hesitate for
            anyone. A COUPLE argue on the sidewalk.  Sam WALKS RIGHT

            Sam keeps moving, he crosses the street without stopping. 
            Traffic SCREECHES to a HALT!  Cars HONK, a taxi driver YELLS.

<b>            INT. HALLWAY - LATER

            Sam plows down the hall and comes to room 324.

<b>                                SAM
</b>                      Rebecca!

            Sam pushes the DOOR OPEN.  And we REALIZE we are entering: A
<b>            HOSPITAL LABOR DELIVERY ROOM AT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL.
</b>
            REBECCA is in the middle of a major contraction.  Her face is
            the opposite of Sam's.  Hardened.  She lets out a scream that
            stops Sam dead in his tracks.  GERTIE, a no-nonsense Black
            Nurse, looks up from the monitor.

<b>                                GERTIE
</b>                      You the one responsible for this?

            Sam nods, taking Gertie quite literally.

<b>                                SAM
</b>                      I'm sorry.

                      here and hold her hand.

            Sam reaches for Rebecca's hand.  She pulls it away.  ANOTHER
            CONTRACTION - Rebecca screams.  Sam SCREAMS.

<b>                                NURSE

</b>                      And it's a girl...

            The BABY lets out her first cry.  Sam watches, awestruck. 
            Gertie wraps the baby in a blanket and holds her out to
            Rebecca.  Rebecca shakes her head - NOT NOW.  Gertie walks
            over to Sam.

<b>                                GERTIE

                      awful long time to see you, Sam.

            She places the BABY into SAM'S ARMS.  Suddenly Sam's whole
            body RELAXES and becomes very still.  He looks to Rebecca,
            but she has turned away.  He meets Gertie's eyes.  Then in
            quiet amazement:

<b>                                SAM
</b>                      This is it.

            We hear LIKE A LULLABY, "Picture yourself on a boat in a
            river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies..."

<b>            EXT. HOSPITAL - NEXT MORNING
</b>
            Sam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out,
            walk down the steps of the hospital holding their
            complimentary plastic baby bag.  Sam is nervous haling the
            precious cargo and Becca is agitated.  They see the bus
            pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they
            can hurry and catch it.  As he approaches the bus, he looks
            to Becca by his side, but she is not there.  He looks around
            and no sign of her. 
            Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of
            her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street.  He
            screams.

<b>                                SAM

            The more he screams the faster she moves away.  Till there's
            no trace of her.  Sam stands in the middle of the busy block
            holding Lucy to his chest, devastated.

            We hear, "Look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but
            she's gone."

<b>                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

<b>            INT. BUS - NIGHT
</b>
            Sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest.  Next to him is
            the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two
            cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk.  Sam is
            surrounded by PASSENGERS, the eerie world of the underground
            at night.  Instinctively, Sam holds her even tighter, two
            against the world.

<b>            INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAWN
</b>
            A marvel of organization.  A closet reveals clothes on
            hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded
            T-shirts, underwear and socks organized by color.  A
            carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift
            bookshelves.

            Beatles posters from every era decorate the walls.  Becca's
            things sit in one corner.  An island of chaos in an "Hold
            Everything" showroom.  The kitchen counter has been
            transformed into a changing table.  Bottles and pacifiers
            lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers.  Underneath, a
            clothes line of baby clothes.

            The sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence.  The camera
            follows and finds the CRADLE: a DRAWER tucked snugly into a
            blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs.  An
            exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed, behind the hammock.  He
            swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back
            to sleep.

<b>                                SAM

                      girl?
                          (Lucy cries harder)
                      Okay, if you say it's time to get up,
                      then it's time to get up, time to get
                      up.
                          (Sam sniffs the air)
                      Oh my, oh my, oh my.  Quite a bit of
                      business.

            He rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the baby's
            pajamas, revealing a cloth diaper held together with
            promotional buttons: one says "Hertz, #1 for Car Rentals",
            the other a picture of Magic Johnson and reads "Go, Lakers,
            Go!"  Sam undoes it.

                      see let me see let me see.

            Sam attempts to clean and diaper her.  He finally manages to
            pin the buttons so that it at least stays on.

            He holds her up, and the diaper falls down around her ankles.

            Sam stares at the "Great Wall of Diapers", awed.  He reaches
            for the Pampers, balancing Lucy, then the Luvs, no, the
            Huggies.  Sam stops moving, Lucy starts CRYING, so he jogs in
            place.  Sam decides on one of each.  He heads to the FORMULA
            AISLE.  Gerber, Carnation, Carnation Iron Fortified.  He
            stops.  Lucy WAILS.  WE HEAR THE SONG "HELP, I NEED SOMEBODY"

            Sam paces, carrying Lucy who screams at the top of her lungs.

            Sam rocks the CRYING BABY in the hammock.  He's exhausted,

            her.

            Peace.  A punch-drunk Sam lays the sleeping baby into the
            cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate. 
            He tiptoes, his FIST raised victoriously - "YES!"  He doesn't
            get two steps before Lucy wakes screaming.  Defeated, he
            picks her up.  HELP.  The PHONE RINGS.  HE PRESSES speaker.

            He looks out his window and sees ANNIE CASSELL, his neighbor
            on the phone, watching him through her window.  She is a
            strange creature with very thick glasses.  We sense a
            uniquely profound intelligence behind all that armor.

            "Father Knows Best" on TV.  Lucy blissfully falls asleep in

            gentlemen with a gentle face and a wide smile, carrying a
            large stuffed giraffe with a bow on it.  BRAD, who sees
            himself as a real ladies man, in tight jeans and a Farrah
            Fawcett T-shirt; and ROBERT, highly paranoid, thinks the
            world's out to get him.  Lucy WAILS.  Sam RUNS to the CRIB.

                      Denny's and Friday night Karaoke.  And I

                      I can't discuss it.  And now this.

            Ifty makes ORIGAMI BIRDS out of newspapers.  Lucy's rapt.

                      "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" was a
                      wonderful movie I forgot to bring last

                      a date with a daydream to come here.

            There's a knock at the door.  Ifty goes to get it.  Brad
            moans when he sees his 65 YEAR OLD MOTHER, ESTELLE, standing
            in the doorway.

<b>                                BRAD

                      Sorry.  I'll wait in the lobby.

            She exits.  Lucy begins to CRY.  Brad takes her - like a hot
            potato, Robert takes her - now Ifty runs around in circles.

<b>                                IFTY
</b>                      She needs motion.  My father drove my

            The camera moves along and stops on the long seat at the
            back.  Sam lies with Lucy spooned into the crook of his arm,
            almost asleep.

<b>                                SAM

            We hear the song "Golden Slumbers".  In a SERIES OF
            DISSOLVES, we see Lucy and Sam in DIFFERENT SLEEPING
            POSITIONS on the bus seat.  Gradually, she GROWS in HIS

</b>
            ONE MONTH,  THEN TWO.  NOW FIVE.  She's BIG AND ROUND at SIX
            MONTHS.  And on and on into the night...

<b>            INT. WALMART'S PHOTO BOOTH - DAY
</b>
            We see Sam and Lucy CRAMMED into the booth, wearing birthday
            hats, taking HER FIRST BIRTHDAY picture.  We see the PHOTO
            STRIP as it comes out of the slot.  Sam's shoulder with
            Lucy's ear - Lucy's nose with Sam's elbow, their faces never
            made it into the picture.

<b>            INT. STARBUCKS - 8:30 A.M.
</b>
            The place is packed.  Sam moves from table to table,
            cleaning.

<b>                                SAM

                      Good choice, very good choice.

            Sam turns and WE SEE LUCY attached to him in a handmade
            snugly, crocheted by Annie.  She faces outward, all hands,
            all 16 MONTHS of her; too big for the snugly.  She grabs a
            croissant from a customer.  George looks confused.  Then
            makes a SWIPE for a customer's coffee, knocking it to the
            ground.  It SPLATTERS all over an anorexic, on-her-fourth
            double-latte WOMAN in a designer exercise outfit.  She begins
            shrieking.  George looks at Sam, this can't go on.

</b><b>            INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - MORNING

            Sam, Lucy by his side, has his foot in Annie's door.

</b>                      It was her first word.  Very first word.

            Annie opens the door, takes Lucy's hand, and pulls her in.

<b>                                ANNIE
</b>                      And people worry you're not smart.

<b>            INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT - ONE WEEK LATER
</b>
            The apartment looks like a fallout shelter.  The kitchen
            contains enough canned goods to last a year.  Brightly
            colored crocheted doilies - Annie's hobby - adorn every
            available surface.  The BRIGHTLY COLORED WEB of an
<b>            AGORAPHOBE.
</b>
            Lucy sits in Annie's lap, getting her first piano lesson.  WE
            SEE LUCY'S TINY FINGERS on the keys.  In a SERIES OF
            DISSOLVES, it is joined by Annie's hand tapping out one note,
            now two notes, and as the weeks pass, a chord.  Until finally
            the notes merge to become the most unlikely duet of "Twinkle,
            Twinkle, Little Star".

<b>                                ANNIE
</b>                      This is Mozart.  He did twenty-two
                      variations of "Twinkle Twinkle Little
                      Star".  You smell good.  You can tell a
                      lot about a person by their smell.  If
                      they've got too much perfume on they're
                      covering something up.  You gotta watch
                      someone who smells like soap.  Gotta
                      wonder what their priorities are. 
                      Nervous people.  People who try too
                      hard.  They smell like fish.  But you. 
                      You smell like milk.  Milk and hope.

            Lucy leaves the piano and toddles over to Annie's loom and
            plays with a ball yarn.

<b>                                VOICE (O.S.)

<b>                                ANNIE
</b>                      Thanks.

            Annie opens the door to pull in the groceries.  The ball of
            yarn ROLLS OUT the door and Lucy chases after it.  Annie,
            terrified, bellows:

<b>                                ANNIE (CONT'D)
</b>                      Lucy!  Come back here!  Come back!

            It becomes obvious Annie can't walk outside.  Trembling:

</b>                      "Lucy in the sky with diamonds..."

            Hearing the familiar tune, Lucy stops and toddles back. 
            Annie sweeps her up, relieved and we --

            continues as Lucy's THREE YEAR OLD laughing face SWINGS INTO
            FRAME on a swing then DISAPPEARS out THE OTHER END OF FRAME. 
            Now Lucy SWINGS BACK DOWN and out of the other end again...

            Sam's FACE, glowing with delight, APPEARS AGAINST THE SKY and
            then disappears.  Sam and Lucy are on swings surrounded by
            MOTHERS and KIDS at the park.

                      Paul McCartney lost his mother when he
                      was fourteen.  John lost his mother
                      twice.  First when Julie gave John to
                      her sister Mimi to raise.  And then
                      again when Julia was hit by a car.  They
                      say God picks certain people, special
                      people.  That's what they say.

            Lucy takes this in.  Sam begins to shift his tomatoes just

            Those same little shoes in the midst of a mass of black
            soccer cleats.  We move up and see Lucy in the middle of a
            fierce kids soccer game.

            Score's tied.  The ball comes to Lucy.  She kicks and misses. 
            From the sidelines we hear:

<b>                                SAM
</b>                      Beautiful kick!  Very close!

            Lucy looks up at her dad proudly.  The ball comes again. 
            Nobody could miss this one.  But Lucy does.

                      getting scared now!

            The game continues.  The GOALIE'S FATHER, DUNCAN RHODES,
            handsome, commanding and dressed in a suit, calls to his son:

            Conner tenses up, alert under the pressure.  Meanwhile, down
            at the other end, the ball heads toward Lucy.  She kicks it! 
            Hard.  Right into her team's own goal.  The crowd GROANS.

            Lucy's bursting with confidence, plows toward the ball and
            NAILS IT!  The ball goes flying.  The parents in the stand
            are completely baffled!  Sam is completely ecstatic!

            The ball heads into the goal, just passing the goalie,
            Conner.  Sam runs to embrace Lucy when he hears Duncan

            BIRD.  And behind her, marching more proudly than any child,
            is Sam, dressed as PAUL McCARTNEY, in the black suit era -
            with Beatle boots and guitar strapped to his chest.  Sam is
            the only adult participating in the parade.

            Music BLASTS over the loudspeaker.  Sam begins to dance with
            joyous abandon.  Lucy joins him.  They dance together
            happily.

            Suddenly Lucy becomes aware that her classmates are beginning
            to laugh.  She slows and watches through their eyes Sam pony
            around the room.  Conner pulls up his pants high on his waist
            and begins to imitate Sam.  Another kid joins him.

            "SURPRISE!"  But instead of Lucy, it's the Social Worker.

            Sam puts a hand over Conner's mouth; Conner struggles against

            Conner's father hurls Sam across the room - Sam gets tangled
            in the MOON BOUNCE!  To get attention, Conner bursts into
            tears.  We hear FOOTSTEPS outside the door - Brad hits the
            lights.  We hear a CRASH!  And in the light, the DOOR SHEDS
            as it opens, Lucy and Ifty see - that MOONBOUNCE, swaying. 
            Then from within the Moonbounce:

                      She says you're not her real father,
                      anyway.  She's adopted!

            Humiliated, Lucy RUNS AWAY!  The Social Worker watches,
            profoundly concerned, and reaches for her cellular phone.

<b>            EXT. WALMART - DAY

            A police car pulls into the parking lot.  Sam and Margaret in
            the back.  Sam and Margaret see Lucy's little feet dangling
            from beneath the curtain of the photo booth.

<b>                                SAM

                      I'm sorry to say this, Mr. Dawson, it's
                      clear how much you love your daughter,
                      but we're going to have to remove Lucy
                      from your home.

            Sam's baffled.  One cop places his hand on Sam's shoulder,
            restraining him.  The OTHER heads toward the photo booth.

<b>                                SAM

                      to your apartment at four.  No, not five
                      every two hours.  It's two every five
                      hours.  She only weighs thirty pounds
                      for chrissakes...
                          (back to Sam)
                      The city has given me the difficult task
                      of deciding when to intervene on behalf
                      of the child.  Unfortunately, I've
                      learned the hard way that it's better
                      too soon than too late.  For now the
                      court will decide what's in Lucy's best
                      interest.

            Sam watches the cop's legs meet Lucy's under the curtain. 
            Suddenly, Sam screams from the deepest core of his being.

<b>                                SAM

            We see LUCY'S FEET KICK the COP'S LEGS and wrestle out of his
            grasp.  She flies out the booth, holding that balloon.  She
            runs down the street, the balloon soaring into the sky - a
            cop follows.  Sam struggles.

            RITA HARRISON and her assistant burst in.  Rita moves in
            opposite circles around the room.  Looking for something.  In

            moving.  Period.  Ten steps ahead of anyone, too much energy,
            too much caffeine, not enough food.  If she slowed down a

            Rita runs to the open elevator and comes face to face with
            Sam who's been holding the door open for her.

            The door closes.  Rita is trapped with Sam.  She stares
            forward trying to will him not there.  Rita gulps her
            champagne.

            And on and on and on.  Rita is about to spontaneously
            combust.  Finally, "G" - Rita bolts out the elevator doors,
            then just as suddenly turns around.

            Sam stares out the window at an unfamiliar neighborhood.  On
            his lap, the pink box, now ripped, allowing us to see Lucy's
            birthday cake.  It's lopsided from having been thawed and
            refrozen.

            Sam waits for his transfer.  He sets the cake down on the
            bench and takes out a piece of paper with directions written
            on it.  The number 43 bus pull sup and Sam consults his paper
            once more before jumping on, forgetting the cake.

            The bus goes half a block before it SCREECHES to a halt.  Sam
            jumps off and runs back for the cake, but the bus continues
            on its way.  Moments later, the NUMBER 34 bus pulls up. 
            Flustered and worried about being late, Sam jumps on.  He
            feels something cold on his hand, looks down, the box is
            starting to leak ice cream.

            The woman is distracted by a loud thumping on Rita's glass
            wall - it's SAM.  Holding an envelope.  Very distressed, as
            the Secretary attempts to corral him back into the lobby.

                      syllable words urgent open at once.

            He hands the letter to Rita.  Rita looks through the glass
            wall at her clients who are getting impatient.

            Sam notices that the woman in Rita's office is crying.  He
            walks in and hands her a handkerchief from his pocket.

            She looks at him as if he's from Mars.  Rita, now outside her
            office, watches Sam now inside the office.

            She quickly gets up but Rita's too impatient and pushes past
            her into the office.

            the sound of Rita arguing with her husband drifts into the
            room.  Sam looks sideways at Danny who remains stonefaced.

            Rita stands in the doorway watching Sam have a longer
            conversation with her son than she's had in months.  She
            retreats.

            George leads him behind the counter.  THE STAFF BEAMS. 
            Euphorically, Sam approaches the huge espresso machines.

<b>            INT. STARBUCKS - 11:00 A.M.

            Sam is doing great.  He's humming as he prepares a triple
            latte with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker.

<b>            INT. STARBUCKS - 12:00 P.M.
</b>
            The place is packed, including a GROUP OF JAPANESE TOURISTS. 
            Sam zips around, trying to juggle between the blender, the
            espresso machine, steamed milk, icemaker, all the while
            glancing up at the clock.  Sam hands three cups to customers,
            the foam overflowing, coffee spilling out.

            A CUSTOMER takes a sip and SPITS IT OUT.

            Working as fast as he can but still NOT FAST ENOUGH, Sam
            unconsciously drinks the latte.

<b>            INT. STARBUCKS - 12:45 P.M.

            Hyped on coffee, Sam is zooming around and he's a mess. 
            Shirt hangs out, coffee stains on it, his hair wild. 
            Frazzled, he forgets to put the lid on the blender and turns
            it ON.  A mint mocha frappuccino SPLATTERS HIM in the face. 
            At that moment, George comes out of his office.

            Walking a hundred miles an hour, Sam barrels down the street
            out of his mind.  Cars are jammed up.  He walks over them, a
            man possessed.

<b>            INT. COURTROOM - DAY

            starts talking very fast from the coffee.  The STENOGRAPHER

                      They put that into the song.  It
                      wouldn't be the same song without that. 
                      It made the song complete.  That's why

</b>                      Excuse me, Mr. Dawson, your lawyer just
                      objected; that means you didn't have to

                      follow the simple rules you've watched
                      here day after day.  You really think

            Sweat pours down Sam's coffee stained collar.  He searches
            for words.  Then from the clearest place inside himself:

                      whatever it is that makes somebody a
                      good parent.  It has to do with
                      constancy.  It has to do with patience. 
                      It has to do with listening.  To
                      pretending to listen when you can't even
                      listen anymore.

            The court is riveted by Sam's eloquence.  Rita's amazed.

            Rita's antenna goes up: who's "she?"

                      that a man has any less of those
                      emotions than a woman.  Billy has a home
                      with me!  It's not perfect!  I'm not a

            Mortified, so uncomfortable in this strange world, so at a
            loss how to swim through it, beginning to believe everything
            Turner's saying, Sam looks out at the faces in the courtroom. 
            Rita, stunned and incredulous; Turner and his associate
            smirking at him; Ifty, shaking his head; Robert, his face in

            The Judge watches Sam, sad and stunned.  The verdict is
            obvious.  Sam has passed judgement on himself.

<b>            EXT. CHILD AND FAMILY PROTECTIVE SERVICES - HALLWAY
</b>
            Sam, broken, walks down the long hallway with Rita toward
            Margaret Brown's office.  Suddenly, Rita stops as she and Sam
            both see -

<b>            LUCY
</b>
            Sitting, hopeful on the bench.  She searches Sam's face for
            the verdict.  The minute she sees sorrow in his eyes, she
            knows.  She runs to him, gluing herself to his chest.

<b>                                LUCY

            In a SERIES OF WORDLESS DISSOLVES, they hold each other in
            the hallway through the entire forty five minute visit.  The
            only thing moving is the hands of a large wall clock in the
            background.  Pained, Margaret reaches for Lucy.

<b>                                MARGARET BROWN

                      let go -

            Sam's tears mix with Lucy's as they sob, clinging to each
            other.  With such fierce love; a parent and a child.

<b>                                LUCY (CONT'D)

            He can't let her go.  That he can't do.  Margaret, steel
            herself, turns to Rita, no matter how many times she's done
            this.

<b>                                MARGARET BROWN
</b>                      Please help me.

            Rita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago,
            shakes her head, NO.  Now, Margaret literally has to wrench
            Lucy away from her father's arms.  Lucy bellowing as she
            pulls her down the hallway.  Sam is frozen in incalculable
            pain.

<b>            EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

            We hear "Fool on the Hill".  We follow a trail of PINK LIQUID
            melting down the hall and come to Annie's door where a pile
            of grocery bags and newspapers sit in a PUDDLE OF STRAWBERRY
            ICE CREAM.  Suddenly, the needle SCRAPES LOUDLY across the
            record, followed by a mysterious POUNDING against the wall.

<b>            INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

            The CAMERA MOVES to the WINDOW.  Inside, the lights are dim. 
            Lucy's HAMMOCK SWINGS EMPTY, ghostlike.  Sam, curled into a
            ball in Lucy's bare corner, bangs his head over and over
            again against the wall, overcome with grief.

<b>            INT. DANNY'S ROOM - RITA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

            The POUNDING CONTINUES as we see Rita standing in the
            doorway, watching her sleeping child.  This stranger that
            she's raised.  She moves to cover him, this tough little boy,
            when she sees POOH BEAR tucked under his arm.  She tucks them
            both in, tenderly.

<b>            EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY

            Saturday in idyllic suburbia.  Sam, directions and a map in
            his hands, tentatively rounds the corner.  A small bouquet of
            flowers in his hands when he stops - STARING AHEAD AT --

            Lucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress.  She
            stands on the front porch with RANDY, who wears a red smock
            and is setting up TWO EASELS AND PAINTS.  There's a tiny
            chair for Lucy and a tiny chair for her.

<b>            CLOSE ON LUCY AND RANDY

            The tension in Lucy's face, Randy straining to connect with

<b>            BACK TO SAM
</b>
            From where he stands, all he sees is Lucy getting everything
            she deserves.  He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand -
            feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers
            from a garden he's passing.  Puts them in his bouquet.  Then
            stops.  Feels guilty.  Tries to put the flowers BACK.  He
            stares up at Lucy on the porch a few houses away.

            Lucy sits on the steps.  Randy sits right next to her.

<b>            BACK ON SAM

            Where he WAS standing, but is now GONE.  The flowers lay in
            the dirt.  From the porch, Lucy looks out and waits.  And
            waits.  And waits.

            It's Saturday.  The place is buzzing.  Sam listlessly cleans
            the tables, without the usual energy and verve.  A TODDLER
            marches around a table, playing under the adoring gaze of his
            parents.

            Sam's out of control, the whole shop stares at him as he
            backs into a shelf of MUGS he so carefully arranged.  They
            CRASH onto the floor.

            Paints and brushes go FLYING across the porch as Lucy KNOCKS

            Lucy sits in a ball on the corner of the porch.  Her eyes
            swollen from crying.  Finally, she gets up and moves to the
            tiny chair that Randy put out for her.  Straightens the easel
            and begins to paint.

            The front door opens and Randy comes out having washed her
            face and hair.  Without speaking, Randy straightens her easel
            and sits down next to Lucy and begins to paint.  Randy and
            Lucy paint in silence for a long time.  Then -

            birthday presents.  TIME HAS PASSED.  They look close, almost
            like a mother and daughter.  Lucy finishes unwrapping Sam's
            present and we see a stack of ONE HUNDRED DENNY'S NAPKINS.

            Denny's napkins into an origami bird.  Then crushes it.  Then
            cautiously:

            A fortress against the world.  He keeps folding - doesn't
            even look at Rita.  He's more far gone than she could
            imagine, she walks gingerly to the wall and knocks gently on
            it.

            slaps him again.  HE SLAPS HER.  She rips the newspaper wall

                      horrible things to him, a five year-old
                      because he doesn't want to get in the
                      car at the end of a day and he stares at

            She's crying too hard to continue.  He pulls her to him. 
            Before she realizes what's happening, she's holding him
            tightly.  He whispers in her ear.

                      enough.

            He looks her straight in the eye - she's undone by the
            intimacy of the moment, by the strength of his purity.  And
            staring into his eyes, she begins to sob, walls crumbling. 
            He kisses her elbow, her shoulder, her forehead, her eyes,
            her tears.  And something ignites between them - something
            confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate
            ache.

            She leaps into them and begins slugging his chest with pent
            up fury.

            Lucy pulls away.  A long charged silence.  Lucy refusing to
            even look at her father.

<b>                                SAM (CONT'D)

                      But the letter had too many big words. 
                      Pokey, sit.

            The black lab has begun eating Randy's flowers.  Lucy stares
            forward.  Sam speaks tentatively, carefully:

                      the day I thought about you.  Lucy in

            Lucy raises her head and looks at Sam for the first time.

            Rows of carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers and - uh-oh, a tomato's

            the tomato just so, in the tomato bin.  Now it moves to the

            they see each other.  Rita unconsciously fixes her hair.  Sam
            adjusts his tie.

            obviously.  Throughout the scene, Rita's hair falls in her

            Sam turns to Rita.  This can't be happening.

<b>            INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT
</b>
            Sam, Rita, Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in a booth.  With one
            extra person, it's a little tight.  Rita picks at her
            Salisbury Steak special, trying to deal with the business at
            hand.

<b>                                IFTY
</b>                      Isn't it illegal?  It's illegal to go
                      through stop signs.  It's illegal to
                      cross on the red.

<b>                                RITA
</b>                      It's not illegal.  It's very
                      complicated.  When a strong foster
                      parent lobbies for a child it changes
                      the equation.

<b>                                ROBERT
</b>                      They're reaching right through Sam as if
                      he doesn't exist.  As if he's a ghost.

                      settle out of court, ask for the most
                      incredible visitation rights - it would
                      almost seem like joint custody.

                      chance.

            Too long a pause.  Ifty looks at the clock.

            IN FRONT OF LUCY.  It's an ORIGAMI BIRD.  She looks around -
            but doesn't see Sam anywhere.  But she feels him.  She walks

            DISSOLVE as they move through the neighborhood.  Finally we

</b>                      Lucy, give me one minute with your
                      father.  Sam, I consider myself an
                      understanding person but I don't
                      understand this.  You can't close the
                      distance between you and Lucy with a new
                      address.  We go to court in a week -

</b>                      I don't want to spend half my visit with
                      Lucy on the bus getting to Lucy.  I
                      don't want to waste one more minute.

            Buster sneezes.

</b>                      He's better, much better.  Now I'll have
                      one box of mint chocolate cookies.

                      That's one dollar and 14 cents less than
                      five.

            Randy watches with a mixture of jealousy and fear as Lucy
            effortlessly enters her and Sam's universe.

</b><b>            EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY
</b>
            From the window, Randy watches as Sam hands Lucy four leashes
            and the two of them get pulled down the street by the dogs.

<b>            INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.
</b>
            Lucy lies in her hammock, unable to sleep.  Staring at the
            little origami bird on her window sill.  She moves it, opens
            the window wide, quickly takes Mr. Jeeters - and within a
            moment she's out the window and onto the limb of the tree.

<b>            EXT. MAIN THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT
</b>
            "The night grows teeth..." stray dogs fight over garbage - a
            wino talks to himself and in the midst of it all walks Lucy
            in her pj's.  Mr. Jeeters tucked under her arm.  Lucy crosses
            the street.  HONK!  the screeching of tires...

<b>            EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
            We're looking at an old fashioned fire escape when suddenly
            we make out a figure climbing higher and higher.  It's Lucy. 
            We catch glimpses of her and then lose her as the neon sign
            across the street blinks on and off.

<b>            INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Sam's asleep.  Suddenly his eyes open wide.  And like an
            animal sensing danger, he gets up.  We HEAR THE SOUND of
            something THUMPING AGAINST RUNG AFTER RUNG OF THE FIRE
            ESCAPE.  He rushes to his window and looks to see --

<b>            EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT
</b>
            Lucy climbing the fire escape!  Sam opens the window and
            reaches for her.

<b>                                SAM
</b>                      Lucy Lucy.  What are you doing?!  You
                      could have really hurt yourself.  What
                      are you doing?

<b>                                LUCY
</b>                      I couldn't sleep.  Daddy, did you know
                      that Warren G. Harding was the twenty
                      ninth President of the United States?

<b>                                SAM
</b>                      No.

                      In case the Judge asks.

<b>            EXT. RANDY'S STREET - NIGHT
</b>
            Sam, in his pajamas, holds a sleeping Lucy in his arms.  He
            turns a corner and heads up the walkway to Randy's house.  He
            knocks on the door.  Finally the door opens and we see Randy
            and Bill in their pajamas SHOCKED at seeing Sam and Lucy.

<b>                                SAM
</b>                      She couldn't sleep.

</b>                      Give me my daugh -
                          (she stops herself)
                      Give me - I'll take Lucy.

<b>                                SAM
</b>                      Maybe if you rub her tummy twenty-three
                      times, tell her two stories and give her
                      half a Denny's blueberry muffin and a
                      third of a glass of milk she'll sleep. 
                      Good night.

            Randy and BILL, her husband, watch as Sam turns and walks
            purposely down the walkway - his houseslippers scuffling on
            the quiet street.

<b>            SERIES OF SHOTS AT 3:00 A.M. --

            Lucy in her pj's walks down the middle of the street.

            Lucy knocks on Sam's window.

            Lucy in a blanket being carried by Sam toward Randy's house.

<b>            INT. LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
            Until FINALLY, we see Lucy in her hammock at Randy's house
            looking out the windows, which have now been completely
            covered with BARS.  Her room is filled with origami birds
            from the 100 Denny's napkins, her birthday gift.  Lucy gets
            out of her hammock and tiptoes across her room - quietly
            opening the door.

<b>            INT. CARPENTER HOUSE - STAIRS TO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
            We follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the
            stairs.  She gets to the front door.  It's been DEAD BOLTED
            where she cannot reach it.  From the darkness we hear --

<b>                                RANDY
</b>                          (tenderly)
                      Lucy.  Come here.

            Randy sits in the darkness, next to a THIRD OF A GLASS OF
            MILK and a HALF A DENNY'S BLUEBERRY MUFFIN.

<b>                                RANDY (CONT'D)
</b>                      I made us a midnight snack.

            Lucy stares at the muffin and milk.  Torn.

<b>                                RANDY (CONT'D)
</b>                      I understand that you want to see your
                      daddy.  And I don't want to keep you
                      from him.  I honestly don't.  So you
                      tell me when you want to see him.  You
                      can see him anytime you want.  But we
                      have to arrange it first.  Do you
                      understand?
                          (Lucy nods)
                      Now would you like a snack?

            Lucy nods.  Elated, Randy makes room for her on the couch. 
            But Lucy just reaches for the milk and muffin and heads up
            the stairs then turns back and speaks gently to Randy.

<b>                                LUCY
</b>                      Thank you.  Goodnight.

<b>                                RANDY
</b>                          (words caught in her throat)
                      Goodnight, Lucy.

<b>            INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
            We PAN ACROSS THE ROOM and see Sam's shoes, his tie, and a
<b>            YELLOW PAD WITH ALL THE PRESIDENTS LISTED IN ORDER.  A KNOCK
</b>            at the door - Sam opens it to see Rita standing there,
            looking intensely vulnerable, holding her husband's suit.

<b>                                RITA
</b>                      My husband left this when he moved out.

<b>                                SAM

                      see, let me see.
                          (pulls out notes)
                      They're going to put Bill and Randy on
                      the stand first and then you.

<b>                                SAM
</b>                      Them first, then me.  They're a nice
                      couple.  They have a nice house.  She's
                      pretty.  She's smart, too.  I can tell. 
                      The manager of the salad bar is gonna
                      testify, isn't he?  That will help us.

            For a moment, Rita's mask drops and her fear for Sam
            overwhelms her.

<b>                                RITA
</b>                      Absolutely.

                      could really be a song writer.  But he
                      wrote "Here Comes the Sun".  John and
                      Paul said it was one of the best songs

            Randy and Bill are asleep when Randy senses something.  She
            opens her eyes and sees Lucy staring at her.

<b>            INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - 3:30 A.M.
</b>
            We see Sam sleeping in bed.  There's a KNOCK at the door. 
            Sam wakes with a start, throws down the covers. 
            We see that he's wearing the Armani suit.  Sam opens the door
            to see Randy standing there, holding a sleeping Lucy in her
            arms.

<b>                                RANDY
</b>                      She fell asleep on the car ride over.  I
                      was gonna turn back and tuck her in to
                      her bed...with the pink canopy...and the
                      quilt I made...But I was afraid she'd
                      wake up at our house...
                          (fighting the ache in her soul)
                      ...and want to come home.

            Sam looks at Randy with profound compassion.

</b>                      I was gonna tell the judge that I could

                      what I think you're saying even though
                      you're not saying it.

            Randy nods and hands the sleeping Lucy into Sam's strong
            arms.  For a moment they BOTH HOLD LUCY between them in the
            most unique embrace.  Randy finally lets go and struggles to
            say goodbye.

            Randy walks away.  Stunned, Sam watches her, holding Lucy in
            his arms.  Then, from a very brave place:

            A glorious sunny day.  Lucy and her team are in the middle of
            a fierce game.  A foul is called when we hear -

<b>                                SAM

            Sam, wearing a UNIFORM and whistle around his neck, walking
            his inimitable walk, races up the field, COACHING THE TEAM.

            Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in the bleachers.  Robert, in
            sunglasses, paranoid, looking behind him.  Brad follows
            around an attractive YOUNG WOMAN as close as he can get to
            her.  Sam runs by the water stand, manned by Randy and Bill.  

            They share a look - a moment of intense parental pride.  Lucy
            and a kid named PHILLIP go after the ball.

<b>                                IFTY
</b>                      Keep both eyes on the ball, Lucy - balls
                      are round - on sale at Kmart.  The earth
                      is a ball, too...

            Phillip steps in front of Lucy and shoves her as hard as he
            can.  Sam blows his whistle repeatedly and races over.

<b>                                SAM
</b>                      Penalty!  Repeat!  Rules broken! 
                      Penalty!

<b>                                RITA (O.S.)
</b>                      Penalty?!  Sue him!  Kick his ass outta
                      the game!

            It's RITA!  With Danny - hollering from the stands.

<b>            ON LUCY
</b>
            Looks over at her father.  Sam does every coaching gesture,
            and referee hand signal from every sport known to man.  It
            looks like a bizarre TWYLA THARP DANCE.

<b>            ON LUCY
</b>
            She does it right back at him.  Their secret code.  The code
            that will bind them for the rest of their lives.

<b>            ON THE CROWD AND PLAYERS
</b>
            All watching.  What the hell was that?  Sam blows his
            whistle.

<b>                                SAM
</b>                      Play ball!  Play ball!

            The game heats up.  Lucy's team gets the ball and is headed
            toward the goal.  Sam is running right alongside them, so
            excited, until he can't hold himself back anymore and
            intercepts the ball!  Sam runs valiantly down the field with
            it!  We hear "Here Comes the Sun"...

            Little darlin', it's been a long, cold lonely winter.  Little
            darlin', it feels like years since you've been here.  Here
            comes the Sun...Here comes the sun...And I say, "It's
            alright..."

            And the CREDITS ROLL.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK.				  								  								  					  					  					  					  					  					  											  								  		</pre><br/>
