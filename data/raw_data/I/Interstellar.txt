<b>          SPACE.
</b>                         
          But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is
          a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.
                         
          Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON
          STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...
          planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?
                         
          Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden
          inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of
          existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.
                         
          The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,
          spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it
          contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.
                         
          The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into
          the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,
          racing back out from the black hole.
                         
          Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-
          like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --
          a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet
          with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.
                         
          The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches
          our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North
          America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and
          through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.
                         
          The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum
          chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected
          in a heavy piece of glass.
                         
          The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in
          the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a
          concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.
                         
          An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it
          parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end
          of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.

          The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission
          Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend
          and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the
          displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by
          a series of echoes.
                         
          The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee.

          The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
          headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity. POSTDOCS
          and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts, arguing.
                         
          ANSEN, 60s, the director of LIGO, walks through the frenzy.
          A postdoc hands him a printout: a pulse followed by echoes.

          In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of
          the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of

          The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,

          Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector.
          On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes.
                         
<b>                          ANSEN
</b>           Yesterday morning, our facility in
           Hanford identified this signal: a
           neutron star colliding with a
           supermassive black hole. We went
           through the last year's data and
           triangulated the source.
                         
          The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron
          star circling into the black hole.
                         
<b>                          NSA AGENT
</b>           We know that, Doctor. What we don't
           know is why, according to your
           numbers, this event took place right
           here in our own solar system.
                         
          Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the
          rest of our solar system around the black hole.
                         
<b>                          ANSEN

          consumed by the black hole. Only the sun survives, pulled

          On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant

          Cooper steps to the engine compartment.
                         
          The ballplayer notices Cooper's two boys, TOM, 15, and MURPH,
          10, watching them. He wanders over.

          Murph, a filth-encrusted kid with a black eye, smiles at the

          Earth spins, lazily. From this height, it looks much the
          same as it has done for thousands of years.
                         
          Suddenly, a tiny black object appears, racing toward Earth.
                         
          The object SMASHES into a large satellite and races onward.
          Behind it, the satellite spins out of orbit in a cloud of

          the upper atmosphere.
                         
          After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but
          everyone has seen it plenty of times before.
                         
          Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop
          fly and the Yankees load the bases. Donald looks disgusted.

          of his house, still eating his breakfast.
                         
          Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke

          his son to the ground.
                         
          Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they

          then soars off over the fields behind them.

          Half a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still

          Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets
          of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted
          over with corn.
                         
          They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot
          harvester. Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it.

          the soft sand.
                         
          A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead.
                         
          Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.
                         
          He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying
          to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin.
                         
          Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike
          the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault

          Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming

          At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across --
          the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a

          Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal.
          He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides
          down into the hole.

          out of the crater and onto the beach.

          Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard.
          Cooper follows his stare.
                         
<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)

           there's something we can salvage?
                         
          Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes.

          The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well,
          putting in a pair of earplugs.
                         
          A line is staked off, leading down into the well below.
          Cooper begins hauling the line up.
                         
          As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK
          returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out
          onto the ground.

          The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper
          spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along
          the dusty runway and into the air.
                         
<b>          EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY

<b>          EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY
</b>                         
          Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it
          did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa
          Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken
          and burned what was left of the homes in between.

          Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up
          to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and
          disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become
          ranchland, once again.
                         
<b>          EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY
</b>                         
          An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and
          checks it over.

<b>          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
</b>                         
          Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows
          the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat,
          the probe is HUMMING.
                         
          A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA
          CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.
                         
          As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent.
                         
<b>                          MURPH
</b>           I think it's home.
                         
          Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat
          grassland in the center of the island.
                         
<b>          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
</b>                         
          The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass.
                         
          Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a
          rifle over his shoulder.
                         
          A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line.
          Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with
          bright red -- strawberries.
                         
<b>                          MURPH

<b>           27.
</b>                         
          Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a
          little off. He walks over.
                         
          He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS
          against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage
          scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical
          transport truck.
                         
          Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.
                         
<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)

          He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses
          and heads into the forest to look for him.
                         
<b>          EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
</b>                         
          Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings.
          Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk
          of the tree is red hot.
                         
          Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged
          chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.
                         
          Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive
          tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some
          kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.
                         
          Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a
          clearing.
                         
<b>                          COOPER

          Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something:
                         
          Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing
          an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT.
                         
<b>                          MURPH

<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't
           made them for thirty years. I've
           never seen one intact before.
                         
          Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy
          frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like
          it might have been standing here for decades.
<b>           28.
</b>                         
          Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes.
          He steps back, clearly a little spooked.
                         
<b>                          COOPER (CONT'D)

           is, but we're leaving.
                         
          Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot.
                         
          Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy
          and hoisting him up to eye level.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.
                         
          The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from
          Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side
          of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony.
                         
          Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as
          hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses
          Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.
                         
<b>                          ROBOT

          Murph raises the rifle butt. A voice stops him.
                         
<b>           VOICE (O.S.)

          A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. This is AMELIA BRAND --
          tough, bright, and a decent shot with the large rifle that
          she's pointing at Cooper.

          trips over something, dropping the equipment.
                         
          Cooper looks back. He tripped on a white plastic post
          sticking out of the snow. He dusts it off, to reveal a

          disappearing into the ice above as if it were cloud cover.
                         
          The base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like
          foliage that runs into a perfectly-still inland sea. On the
          far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into
          the distance, supporting the thick ice and rock cavern roof.

          towards the huge inland sea below.

          Cooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like life-
          forms, which are wildly different from their counterparts
          back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a
          struggle to punch through the canopy to reach the light above.

          Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. The
          transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto

          over Brand's fingers.
                         
          Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her,

          to break apart and move.
                         
          After a moment, they're surrounded. The jungle is completely

          dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards

          Cooper opens the storage crate. Picks one of the probes at

          The rocket tucks in close behind one of the moons orbiting
          the ice planet.
                         
          The rocket fires to maneuver closer and closer to the moon's
          surface -- the tiny moon doesn't provide enough gravity to
          attract it.

          punctures the ice near the Chinese camp.

          Gargantua rising over the horizon of the shining ice planet.
                         
          He takes a final breath and activates the black box.
                         
          Instantly, the moon's gravity is magnified a hundred million
          times over. Roth is instantly crushed as the moon collapses
          around him into a tiny sphere.

          Even the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage, a
          tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin. The creature breaks
          apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure.
                         
          Finally, Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself

          tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining
          globes into the air.
                         
          For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin
          moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them
          into patterns in the air.
                         
          First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then
          shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around
          a medium-sized star.

          Pantagruel, and the ice planet.
                         
          Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet.
          Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around

          Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch, the
          entire barn IMPLODES. Their tractor begins sliding towards
          the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil.
                         
          Finally, the RUMBLING STOPS as the power lines short out in
          a FIERY display.
                         
          As the dust clears, Murph and his daughter examine the mess:
                         
          The entire barn has been crushed into a tiny ball.
                         
          Murph looks at his daughter.

          This is North America. But it doesn't look much like it.
                         
          Mother Nature has just about wiped the slate clean. Most of
          the vegetation is gone, and unchecked winds sweep across the
          barren plains. Patches of ice lie think on the ground, as
          if a heavy snow has come and gone.

          clouds above and settles gently onto the plain.
                         
          The hatch opens and Cooper steps out. He takes a cautious
          look around. He is holding the fractal life in its small
          container.

          Cooper stands in the middle of his kitchen. Two walls are
          missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap. But he can
          still see where he used to feed his kids breakfast.
                         
          He has kept his promise. Several hundred years too late.
                         
          Cooper hunkers down, staring at the space where his kids
          used to be. Rainwater covers the ancient formica.
                         
          It has taken him years to finally reach this place. He has
          had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find.
          But nothing has prepared him for this:
                         
          He is completely alone. Nothing is left.

          Cooper is still sitting there when the ice storm hits.
                         
          Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through
          the house, blasting Cooper and pelting what's left of the
          structure with fist-sized hail.
                         
          Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall. He's going
          to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the
          brutal descendants of the weather he knew. They'll finish
          him off if he steps back outside.
                         
          As he watches, the pool of water on the kitchen floor freezes
          over in seconds.

          Cooper shivers, pressed against the wall. The storm is still
          raging outside. He is freezing to death. He has to move
          now or he will die. He pulls the hood tight around his face
          and stumbles outside.

          Cooper makes his way through the blinding snow. He tries to
          find his way, but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard.
                         
          He stumbles to the ground, dropping the glass case with the
          fractal wildlife in it. The case shatters.
                         
          Cooper tries to stand back up, but his strength is dwindling.
<b>           145.

          As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out
          of its broken habitat. It forms together against the cold.
                         
          After a moment, it burrows into the ice. As it does, the
          ice glows faintly. It seems to be right at home.
                         
          Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. Was this
          what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along?
                         
          Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the
          driving snow. He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles
          a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent.
                         
          Finally, he sits down in the snow to die.
                         
          As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories
          of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling
          forward in the snow.
                         
          He stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about
          what happens when humans die.
                         
          He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet,
          eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship.
                         
          Cooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his
          ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him.
                         
          As the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast
          arctic tundra. He will die alone.

          He is in a sunlit room. A breeze rustles the curtains as it
          makes its way in through a large open window.
                         
          Cooper sits up. As he a does, a control panel on the wall
          TONES gently, as if in response to his movement.
                         
          He stands and looks around. He can see sunlight through the
          open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play.
          He moves toward the window. Reaches for the curtains. Before
          he can, the door opens behind him.

          Inside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. The old man
          carefully takes out the watch. He gives the watch a few

          less comfortable.
                         
<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Can you tell me why you... elected
           to release the life-form back on
           earth?
                         
          Cooper is still laughing.
                         
<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Because that was the plan.
                         
<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           Whose plan?

</b><b>                          (SMILES)
</b>           I don't know.
                         
          The administrator tries to smile back. Makes a few notes in
          his file. Changes the subject.
                         
<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           My assistant tells me you've applied
           for a position with the exploration
           fleet.
                         
<b>                          COOPER

<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The
           truth is, most of the fleet's
           personnel are automated. There are
           a small number of crewed ships. But
           there are great numbers of candidates.
           Very well trained candidates.
                         
<b>                          COOPER
</b>           I was hoping to enroll in a course.
           Try to get myself up to speed on the
           new systems.
                         
<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           I don't want you to take this the
           wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I
           said, you're a hero. But the truth
           is we have somewhat limited resources.
                         
          Cooper remembers this conversation. He looks down.
                         
<b>                          COOPER
</b>           No one's heard anything from Brand?
                         
<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           I'm sorry. Officially, she's been
           listed as missing for over 200 years.
           Mind you, I guess you turned up
           eventually, didn't you?
                         
<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Am I really going to hurt anybody by
           going to look for her? I just need
           a small ship. I made a promise.
                         
          The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to
          tell this guy the lay of the land?
                         
<b>                          ADMINISTRATOR
</b>           Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero.
           You're the oldest man in the human
           race. Don't you want to take it
           easy?
           (off his look)
           I hope you understand, we all you
           hold you in the highest possible
           regard.
<b>                          (QUIET)
</b>           Which is why they're never going to
           let you go off by yourself in a
           spaceship. I'm sorry.
                         
          Cooper looks at his hands. He's got a couple centuries on
          the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger.
          He puts his hands in his pockets.
<b>           151.

</b>           I've got some good news, however.
<b>                          (BIG SMILE)
</b>           We all know about your early life,
           Mr Cooper. I wrote a paper on it
           when I was a boy. And I think we
           found something you'll really enjoy.
                         
<b>          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY
</b>                         
          Corn blows in an artificial breeze. A red tractor makes its
          way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance.
                         
<b>           ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)
</b>           The machines do most of the work, of
           course, but we were able to get you
           a few acres. You're going to be a
           farmer again.
                         
          After a moment, the tractor stops. Cooper climbs down from
          the seat. Looks at the front steering linkage, which is
          jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead
          and begins working the branch out of the machine.
                         
          He looks miserable.
                         
          A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. Offers Cooper
          a bottle of water. Cooper accepts it.
                         
<b>          EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION
</b>                         
          Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar
          floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb
          into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out.
                         
<b>          EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION
</b>                         
          Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack
          of the bat as an intramural team from the university
          practices.
                         
          Cooper watches. He looks bored.
                         
          The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher
          shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position.
          But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.
                         
          Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward
          the town center above.
                         
          After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a
          building high above them.
                         
          Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing.

<b>          INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
</b>                         
          Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. Cooper is fiddling
          around in the back of his head.
                         
<b>                          ROBOT

          He begins putting the robot back together.
                         
<b>          EXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT
</b>                         
          Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before.
          They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of
          alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the
          cylinder into shade, then darkness.
                         
          The shadow races past them. Another day. Another night.
                         
<b>          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
</b>                         
          A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek-
          looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out.
                         
          After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar
          floor, sticking to the shadows.
                         
          As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better
          look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing
          a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.
                         
          Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with
          a click against the mirror-like floor.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his
          finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.
                         
          Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the
          ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes.
          Nothing happens. He punches in a few more.
<b>           153.
</b>                         
          Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS.
                         
<b>          INT. SHIP
</b>                         
          Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. Looks over
          the controls. The robot straps himself in next to him.
          Cooper looks up through the windows.
                         
          The inky black void of space beckons.
                         
          Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls.
                         
<b>                          COOPER
</b>           Where do you want to go first?
                         
          The robot thinks it over.
                         
<b>          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
</b>                         
          The technician walks back into the hangar. He walks along
          the row of ships till he reaches the last one.
                         
          It's not there.
                         
          He looks out into the blackness of the void. Sees a tiny
          glowing speck, getting smaller and smaller.
