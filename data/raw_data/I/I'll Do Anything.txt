<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               The CAMERA briskly retreats as FORTY, HIGHLY CHARGED, 
               ATTRACTIVE, YOUNG PEOPLE march towards it. Each side of the 
               frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the 
               middle, everyone talking, grinning, squealing,... everyone 
               having the "high" of their lives.

<b>               INT. NEW YORK CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
               As the troupe, with geometric precision, spills into a large 
               room (containing a raised dance floor); the CAMERA begins to 
               move past dancing couples as a legend appears:

               'This is 1975 and Matt Hobbs is singled out for the first 
               time.'

               And now the CAMERA reveals MATT HOBBS. His open, friendly, 
               American face slips between some of the many cracks in his 
               profession. The face at 26, and forever more, not arresting 
               enough for a leading man; not quirky enough for a "character." 
               Matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way 
               past a knot of people. He dances furiously for two seconds, 
               then steps down as THE DANCERS BEGIN TO SING "WOW", but just 
               as the song breaks out musically, we hear the SOUND OF PEOPLE 
               SHHHING; the singers falter and then stop as the party-goers 
               gather, in choreographed movement, at a ceiling mounted TV 
               set.

               We can barely discern the words. . ."with his review is 
               Leonard Graff."

               A FRANTIC ACTRESS yelps a command:

</b>                         I can't hear over this shhing.

               Silence, then:

               He stands next to a ruggedly handsome and extremely nauseous

</b>                         Good idea, let's not.

               He begins to walk, the Handsome Contemporary falling into 
               step. Everyone they pass is straining, upwards, at the TV.

                         reaction.

               At that moment, the rest of the party-goers turn from the TV 
               as one, looking mugged. (One girl briefly gets our attention 
               because she is particularly distraught; tears streaming down 
               her angry face. The mixture of tears and rage are, of course, 
               the chemical components of incredible sexiness. Her name is 
               BETH.) A TORTURED MALE DANCER offers an incantation.

                         back as the soap cake in a urinal.

                         He didn't like it?

               The DIRECTOR moves through the group, bucking up spirits.

</b>                         Don't worry. He doesn't count. We'll

               As they morosely watch the Director approach.

</b>                         Hey, no matter what this review says, 
                         the play was a great experience for 
                         me.

               Beth looks at him, puzzled.

</b>                              (again)

                         we're alive for.

               Beth turns from the conversation, finding it preposterous, 
               then rivets her attention on the Director, walking towards 
               them, holding a ridiculously thick sheaf of papers. Beth 
               begins to sob in anticipation.

<b>                                     MATT
</b>                         You've just got to be tougher than

                         Tougher than this?!?

               The Director reaches them.

</b>                         I took it all down over the phone. 
                         It's quite bad. And, unfortunately, 
                         it's very, very long. I've got a 
                         broken heart and writers' cramp.

                         What did he say?

               The Director hunts for the paragraph.

                         then go into some dark alley and

                         curious. That's it.

               The table of actors look at a sober Matt. A long beat and 
               then, against his will, he grins... then a short, involuntary 
               barking laugh of joy... then:

                         six or eight pounds even. Oh, God... 
                         Nothing like it. I'll tell you 
                         something amazing. They really reach 
                         right into her stomach and pull out 
                         this baby. It's not just a rumor. 
                         God. I understand the expression 
                         'mind blowing' for the first time. 
                         It means something so wonderful 
                         happens that the top of your head 
                         comes off and your brain pops out. 
                         Part of it was terrifying, the baby 
                         was turned and they couldn't budge 
                         her. I kept looking at this one woman 
                         doctor's eyes. And when Jeannie 
                         finally came out, this doctor and I 
                         each wiped away a tear at the exact 
                         same time, caught ourselves doing 
                         it, and then laughed together at the 
                         same time. Nothing can prepare you

               It's an awful place... the start-up apartment he's way too 
               old for... but we don't yet see his humble quarters. Rather:

               Then, the screen is CLEARED ON ONE HALF so we see half of a

               Bleaching his teeth... finishing... smiling in the mirror... 
               This is the bleached smile of fear--true fear--the awful 
               state of having lost your way. The phone rings. Matt clears 
               his voice before answering.

               Matt was so suddenly, emotionally extended that the anger 
               leaves him that quickly... just a strange atypical lightning 
               bolt of rage toward life and women.

                         You know what? I'm being a sort of 
                         gutless wonder here. I'm yelling

               He rubs his head with both hands, including the one holding 
               the phone. This allows us to hear his ex-wife repeat the 
               same sentence over and over again.

                         I'm broke. It's the driest spell of 
                         my life. I'm not saying it's your 
                         problem, but it's no place for a six-
                         year-old. What can I do? The only 
                         full-time job I seem to have is not 
                         showing how scared I am. What? No,

               Beth turns angry again. Matt finds, unfortunately, that he's 
               got one more act of bravado left.

               at each street corner, are various actors doing the relaxation

               We pass various actors going over alternate sentences for 
               the same speech so that we get a sense of the speech as a

               The walls are pockmarked with movie posters. THREE MEN sit 
               in an area some distance from the desk. The casting director, 
               MARTIN, makes the introduction:

                         I'm real bad at interviews, so, if 
                         you don't mind, I'd really prefer to 
                         just read first.

                         just take your word that you're good.

               Matt smiles.

</b>                         No. I'm serious. There's all different 
                         ways. Did you know Woody Allen never 
                         reads actors? He just looks at them, 
                         feels around a little and then decides 
                         who he wants. That's his way. Doesn't 
                         hear them do a line. I also have a 
                         way. What I do is interview first--
                         then read--maybe do it all over again 
                         the next day. I call up people the 
                         actor has worked with--check him 
                         out. If he's famous, I do an opinion 
                         survey to test how much people like 
                         him. If he's not famous, I put him 
                         on tape and show it to everyone I 
                         can grab. I believe in screen tests; 
                         I believe in replacing if the dailies 
                         are bad, in cutting people out if 
                         the previews aren't there. Because 
                         I'm not doing movies for theaters 
                         where they serve cappucino in the 
                         lobby. I'm doing popcorn movies. You 
                         want to know what I like? Come to my 
                         house, look at my lamps... you won't 
                         find it in my movies. In my movies, 
                         you'll find out what I know. I know 
                         how to do detail. What I don't know, 
                         I discover. Yesterday we finished 
                         mixing a movie--the last scene is in 
                         a field of windmills which blows up 
                         and all the blades of these windmills 
                         slice through the air, one of which 
                         hits a four-story tank of propane 
                         gas. A humongous explosion scene. I 
                         kept on saying 'louder', and they 
                         finally said to me they couldn't go 
                         louder without distortion. We went 
                         louder. We had to discover a thing, 
                         a filter, but we went louder. I don't 
                         question doing these things. I do 
                         them. So if you want to know if it's 
                         okay to do it differently--not to 
                         talk--to just read first... I say...

               Matt rises uncomfortably. A SECRETARY enters and hands a

               We HEAR the strains of the theme of a past hit movie coming 
               from Cathy's cassette player. A rack of soundtracks clearly 
               visible. Cathy is frowning as she reads the last of the galley 
               pages. She overhears some conversation in the adjoining room 
               which begins to disturb her concentration.

               Cathy closes the door, shutting her off. She now begins to 
               fill out a form with a felt-tipped pen. As she does so, the

               writes, we see the notations on the super.

               coincidentally celebrates this considerable act of heroism. 
               Cathy takes the sheet and walks to the door.

               As she approaches her secretary's desk, she overhears two 
               other members of Burke's Development Staff (a 27-year-old 
               well-dressed man and a woman younger than Cathy) as they 
               enthuse.

               He looks off... sees something that arrests his interest and 
               pulls to the curb. It's a curious sight.

<b>               MATT'S POV
</b>
               Burke Adler, standing at a street corner, palpably in pain. 
               He's trying to rein in his emotions, sucking in huge gulps 
               of air... and, then, a wave of emotion gets the better of 
               him as he looks at his watch. A sob escapes him--shocked 
               that he's so close to tears on a public street corner, he 
               battles for control... another sob as he looks to the heavens.

               A flow of PEOPLE--in the foreground, the tortured figure of 
               Burke Adler--in the background, Matt Hobbs, pauses before 
               intruding. But Burke's spectacle is growing more public, 
               sounds of anguish escape him.

               And now he begins to dissassemble, openly crying--on the 
               verge of a complete breakdown. Matt moves into frame, grabbing 
               Burke, trying to provide him with an anchor.

               Matt starts to lead him back, then realizes he's alone, Burke 
               having seen his car finally arrive.

               Our first view of NAN MULHANNEY; middle-aged and pragmatic, 
               yet extraordinarily naive. She's a scientist of sorts--
               monitoring the tastes and feelings of Americans, first in 
               Washington and now here. Though she just had a very rough 
               hour or so, she bends down to smile at Burke.

                         has a real case on me, but so far 
                         I've been keeping it in the bank.

<b>               BURKE'S POV - THE TEST AUDIENCE
</b>
               The line consists of disparate, disinterested people who are 
               focused on their own small, personal dramas--not at all 
               cognizant of the fact that they hold a life in their hands. 
               They are clearly growing impatient.

               towards the line. Nan approaches the car.

               As he approaches the line, he BEGINS TO SING his love to 
               them, "I'll Do Anything." As he pours out his misdirected 
               heart to individuals on the line who DO NOT HEAR HIM.

               Their impatience gives rise to a VERY SLOW TAP DANCE, each 
               couple or cluster doing it differently--barely exaggerating 
               the normal shifting of a line... As BURKE CONTINUES TO SING... 
               the song builds as does the dance... Burke sings even more 
               passionately, his D-PEOPLE perhaps joining in as BACKGROUND 
               SINGERS. At a key point, the disparate groups turn and form 
               a SOLID UNIFIED LINE. They begin the rhythmic clapping of 
               impatience--having become a line, they now threaten to become 
               a mob. Burke sings one more Joe Cocker-like passionate plea 
               before turning to camera to shout over the mayhem:

               As they enter.

<b>               INT. MOVIE THEATER - EVENING

               Nan is addressing the audience from down front.

                         seeing is 'Ground Zero'... There may 
                         be some scratches... some of the 
                         colors may be off, there are no final 
                         titles, and it has not been finally 
                         mixed for sound, and the music is 
                         temp, that means temporary...

               As she says this:

               Where Burke spies the STUDIO HEAD and leaves Matt's side.

               As BURKE enters the frame behind him. He is right behind his 
               boss' ear. He leans in and offers an intimacy.

                         of sending your staff.

               The boss is startled--jumps. BURKE eyes him... there must be 
               some way to profit from these stolen moments with a powerful 
               man.

                              (emphatically)
                         Could happen, right?

               He moves back to Matt and Nan at the rear of the audience.

                         Eisner just said he thinks the 
                         screening will be a monster.

               Strangely, Burke seems truly buoyed by the words of 
               encouragement he himself manufactured. He moves down three 
               rows and sits in an aisle seat just as the film opens with a 
               series of violent explosions.

                         peace.

               Incredibly, Burke turns and gestures to her that the sound 
               of her small voice is interfering with the cacophony of his 
               movie. Nan is clearly stricken by her lapse as she whispers 
               to Matt.

<b>               INT. WHOLESALE BUTCHER'S (THE FILM) - DAY

               As the muscular hero moves with stealth through the giant 
               refrigerated meat door. He passes cows and dead men hanging 
               from alternate hooks. Suddenly, he is attacked by the villain 
               brandishing an electric meat dismembering tool. The hero 
               ducks, the machine ripping apart hanging cow flesh. The hero 
               grabs the only weapon he can find: a large piece of meat on 
               a large bone, which he uses as a mace. He clubs the other 
               man--then again--and again. Part of the audience is whooping 
               and applauding.

               Nan grins and mumbles with a connoisseur's knowledge.

               Where the hero stands over the man whose face he has 
               shattered, holding a club from which hang strings of meat. 
               He is breathing heavily, and between breaths, states:

               An office meant for two, containing twenty counters. The 
               counting is done with erasers rifling stacks, creating a 
               sound, a MUSICAL RHYTHM, as the GROUP CAPTAIN calls out with 
               gospel cadence.

               Matt, his tally finished, squats on the floor, waiting. The 
               Group Captain approaches.

                         Older males... over 25?

               Matt now realizes that it is his category and hands over the 
               older male cards and exits.

               As everyone starts pushing the cabin attendant call button. 
               These dings magnify until they're part of the music--as it 
               drives and drives... Matt takes Jeannie's hand and tries to 
               restrain her.

                         yellow dress... let go... let go.

               She breaks away from him. He moves after her.

<b>               CAMERA MOVING
</b>
               At breakneck speed, Jeannie dashes through the plane with 
               her father in pursuit... flashes of disapproving faces. The 
               seat belt sign goes on. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT blocks his path.

               Jeannie takes advantage of Matt's being stopped and moves 
               into the toilet, locking the door behind her.

<b>                                     MATT

                         the cabin attendants please take 
                         their seats?

                         I have no idea what to do.

               A sudden bump and Matt falls. He yells to the locked door.

               As Matt makes his way back, the Flight Attendant uses a hidden 
               latch to open the door. Music building--then calming, the 
               worst is over. Matt makes his way back to his seat, shell-
               shocked. The Attendant leans over him.

               He just nods.

               Down the aisle--Jeannie lets an Attendant lead her as she 
               peers back at her dad.

               Matt carrying the sleeping child like a sack over his 
               shoulder, also managing to hold onto all her luggage.

<b>               INT. MATT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               He has propped her on the sofa, a cotton nightgown out. He 
               is unbuttoning her dress. She opens her eyes, the window's 
               protective bars PLACING A SHADOW ACROSS HER FACE. She attempts 
               to cover her fear.

</b>                         Okay... so what do we do?

               Jeannie mimics him perfectly under her breath. She goes to 
               an open suitcase and throws things on the floor until she 
               finds the right jammies.

               She surveys her pitiful choice; then points to the sleeping 
               bag.

<b>                                     JEANNIE
</b>                         That.

               She gets into it. He zips her up--then she says something 
               remarkably unexpected.

<b>                                     JEANNIE
</b>                         Hug.

               Amazed, Matt hugs her. A half-beat, then:

</b>                              (sharply)
                         Let go.

               He does--then stands and looks down at her. She looks back, 
               mocking his stare with one of her own.

<b>               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Nan uncertainly enters this decidedly masculine bathroom. 
               She is wearing an evening gown. The sun streams through the 
               lush foliage outside a wall-sized window. MUSIC as she opens 
               her purse and removes a pillbox; at one point lightly singing 
               a snatch of lyric concerning the conflicts of being a single 
               woman and a single mother--this while totally focused on the 
               pills.

               MUSIC CONTINUES. She dials a phone number while arching her 
               neck and swallowing one pill after another with little swigs 
               of water. This process continuing, even as she speaks into 
               the phone.

                         didn't want you to get worried when 
                         you realized I wasn't there. I'm

                         we'll rent any cassette she wants 
                         for tonight. Thank you... Take good 
                         care.

               She hangs up. Another snatch of lyric as she bends to brush 
               her teeth with her finger; prepares herself and opens the 
               door to greet her new lover.

                         to work for me. He was always crazy

               Nan is dumbfounded; still she puts a hand on him, actually 
               consoling him for his hideous thought--Hollywood lovers: he, 
               wrapped up with ill thoughts of others; she, feeling intimate, 
               yet severely compromised. Cupid's work is done.

               We hear a muffled argument between Matt and Jeannie coming 
               from inside their apartment. Then the door opens and Matt, 
               holding Jeannie by the hand, moves down the hall to the next 
               door and knocks. (NOTE: Jeannie is dressed in layers of varied 
               clothing--some of the layers play clothes, some fit for a 
               coronation. She is a pocket contemporary Annie Hall... her 
               style so much her own it transcends judgement. Her hair is 
               unkempt. The door opens revealing Lucy, an Hispanic woman in 
               her mid-30s.

               Matt is extraordinarily anxious. Then he HEARS loud crying 
               and screaming from next door. There is a stab of despair. 
               Matt deflates, then resigned, exits.

               The sound of screaming now louder. He walks to Lucy's door, 
               takes a breath and knocks. The door opens and Lucy stands 
               there looking rattled.

                         they gave me pills to deal with the

               Matt is very much like a fighter taking a great deal of

               Matt, upset in a way he has never imagined, as he pops a 
               beer--puts on some headphones for calming music and begins 
               to read a book on child behavior modification.

               Feeling the restrictions of her punishment, pacing and now 
               she begins to wail "THIS LONELY LIFE". Few adult women have 
               sung with such appropriate passion out of need and loss, 
               aloneness and confusion. The song finishes. Jeannie sits 
               huddled.

               Moving very quickly and with great purpose, she slaps a tape 
               into a pink child's cassette player and MUSIC BEGINS... 
               Jeannie sings along with the child's chorus on the tape, 
               "YOU COULD BE WONDERFUL", making, with little hand motions, 
               the last thing Matt needs, but, in due course, he starts to 
               actually make a bit of transitional progress out of his own 
               troubles and into the fact that his daughter is beguiling. 
               But, before the mood can fully sweeten, Jeannie forgets the 
               lyrics and begins to verbally assault herself as the tape

               in place a phony cheap-car-radio-sticker over her own

               In the b.g. WE HEAR Jeannie loudly imploring her father to 
               make the person wait till she's finished dressing. There is 
               the SOUND OF the buzzer. Cathy hurls herself at the door a

               the necessary strength to spill through.

               A post-coital moment though only the man is visible; Burke, 
               who lies on the bed wearing a shirt and tie and nothing else. 
               Nan lies out of sight on the floor where she is recovering 
               from the deepest orgasm of her life.

               Matt, holding the script, walks the small lane through the 
               tidy lawn to the perfect Silver Lake cottage. We HEAR MUSIC 
               from inside. (A soundtrack.) There is a note on the door, 
               which is slightly ajar, reading: "Come right in if you loved

               Matt totally there... this is major for him, then he does 
               something sensitive... reads her concern over the depth of 
               his need and interest and shrugs, indicating he can't help 
               it.

               and - as the color changes. Burke talks sotto to Nan.

               Burke rises and addresses his staff... the camera has his 
               back in the foreground as it MOVES TOWARDS A RENDEZVOUS, 
               Burke moving too as he continues...

               And now Burke and CAMERA meet up--the effect being that he

               She listens to him. He is hurt. Cathy, though, is also 
               wrestling with her own internal struggles. She has betrayed 
               him and is ashamed; in a strange way--terrified. She is, 
               therefore, just a little irritable.

               overcome... his energy failing to get him past this most 
               awful moment in his life. She moves to his side. He starts 
               to cry and, urgently seeking privacy, he moves quickly towards 
               the bathroom, rubbing Jeannie in an instinctive gesture of 
               reassurance. He closes the door.

               Devoid of anger. Sympathy so pure that it wrenches. She starts

               Matt sits down, still suffering a bit of dysfunction, unable 
               to keep up appearances other than a few minor half-hearted 
               tweaks at his daughter who stands solemn and silent at his 
               side. She pets him some... this goes on for several beats as 
               the STRAINS OF "YOU COULD BE WONDERFUL" accompany the moment. 
               Then:

               while looking over his shoulder at the telephone... now

               MUSIC IN as Burke leaves the table. This "Dance of 
               Desperation" is classical. Burke himself lifting one of the 
               women in greeting, then, as he puts her down.

               As she looks down on him, dying for him, we HEAR her sing 
               the song "Poor Bastards". Finally, not only about Burke--but 
               the other damaged souls he seeks to dance with. Now, Nan can 
               take no more. She exits.

               As he sees her go past in the background, he goes after her, 
               finally grabbing her near the Maitre D' station. This, just 
               as TWO IMPORTANT COUPLES arrive. Burke frantically tries to 
               cover.

                         very upset about what's happening to 
                         Burke, so I just made up my mind I 
                         can't be witness to it anymore if I 
                         love him and I certainly shouldn't

                         in the process of leaving when he

                         horrible thing in your personal life 
                         happening in public.

               They all nod and ad-lib agreements with her premise to Burke's 
               amazement.

                         really damaged by this relationship.

               She exits, enormously upset. Burke, torn between following 
               her and repairing the social damage. But the couples are 
               paying him no mind; rather they are impressed with Nan. As

               The strains of "Poor Bastards" underscoring the moment as 
               Burke rushes into the parking area and grabs Nan's hand just

                         with you.

               She begins to cry. Ordinarily this would be a scene which 
               would be unendurable for Burke. However, the lesson of a 
               moment ago is not lost on him. As people get out of cars and 
               witness the sobbing Nan.

                         you know, private stuff in public.

               The reaction to his openness is disdain and passing contempt. 
               She drives off, leaving Burke hurt and alone. "Poor Bastards" 
               up and out.

               Matt laughs. Jeannie looks at him shyly... he looks at her 
               with encouragement. Suddenly she is in his arms, hugging him 
               hard, an emotional dam seems to have broken.

               Matt holds on--clearly, deeply moved. Then he exercises the 
               effort to control his emotions and speaks, surprisingly, as

                         most important acting you do is when

                         to do it. Think of something that 
                         makes you really sad... or forget

               Millie, having been at the screen test viewing, is taken 
               aback, looking from one to the other. Cathy knows what she's 
               thinking and is unnerved, feeling silently accused, as she 
               leads Matt out.

               We see Jeannie's face in the mirror, but it is seen through 
               something resembling fleece, which we now recognize as the 
               strands of Jeannie's hair being combed out to the side by an 
               expert hair-dresser. Jeannie is shifting nervously in the 
               large room where each chair is filled with a child of a 
               different age and color. In the b.g., we can HEAR the voice 
               of the WARM-UP MAN.

                         more and make you love me...

               The audience laughs thinly. The BAND PLAYS as someone closes 
               the door to the make-up room muffling the offstage sound... 
               There is a good deal of tension in the brightly lit room. 
               Jeannie sits between a FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD HISPANIC BOY and a 
               FOUR-YEAR-OLD ASIAN GIRL. The room is abuzz... kids running 
               lines and loudly talking... this builds to a musical life as 
               in our first audition scene... there is a briefly sung phrase 
               (Jeannie not taking part).

<b>               INT. GREEN ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               The parents, in the same variety of skin colors as the child 
               actors, are stuffed into a small room being patronized by 
               the ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. Matt is grimly seated in the middle 
               of a long sofa containing stage mothers. Another sofa is two 
               feet away; the parents strain at each other. The A.D. is 
               talking grandly but we cannot hear his words because the 
               Rainbow Parents are SINGING a phrase from the same song we 
               heard in the make-up room. Matt does not take part in the 
               singing. The music goes under allowing us to now hear the 
               A.D.'s words.

                         when it's somebody else's kid...

               There is appreciative laughter from everyone save Matt, who 
               rises in disgust and crosses out of the room.

               cluster of other cast members excitedly awaiting their

</b>
               Across the stage to the distant make-up room. Jeannie, alone 
               in the room, which is so brightly lit it creates a bizarre 
               effect, as if she were under a surreal spotlight. MUSIC 
               reprises Jeannie's Sinead O'Connor song, "Lonely Life of 
               Mine."

               Stopping his impulse to go to her--he continues to observe.

<b>               MATT'S POV
</b>
               Jeannie is nervous and uncertain... She plays with the handle 
               of the make-up chair... turns herself back and forth... Then 
               a very attractive TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY enters the scene--obviously 
               telling her to hustle... He offers his hand and she takes 
               it, instinctively masking all clues that this hand holding 
               is a "first" of great moment in her life. As they move toward 
               the main stage area, Jeannie looks around, needing 
               something... her dad.

               She turns--sees her father and gives a small, cursory nod... 
               He moves quickly, drawing even with her but still giving her 
               a bit of space and a low-key pep talk.

               This does not satisfy her. She rolls her eyes as she is pulled 
               away towards the front of the stage. Matt watches as the 10-

</b>                         Oh, Cathy. Look, I'm going to watch 
                         this. Let me talk to you later or 
                         tomorrow. Thanks for your help. It's 
                         good news. Gotta go.

               From the stage, we HEAR the VOICE of the WARM-UP MAN.

<b>                                     WARM-UP MAN'S VOICE
</b>                         First, in her first appearance ever, 
                         Jeannie Hobbs...

               There is applause. Matt's missed her intro.

<b>                                     MATT
</b>                         Shit.

                         Shit.

</b>                              (broadly)
                         I guess it's because I'm just 
                         incredibly insensitive to all human 
                         needs. I'd ask you to save me, but 
                         I'm so far gone, I wouldn't want you 
                         to waste your time.

</b>                              (after a moment)
                         Huh?

               She reacts, but he walks off, not wanting to get into it. 
               Cathy, however, has had a tricky nerve struck. She continues, 
               biting off each word.

<b>                                     CATHY
</b>                         You know, I don't have a kid or a 
                         mate or a talent.
                              (holding up book bag)
                         I got this.
                              (she's quite upset)
                         And shoot me if I think it's 
                         important.

<b>               MATT'S POV
</b>
               Cathy, who looks alone and adorable as we HEAR MUSIC of "THIS 
               LONELY LIFE OF MINE." He puts a comforting hand on her. She 
               speaks nakedly from deep within herself; her eyes downcast.

<b>                                     CATHY
</b>                         You think I'm a superficial jerk.
                              (and then a whispered 
                              afterthought)
                         You can't be right.

<b>                                     MATT
</b>                         I think you're the best of the bunch.

<b>                                     CATHY
</b>                              (broadly)
                         Oh, great.

               And now she raises her eyes--big, blue and vulnerable. If 
               this look were returned, "I love yous" could flow--they could 
               sink to the floor in a joint epiphany; but there is no romance 
               or kindling in Matt's eyes. He is in a hurry. Pridefully, 
               Cathy turns and walks off in the opposite direction, her 
               flight so instinctive, she forgets her book bag. We hold on 
               this--her exit, then:

<b>               INT. STUDIO FLOOR - BURKE AND MATT - 20 MINUTES LATER
</b>
               Standing just behind the four television cameras, immediately 
               behind them, the "rail" where the Show's Staff and Crew 
               Members and Network Bosses stand crowded, choreographed in 
               the way in which they "clear" for a moving camera. Behind 
               these people is the studio audience. There is a loud laugh. 
               Burke turns around to study the audience.

               Happy faces accompanied by the strains of Burke's love song 
               to the crowd...

                         What do you think?

               But Matt doesn't hear him... a few feet away, Jeannie is 
               making ready for her big moment. Three cameras swing in front 
               of them, TV monitors showing a MASTER and CLOSE-UPS of the 
               three characters in the scene: a short comic WHITE MAN, the 
               Black Female Lead, and Jeannie, dressed as a poor child.

                         off at me because I'm not colored.

               The White Man jumps on the phrase.

                         The word is African American.

               A burst of laughter, whooping and applause from the audience. 
               Burke brags in a whisper to Matt.

               She looks at the Lead Actress giving Jeannie all she can.

               Jeannie still can't cry. She looks past the cameras.

               Her father nervously pulling for her.

<b>               BACK TO JEANNIE

               That didn't do it either. She looks into herself... she blinks--
               there are tears running down her cheek.

               The Black Lead Actress holds out her arms to Jeannie, who, 
               tears streaming down her face, runs towards the arms...

               Jeannie has run past the Lead Actress and off the set, going 
               into her father's arms instead. She jumps on him, her legs 
               and arms wrapped around him.

               The background to this intimacy is enormously alive. The 
               Lead Actress and the Character Actor laughing out loud. In 
               the b.g., we see the audience filling out preview cards as 
               the FLOOR MANAGER leans in to say:

               Matt starts to walk her back to the set.

                         until you hug the lady just like you 
                         did me.

               He puts her down. She turns from him to go back to work but, 
               on impulse, he restrains her. He is kneeling down, holding 
               her lightly by the arms, her back to him as he states an 
               ultimate truth:

                         more than anybody.

               Jeannie, shocked by her father's unprecedented sentiment, 
               turns to face him and clamp a hand over his mouth so he will 
               add no more lush and primal affection. Having silenced him 
               though, she finds that she has something of her own to say. 
               She'd never tell it to her father, but she can't resist 
               telling it to her acting coach.

               what's the opposite of trauma? All are off the wall with 
               pleasure--the MUSICAL LIFE of the earlier dressing room scene
