               Interior: Jack Burden's Desk, The Chronicle, Day

               Jack Burden is looking over the morning edition of "The 
               Chronicle." He reads the society page. A man enters and leans 
               across his desk.

                         to see you.

               He folds his paper, rises, and walks by the presses into 
               Madison's office.

               Exterior: Kanoma City, Day

               As Jack Burden's jalopy pulls up before the Kanoma County 
               Courthouse of this back-country, one-street small town.

<b>                                     JACK
</b>                              (voice over)
                         I found him in Kanoma City. A typical, 
                         hot, dusty, backwoods county seat.

               He gets out of the car, and notices a crowd of people gathered 
               around a platform in the town square. As he walks over the 
               begins to hear the words that Willie Stark is speaking.

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         ...to lie to them in order to line 
                         their own dirty pockets with the 
                         taxpayers' money. When have the 
                         citizens of Kanoma County ever 
                         witnessed a campaign like this? Why 
                         is the opposition so anxious to defeat 
                         me? Why have they used every dirty 
                         method known to make sure I'm not 
                         elected county treasurer? Well, I'll 
                         tell you why...

               A man in shirt sleeves and suspenders, Tiny Duffy, comes out 
               of the local poolroom, listens for a moment to Willie's 
               speech, and signals to two uniformed men to go over and break 
               up the gathering.

               Jack Burden stands close to the platform, next to Willie's 
               son, Tom, who waits patiently to distribute handbills.

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         ...Because they're afraid of the 
                         truth... and the truth is this. 
                         They're trying to steal your money. 
                         Yeah, I said steal. The county 
                         commissioners rejected the bid on 
                         the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll 
                         tell you their reason is the job 
                         will be done better. The county 
                         commissioners would have you believe 
                         that they're interested in public 
                         welfare. They're interested in 
                         welfare, sure. But it's their own. 
                         Let's look at the reason in the light 
                         of the facts and the figures. That 
                         brick factory is owned by one of the 
                         commissioners. That same brick factory 
                         uses convict labor.

               The sheriff and his deputy push through the crowd.

                         read these handbills, my boy will 
                         pass them out among you.

                         Pass 'em out, Tom.

               The sheriff pushes Tom back, grabbing the handbills out of 
               his hand. Willie jumps down off the platform.

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         Let him alone!

               The sheriff collars Willie, then notices Jack on the platform 
               snapping a picture.

                         Get that camera! Willie, you're under 
                         arrest.

               He takes Willie by the arm and leads him away. The crowd 
               follows them to the courthouse. Tiny Duffy wipes the sweat 
               off his neck and goes back into the poolroom.

               Two of Duffy's men, Pillsbury and a local commissioner, are 
               playing pool as Jack enters.

               The whole town is there. Willie Stark, Lucy, Tom stand 
               modestly in the background. Quiet sobbing is heard as the 
               minister reads from the Bible. When he finishes the prayer, 
               he walks past the line of mourners, shaking their hands. The 
               ceremony is over. As they start to go, a man spots Willie, 
               goes over to him, and lifts Willie's arm in the air.

               This sudden action brings response; women begin to cry and 
               people push their way forward to grab Willie by the hand.

                         were right, Willie. Let me shake

                         the time.

               On Willie's face is the realization that something important 
               has happened to him.

                         him.

               Jack sits on the bed next to Willie.

                         They're waiting for him at the

               Sadie pulls her coat off Willie and goes to the door.

               She leaves. Jack bends over Willie, who continues to snore.

               Exterior: Fairgrounds (Upton), Day

               A crowd mills about underneath a banner that reads HEAR WILLIE 
<b>               STARK MAMMOTH BARBECUE -- UPTON FAIRGROUNDS

               Exterior: Fairgrounds, Day

               Willie, staggering a bit, hung over, reacts painfully to the 
               staggering height of the Ferris wheel. He leans on Jack for 
               support, and they walk on.

               Exterior: Fairgrounds, Day

               Willie takes a seat on the children's swing as Jack goes off 
               to get some coffee. Two little girls stare curiously at him. 
               Willie waves them off. Jack returns with the coffee and pours 
               some whisky in it. Willie tips his hand, forcing him to pour 
               more, then gulps his drink down.

               Exterior: Bandstand (Upton), Day

               Duffy, Pillsbury, and the other politicians stand on the 
               platform, waiting for Willie. A band plays march music. Duffy 
               goes over to Sadie, who is standing on the steps of the 
               platform.

                         There he is.

               Escorted by Jack, Willie approaches the platform and stumbles 
               up the steps past Sadie.

                         favor drinkin'.

               Duffy follows Willie up on the platform.

                         How'd you get him here? He was out 
                         stiff.

</b>                         Hair? He must have swallowed the 
                         dog.

               On the platform, Duffy looks uneasily at the bleary-eyed 
               Willie. The band suddenly plays a fanfare, and the chairman 
               steps up to the microphone.

<b>                                     CHAIRMAN

                         the next governor of the state... 
                         Willie Stark.

               There is scattered applause as Willie steps forward to speak.

               He turns his face from side to side, and fumbles in the right 
               side of his coat pocket to fish out his speech.

<b>                                     WILLIE

               He tries to focus on the speech, which he clutches before 
               his eyes with both hands. Then he lifts his head, and looks 
               directly at the people who have come to hear him. As he 
               speaks, the camera focuses on the faces of these people: the 
               farmers, workers, hicks, red-necks who are Willie's audience, 
               Willie's people.

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         I have a speech here. It's a speech 
                         about what this state needs. There's 
                         no need in my telling you what this 
                         state needs. You are the state and 
                         you know what you need... You over 
                         there... look at your pants. Have 
                         they got holes in the knees? Listen 
                         to your stomach. Did you ever hear 
                         it rumble from hunger?... And you, 
                         what about your crops? Did they ever 
                         rot in the field because the road 
                         was so bad you couldn't get them to 
                         market?... And you. What about your 
                         kids? Are they growing up ignorant 
                         as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause 
                         there's no school for them?... No, 
                         I'm not going to read you any speech.

               He throws his speech away. Duffy looks alarmed.

</b>                         Get ready to bust your sides laughing, 
                         'cause it's sure a funny story. It's 
                         about a hick... a hick like you, if 
                         you please. Yeah, like you. He grew 
                         up on the dirt roads and gully washes 
                         of a farm. He knew what it was to 
                         get up before dawn and get feed and 
                         slop and milk before breakfast... 
                         and then set out before sunup and 
                         walk six miles to a one-room, slab-
                         sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick 
                         knew what it was to be a hick, all 
                         right. He figured if he was going to 
                         get anything done, he had to do it 
                         himself. So he sat up nights and 
                         studied books. He studied law because 
                         he thought he might be able to change 
                         things some... for himself, and for 
                         folks like him.

               Sugar Boy listens intently, sharing in the anger in Willie's 
               speech.

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         No, I'm not going to lie to you. He 
                         didn't start off thinking about the 
                         hicks and all the wonderful things 
                         he was going to do for them. No. No, 
                         he started off thinking of number 
                         one. But something came to him on 
                         the way. How he could do nothing for 
                         himself without the help of the 
                         people. That's what came to him. And 
                         it also came to him, with the powerful 
                         force of God's own lightning, back 
                         in his home country, when a 
                         schoolhouse collapsed because it was 
                         built of politics... rotten brick. 
                         It killed and mangled a dozen kids. 
                         But you know that story. The people 
                         were his friends because he fought 
                         that rotten brick. And some of the 
                         politicians down in the city, they 
                         knew that... So they rode up to his 
                         house in a big, fine, shiny car and 
                         said as how they wanted him to run 
                         for governor...

               Jack, electrified, grips Sadie's arm.

               Duffy fidgets as Willie continues to pace and speak, his 
               face filled with conviction, and with fury.

<b>                                     WILLIE

                         swallowed it. He looked in his heart 
                         and he thought in all humility how 
                         he'd like to try and change things. 
                         He was just a country boy who thought 
                         that even the plainest, poorest man 
                         can be governor if his fellow citizens 
                         find he's got the stuff for the job. 
                         Well, those fellows in the striped 
                         pants... they saw the hick and they 
                         took him in.

               He points his finger at Duffy, who is coming over to speak 
               to him.

               Willie turns on him, roaring.

                              the platform)
                         Look at him... lickspittle... nose-
                         wiper.

               Duffy gestures frantically to the band.

               The band starts to play, adding to the pandemonium. Willie 
               shouts above it.

               Sugar Boy leaps up on the platform, his pistol drawn and 
               pointed at Duffy's men. Willie throws up his arms to silence 
               the crowd.

               the hotel.

               The lobby is packed as Willie, Jack, Sugar Boy, and Pillsbury 
               enter. Willie makes signals to Duffy to tag along with the 
               entourage. Willie leans over to speak to the room clerk.

                         here. Give him anything he wants.

               The group starts up the stairs, past the officers who are 
               standing guard. Duffy stops to speak to one, pointing his 
               finger at some of his men standing below.

               They start up the second flight of stairs.

                         Why are you saving Pillsbury's hide?

                         Pillsbury's hide. It's something 
                         much more important than that. If 
                         the McMurphy boys get the notion 
                         they can get away with this, there's 
                         no telling where they'll stop.

                         Or where you will... Pillsbury is 
                         guilty. As attorney general of this 
                         state, it's my job to prosecute.

</b>                         Judge, you talk like Pillsbury was... 
                         was human. He isn't. He's a thing. 
                         You don't prosecute an adding machine 
                         if the spring goes busted and makes 
                         a mistake. You fix it. Well, I fixed 
                         him. I'm not a bit interested in 
                         Pillsbury. It's something much bigger

                         now you're scared. You don't want to 
                         get your hands dirty. You want to

               Sadie wanders around. She goes to the dresser, upon which is 
               a photograph of Anne Stanton. She picks up the picture and 
               places it so she can see it in the mirror and compare it 
               with her own reflection.

                         to look in the mirror to be able to 
                         see it. Soft, white skin... not like 
                         mine.

               Jack watches her through the open bathroom door.

                         her head... at just the right angle.

               Tom and his girl friend Helene are in the car. Tom is 
               drinking.

                         Come on...

               The car goes across a bridge, weaving. Two motorcycle cops 
               parked there start to give chase.

               Tom's car swerves out of control and crashes through a fence.

               The two motorcycle cops ride out to the field to the wrecked 
               car. They find Tom and Helene, unconscious. One of the cops 
               picks up the empty bottle and hands it to the other.

                         It's the governor's son.

               He throws the bottle away.

               Willie is finishing his meal, seated at the table with his 
               family and Jack. Sugar Boy stands behind Willie. Sadie has 
               left the table and is examining the room.

                         roared across the state making one 
                         speech after another. And all of

                         Willie hollered foul. Willie knew if 
                         you hollered long enough, hard enough, 
                         and loud enough, people begin to

                         he organized spontaneous 
                         demonstrations.

                         and added a few more.

               Crowd looks on as two uniformed police drag a man away.

               Jack turns and looks at the large crowd. A voice from a public 
               address loudspeaker begins to yell out commands to the crowd.

               The chant is picked up enthusiastically by the crowd.

               Interior: State Legislature, Day

               The speaker is trying to speak over the clamor of the 
               chanting.

                         of the impeachment of the governor.

                         Mr. Speaker, this is a farce to ask 
                         us to vote in the face of the kind 
                         of intimidation and pressure that 
                         has been exerted here in the past 
                         few weeks. Even that crowd outside, 
                         yelling on cue, is part of that 
                         pressure.

               Willie gets up, and goes to the window.

               Exterior: State Capitol, Day

               The crowd, with Jack in the foreground. The crowd suddenly 
               goes wild as they see Willie appear at the window. In the 
               growing darkness he seems only a shadowy figure as he raises 
               his hands to wave to the crowd.

               We see various shots of people straining to get a little 
               closer to the steps in order to see him better. Willie then 
               turns and goes back into the room.

               The crowd again, still waiting. The camera pans upward to a 
               loudspeaker.

                         He doesn't want any one of you to 
                         leave...

               The camera moves over the faces of the people listening.

                         win, stay where you are.

               They cheer. Camera picks up Jack watching the crowd's 
               reaction, then up to a plaque over the entrance to the Capitol 
               Building. It reads THE PEOPLE'S WILL IS THE LAW OF THIS STATE --

               Exterior: State Capitol, Night

               Newsmen, photographers stand about, bored. The crowd, every 
               bit as large, is quiet but expectant. Everyone holds still 
               as the announcer's voice is heard again.

<b>                                     ANNOUNCER

                         The balloting on the impeachment 
                         proceedings against Governor Stark 
                         has just ended. This is the result: 
                         Willie Stark has won.

               The crowd explodes. People break through the police barriers. 
               Mounted policemen ride in quickly to prevent a riot. Camera 
               picks up Anne in the crowd, trying to push through.

               Jack stands on the steps of the Capitol, watching it all. 
               Suddenly Willie appears at the top of the steps, followed by 
               Sugar Boy. Sadie, Duffy, Pillsbury follow close behind. Willie 
               grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed 
               crowd.

                         they did not like what I have done. 
                         Do you like what I have done?

               Loud applause, and cries of "yes."

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         Remember, it's not I who have won, 
                         but you. Your will is my strength, 
                         and your need is my justice, and I 
                         shall live in your right and your 
                         will. And if any man tries to stop

                         that will, I'll break him. I'll break 
                         him with my bare hands. For I have 
                         the strength of many.

               Having finished, he waves at them all. Then he notices Jack 
               and comes down the steps to greet him.

                         here. I knew you'd come back.

               He walks back up the steps, his arm around Jack's shoulders. 
               They start to go into the building that way when Willie sees 
               someone. He smiles and puts out his hand.

                         you.

               Adam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building. Before 
               Willie has taken a step Adam fires several shots into him. 
               Willie falls to the ground and Sugar Boy whips out his pistol 
               and fires at Adam. Three policemen with tommy guns open fire, 
               shooting into Adam's already fallen body. Then they turn and 
               point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward Willie, 
               forcing them back.

               Sugar Boy kneels beside Willie. Sadie stands against a pillar, 
               looking down on him.

               Jack looks up to see Anne struggling through the screaming 
               mob to get to Adam. She looks at Adam for a moment, then 
               turns away.

               She doesn't answer, only walks away. He runs after her and 
               catches hold of her arm.

                         people...

               He turns her around so that she can see the crowds still 
               struggling to get a look at Willie.

                         Willie the way Adam saw him, or 
                         there's no meaning in anything... 
                         anything.

               She nods her head slowly. Jack walks through the building to 
               the pillar against which Willie has been propped. Sugar Boy 
               is still beside him. He stands behind Sadie and Duffy, looking 
               down at Willie.
