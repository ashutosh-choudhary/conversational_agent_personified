</b>               From a secret island in the South Pacific, 
               the courageous Tracy family run an organization               
               called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere 
               in the world, they are always first on the
               scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, 
               the Thunderbirds.

               (Counts down numbers and shows corresponding
               Thunderbirds) Five, four, three, two, one. Thunderbirds are go!
 
               
               Cuts to live action, Alan Tracy is looking out a school window.
 
               
               
               But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind.
 
               
               
               
<b>                             TEACHER
</b>               So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus 
               B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what 
               happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E,
               F and... (Teacher notices Alan looking out window

               Alan's head jerks back from the window and to the teacher who 
               is now standing in front of him.
 
               
<b>                             TEACHER
</b>               How kind of you to come back from outer 
               space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't 
               too rough?
 
               (Chuckles sarcastically and continues sounding even more annoyed) 
               Here on Earth we've been discussing the Pythagorean
               theorem. Did any of that happen to sink in?

               which he has been doodling in) "Thunderbirds 
               are go."

               Well, I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring 
               break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk
               the day you get back. That should keep you busy.
 
               
               Bells rings dismissing the students and Alan and Fermat walk 
               out to their lockers.
