<b>                                                       FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. CUMBERLAND, RHODE ISLAND HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING
</b>
It's the early 1980's and everyone is arriving at school. We push
through the parking lot crowd to a nervous, lanky kid, TED
<b>PELOQUIN.
</b>
<b>                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>           When I was sixteen years old I fell in
           love...

<u>CLOSE ON</u> - RENISE, a tough girl with stringy brown hair and a
shiny forehead, as she turns toward the camera.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Hey, Renise.

She barely looks at him as he approaches, just drags on her smoke.

<b>                        RENISE
</b>           Hey.

<b>                        TED
</b>           So what's up?

<b>                        RENISE
</b>           Eh.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Great. Great.
                 (beat)
           So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you
           wanted to go to the prom you know, with
           me.

Renise looks unenthused.

                        TED (cont'd)
           It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you
           want.

<b>                        RENISE
</b>           See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that
           this guy I like was gonna ask me.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Uh-huh.

<b>                        RENISE
</b>           Yeah, so...I'm gonna wait and see what
           happens there...But that sounds great,
           yeah.

Ted nods, confused.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Okay.
                 (beat)
           So is that a yes or a no?

<b>                        RENISE
</b>           I think I was very clear, Ted. If
           everything else falls apart, maybe.

Renise throws down her butt and storms off.

<b>                        TED
</b>           I'm gonna hold you to that.

<b>                                                        CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT
</b>
<u>ANGLE ON</u> - a pretty girl, MARY, climbing off a ten-speed in the
school parking lot. She's athletic and tanned and doesn't have a
bad bone in her body.

<b>                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>           Her name was Mary. She'd moved to our
           little Rhode Island town from Minnesota two
           years earlier.

She locks up the bike and starts walking toward the school.

<b>                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>           Mary was very smart, and very cool, and she
           had a faceful of eyes that promised you a
           better life if you could only know her.

As she approaches the camera, we PAN to see Ted watching her. He's
sitting on a picnic table with two FRIENDS.

<b>                        FRIEND #1
</b>           Hey, dirtbud, who you going to the prom
           with?

Finally Ted takes his eyes off Mary.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Ah, I don't know if I'm even gonna. You
           know, not my style.

<b>                        FRIEND #2
</b>           You have a style?

<b>                        FRIEND #1
</b>           Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?

<b>                        TED
</b>                 (perks up)
           Who?

Friend #1 makes a jerk-off motion.

<b>                        FRIEND #1
</b>           Rosey Palm, your girlfriend. God knows you
           spend enough fucking time with her.

The guys LAUGH.

<b>                        TED
</b>                 (out of ammo but doesn't
                  know it)
           Yeah, and who are you gonna take, your own
           palm?

His friends stare at him.

<b>                        FRIEND #1
</b>           Clever. I like the way you just spun that
           around on me.

Friend #2 notices Mary talking to her FRIENDS.

<b>                        FRIEND #2
</b>           I wonder who she's going with.

<b>                        FRIEND #1
</b>           Some guy named Woogie.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Who?

<b>                        FRIEND #1
</b>           Big guy--goes to Barrington high school.

This irks Ted.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like
           a loser.

<b>                        FRIEND #1
</b>           Loser? Woogie was all-state football and
           and basketball and valedictorian of his
           class.

<b>                        FRIEND #2
</b>           I heard he got a scholarship to Princeton
           but he's going to Europe first to model.

This takes the wind out of Ted's sails.

<b>                        FRIEND #3
</b>           Yeah and he's got a huge cock.

Everyone looks at him.

                        FRIEND #3 (cont'd)
           I heard.

Suddenly Friend #1 NOTICES something.

<b>                        FRIEND #1
</b>           Hey, check it out.

<u>THEIR POV</u> - A large, goofy YOUNG MAN with an unfashionable
crewcut comes walking up the street. He's in his early twenties
and though the weather is mild he's WEARING EARMUFFS. He
approaches a GROUP OF KIDS sitting on a car hood.

<b>                        EAR-MUFF GUY
</b>           You seen my baseball?

<b>                        CAR HOOD KID #2
</b>           No.

The kids watch as the Ear-Muff Guy approaches another group.

<b>                        EAR-MUFF GUY
</b>           You seen my baseball?

<b><u>ON CAR HOOD KIDS
</u></b>
<b>                        CAR HOOD KID #1
</b>                 (to his buddies)
           This guy must be in the 'tard squad.
                 (to Ear-Muff Guy)
           Hey, buddy, come here, I think I know where
           your ball is.

The Ear-Muff Guy heads back to the car.

<b>                        EAR-MUFF GUY
</b>           You seen my baseball?

<b>                        CAR HOOD KID #1
</b>           Yeah, I seen it. That girl over there, she
           has it.

Car Hood Kid #1 points to a BUSTY GIRL leaning against another car
talking to her large BOYFRIEND.

                        CAR HOOD KID #2 (cont'd)
           'Cept she doesn't call it a baseball. She
           has another name for it...

<b>                                                       CUT TO:
</b>
<u>ON BUSTY GIRL</u> - The Ear-Muff Guy marches up to her and her
boyfriend.

<b>                        EAR-MUFF GUY
</b>           You seen my pecker?

<b>                        GIRL
</b>           What?!

<b>                        EAR-MUFF GUY
</b>           You seen my pecker?

The Boyfriend grabs him by the collar.

<b>                        BOYFRIEND
</b>           You son-of-a-bitch, I'll kick your ass!

The Boyfriend throws the Ear-Muff Guy to the ground and is about
to pummel him when Ted intervenes.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Take it easy, Smokey.

<b>                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
</b>           This fucking pervert just came on to Nance!

<b>                        TED
</b>           All right, just be cool.
                 (under breath)
           He looks like he's not all there, you know
           what I mean?

A crowd starts to gather which only incites Smokey more.

<b>                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
</b>           Get the fuck out of my way, man!

Smokey tosses Ted out of the way and moves toward the Ear-Muff
Guy. Just then Mary shows up and steps between them.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           What's going on here?

She bends down and helps the Ear-Muff Guy off the ground.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Are you all right?

<b>                        EAR-MUFF GUY
</b>           Mary, you seen my baseball?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           No, I haven't seen your baseball. Jeez,
           Warren, you know you're not supposed to
           leave the yard by yourself.

<b>                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
</b>                 (to Mary)
           You know him?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           He's my brother.

<b>                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
</b>           Oh.
                 (beat)
           I didn't realize he was...you know...

At this, Smokey and his girlfriend reluctantly head toward the
school, along with most of the crowd.

Mary turns her attention in the direction Ted was thrown.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           You okay?

<u>HER POV</u> - Ted is sitting in a mud puddle. He stands and brushes
himself off.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Oh yeah. Fine.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Thanks a lot, Ted.

<u>CLOSE ON</u> - Ted. He can't believe what he's just heard. As Mary
helps him up, she turns her attention to Warren.

<b>                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>           That she knew my name blew my mind. Some of
           my best friends didn't know my name.

<b>EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING
</b>
Mary and a muddied Ted are walking Warren home. Warren lags
behind, mumbling to himself. Mary notices that Ted is limping.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt
           yourself?

<b>                        TED
</b>           No, it's an old football injury.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Oh, are you on the team?

<b>                        TED
</b>           No, a couple of the players and me were
           joking around and, uh, I fell off the
           school.

Warren approaches and motions for Ted to hop on his back.

<b>                        WARREN
</b>           Piggyback ride?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Warren, come on, leave Ted alone.

Warren pats his back again.

<b>                        WARREN
</b>           Piggyback ride.

<b>                        TED
</b>                 (to Mary)
           I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Oh he can hold you. He weighs
           two-hundred-and-thirty pounds.

<b>                        TED
</b>           A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?

Ted hops onto Warren's back.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Giddy-up.

Warren walks about five feet and stops.

<b>                        WARREN
</b>           My turn now.

Off Ted's reaction, we

<b>                                                       CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT . MARY'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Muddy sweat is running down Ted's face as he struggles up a hill
with Warren on his back.

<b>                        TED
</b>                 (straining)
           We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?

<b>                        WARREN
</b>           Giddy-up.

Ted rolls his eyes and continues toward the front door. Mary looks
on, amused.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           So who you taking to the prom?

<b>                        TED
</b>           Huh?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           The prom--you going?

<b>                        TED
</b>           Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty
           dumb.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go
           if you weren't already taking someone.

<b>                        TED
</b>           I mean dumb in the sense that they only
           happen once a year.

She smiles at this.

<b>                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
</b>           From that moment on the guys at school
           looked at me in a whole new light.

<b>EXT. CUMBERLAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
<u>PULLBACK TO REVEAL</u> - Ted is leaning against his locker
surrounded by a group of guys.

<b>                        FRIEND #2
</b>           You expect us to believe you're going to
           the prom with Mary? What about Woogie?

<b>                        TED
</b>           They broke up. She said he started getting
           weird on her.

<b>                        FRIEND #1
</b>           I got twenty bucks says you're full of
           shit.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Oh come on, why would I lie?

<b>                        FRIEND #1
</b>           Because you're a loser, and in some warped
           way this gives you a momentary sense of
           worth.

<b>                        FRIEND #2
</b>           Put me down for fifty.

<b>                        FRIEND #3

As the others join in, we

<b>EXT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT
</b>
A tuxedoed and smiling Ted drives up in his parent's station
wagon.

<b>EXT. MARY' S FRONT DOOR - TWILIGHT
</b>
Ted knocks on the door and Mary's gruff DAD answers.

<b>                        MARY'S DAD
</b>           Yeah? What do you want?

<b>                        TED
</b>           Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take
           Mary to the prom.

<b>                        MARY'S DAD
</b>           Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She
           just left for the prom with her boyfriend
           Woogie.

Ted looks devastated. Suddenly the door swings open revealing
<b>MARY'S MOM.
</b>
<b>                        MARY'S MOM
</b>           Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted.
           Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a
           joke a minute.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Oh.
                 (relieved)
           Oh, that's a good one.

<b>INT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT
</b>Ted nervously enters and sees Warren watching T.V. in the den.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Hey, Warren.

Warren doesn't look his way.

Just then Mary comes down the stairs looking as if the directors
had really taken their time casting this role. Ted can't believe
his eyes.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Hi, Ted.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Hi, Mary.

<b>                        MARY'S MOM
</b>           Poor Teddy--he's been getting it both
           barrels from the Wisenheimer here.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Dad, have you been busting Ted's chops?

Mary's Dad shrugs.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Warren, did you say hi to Ted?

<b>                        WARREN

           'Bout ten times.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Hey, Warren, I think I know where your
           baseball is.

This finally gets Warren's attention.

<b>                        WARREN
</b>           You seen my baseball?

We see Ted discreetly pull a BRAND NEW BASEBALL out of his pocket
and palm it in his hand.

Ted is reaching behind Warren's ear when suddenly Warren TAKES A
SWIPE AT HIM, knocking him to the ground.

Ted HITS HIS HEAD on the coffee table.

<u>ON THE BASEBALL</u> - as it rolls under the couch, stopping right
next to the OTHER MISSING BALL.

<u>BACK TO SCENE</u> - In a split second, Warren is up like a cat and
DIVES ONTO TED. As MARY AND HER PARENTS SCREAM, Ted manages to
free himself from the disabled man's clutches and GETS WARREN IN A

The family jumps on Warren and finally break it up.

</b>           There was a ball I had a honest.

As Mary helps Ted up, we see that his shirttail is out and his tie
is hanging off. Mary's parents lead the frothing Warren back to
the couch.

                        MARY (to Ted)
           I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a

           I have to iron this thing.

Ted starts to tuck his pants in as Mary and her mother head back
up the stairs. Mary's Dad and Ted are left alone. And Warren.

Ted rubs his head, sees a spot of blood.

Ted dabs his head with a tissue, then moves to the toilet. As he

Ted smiles...

song for themselves, for the spring, for Ted and Mary, and
suddenly they fly away and we...

<u>Ted has been telling all this to no one</u>.

                 (sighs)
           I never did see Mary again. That was about
           twelve years ago.

Just then the door quietly opens and Ted's PSYCHIATRIST tip-toes
back into the room and takes his seat. (He has a dab of mustard on
his chin and has forgotten about the cloth napkin tucked into his
collar.)

</b>           Anyway, it's not something you exactly
           forget about, but I guess I must've blocked
           it out of my head. Then about a week ago
           I'm driving on the highway and I got to
           thinking about Mary and suddenly I couldn't
           breathe...I couldn't keep up with the flow
           of traffic anymore I felt like I was
           going to die. I pulled into a rest area,
           parked the car, and just started shaking.

The Psychiatrist scratches his chin.

little embarrassed.

           Anyway, they were going to let him go but
           his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that

           Seemed like a sweet lady--got diabetes or

           him transferred down to Providence.

sips.

her. She cranks the music even LOUDER. Mary hops out of bed,
wearing only her panties, and though she's a little older now, she
still looks well cast.

</b>           Have you been up all night again?

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Bet your ass I have. It's an important job,
           Neighborhood Watch is.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call
           listening in on stranger's phone
           conversations?

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           These ain't strangers, they're <u>neighbors</u>.
           This only picks up signals in a half-mile
           radius.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Meaning?

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Meaning these are the people you live
           amongst, you got a right to know if they're
           creeps. For instance, did you know there's
           a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?

<b>                        MARY
</b>                 (feigning shock)
           You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta
           move.

<b>                        MAGDA 
</b>           I <u>confirmed</u> it on the scanner. I knew
           something was up because Puffy used to bark
           like hell whenever he saw him and you know
           Puffy only barks at bad people.

Magda pats her little dog PUFFY on the head.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           That's because there's a lot of bad people
           out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you
           about that Steve guy you was seeing--he was
           a fucking asswipe--but you had to find out
           for yourself, didn't you?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep,
           huh.

Mary gives Magda a kiss and heads to her bedroom.

<u>MUSIC MONTAGE</u> - as Healy follows Mary around town.

<b>EXT. EUCLID AVENUE - MORNING
</b>
Mary exits her apartment and bounces out into the world. There is
a HOMELESS MAN sitting on the sidewalk. Mary flips him an apple,
then jumps in her Honda Civic and drives off.

<b>EXT. DRIVING RANGE - MORNING
</b>
Mary is at the range HITTING a couple buckets of balls.

           Looks like we got an athlete on our hands.

<b>EXT. MACDONALD'S DRIVE-THRU WINDOW - MORNING
</b>
Mary waits in the drive-thru lane reading the SPORTS PAGE. Finally
the window opens and she is handed a HUGE BAG OF FOOD.

<u>PAN TO</u> Healy watching from his car.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>                 (into mic)
           Well, from her figure and her appetite, I'm
           guessing she's either got a bowel disorder
           or we've got a hurler on our hands.

<b>EXT. SPECIAL ED. CENTER - MORNING
</b>
Mary's brother Warren is wearing a walkman as he plays catch out
front with a SPECIAL ED TEACHER while several other
MENTALLY-DISABLED PATIENTS entertain themselves.

Mary pulls up, gets out, and starts handing out Egg McMuffins.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Get in line. One at a time.

A fat patient, GARY, approaches.

<b>                        GARY
</b>           Can I have two, Mary?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Yeah, you can have two halves, just like
           everyone else.

<b>                        GARY
</b>           Thanks.

Gary takes his and walks off. A couple more patients and then
bucktoothed FREDDIE steps up to her.

<b>                        FREDDIE
</b>           Will you marry me, Mary?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Oh yeah, pretty boy? And what about
           Dolores?

Mary points to another PATIENT staring bashfully at Freddie.

<b>                        FREDDIE
</b>           Would you marry us both, Mary?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Yeah, that'd be a good deal for you,
           wouldn't it?

Freddie moves off and fat Gary is back, trying to be
inconspicuous.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Wow, this is weird. There was somebody who
           looked just like you here a minute ago.

Mary smiles and hands Gary another McMuffin.

<b>EXT. BEACH BAR - DAY
</b>
Neighborhood restaurant and bar. After-work crowd. Mary and her
friends, BRENDA, LISA, and JOANIE are sitting at a table under an
umbrella. Lisa reads from the PERSONALS COLUMN in <u>South Beach
Magazine</u>.

<b>                        LISA
</b>           Listen to this one--'Seeking sensitive Wasp

           walks in Coconut Grove, marriage.'

<b>                        BRENDA
</b>           What does this girl want, a corpse? You
           gotta be more specific: 'Seeking deaf mute
           with three pound cock and trust fund.'

<b>                        JOANIE
</b>           No, it should be 'a hockey player with
           great pecs.'

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those
           guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana
           hammock.

<u>PAN TO</u> the bar where we see Healy eavesdropping on their
conversation.

<b>                        BRENDA (O.S.)
</b>                 (to Mary)
           I suppose you wouldn't like someone with a
           washboard stomach like Brad Pitt?

BACK ON Mary and friends.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a
           bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy.
           You can have those pretty boys who hang out
           in a gym all day staring at their
           reflections.

<u>BACK ON</u> Mary and friends.

<b>                        JOANIE
</b>           I can live with those reflections.

<b>                        MARY 
</b>           I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies.
           Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer
           and playing thirty-six holes and still has
           enough energy to take me and Warren out to
           a ballgame.

<b>                        JOANIE
</b>                 (sarcastic)
           Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going
           to find a guy like that.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking
           about has got to be self-employed.

<b>                        LISA
</b>           You mean, like an architect or something?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Architect, yeah.

BRENDA You mean creative, but not poor.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           No, it's not the money. Creative, yeah,
           that's good, but it's the freedom I'm
           talking about. See, this guy has to have a
           job he could do anywhere. That way we could
           just up and leave at the drop of a hat.

<b>                        LISA
</b>           And where would you and your beer-bellied
           architect be leaving to?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           I don't know. The Super Bowl, New Orleans
           Jazz Festival...maybe a couple months in
           Nepal.

<b>                        JOANIE
</b>           Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy
           halfway to Katmandu.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           What's that supposed to mean?

<b>                        JOANIE
</b>           It means you're too hard on guys.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           No I'm not.

<b>                        JOANIE
</b>           Oh come off it, Mare. What about
           what's-his-name...Steverino? You could've
           at least passed the baton on that one.

The girls LAUGH.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for
           awhile.

<b>                        JOANIE
</b>           All right for awhile? The guy's
           good-looking, rich, witty. He was a god.

<b>                        LISA
</b>           At one point you were talking about
           marrying him. Come on, why'd you dump him?

Mary thinks about this.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           I don't know, it was complicated. He's in
           San Francisco, I'm in Miami.
                 (dodging question)
           Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.

<b>                        JOANIE
</b>           Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you
           said you were putting her up for a
           month--it's been a year and a half.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Ah, she's okay.

<b>                        LISA
</b>           Mary, cut the crap, what really happened
           with Steve?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Nothing. I mean, you know my brother.
                 (sighs)
           Warren.

<b>                        JOANIE
</b>           What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           I don't want someone who'll <u>put up</u> with
           him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the
           way I do. Do you know what he told my
           friend Tucker? He said he would've popped
           the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't
           in my life.
                 (beat)
           Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn
           lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.

Everyone is touched by this. Then:

<b>                        BRENDA
</b>           Well, that's the last time I blow <u>him

<b>EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Healy sits out front in his car again waiting for Mary to get
home. He picks up the phone, dials a number, and someone answers
but doesn't speak.

           there?

<b>INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Sully is sitting on the kitchen floor in his police uniform, a
ring of white around his nostrils. The room is littered with beer
cans, he has another one in his hand, there's a pile of cocaine
and a rolled-up bill on the breakfast table. The dog and the snake
are in the doorway looking at him with concern.

<b>                        SULLY

           hell are ya?!

<b>INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

Healy looks at the phone, concerned.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know
           I'll have your car back in a couple hours,

<b>                        SULLY (V.O.)

Just then Healy notices Mary pull up and park. He slides down in
his seat.

<u>ON MARY</u> - she gets out carrying a bag and approaches the
Homeless Man, who is still sitting on the sidewalk. She hands him
the bag.

<b>                        HOMELESS MAN

out of the bag.

<b>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Mary rushes into the apartment, Magda is glued to her radio

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this--some

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Ah, Christ, I lost 'em.

just as <u>ESPN Sportscenter's</u> OPENING THEME SONG is playing.

Ted looks completely drained.

           bookie--nice guy. You should definitely
           call her, Ted. I mean she's a real
           sparkplug, that one. She seems determined
           to get those rugrats off welfare and with
           your help I'll bet she does it.

Ted stands and starts moping away.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Thanks, Healy. Good work.

<b>                        HEALY

As Ted leaves, Healy puts his feet up on the table and sits back.

<b>INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
We PAN across the room of unopened boxes to Ted laying awake in
bed. We hear HEAD-BANGER MUSIC coming from the apartment next
door. Finally Ted gets up and walks over to his dresser. As he
flips on a small light we see loose change, a balled-up Kleenex, a
few golf tees, and Ted's wallet. Ted picks up the wallet and opens
it.

<u>TED'S POV</u> - Inside is an an old high school photo of a smiling
Mary.

As Ted looks at it, he can't help but smile, too.

<b>INT. PROVIDENCE UNION INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY
</b>
<u>ON HEALY'S CUBICLE</u> - Healy's taking his last boxload of crap out
of his cubicle when he spots Ted. He tries to duck back in but
Ted sees him. Healy forces a smile as Ted approaches.

Healy starts walking out of the office and Ted follows. Healy is
having a hard time looking him in the eye. So he doesn't.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Look, uh, I've been thinking about

Ted SIGHS and follows Healy out the front door.

They walk across the lot toward Healy's car.

<b>                        TED
</b>           All the same, I still want to call her. I
           know it sounds crazy--Mary sure has a lot
           of troubles in her life--but, I don't know,
           maybe I can help her out.
                 (sighs)
           The poor thing's had it tough--she's in a
           wheelchair for Godsakes.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.

                 (beat)
           That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't
           make any sense to you, but I just can't
           turn it off that fast. I still feel
           something for her.

Healy comes to his car and puts his stuff in the trunk.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number
           for you just as soon as she gets back from
           Japan.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           You've heard of mail-order brides? Well
           they go that way, too.

Ted is devastated.

<b>                        HEALY

Healy pays for a bucket of balls, then takes his clubs and strolls
jauntily to...

<b><u>A GOLF TEE NEXT TO MARY'S

Healy places a ball on the tee and takes a swing. He tops the ball
and it dribbles about ten yards.

                 (to Mary)
           Haven't swung the wrenches in a while.

Mary nods. Healy takes another swing and duck-hooks one about
fifty yards. Mary addresses her ball, takes a smooth backswing,
and

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Hey, can you give me some tips here?

She cracks her shot long and straight.

<b>                        HEALY

Mary tees up another ball and Healy puts down his club.

           You know, I should just get going. I'll

ever see this guy again?

                 (CALLS after him)
           It was nice meeting you!

Healy doesn't answer or turn around. He just raises his hand and
gives her a little wave.

Mary shrugs her shoulders. Oh well...

<b>EXT. DRIVING RANGE PARKING LOT - DAY

Healy is sitting in Sully's Chrysler LeBaron, right next to Mary's
Honda Civic.

He watches the rear-view mirror, and the moment he sees Mary
coming out from the driving range, he swings his legs out the door
and starts changing out of his golf shoes. As Mary tosses her
golf bag into the trunk, she notices Healy tying his shoes. A
second chance.

usual questions?

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           It's right there on your golf bag.

Healy opens the back door to put away his golf shoes. Suddenly,
rolls and rolls of paper come tumbling out. Mary bends over to
help Healy pick them up.

<b>                        MARY

Mary stares at him, mouth agape.

Healy tiptoes up to Mary's apartment door. He peeks through the
mail slot.

<u>HEALY'S POV</u> - Puffy is staring at him and GROWLING.

Healy reaches in his pocket, pulls out a VALIUM and a DOGGY TREAT.
Healy shoves the pill into the treat's soft center, examines it,
then thinks what the hell and SHOVES IN ANOTHER ONE.

Puffy GROWLS LOUDER. Healy pops the treat through the mail slot
and listens as the dog DEVOURS IT. Healy looks at his watch, then
sneaks back outside to wait a few minutes for the drugs to kick
in.

in amazement.

           ...who love him a lot, too...and so on.'

Magda stares dreamily at Healy, smitten.

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Oh, yeah, of course, dear.

The two women go into the kitchen and Healy is left to pet the
MOTIONLESS DOG. Suddenly Healy notices that the dog is A LITTLE
TOO MOTIONLESS. Healy checks Puffy's pulse. He looks at his watch
to time the rate.

He starts SHAKING THE DOG, but Puffy doesn't move. Healy goes into
action. He starts pressing on his heart, PERFORMING DOGGIE CPR.
One-and-two-and-three, he continues trying to revive him.

           find some cookies.

As Magda starts to go through the cupboards...

           Come on, man, stay away from the light!

Healy resumes blowing into the dog's snout, pumping his chest,
with no results. Desperate, he picks up the cheese knife and
quickly SLICES THE WIRES ON TWO TABLE LAMPS.

Healy grabs the two wires and TOUCHES THEM TOGETHER LIKE A
DEFIBRILLATOR on the little pooch's chest.

<u>ZZZZZTTTTTT</u> - the dog BOUNCES a couple feet off the couch as
<b>SPARKS FLY.
</b>
Healy takes his pulse again. Nothing. He ZAPS him once more with
the LIVE WIRES.

<u>ZZZZZTTTTT</u> - Still nothing. Healy gets to his feet and peeks
into the kitchen. When he turns his back, we see PUFFY IGNITE IN
<b>FLAMES.
</b>
When Healy turns back, he's horrified at what he sees. He grabs a
vase of flowers and POURS THE WATER ON THE BURNING DOG.

With this, Puffy flinches and comes to, GASPING FOR AIR!

</b>           All I had was some Funny Bones--how does

Healy picks up the stunned pooch and swaddles it in a blanket as
Magda ENTERS the room followed by Mary.

Mary points to an architectural model.

           concern yourself with the pieces--look at
           the building in its totalitarianism.

Mary gives him a look. Suddenly, Healy draws a couple of invisible
sixshooters at her.

           Stone crab time! Come on, let's get outta

He turns to go but Mary notices something O.S.

Mary leads Healy over to her friend TUCKER, a
distinguished-looking man in his fifties. Healy looks like a dog
that's being dragged to the vet. Mary and Tucker embrace.

Mary LAUGHS and hugs Tucker tighter. Then:

</b>           Tucker, this is my friend Pat Healy.
           Healy and Tucker shake hands.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Uh, sort of nouveau deco...with a big

Tucker starts to look a little suspicious.

<b>                        TUCKER

He has a cup of coffee in his hand and a HITCHHIKER in the seat
beside him. The Hitchhiker sits with a LARGE RED DUFFEL BAG
between his legs.

</b>           I know how you feel--I been standing in the
           same spot for the last five hours. You know
           it's against the law to pick up a
           hitchhiker in this state.

<b>                        TED
</b>           That must make it tough.

As they grab Ted and the others and hustle them away, we

unfold.

The Hitchhiker is clearly PANICKY at the sight of all the cops.

Healy and Mary are walking home at the end of their date. Healy is
eating a big, wild cone of COTTON CANDY and drinking a beer.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           That grandmother of yours--she's really
           something.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Magda? She's not my grandmother--actually
           she rents the apartment right next to mine.
           Her husband passed away a couple years ago
           so she doesn't like to be alone.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           And it doesn't cramp your style?

<b>                    MARY
</b>               Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Lint?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running
           around on the rug all day--just makes for a
           lot of lint. Look at this...

Mary lifts her shirt, revealing a BIG CLUMP OF COTTON CANDY
<b>STICKING OUT OF HER BELLY-BUTTON.
</b>
                        MARY (cont'd)
           See? That's just one day.

Healy CRACKS UP and then gazes at her. What a babe.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           You know, sometimes I wish I could be like
           Magda and not go home. I'd like to just
           bounce around for awhile, do a little
           traveling...

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Why bounce when you have your own condo in
           Nepal to go to?

It's clear Healy forgot about that one.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new
           place, quit the architect game, slow things
           down, read more books, see more movies...

<b>                        MARY
</b>           You're a movie buff?

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Try to be. It's tough going with the crap
           they make today. If <u>Dumb and Dumber</u>'s the
           best they've got to offer I say thanks but
           no thanks.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Have you seen it?

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr
           hated it.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           A fucking moron.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Huh. I guess I just wish they made them
           like they used to. You know, something like
           <u>The Heartbreak Kid</u>...or <u>Harold and
</u>           <u>Maude</u>.

Mary can't believe her ears.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           <u>Harold and Maude</u> is my all-time favorite
           movie.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know
           it's corny, but I do love it.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's
           the greatest--

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           --Love story of our time.

Mary smiles. Is this guy for real?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Yeah.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Wow. I thought I was the only one.

They come to her apartment building and stop. It gets a little
awkward.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           So...

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Yeah...I guess this is it, huh?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           I guess.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Well, I'll see ya.

Healy turns to go but stops.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Mary ah, forget it.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           What?

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           No, forget it, it was stupid.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Come on, what were you going to say?

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Nah, really, it was moronic.

She grabs him by the shirt playfully.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           <u>Just say it.

</u>Healy takes a deep breath.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Could I feel your bosoms before I go?

Mary just stares at him.

                        MARY (beat)
           Knock yourself out.

Healy reaches out and cups her breasts. He doesn't kiss her, she
doesn't kiss him, he just fondles her breasts. Then:

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Okey-dokey, so tomorrow night?

She smiles and as Healy walks away we

<b>                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
</b>           That's probably how he got the victim to
           drop his guard. 

<b>                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
</b>           Where'd they find the body?

<b>                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
</b>           In a big red bag on the front passenger
           seat. All hacked up--fucking gruesome--a
           real psycho, this one.

The Detectives ENTER the room.

<b>INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Ted stands as the Detectives take a seat across from him.

</b>                 (agitated)
           I'm telling you, I did not solicit sex! I

</b>           Okay, calm down, Ted, we believe you.
                 (beat)
           The problem is we found your <u>friend</u> in
           the car.

As Ted sits back down the Detectives just stare at him. Finally
Ted thinks he gets it.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Oh. The hitchhiker.
<b>                 (CHUCKLES)
</b>           That's what this is all about.

Ted puts his head in his hands and smiles.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Isn't that just my luck--I get caught for
           everything.

<b>                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
</b>           So you admit it?

</b>           Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games
           with you. I could give you a song and dance
           but what's the point? I did it and we all
           know it.
                 (laughs)
           The hitcher himself told me it's
           illegal The irony.

The Detectives are surprised by his forthrightness.

<b>                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
</b>           Well, uh, can you tell us his name?

<b>                        TED
</b>           Jeez, I didn't catch it.

The Detectives flinch at his glib demeanor.

<b>                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
</b>           So he was a stranger? It was totally
           random?

<b>                        TED
</b>                 (confused)
           He was the first hitcher I saw, what can I
           tell you? Now cut to the chase, how much
           trouble am I in? 

The Detectives look at one another. 

<b>                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
</b>           First tell us why you did it.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Why I did it?
                 (scoffs)
           I don't know. Boredom? I thought I was
           doing the guy a favor.

The Detectives look at each other.

<b>                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
</b>           This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted?

<b>EXT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Mary pulls up in her Honda Civic. She parks out front and enters
the building.

<u>PAN ACROSS THE STREET TO REVEAL</u> - Healy is parked in his car.
His surveillance equipment is pointed toward Mary's office.

<b>INT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING
</b>
Mary walks into the office and sees a MEDICAL ASSISTANT standing
near the coffee maker.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Mornin', Jane.

<b>                        MEDICAL ASSISTANT #1
</b>           Good morning, Doctor. Your friend Tucker's
           in your office to see you. 

Mary nods and heads toward her office. 

<b>INT. MARY'S OFFICE - SAME
</b>
Mary walks into her office and sees Tucker seated at her desk.
(SHOT FROM behind Tucker so we only see the back of his head.)

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           What's up, Doc?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Tucker, you look different some how. Did
           you do something with your hair?

<u>MARY'S POV</u> - Tucker's got two TONGUE DEPRESSORS under his upper
lip making him look like a walrus.

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           The teeth, the teeth. I got 'em capped.

<u>ON MARY</u> - smiles.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Oh yeah, they look great.

<b>INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME
</b>
He's got his listening gun fixed on Mary's office.

<b>                        TUCKER (V.O.)
</b>           You don't think they're too big?

<b>                        MARY (V.O.)
</b>           No no, the bigger the better.
                 (beat)
           But I must say, they could be a little
           brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful
           of pearly whites.

Healy looks at his teeth in the mirror. Not exactly pearly.

<b>INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Tucker pulls the tongue depressors out of his teeth and laughs. He
stands up, and when Mary tries to squeeze past him he gives her a
kiss on the cheek.

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           You ever been laid in this office?

Mary pushes past him.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Behave yourself, Tucker.
                 (smiles)
           Come on, what are you doing here?

She sits in her chair and leans against her desk.

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           I wanted to talk to you about your friend
           Patrick.

Healy almost flies out of his seat.

<b>                        MARY (O.S.)
</b>           He's a nice guy, isn't he?

<b>                        TUCKER (O.S.)
</b>           Well that's what I'm trying to figure
           out. How long have you known him?

<b>INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Tucker has a look of concern.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Not long at all, but I really like him.
                 (off Tucker's look)
           Okay, I know he's a little different,
           Tucker, but that's what I like about him.
           He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a
           dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always
           politically correct and he probably farts,
           too. And that's okay with me.

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           That's what you've been looking for--a
           farter?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           I've been looking for a <u>guy</u>--not one of
           these South Beach pussies.

</b><b>                 (SIGHS)
</b>           Look, it's just that something about him
           struck me as odd last night. He gave me
           this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some
           friends back east. They don't know of any
           architect named Patrick Healy and he's not
           listed as a Harvard alumnus.

Healy SLAMS his hand on the steering wheel.

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't
           think I'm being meddlesome. I just think
           you should be careful with this guy.

<b>                        MARY
</b>                 (concerned)
           No no no, Tucker, thank you.

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           I mean let's face it, Mary, you're
           beautiful, you've got money, you trust
           people--I'm just saying, there's a lot of
           psychos out there.

remorseful- looking partner Cavallo stands behind him.

being spooned by a 300-pound SLEEPING INMATE.

The two Detectives and an apoplectic Ted walk down the hallway.

</b>           At exactly 10:48 this morning a man was
           apprehended not far from where you were
           arrested. He was identified as an escaped
           mental patient and subsequently confessed
           to the murder that you were being held for.
           Lab tests confirmed a fingerprint match on

Detective Cavallo stops and holds out his hand.

Still traumatized, Ted shakes the man's hand, then mopes toward
the door.

           years.

           <u>everything</u>! The landlord said when he got
           back from Miami he kept talking about
           falling for some doctor named Mary!

Ted is stunned.

Magda turns up the volume on her scanner and we can clearly hear

--Healy shows up at Mary's door sporting a set of OVERSIZED
INCREDIBLY-WHITE CAPPED TEETH. He gives her a big horse smile and
she reacts uncertainly.

--Healy is in Mary's apartment as Mary finishes dressing for a
night on the town.

<b>                        MARY

</b>           You look great.
                 (beat)
           Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of
           these pants?

When she puts her head close to inspect his pants, he lets fly a
THUNDEROUS FART. She pulls her head away, repulsed, but Healy just
<b>LAUGHS.
</b>
--Mary and and the horse-toothed Healy are having dinner in a
romantic restaurant. As he eats he tells an animated story but
he's having trouble with the new choppers and chunks of food are
spraying out of his mouth with every word. Mary has to BOB AND
WEAVE to avoid being covered with debris.

--Healy and Warren are playing monopoly. When Warren isn't
looking, Healy cheats and puts a couple hotels on Boardwalk. In
the b.g. we see one of Warren's buddies fall out of a palm tree.

<b>EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
A lovesick Healy is mauling Mary out on the sidewalk in front
while Warren stands off to the side LISTENING TO A WALKMAN.

<u>REVERSE ANGLE</u> reveals a devastated Ted and Dom watching this
from Ted's car.

<b>                        TED

                 (sighs)

           back down now. Get over there and do
           something--I can't stand watching this.

has to break it off.

</b>           Whoa, whoa, how's my stomach taste?

Healy LAUGHS.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           How's my stomach taste, she says.
                 (shakes head)
           Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab,
           Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like
           a dog.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Forget it. It was...fun.

Ted recognizes Warren.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Holy shit, there's Warren.

<b><u>BACK ON MARY. HEALY, AND WARREN

Suddenly we see Warren PERK UP at something.

<b>                        WARREN
</b>           Franks and beans!

<b><u>ON TED AND DOM
</u></b>
<b>                        TED

</u></b>
<b>                        WARREN

<b>                        MARY

           appetite.

           Am I right?

Healy winks at Mary.

<b>                        WARREN
</b>           Huh?

Healy reaches over and lifts a headphone off Warren's ear.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           I said you've got a big app--

Suddenly Warren SUCKER-PUNCHES HEALY IN THE THROAT.

                        HEALY (cont'd)

<b>                        DOM
</b>           Attaboy!

<u>BACK ON MARY et al</u> - Healy holds his throat, clearly in pain.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Are you okay?

                        HEALY (cont'd)

           Sure.

Mary watches with a look of concern as Healy gets in his car and
drives off.

<b><u>ON TED AND DOM
</u></b>
Ted stares gazily.

<b>                        DOM
</b>           Well? What are you waiting for?

<b>                        TED

<b>                        DOM
</b>           Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the
           schmuck out of the water.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on
           her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.
                 (stares at Mary)
           She's even more beautiful than I remember.

<u>THEIR POV</u> - Mary and Warren start to go in the apartment.

<b>                        DOM
</b>           Get over there, you pussy! She's leaving!

Suddenly Dom HONKS THE HORN, then ducks down. Mary turns around
and sees Ted.

<b>                        TED

</b>                 (squinting)
           Who's that?

Ted gets out of the car and hustles across the street toward Mary.

<b>                        TED
</b>           It is you! It's me...Ted. From Rhode
           Island Ted.

Finally she recognizes him.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Oh my God...Ted.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Yup, that's right. Junior prom...kinda.

<b>                        MARY

<b>                        TED
</b>           Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.

Mary LAUGHS.

                        TED (cont'd)
           How are you doing, Warren?

<b>                        WARREN

Mary is stunned.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           I can't believe he remembered you. He never
           remembers anybody.
                 (beat)
           You know I tried to call you for weeks
           after that.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Really? I never got a message.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           That's weird. I talked to your brother
           Jimmy five or six times.

Ted is devastated to hear this.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           By the way, how's he doing?

<b>                        TED
</b>           He's dead.

<b>                        MARY
</b>                 (taken aback)
           Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.

<b>                        TED
</b>                 (bitter)
           No, it was a good thing.
                 (off her look)
           I mean, good in that it was very quick.

Ted pantomimes an explosion.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Oh. So...what brings you down here?

<b>                        TED
</b>           Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of
           mine decided to...ah...you know...just
           ...drive down.

She stares at him.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Well you look great. Are you married, do
           you have kids?

<b>                        TED

                 (smiles)
           God, I cannot believe I'm standing here
           with Mary Jenson.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Actually, it's Mary <u>Brooks</u> now.

<b>                        TED
</b>                 (taken aback)
           Oh...are you...?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.
                 (off his look)
           There was this guy back in college who was
           bothering me...got kind of ugly--a
           restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway,
           when I got out of Princeton I changed my
           name as a precaution.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Jeez...that sounds awful. Hey, what do you
           say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up
           on old times?

<b>BEAT.
</b>
<b>                        MARY
</b>           Didn't we just do that?

Ted doesn't know how to respond to this and then she smiles.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but
           the thing is I already have plans. How
           about tomorrow night?

<b>                        TED
</b>           Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve
           years.
                 (beat)
           Don't make me wait another day.

Mary seems touched by this.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Tell me where you're staying. I'll pick you
           up at eight.

Ted finally smiles and we

<b>INT. HEALY'S CAR - TWILIGHT

A content Healy is parked out front of Mary's apartment, absently
listening to her spill her guts to Magda while he reads the
newspaper.

<b>                        MAGDA (V.O.)
</b>           I'm buying bananas tonight.

<b>                        MARY (V.O.)
</b>           Why?

<b>                        MAGDA (V.O.)
</b>           Back when I was your age I always used to
           make myself a big banana split after sex. I

<b>                        MARY (V.O.)
</b>           Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll
           probably need it before I will.

<b>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME
</b>
Mary is skipping around the apartment while Magda sits on the
couch.

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap
           smear the guy needed leather gloves and an
           oyster shucker.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to
           take you to the movies.

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're
           in love doesn't mean everyone else has to
           be.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this
           since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.

<u>BACK ON HEALY</u> - he's reveling in it all.

<b>                        MARY (V.O. )
</b>           Well I am pretty psyched. I ran into a
           guy today I hadn't seen since high school.

Healy loses the smile and sits up.

<b>                        MAGDA (V.O.)
</b>           An old flame?

<b>                        MARY (V.O.)
</b>           Kind of. Ted Peloquin--one of the sweetest
           guys in the world.

Healy TURNS UP THE VOLUME.

<b><u>ON MARY
</u></b>
                        MARY (cont'd)
           He was so shy and clumsy...I had a major
           crush on him.

<u>BACK ON HEALY</u> as he nearly puts his head through the roof. He
grabs hold of the steering wheel and pounds his head on it.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                        MARY (V.O.) (cont'd)
           We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that
           reminds me, I've got to call
           what's-his-face and cancel.

<b><u>ON MARY
</u></b>
<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Do I sense a chill in the air?

Mary sits down.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Oh, Magda, I let my head get in the way of
           my love life. I always pick guys on what I
           feel in here.
                 (pats heart)
           But with this Pat guy my head kept saying
           "Grow up, Mary. You have a lot in common
           with this one, you'll grow to feel
           something for him." But it never happened.

<u>ON HEALY</u> - he couldn't look more crushed. Suddenly his cellular
phone RINGS. He stares at it for TWO, THREE, FOUR RINGS.
Panic-stricken. Then he answers it.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>                 (jovial voice)
           Hey, Patty-boy here. Sorry I missed ya, but
           I'm out rustling up some champagne and
           roses in preparation for the greatest
           birthday of my life. Hope you and yours are
           having a good day, too.

Healy makes a BEEP sound and then holds his breath.

<u>ON MARY</u> - she stares at the phone, feeling cornered.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Uh, hi Pat, it's me, Mary. Just wanted to

She hangs up.

<b>                        MAGDA

           birthday.
                 (sighs)
           I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.

<u>ON HEALY</u> - he blows imaginary smoke off an imaginary gun. Then
he sits back and smugly listens to her DIAL THE PHONE. But then he
hears something that concerns him--a KNOCK on the door and the dog
<b>YAPPING.
</b>
<u>ON MARY</u> - she puts down the phone and answers the door. It's
Tucker, the architect.

<b>                        MARY

           Tucker...come on in.

<u>BACK ON HEALY</u> pulling his hair out. He's on an emotional roller
coaster heading downhill.

<b>                        MAGDA (V.O.)
</b>           Well look who's here.

<u>BACK TO MARY'S APARTMENT</u> - Tucker is carrying an unopened BOTTLE
OF SCOTCH and absently flicking the YAPPING pooch off his ankles.

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           There she is--I brought you a little
           thirst-quencher, Mag.

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Oh, you are sweet.

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           No, I'm not. I just want to get you-drunk
           so you'll pass out and I can have my way
           with Mary.

Everyone LAUGHS.

</b>           Thanks, but I've got to be going.
           Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social

Tucker's tone shifts and Mary grows concerned.

Mary seems relieved.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           I know what you're going to say, but he
           already told me everything. I know he's not
           an architect.

Tucker pulls out a piece of paper.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I think you'd better sit down.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this,
           but I'm really strapped for time here and--

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           Mary, the man's a killer.

<u>ON HEALY</u> - he can't believe his ears.

<u>BACK ON MARY</u> - as she lowers herself onto the couch.

<b>                        MARY
</b>                 (stunned)
           What...?

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           I've got a friend in the Boston police
           department. He faxed me this this morning.
           I'll just give you the highlights.
                 (reading from rap sheet)
           After a short stint as a petty thief,
           Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery
           by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he
           committed his first murder--a pretty
           teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He
           was incarcerated until age twenty-two when,
           despite a grim psychological profile, the
           state was forced to release him. In his
           mid-twenties and again in his early
           thirties he was suspected of homicides in
           the states of Utah and Washington.
           Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly
           decomposed that there wasn't enough
           evidence to hold him, and on and on and so
           forth and so on.

Mary looks like she's going to throw up.

<u>ON HEALY</u> - he listens intently, his face ashen.

We hear the PITTER-PATTER of the dog's nails on the floor, then a
LOUD THUMP followed by a YELP.

</b>                 (growing emotional)
           I can't believe this is happening. I'm

Tucker puts his arms around her.

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Why you two never hooked up is beyond me.

Mary looks fondly at Tucker.

<b>                        MARY

           my life.

           me a big head.

           The important thing, Doctor, is you've got
           to distance yourself as much as possible
           without pissing this psycho off.

</b>           Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to
           do. I'll call him right now.

<u>BACK ON HEALY</u> - he looks stunned. His cellular PHONE RINGS. He
stares at it, then picks it up.

<b>                        HEALY

           roses...and I'm really happy. Leave a

           believe it, there's no reason not to--but I
           just got beeped for emergency surgery.
           Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to

           You're gonna pay, fucker.

Healy discreetly pulls out and slowly follows Tucker in his car.

<u>BACK ON TUCKER</u> - He continues down the sidewalk, looking back
once or twice, apprehensive. He rounds a corner, then stops next
to an OLD FORD PINTO. He looks around nervously again. Then Tucker
DUCKS INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT and DRIVES OFF. Healy pulls into
traffic and follows.

           You don't jerk off before--?! Are you

Ted considers this.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Think about it: After you've had sex with a
           girl and the two of you are laying in bed,

Ted has a newspaper splayed out on the counter (open to the bra
ads) as he furiously FLOGS THE DOLPHIN (chest-high side view.) We
see some balled-up tissue nearby. After several frantic strokes,
he takes a deep breath and slowly and loudly EXHALES, clearly
having COMPLETED HIS MISSION.

He draws a few more breaths, picks up a face cloth, and goes to
clean up.

But something's missing: The Load. Ted looks down, checks his
hands, pants, shoes, looks in the sink, finally glances at the
ceiling, with no luck.

<u>The Load IS MISSING</u>!!!!

That's when the doorbell RINGS. Ted couldn't look more HORRIFIED.
As he buckles his pants, he makes a last, panicky reconnaissance
of the area. The doorbell RINGS AGAIN and Ted reluctantly goes to
answer it.

Ted opens the door and Mary is standing there looking as lovely as
ever.

drop earring.

Tucker drops the pizza as Healy SLAMS HIM into a tree.

           I'll give you a hint--it's got something to

Mary is amused by this.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Nitrate-sicles--I like that.

<b>                        TED
</b>           I say they should put more meats on a
           stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets
           on sticks--popsicles, fudgesicles,
           lollipops--but hardly any meat.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           I agree there should be more.

The Counter-Man hands each of them another corndog.

<b>                        TED
</b>           You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a
           cone. You could put corned beef hash in a
           cone, or chopped liver.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           I like it. And think of the
           toppings--cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly

<b>                        TED
</b>           Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.

They smile at one another.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.

<b>                        TED

           Yeah?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           We've got a lot in common.

Ted takes a chance.

<b>                        TED

<b>                        MARY

           got a nice thing going
                 (joking)

Mary smiles and Ted LAUGHS...perhaps a little too hard.

Ted and Mary are sitting on her front stoop SMOKING A BONE.

ON THEM from the shadows.

Healy and Tucker duck back into the alley.

Healy is throwing DOGGIE TREATS through an open THIRD-FLOOR
<b>WINDOW.
</b>
<b>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME
</b>
We hear the TELEVISION and see Magda DOZING on the couch with a
watery COCKTAIL IN HER HAND and the dog Puffy at her feet.

Suddenly a DOGGIE TREAT flies through the window, landing on the
rug. Puffy SNAPS TO ATTENTION and approaches the treat. He sniffs
it, then GOBBLES IT UP. ANOTHER doggie treat lands beside him and
he eats that, too. Then ANOTHER.

<b>EXT. MARY'S ALLEY - SAME
</b>
Tucker keeps throwing the treats up and Healy looks concerned.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           How many is that?

<b>                        TUCKER

</b>           I never said that.

As Tucker throws another...

The doggie treat LANDS IN MAGDA'S COCKTAIL, waking her up. Magda
looks around, gets her bearings, and then DOWNS THE DRINK!

Mary and Ted, still sitting on the stoop. Mary seems a little
reflective.

           when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm
           afraid I'm going to doing something really
           dumb before we get started so I think I
           should just lay back until I regain my
           composure.

Mary sort of smiles.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           That's really sweet, Ted, but you should
           save it for one of your books.

<b>                        TED
</b>           All right, let's go.

Ted jumps up and starts up the stairs two at a time.

<b>INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
As Ted and Mary ENTER, we see Magda HOLDING UP THE COUCH with one
hand and VACUUMING WITH THE OTHER.

Mary doesn't know what to make of it.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Magda, what are you doing?

Magda turns off the vacuum and we hear a BANGING SOUND coupled
with the O.S. MUFFLED YAPPING of Puffy.

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Where's Puffy?

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the
           bathroom.

As the O.S. YAPPING AND BANGING continues, Magda PICKS UP THE
TELEVISION and starts DUSTING the TV stand.

<b>                        MARY
</b>                 (to Ted, concerned)
           Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda--would
           you let the dog out of the bathroom.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Yeah, sure.

Ted walks down the hall, following the YAPPING AND BANGING SOUND
until he comes to the bathroom door. The YAPPING is MUCH LOUDER
now and he NOTICES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIM HESITATE.

<u>TED'S POV</u> - the bottom part of the door is being DENTED OUTWARD
from the force of something BATTERING IT FROM WITHIN.

<b>                        TED
</b>                 (CALLING out)

</b>                 (CALLING out)
           Toy poodle!

Ted thinks about this, shrugs, and opens the door.

BARING HIS TEETH like a Rottweiler, Puffy SPRINGS at Ted's
jugular!

<b>INT. MARY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Ted stumbles back into the living room with the hopped-up dog ON
HIS FACE. He KNOCKS OVER A LAMP, tumbles onto the floor, and
fights for his life.

Mary and Magda SCREAM as Ted and Puffy mix it up on the floor. Ted
tries to CRAWL TOWARD THE DOOR but Puffy GRABS THE CUFF OF HIS
<b>PANTS.
</b>
<u>DOOR POV</u> of Ted's anguished face as he gets pulled back into the
room.

Ted manages to GET THE DOG IN A HEADLOCK.

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Stop it, you're hurting him!

<b>                        TED
</b>                 (out of breath)
           Tell him...to calm down.

Puffy gets a piece of Ted's wrist and Ted SCREAMS and drops him.
Both man and toy poodle SPRING TO THEIR FEET.

They start CIRCLING ONE ANOTHER. Puffy leaps at Ted and Ted SMACKS
HIM into a wall. Unfazed, the dog gets a running start and LEAPS
<b>AT TED'S NECK.

Ted manages to duck and PUFFY FLIES OUT THE OPEN WINDOW!

<b><u>MONTAGE OF TED AND MARY FALLING IN LOVE
</u></b>
--Ted and Warren are at the top of a giant WATER SLIDE
Warren motions that he has decided this is not for him.
Ted shoots him a look that makes Warren feel like a
sissy. Convinced it's not too dangerous, Warren
decides to go for it and Ted follows.

--At the bottom of the slide Ted splashes into the huge
pool of water, laughing, having a blast. Then he looks

around...no sign of Warren. Concerned, Ted dives
underwater and a moment later Resurfaces clutching a
GASPING Warren.

<b>EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY
</b>
--Mary pumps Warren's stomach as he coughs water out of
his mouth. Ted looks on sheepishly.

<b>EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY
</b>
Ted and Warren walk down a city sidewalk. As they pass
a shop Warren points to the window excitedly.

<b>THEIR POV
</b>
In the window there is a mannequin dressed in a Super-
hero outfit, i.e. a generic superman.

Warren then pulls Ted into the store.

a few steps later Warren excitedly points to another
shop window.

<b>THEIR POV
</b>
In the window is a mannequin dressed in a cowboy
outfit, i.e. Lone Ranger (hat, badge, holster, chaps,
vest, boots, spurs, etc.)

Again, Warren pulls Ted into the store.

Super-hero outfit.

<b>EXT. SCENIC PIER - MIAMI - DAY

--Ted and Mary are walking arm and arm on a SCENIC PIER
where PEOPLE ARE FISHING. Right behind them are Magda
and Herb (the Homeless guy) enjoying one another's
company. Ted is on top of the world, feeling good,
looking good-right up until he gets the HOOK IN HIS
MOUTH. Suddenly he gets YANKED OUT OF FRAME.

<b>EXT. SCENIC PIER - MIAMI - DAY

--Ted is FLOPPING AROUND on the pavement and a FISHERMAN
has his FOOT ON HIS FACE as he STRUGGLES TO REMOVE THE
HOOK. Mary looks on, concerned.

<b>EXT. GROCERY STORE - MIAMI - DAY

putting the groceries in the back seat.

<b>EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

           The flowers are for you and the ball's for
           Warren. I had a friend of mine Fedex it to

Mary finally looks up but doesn't smile.

<b>                        MARY

Mary starts to get emotional.

Ted comes out of the building, a broken man. He paces back and
forth on the sidewalk, manic with despair. Then he seems to grow
angry. He rifles through his pockets until he finds a SLIP OF

Street, apt. 43.'

Ted walks down a rather dark hallway until he comes to apartment
43. He KNOCKS on the door but no one answers. He tries the handle
and THE DOOR OPENS.

Ted ENTERS and immediately reacts to the STENCH.

<u>REVERSE ANGLE</u> reveals that the place is a fucking PIG-STY. DOG
SHIT is everywhere, FLIES fill the room, a MOUSE scampers across
the carpet.

No answer. Suddenly he HEARS SOMEONE out in the hall, so he ducks
behind the door.

Healy and Tucker ENTER the apartment and stop in their tracks when
they see the MESS.

Again, no answer. Suddenly Ted SLAMS THE DOOR shut and grabs Healy
by the collar.

</b>           That's right--if you weren't you would've
           looked for her yourself!

Suddenly they hear a SOUND and turn to see Bill the Boa slithering
into the room with A HUGE, GREAT-DANE-SIZE LUMP in his midsection.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (sickened)
           Oh Christ...poor dog.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand
           the fact that it was my turn.

<b>                        TED

<b>                        HEALY

           That's right, hot shot! <u>My turn</u>. What's
           the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever
           get the great girl? Give the big pig with
           the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick
           of it, man! No more--it was my turn. It was
           time for me...time for me...to be happy.

This is so pathetic that it actually gets to Ted. He sits down,
runs his fingers through his hair.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Well you didn't have to blow us both out of
           the water. Jesus Christ, just because she
           found out about you, why'd you have to take
           me down with you?

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           I don't know what you're talking about.

<b>                        TED

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           What? 

Ted stares at him.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a
           letter outlining our deal?

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be
           screwing myself.

The guys stare at one another, then Tucker comes out the kitchen
with a drink. They turn their attention to him.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You little fuck.

<b>                        TUCKER

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           You fucking prick, we had a deal--you said
           you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck
           you until we had this fuck out of the
           fucking picture.
                 (moves in on Tucker)
           You crossed the line, man.

Tucker backs away nervously. 

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           Whoa, whoa, you're getting crazy now. Why
           would I cross the line--what do you think I
           got no pride?

Healy grabs Tucker by the neck.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You
           probably did it yourself, you piece of
           shit.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I
           rat myself out?

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy
           who's idea of courting is blowing farts in
           the chick's face

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           You were following us?

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           Don't flatter yourself--I was following
           <u>her</u>, I always do. How the hell you think
           I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?

This gets Ted's attention.

<b>                        TED
</b>           You mean...Steve didn't say all that stuff
           about Warren?

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           Are you shitting me--Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes?
           He was like a fucking eagle scout. You two
           should be kissing my balls--if it wasn't
           for me, she might've married that schmuck!

Ted thinks about this.

<b>                        TED
</b>           The hell with you both--I'm out of here.

Ted walks out the door leaving Healy and Tucker to stare each
other down. Just then Hal the Great Dane walks out of the bedroom
with a CEREAL BOX stuck on his head. Healy does a double-take,
then looks back at the snake.

</b>                 (excited)
           That's what I want to tell ya. I've been
           through two years of extensive
           psychotherapy and you know what? <u>You were

           That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're
           better--you seem...good--but...you put me
           through quite an ordeal, you know.

Dom nods aggressively.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           I had to move, go to court, change my last
           name--you stole all my shoes!

Dom stands up.

<b>                        DOM
</b>           Look at me.

Mary turns her head.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           <u>Look at me, Mary</u>. On my mother's soul, on
           God above, on everything that is holy to
           me, I did not steal your shoes.

<b>                        MARY

<b>                        DOM
</b>           All right, I did, but I was in a weird
           place then.

He approaches her.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Give me a break, Mare, I was nuts!

Mary backs into the living room.

Tucker just shrugs.

<b>                        MARY

Healy and Tucker STORM INTO THE ROOM and freeze at what they see.

<u>THEIR POV</u> - Dom is cradling SEVERAL PAIRS OF SHOES in his arms
and trying to crawl to the door while Mary holds him back.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Stop it!

<b>                        DOM
</b>           Just one pair! You owe me that much, you

Healy and Tucker grab Dom and throw him down on the couch.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Dom, you're pathetic, fucking over your
           friend Ted like that.

<b>                        DOM

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           He's no friend of mine.

Suddenly Magda ENTERS from her bedroom. She's holding a half-eaten
BANANA SPLIT. Herb, the Homeless Man, follows after her, sporting
a Tom Jones and buttoning up his shirt.

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           What the hell's going on here?

At first no one knows what to say. Then:

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           We're in love with your roommate.

<b>                        MAGDA
</b>           Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm
           gonna pack my bags and go back to my own
           place.

Magda heads back into her bedroom and Herb follows.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Tucker, where are your crutches?

Tucker is stumped for a second, then:

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>                 (British accent)
           Interesting query, Mary...

Healy slaps Tucker in the back of the head.

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           Shut the fuck up and tell her the truth.

Before he can respond, Ted ENTERS.

</b>           Well isn't this nice--now we've got the
           whole gang together.

Ted can hardly believe Dom is there.

<b>                        DOM

Everyone turns to Healy.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I say none of us leave this room until our
           young Mary here stops jerking us around and
           decides once and for all who she wants. Now
           Mary, I know this is difficult but you
           really will be doing them all a favor to
           tell them the truth about us.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're

Healy glares at Tucker.

<b>                        TUCKER
</b>           Uh, well...not exactly. You see, I
           exaggerated a little there.

<b>                        MARY

<b>                        HEALY
</b>           God no!
                 (pleased)
           I'm just a pathological liar!

Mary looks at Tucker, confused.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Tucker...not you, too?

Tucker lowers his head and reluctantly nods.

<b>                        TUCKER

Just then the door opens and BRETT FAVRE, the Packers quarterback
ENTERS, with Warren (wearing a walkman) beside him. Everyone is

Tucker lowers his head.

           Brett never said anything bad about Warren.
           He loves Warren...and from what he just

Mary manages a smile.

           I realized something tonight. I'm no better
           than any of these guys. None of them really
           love you...they just fixated on you because
           of how you made them feel. But that's not
           real love...Thank you for letting me see
           that. Now I can get on with the rest of my
           life.

Tucker, Healy, and Dom scoff.

</b>           Oh please...

<b>                        DOM

           going to stand here and tell us that you
           aren't in love with this girl?

Ted looks into Mary's eyes. She looks vulnerable.

<b>                        TED

                 (winks)

Ted looks Mary in the eye, then starts for the door.

                 (as he passes Warren)
           See you, Warren.

<b>                        WARREN

Ted lifts the earphones off Warren's ear.

<b>                        WARREN

Ted then WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM. They all stand there in silence
for a moment, then Dom turns to Brett Favre.

<b>                        DOM

           But but what about Steve?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun--the guy
           doesn't even drink beer or gamble.

Now Ted smiles.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Get over here.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Really?

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Really.

The BEAMING Ted starts walking across the street. Suddenly a BUS
WHIZZES BY AND SMACKS TED BROADSIDE. He bounces around under the
bus like a rag doll, then finally squirts out the back end and
<b>TUMBLES TO A LIMP STOP.
</b>
Mary SCREAMS and runs toward the body as a CROWD begins to gather.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           Ted, no, no....!

She starts giving him CPR. Somebody covers him with a blanket.

Just then, another CAR WHIZZES OVER HIS FEET like speedbumps. The
crowd winces.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Somebody hold up traffic!
                 (beat)
           Come on, Ted. Come on. Tell me you're going
           to be okay.

Then Ted takes a deep breath and his eyes flutter open.

<b>                        TED
</b>           Mary....Oh Mary, I love you.

Mary's smile is as bright as the light from heaven.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           I love you too, Ted.
                 (beat)
           I think I always have.

As the two lovebirds kiss, a LADY CALLS OUT:

<b>                        LADY
</b>           Over here! I found his foot! It was in the
           storm drain!

<u>ON THE LADY</u> as she holds up a SEVERED FOOT in a cloth.

<b>                        MARY
</b>           All right, everyone, let's fan out and look
           for the penis!

As Ted REACTS to this, we pull UP, UP, UP, and

<b>                                                       FADE OUT.
</b>

<b>                              <u>THE END</u></b></pre>
