</b>
    A very English scene - a beautiful English garden belonging to a
    mansion house. A smartly turned out gardener in green overalls
    is raking leaves. It's an impressive picture of Britishness and
    order. Another gardener, DAVE is trimming the edge of the lawn.
    We see shots of the garden; plants, trees, a gazebo, sundial,
    water fountain etc. We follow one of the gardeners pushing a
    wheelbarrow across the width of the lawn and we see the rear of
    this impressive property.

    A chauffeur-driven Mercedes pulls up to the front of the mansion
    house. MRS PARRINGTON, the housekeeper and nanny, waits for the
    car. HARRY and his children, JAMES, KATIE and THEO exit through
    the front door. As they do so, MRS PARRINGTON makes sure the
    children are smartly turned out. The chauffeur gets out and
    opens the door for the children.

    We cut to the family seated at a round table. The children look
    bored. HARRY listens proudly.

</b>              Harry was a grafter, entering the
              restaurant trade as a young man.
              (Beat) That's a euphemism for 'Greek
              waiter' isn't it?

    There is some laughter in the audience. We cut to HARRY again,
    who attempts to smile off the joke.

</b>              Only joking Harry. He then started the
              now famous Papadopoulos &amp; Sons - doing
              all things Greek. From taramasalata to
              olive oil and frozen mousakas - which,
              I must admit, my wife and I are
              partial to occasionally. Not one to
              settle, Harry's made the move into
              commercial property where he's about
              to embark on one of the most audacious
              developments yet - Papadopoulos Plaza.
              A two million square foot
              redevelopment in the heart of our
              great city. (Applause from the
              audience) Ladies and Gentlemen, I give
              you European Entrepreneur of the Year.
              Harry Papadopoulos.

    Awards music. We now cut to HARRY getting up from the table. He
    momentarily acknowledges the applause. The children are clapping
    politely but absently.

    JAMES' room resembles a botanical garden. JAMES is at his desk
    with pots of plants and various tools and test tubes with soil
    and desk lamps. JAMES looks through a microscope, studying a
    leaf, ignoring his father. HARRY surveys the room trying to
    accommodate his son's interest in botany. He notices a poster of
    Charles Darwin with a quote. He reads it out.

              random plant) Ah. Look at that. (Beat)
              And that's...

    JAMES answers without looking up from the microscope.

              Fine. But don't quit. Your mother

</b>              Well, your mother would probably have
              said do what you feel was right but
              I'd argue she was wrong. And then we'd
              argue. Probably. And she'd win. That
              was your mother. At least consider
              deferring.
    JAMES thinks about it.

</b>              Okay. I'll consider deferring.

               asked the Universe. Please help me.
               Please help me help these people.
               And I must've fallen asleep not
               long after. A crazy sleep. And then
               this dream. Banayia mou. There was
               this, this music. The most
               incredible music. And you and me
               Harry. Running the shop. I woke
               with tears in my eyes and I knew.

     Music. We see the family get into Spiros' tatty white van.
     SPIROS loads up some suitcases into the back. HARRY carries
     his businessman of the year award. JAMES has some plants.
     THEO has his laptop. KATIE has designer dress bags and shoes.
     On the side of the van we see "The Honest Handyman" with a
     telephone number and the strapline, "If it's still broke...
     then we can't fix it. That's honesty!" The logo is a hammer
     with angel wings. The van pulls out of the drive.

     Shop. The door is boarded up and covered in posters. We see
     the old sign, "The Three Brothers". The family, still seated
     in the van, stare out.

     prayer and making the sign of the cross over the fish frying

     the entrance. We see a skip. We see him peering in through a
     window. He walks over to the skip and looks in. He climbs in.
     Inside the skip among old cardboard boxes, a broken chair etc he
     finds a selection of plants - some of them in pots. He picks one
     up, the one with the distinctive Union Jack pot, and brushes the
     leaves. We then see him walk off with a box of plants.

</b>               I set up the business. I wasn't
               going to stay in the shop. You
               could've come with me.

</b>               Harry, you were so fast. You were
               like a plane, like a supersonic
               jet.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               But I gave you everything you
               wanted. Did I ever once turn you
               down? In all the years after I left
               the business. Did I? And after it
               went bust? But it was never enough.
               Every week something new. Writing a
               cheque to... I don't know. You had
               some weird friends. Who was that
               bloke with the pin head? Kept
               turning up at the house.

<b>                         SPIROS
</b>               None of my friends anymore.

<b>                         HARRY

               And your big 'tell it as it is'
               speech.

<b>                         SPIROS

               fork pierces the hard, crunchy

               The tangy smack of salt and vinegar

               of here. We got the loan. We should be
               celebrating.

               you be happy for me? Whenever I have
               any kind success you always have to

     cannot remember.

               By his thing that he does. You know,

               back to the shop and let me cook you
               something to eat. Go on. We're doing

               We've both had it. What is it? Is
               it the share price? Is it the
               profit earnings ratio? Is it a
               beautiful car.
