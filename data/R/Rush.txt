    Dark clouds passing overhead.

    The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in
    Germany), the past three days is on it's way out..


<b>2   AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                    2
</b>
    A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.
    Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..


<b>3   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   3

    The first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of
    international TV commentators in different languages.

</b>
    The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER
    wearing a fireproof balaclava...

    Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His
    name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.

<b>                         NIKI (V/O)
</b>               My grandfather always said history is
               cruel and reductive and no matter how
               long we live, or how much we achieve -
               we are remembered for very little. So
               make sure it's the right things.

    NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.
    Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...

    Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be
    using slicks or wets?


<b>5   EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                          5

    We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major
    Grand Prix. All around us...

    Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An
    OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One
    Minute"...

    Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.

<b>                           NIKI
</b>                 This is bullshit. We have no control
                 over our legacy. We cannot choose what
                 we are remembered for...

    A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian
    above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...

<b>                           MECHANIC
</b>                 Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare
                 anche tu?
                     (Mass is going on slicks. You
                      want to change?)

    NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white
    helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of
    MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.

<b>                           NIKI
</b>                 Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for
                 my rivalry with this asshole. And the
                 1976 season.

    NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.
    Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...

<b>                           NIKI
</b>                 What about Hunt? Has he changed?

<b>                           MECHANIC
</b>                 No, he's going on wets.

    The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,
    mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..

    The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but
    HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.

    NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's
    glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,
    flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..

<b>                           NIKI
</b>                 I don't know why it became such a big
                 thing. We were just drivers. Busting
                 each other's balls. To me this is
                 perfectly normal. But other people saw
                 it differently.

               That whatever it was between us went
               deeper. And changed us both somehow.
               Forever.

    NIKI stares, then...

                   (Then we go on wets, too.)

    The ten-second board is held up.

    NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a
    split-second, eyes staring...

    NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the
    engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000
<b>    RPM.
</b>
<b>                         NIKI

               I was in. And why it happened. The

               On August 1st, that same year...

    CAPTION: "AUGUST 1st, 1976".

    The STARTER waves the flag. NIKI's foot hits the floor - his
    engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch
    scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.

    NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin
    leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..

    NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there's
    a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.

    His arch-rival. HUNT.

    But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.
    Number 12. It's not Hunt. It's MASS. On his bald, slick tyres.

    NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong
    decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to
    change tyres...

    NIKI swerves angrily into the pits. Ferrari's pit is right at
    one end...

</b>
    Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the
    crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the
    pits to change to dry tyres.

    It's chaos. A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...

    The Ferrari team frantically work. Changing NIKI's tyres. Four
    men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. The same
    Italian MECHANIC appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..

<b>                         MECHANIC

    NIKI screams at the MECHANICS, who are struggling. The airguns
    make a high-pitched noise...something's not right.

<b>                         NIKI
</b>               What's GOING ON???

    "Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and
    NIKI exit the pits in pursuit of HUNT. But the delay has cost
    him dear...

    He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and
    Swallowtail - passes one car after another. Into 13th place
    now. Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres.

    NIKI's P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur. The steering
    wheel shakes. The car is right on the edge. Cannot be driven
    any harder.

    NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of
    the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner. Crazy speed.
    And tight. Too tight. A mistake...

    "Thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the
    inside. NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155
    mph. The car jerks horribly to the right..

    "Crunch", hits the embankment, then "Bang", hits the barrier,
    and is thrown across the track..

    Fire breaks out in the engine. NIKI's eyes widen in horror,
    with another car bearing down upon him...

<b>                          NIKI
</b>                 No...!

    The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, "Crash", a
    sickening, terrifying impact.

    The car explodes. Seventy litres of burning high-octane
    gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his
    seatbelt. Locked in a blast furnace.

    NIKI screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees
    temperature. Trapped inside his car.

    Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...

    Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV
    commentators helplessly describe what's happening..

    NIKI's POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable
    figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..

    Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully
    to undo NIKI's seatbelt..

    Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Dry powder extinguishers.
    Covering NIKI's helmet. Blurring his vision, as he cries out
    in agony, inhaling the powder..

    Screaming voices. Panicked reactions. On the side of the car,
    the painted name `Niki Lauda' blisters and melts.

    We're in a busy hospital A&amp;E unit. Noise. Crowds. A regular
    Saturday late afternoon. The phone continues to ring..

    Finally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20's, run-off-her-

    All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way.

    The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and
    consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by...

    Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks
    through and into the accident and emergency unit.

    Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing
    overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT,
    (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair...

    A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to
    describe an Englishman. SEXY.

    Blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and
    the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no

     `Crash', the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble
     through, mid-embrace, tearing at one another's clothes...

     The apartment is basic. Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor
     student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer
     cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two
     budgerigars.

     A mattress on the floor.

     Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England's
     crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the
     government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition,
     leaving behind its strong, imperial past.

     JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half-
     dressed, but already passionately making love...

</b>                  I have a theory why women like racing
                  drivers. It's not because they respect
                  what we do...driving round and round
                  in circles. Mostly they think that's
                  pathetic. And they're probably right..

                gave me a first class education...but
                to no avail. My brothers are the

                have a hot head, an inability to
                tolerate discipline. I fall out with
                people left and right. I'm quick to
                settle matters with my fists. The only
                creatures I've ever loved and treated
                well, are budgerigars. In any normal
                area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total
                liability. All I've got going for me
                is I'm quick in a car.

     Glamorous, long-haired, tanned, fashionable - like rock stars,
     they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES.

     What are you doing answering the phones? New haircut! Like it.
     What have you done to the weather?

     They make her laugh. And smile.

     NIKI feels invisible. Embarrassed. Awkward. Inadequate. He
     gets to his feet. And goes to the car that has come to collect
     him.

     As he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him. Ignoring the
     other DRIVERS. Intrigued.

     He's different. Interesting. Intense. Intelligent eyes.

                  But Agnes's last boyfriend was a
                  British Formula 2 driver, who has a
                  reputation for two things. For being a
                  suicidal jerk on the track, and for
                  going all night, and all day
                  afterwards...and all night again in
                  bed. He's an OK driver, but an
                  IMMORTAL fuck, apparently. I don't
                  know about you, but that's not an act
                  I'd like to follow.

                 two weeks before that race in Spain,
                 we put 20-inch rims on the rear
                 wheels. We get an extra half second

                 tells me we can't use those rims, they
                 make the car too wide. Against the
                 rules. So we go back to 19-inch rims
                 making the car slower again. Rules are
                 rules. For all of us. You're just a
                 bad loser who can't accept that.

   JAMES sits alone in the first class section. A loser on the
   track, and a loser in love, too. Being played out in the full

   on the plane.

   Nothing to do with pleasure. An analgesic - a way of blocking
   out the pain. JAMES catches his own reflection in the mirror.
   Teeth clenched. Eyes burning with anger and self-loathing...

   Make that beyond the limit. At the point of no return. The car
   shaking. Weaving recklessly through other cars...

   Where death has become a real option.

   Because he doesn't care anymore. Because it's all he deserves
   anyway...

   And in that moment, in reaching his lowest point, JAMES has
   unwittingly stumbled on the one thing that gives him an
   advantage over everyone else...

   The fact that he doesn't care. The fact that death has become
   an option. The fact that there is no risk he is not prepared

                 Nurburgring is a race track from the
                 Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric,
                 outdated, dangerous, track in the
                 world. You've all seen the rain which
                 has been falling this morning. Those
                 of you with experience know the Ring
                 needs perfect conditions to be even
                 remotely acceptable in terms of risk.
                 As you can see today is anything BUT
                 perfect, so I called this meeting to
                 take a vote to cancel the race.

               I could die. But not one per cent

   JAMES's spray makes it impossible for NIKI to see. NIKI can't
   blink his eyes...it's agony.

   Half-blind, NIKI tries to overtake. Gives it everything he's
   got, breaking as late as he can, tearing through the gears...

   For NIKI the world flies past in a near-blind blur. The
   steering wheel shakes. The car cannot be driven any harder.

   But the visibility is terrible. The spray tears into his
   scarred eyes. He is unable to see anything but...

   MARLENE's beautiful face: staring at him. Smiling tenderly.
   Kissing him tenderly.

               In hospital the toughest part of my
               treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the
               shit out of my lungs. It was agony.
               While doing it, I was watching
               television...you winning all those
               races...and I was cursing you.. "That
               bastard, Hunt", I would shout, "I hate
               that guy." one day the doctor said,
               "Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of
               advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse
               to have been given an enemy in life.
               It can be a blessing, too." I said,
               "Who are you, Confucius?" He said, "A
               wise man gets more from his enemies
               than a fool from his friends." And you
               know, he's right. Look at us. We were
               a pair of kids when we first met.
               Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed
               nowhere. Now we're both Champions of
               the world. Not bad.

</b>               No, not bad.

<b>                         NIKI
</b>               So don't let me down now. I need you
               busting my balls. Get back to work.

<b>                         JAMES
</b>               I will, Niki. But I intend to enjoy
               myself first. And so should you. You
               think you can?

   NIKI stares. A blank look..

<b>                         JAMES
</b>               See you on race day, Champ.

<b>                         NIKI
</b>               You will. Champ.

   JAMES goes. NIKI watches him, pulled into his plane by his
   laughing, cool FRIENDS. An unmistakable flicker of envy in his
   eyes.

   Then NIKI turns, alone, and resumes his safety checks.

   JAMES's plane roars down the runway and takes off into the
   azure blue sky...
