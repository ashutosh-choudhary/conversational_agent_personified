</b><b>	
</b>	PRESENTATION CREDITS appear... then FADE...
<b>	
</b>	Out of BLACK... SHOCK CUT TO:
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   LAB   "A" LEVEL   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	A MAN'S FACE, filling the screen.
<b>	
</b>				MARCUS (filter)
			Stay away from here!
<b>	
</b>	We're watching A VIDEO MONITOR. A pre-recorded tape shows
	a view of what is obviously a pristine-RESEARCH LABORATORY.
	DR. JOHN MARCUS, in a lab coat, faces THE CAMERA, disheveled
	and looking like a madman.
<b>	
</b>				MARCUS (cont. filter)
			This lab must remain sealed!
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	Overhead lamps cast pools of LIGHT down onto A CONFERENCE
	TABLE, onto THE HANDS of PEOPLE assembled to observe the
	video. We see NO FACES. But expensive WATCHES, sleeves
	with high-ranking STRIPES, indicate wealth, power, and a
	military presence.
<b>	
</b>	THE VIDEO: On the wall behind MARCUS, we see SHADOWS darting
	frantically. We hear VOICES rising in panic.
<b>	
</b>				MARCUS (cont. Filter)
			For God's sake, don't come in!
<b>	
</b>	The CAMERA is SWATTED by A HAND that lurches suddenly into
	the foreground. We only see it for a few video frames, but
	we might subliminally notice LESIONS on the flesh. The IMAGE
	SWIRLS wildly. The next clear picture we see... is of the
	same laboratory...topsy-turvy. THE CAMERA is lying on its
	side on the floor.
<b>	
</b>				VOICE IN THE ROOM (o.s.)
			Look.  Here.
<b>	
</b>	A LASER POINTER casts a RED DOT on a corner of the video
	screen, indicating A HUNCHED FIGURE, leaning over A HUMAN
	BODY, apparently ...feeding! With a GRUNT, the figure turns.
	and LUNGES, it's face covered with BLOOD, at the CAMERA. The
	image SWIRLS again, and the SCREEN GOES BLACK. With a MUSIC
	STING, a single TITLE appears, full across the blackness...

</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-2
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT  FOREST LAND   PRE-DAWN
</b><b>	
</b>	A DARK SKY ...and in the foreground, profiled against a FULL
	MOON, A DARK FACE ...watching the heavens with piercing black
	eyes, alert, though not predatory. This is CHRIS REDFIELD,
	young, handsome. More than simply an outdoor type, he seems
	perfectly in place, almost part of the environment.
<b>	
</b>	A band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of
	magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. Sitting
	on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees ...
<b>	
</b>	...AN EAGLE coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through
	the hilltops. As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes
	recognizable. Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad.
<b>	
</b>	The regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly...
	a freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above
	the highest water.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Take it, Goliath. It's yours.
<b>	
</b>	"Goliath" snaps up the fish and flies away with it.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			See ya next year, guy.
<b>	
</b>	Chris reaches into a water-filled bucket, pulls out another
	trout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious
	Cliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the-same high rock.
	ANOTHER EAGLE, smaller, a female, appears in the sky.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			Cleopatra.
<b>	
</b>	Chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note.
<b>	
</b>	"Cleopatra" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down.
	She's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she
	recoils and climbs again, hovering.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			Come on. Come on down.
<b>	
</b>	The eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. It makes another
	dive, but stops short again.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			What's the matter, beautiful?
<b>	
</b>	The bird seems frightened.  Of what? It makes one more dive.
	Gets very close to the fish... but suddenly SHRIEKS and peels,
	away from the rock. Chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as
	it soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-3
<b>	
</b>	CLOSE ON: CHRIS, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear
	over the hills.
<b>	
</b>	Over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the
	fish. It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight
	catches SOMETHING MOVING there. Something that lets out a
	sharp INHUMAN SOUND.
<b>	
</b>	Chris whirls around. There's nothing on the rock. Nothing
	at all. The fish has been taken.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   DAWN
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS walks into a characterless apartment. He quietly
	sheds his clothes. Even in silhouette, we can see that his
	body is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight.
	Moving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases
	himself into a bed where...
<b>	
</b>	...a beautiful young girl, JILL VALENTINE, seems to be fast
	asleep. As Chris nestles in beside her, we see that her
	eyes, facing away, are open. Chris gently drapes an arm
	around her and lets his body relax.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			(A whisper) Glad you're still 
			here, lady
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			It's my apartment.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			(Surprised) You're awake.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			I've been awake. Since you left.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Sorry.
<b>	
</b>	His apology goes no further. He's still troubled by what
	happened in the hills.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			There was... something wrong.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			What, with my dinner? I never had
			a mother. I'll learn.
<b>	
</b>	Chris smiles politely. He offers...
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			I'll do the cooking.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-4
<b>	
</b>	...but he can't switch focus.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			On the mountain...there...must
			have been something... prowling
			around up there.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			There are probably all kinds of
			things prowling around up there.
			In the middle of the night.
<b>	
</b>	Chris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			I'm sorry. Really. You...have to
			be there at dawn. They ride the
			wind over the ridge.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Dawn? You left at one A.M.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			I had to go fishing. It's the fish
			that bring them down, so I can get
			a close look at them. (Enthused)
			I've tracked a dozen of them, Jill.
			Twelve of those big bruisers. I can
			actually recognize them. I've even
			given them names, over the years.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			You've been doing this for years?
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Only in the early Autumn. When
			they're' migrating.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			I'II set the alarm for next. October.
<b>	
</b>	Jill rolls over and faces him.
<b>	
</b>				JILL (cont.)
			I wish I could get excited. Really.
			That's the truth. As excited as you,
			over such... simple things.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Beauty... isn't simple. If it was...
			I'd be beautiful.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			You are.
<b>	
</b>	Pg-5
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			No, no, no.  I'm simple.  You, on the
			other hand...(nuzzling closer)...have
			all that... stuff... hiding underneath
			somewhere. That's what fascinates me.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Fascination. Not love?
<b>	
</b>	Jill is being playful. Chris, taking her question to heart,
	becomes introspective.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			I... honestly don't know. I guess
			I've been... living alone too long.
			You're the first, the only woman I've
			ever thought of as... a real partner.
<b>	
</b>	Now Jill becomes introspective.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			I've always been...afraid of living
			alone. I've always had... people...
			talking at me... knowing they could
			wind me up and I'd do... (shrug) ...
			whatever they wanted.
<b>	
</b>	Chris looks into her eyes. She kisses him gently.
<b>	
</b>				JILL (cont.)
			We all have... something hidden...
			underneath.  Beauty may not be simple.
			But it's not all that complicated,
			Either.  Most of the time, you find
			It... right in the middle of all the...
			confusion.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			I'm part Mohawk. Indians are never
			confused. At least, they never let
			it show.
<b>	
</b>	They kiss again, this time more passionately. Rolling over,
	they begin to make love.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   FARM   DAWN
</b>	The purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite
	dark when a crusty old farm-hand, RAKE, opens the creaking
	door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads THREE HORSES
	out into the morning breeze.
<b>	
</b>	Two dogs, A LAB and A SPANIEL, romp at his heels as Rake
	opens a log gate.
<b>	
</b>	Pg-6
<b>	-
</b>	Two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large
	corral. The third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting,
	tossing its head in high spirit.
<b>	
</b><b>				RAKE
</b>			Get in there, Lucky. Quit horsin'
			around. Get in.
<b>	
</b>	"LUCKY" moves into the corral, strutting proudly.
<b>	
</b>				RAKE (cont.)
			Swear. If I didn't know you was
			just an animal, I'd say you was all
			full of yourself. GET IN THERE!
<b>	
</b>	Rake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a
	great deal of affection here. Rake shuts the gate behind
	the stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside
	the fence. All seems lovely, until...
<b>	
</b>	...the dogs suddenly go on point. Their ears perk. They
	sniff the air...and begin to WHINE.
<b>	
</b>				RAKE (cont.)
			What's wrong with you two?
<b>	
</b>	KER-RAAKK! A startling SOUND. Rake turns to find Lucky and
	the other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to KICK their
	way out of the fencing. They seem terrified.
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO :
</b><b>	
</b>	A WIDE SHOT:  of RAKE, and the frightened ANIMALS, from
	two hundred yards away. THE CAMERA MOVES IN, slowly at
	first, then gaining speed... extraordinary SPEED. We are
	seeing THROUGH THE EYES OF... whatever it is that's running,
	charging, SLATHERING HUNGRILY...
<b>	
</b>	...reaching the corral, DARTING through the fence, past the
	KICKING HORSES, and LEAPING at Rake, who whirls around...and
	CRIES OUT in pain as his flashlight BLINDS us with WHITENESS.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
</b><b>	
</b>	The WHITENESS becomes the GLARE of HALOGEN LIGHTS. We are
	overwhelmed by the SOUND of AIRCRAFT ENGINES. We see MEN,
	armed SOLDIERS, scrambling into combat HELICOPTERS.
<b>	
</b>	A RADIO MAN runs right toward THE CAMERA, holding out an
	open receiver.
<b>	
</b><b>				RADIO MAN
</b>			Top brass, sir!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-7
<b>	
</b>	ANOTHER MAN, in the foreground, takes the radio-phone. We
	can't see his face. Only his forearm, which bears A TATTOO
	of a grinning SKULL.
<b>	
</b><b>				MAN WITH TATTOO
</b>			Alpha Leader.
<b>	
</b>				VOICE ON PHONE (o.s. filter)
			How long before you get in there?
<b>	
</b><b>				MAN WITH TATTOO
</b>			Fifteen minutes.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   AN OFFICE   DAWN
</b><b>	
</b>	A SUIT talks on a red telephone. Once again, we see no face.
	An ostentatious diamond RING kicks light as the man snips off
	the end off a Monte Cristo.
<b>	
</b><b>				MAN WITH RING
</b>			You're good, soldier. But not that
			good. It's five hundred miles away.
			In the backwoods of Pennsylvania.
<b>	
</b>				MAN WITH TATTOO (o.s. filter)
			We have troopers on site. A first-
			strike force. Under cover.
<b>	
</b>	The flame from a wooden match lights the Monte Cristo.
<b>	
</b><b>				MAN WITH RING
</b>			Very resourceful.  You have my
			permission activate them.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
</b><b>	
</b><b>				MAN WITH TATTOO
</b>			I've already done that. You have my
			permission... to say that you gave me
			permission.
<b>	
</b>	THE TATTOOED MAN runs off to join the other SOLDIERS.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS sleeps. JILL is awake, deep in thought, when...
<b>	
</b>	...BRRRRT! It's not a ring, it's a vibration. Jill reaches
	down and extracts something small and black, the size of a
	box of Tic-Tacs, from one of her shoes. She gets out of bed,
	checking to see that Chris is still asleep, and moves into...
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-8
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   BATHROOM   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	...a bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she puts the
	small box to her ear, extracts a wire from it, with a tiny
	microphone on its tip, and...
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			(Softly) Valentine.
<b>	
</b>	We can't hear the voice that speaks to her.
<b>	
</b>				JILL (cont.)
			If this is just another a drill,
			I'll strangle you. (She listens)
			Shit. Give me the activation code.
<b>	
</b>	JILL pulls a small ENVELOPE from a toiletry bag. She breaks
	open a wax seal...and takes out a thick paper on which is
	printed... 29-RC-6735.
<b>	
</b>				JILL (cont.)
			(Gaping, not believing) Th-that's
			a match. (Beat) I'm on my way.
<b>	
</b>	Jill clicks off. She dumps something else from the envelope
	into her hand... A BLUE PLASTIC CARD, the size of a Visa,
	blank except for a mag-stripe. There's a small hole in one
	corner, through which a chain is strung. Jill slings the
	chain over head, wearing the blue card like a pendant.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS is still asleep. JILL comes out of the bathroom and
	looks down at him longingly.  Should she wake him?  Tell him
	what's happening?  She wants to, but duty prevents it.  She
	pulls herself away.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   CLOSET   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	TCHIK TCHIK TCHIK...JILL pushes aside hangers which hold her
	clothes. She types numbers into a hidden KEYPAD. A SECRET
	PANEL OPENS, revealing a CLOSET WITHIN THE CLOSET, packed
	with COMBAT UNIFORMS and WEAPONS.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	The sound... TCHUNG... of the front door closing snaps CHRIS
	awake.  His first thought is for his lover.  He reaches out
	and finds that... she's not in bed.  He jumps up, rushes to
	a window, looks down, from the second story, and sees...
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-9
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	...JILL, heavily ARMED, in UNIFORM, wearing a beret that has
	an insignia... S.T.A.R.S. She rushes down the front path and
	jumps into A HUMMER with THREE OTHER TROOPERS on board. The
	vehicle pulls instantly away...
<b>	
</b>	...leaving Chris, looking through the window, puzzled, angry,
	and very much wounded.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT/EXT   HUMMER   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	RUSSO drives. WILLIAMS and DISIMONE sit in the back, all
	tough Special-Forces types. JILL, in the front passenger
	seat, though the only female, ranks the highest.
<b>	
</b><b>				DISIMONE
</b>			Another practice run, right?
<b>	
</b><b>				RUSSO
</b>			We been practicin' six months!
			For what?
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			For this. This is the real deal.
<b>	
</b><b>				WILLIAMS
</b>			Honest to God?
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Based on my experience, Williams,
			God isn't always honest
<b>	
</b><b>				DISIMONE
</b>			Where we goin'?
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			In there.
<b>	
</b>	Jill points into THE ARKLEY FOREST which lies ahead. Miles
	of old growth-trees shrouded in a ghostly morning mist.
<b>	
</b><b>	DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT   THE FOREST   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE MIST... THE HUMMER bounces over
	non-roads and stops fifty yards from...
<b>	
</b>	...A PAIR OF IRON GATES, each wrought with the letter "A".
	Beyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of...
	A MANSION.  Huge.  Like Xandau.  THE TROOPERS, amazed,
	climb out and approach the gates.
<b>	
</b>	Pg-10
<b>	
</b><b>				RUSSO
</b>			If you had the jing to build a place
			like this, would you build it in the
			middle of fuckin' nowhere?
<b>	
</b><b>				WILLIAMS
</b>			Paris.
<b>	
</b><b>				DISIMONE
</b>			Manhattan. Upper west.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			(Wistfully) Some people prefer...
			a quiet life. (Back to business)
			Our orders are to secure the area.
<b>	
</b><b>				DISIMONE
</b>			From what? This area's been 'secure'
			since the French and Indian War!
<b>	
</b>	A deep, animal SNARL comes from the woods.  The troopers
	raise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush.  The
	fog keeps sunlight from penetrating.  The forest is a maze
	of dark shadows. Leaves flutter.  Limbs SNAP.  Then...
<b>	
</b>	DARK SHAPES can be seen moving, circling.  A half-dozen
	of them.  Maybe more.  Jill whips out a transmitter and
	quickly types an access code.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			(Into radio) This is Valentine,
			Bravo Team. We, er... we might be
			in trouble, here.
<b>	
</b>	KRITCH! Something LEAPS out of the brush. Automatic
	WEAPONS SPIT reflexively.
<b>	
</b>	KRITCH KRITCH KRITCH...more lunging SHAES appear. The
	troopers scatter, firing, as they are attacked from all
	sides. Jill dives for the shrubbery, shouting into her
	transmitter.
<b>	
</b>				JILL (cont.)
<b>			WE ARE IN TROUBLE!
</b><b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO :
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT   HUEY   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	JILL'S VOICE stutters over a headset which is pressed against
<b>	A MAN'S EAR.
</b><b>	
</b>				JILL (o.s. filter)
			Under attack... by.. .assailants...
			Unidentifi...
<b>	
</b>	Pg-11
<b>	
</b>	Static. Hissing air. The SHOT WIDENS as the man lowers his
	headset. First we see the TATTOO on his arm... a grinning
	SKULL which we recognize. Then, gradually, we see his face.
	Lean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is ALBERT
	WESKER, a hard-assed career officer.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Can you get a trace?
<b>	
</b>	The pilot, LAGUARDIA, responds.
<b>	
</b><b>				LAGUARDIA
</b>			Lost the beacon. It just cut out.
			Like it was...swallowed by something.
<b>	
</b>	Oddly, Wesker smiles.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			I do believe, gentlemen...that we're
			gonna be earning some combat pay.
<b>	
</b>	There are three other MEN on board. The closest to Wesker
	is BARRY BURTON, a muscular black man, as big as a grizzly,
	with the heart of a Teddy.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			Damn, if you don't love a fight.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Hey, if I didn't... you'd be a dead
			man. (To the pilot) Call in a nine-
			nine. I want Raccoon City e-vacked.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker and the men fly from the lens.  THE CAMERA passes
	Out through one of the helicopter's windows as the chopper soars
	away.  When the SHOT WIDENS, we see OTHER HUEYS...black,
	unmarked, keeping formation.  Three... six...ten of them.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   FOREST   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	GUNS BLAZE. THE TROOPERS are under assault by thrashing,
	inhuman SHAPES...GROWLING, SNAPPING. JILL rolls into a
	natural trench.  DISIMONE is behind her, WILLIAMS is
	crawling just ahead, his legs pumping.  Jill scoots past
	him and sees that...
<b>	
</b>	...those legs aren't moving on their own.  They've been
	RIPPED AWAY FROM WILLIAMS' TORSO and are being dragged into
	the underbrush by some... BEAST... concealed in the thick
	brush, so we never get a clear look at it.
<b>	
</b>	OTHER BEASTS attack DiSimone.  Then Russo.  We see only
	details.  Jill fires her pistol, point blank... to no avail.
	RED-RIMMED EYES, SNARLING JAWS, DROOLING TEETH descend on
	her as we CUT TO:
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-12
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT BUILDING   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS steps out of Jill's building. Suddenly, incongruously,
	camo-painted HUEYS swoop down out of the sky.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   RACCOON CITY   MAIN STREET   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	THE CHOPPERS land where they can. COMMANDOS leap out and
	begin to cordon off the town.  Bullhorns blare.
<b>	
</b><b>	BULLHORN
</b>	There's been an accident in the
	hills nearby. A military aircraft,
	carrying live weapons, has crashed...
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   RACCOON CITY   SIDE STREET   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS runs down a side-street into AN ALLEY, where he's
	trapped by COMMANDOS, both in front and behind.
<b>	
</b><b>				SOLDIER
</b>			Let's go, hayseed. (Aiming his M-16)
			You gonna be a good boy?
<b>	
</b>	Chris swallows his fury. Gritting his teeth, he goes along
	with the soldiers, prodded, by rifle barrels, out onto...
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   RACCOON CITY  MAIN STREET   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	...Main Street, where there is CHAOS... an Orwellian sight,
	as CITIZENS find themselves horded into helicopters and
	TRUCKS from the local National Guard Post.
<b>	
</b>	A sweating man, still in his pajamas, rushes up to the
	SOLDIERS that are escorting CHRIS.
<b>	
</b><b>				MAN
</b>			Look here, I'm the Sheriff of this...
<b>	
</b><b>				SOLDIER
</b>			Step aside.
<b>	
</b><b>				SHERIFF
</b>			But, I'm the Sheriff! An ex-Army man, like you.
<b>	
</b>				BULLHORN (o.s.)
			There is no immediate danger, but
			as a precaution, we are evacuating
			the area. You will be provided
			shelter until the weapons have been
			removed from the crash site.
<b>	
</b>	Pg-13
<b>	
</b><b>				SHERRIFF
</b>			That's a worn-out scenario. If
			a plane crashed nearby, don't you
			think somebody would have heard
			it go down? Tell us the truth,
			guys. What's this really about?
<b>	
</b><b>				SOLDIER
</b>			I said, STEP ASIDE!
<b>	
</b>	The soldier lifts his rifle. He's about to CLUB the sheriff
	when Chris lunges, grabbing his arm. WHOOMPH! Chris kicks
	the soldier in the balls. The man buckles. Chris bolts.
<b>	
</b>	One of the other commandos FIRES at him, a loud BURST which
	misses Chris but SHATTERS a shop window, setting off wild
	PANIC on the street. Chris ducks into a building...
<b>

	alleyways, arriving at...

</b>	...A JEEP SAHARA which is parked behind Jill's apartment
	building. He jumps in without opening the door, jams the key
	into the ignition, and ROARS off.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   HUEY   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	Still airborne, in one of the black helicopters that have yet
	to reach the site, WESKER barks orders into a radio.

</b><b>	EXT   FARM   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS rumbles his jeep onto a picturesque FARM, secluded deep
	in the forest. We don't recognize it immediately. It was
	dark when we last saw the place.
<b>	
</b>	Jumping out, Chris sees three large SHAPES lying in the grass
	of a corral. Rushing over, Chris realizes...
<b>	
</b>	...they're HORSES. One of them is LUCKY, his prize
	stallion... DEAD, in a pool of BLOOD, with its belly torn
	open and a huge chunk out of its neck.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Aw, no... (Devastated) ...L-Lucky.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-14
<b>	
</b>	Chris hears a weak, MOANING SOUND. He turns and sees...
	RAKE, lying near a water pump. Chris rushes to the man's
	side and finds him brutally SLASHED, barely clinging to life.
<b>	
</b><b>				RAKE
</b>			(Coughing blood) They... they come
			outta the trees, Reddy. Don't... don't
			know what they was. Figure... maybe
			some kinda... wolves, or somethin' ...
<b>	
</b>	Examining the man's wounds, Chris realizes they're fatal.
<b>	
</b><b>				RAKE
</b>			I... I never seen 'em comin'.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Don't try to talk, Rake.
<b>	
</b>				RAKE (cont.)
			I... ain't... never left this farm...
			untended... since yer daddy first
			took it over.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			I know. You... kept the place runnin'...
			better than me.
<b>	
</b><b>				RAKE
</b>			I just...never seen 'em comin', Reddy.
			Never even...had a chance to...turn
			a gun on 'em.
<b>	
</b>	There's a THUNDER in the sky. Chris looks up. Wesker's
	Fleet of black HUEYS appears on the horizon.  They split up,
	Seven banking off toward Raccoon City, the remaining three
	grinding ahead over the forest, slowing down, dropping in
	altitude.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Where are they going? There's
			nothing in there... except...
<b>	
</b><b>				RAKE
</b>			Y'oughta... remember it... real good.
			I do.  From... when you was a kid.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			The... the old Arkley place?
<b>	
</b><b>				RAKE
</b>			I remember them days. I surely do...
			Remember them... them old days.
<b>	
</b>	Chris looks back down at the old man, who is drifting,
	starting to lose it.
<b>	
</b>	Pg-15
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			I'm not gonna bullshit you, Rake.
			You're...in a bad time. If there's
			any way to save you, I'll find it,
			I swear. You just... hang in there,
			old guy. I'll be right back.
<b>	
</b>	Chris jumps to his feet and runs into...
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   FARMHOUSE   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	...the great-room of the FARMHOUSE. Rustic. Cozy. CHRIS
	snatches up a telephone. There's no dial-tone. The line
	is dead. Chris rushes to a gun cabinet and pulls out an old
	WINCHESTER rifle. He scoops ammo from a drawer into a
	shoulder bag and runs back outside...
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   FARM   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	...where his eyes catch MOVEMENT in the corral. LUCKY,
	entrails spilling, is trying to stand.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Oh, God, Rake. Oh, Jesus, the poor thing's still alive.
<b>	
</b>	Chris shoulders his ammo bag, reaches inside, and quickly
	reloads the Winchester. Stepping forward, he aims carefully.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			Sorry, old hoss.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	BLAM!  A clean shot to the horse's brain drops the animal.
<b>	
</b>	It takes Chris a long moment to recover... then, he looks into
	the trees. The helicopters are no longer in sight, but their
	THUNDER remains.  They haven't landed yet.
<b>	
</b>	Chris turns and rushes back to Rake's side, only to find...
	...he has died. Chris' jaws tighten, but he has no time
	to mourn. He closes Rake's eyes. Digs through the grass.
	Pulls up a handful of dirt. Stuffs it into the old man's
	hand, and closes his stiffening fingers over it.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			The earth keeps us.
<b>	
</b>	Conquering his emotions, Chris runs to his jeep and jumps in.
	He shifts into four-wheel-drive and, ignoring the road, heads
	straight over the field for the trees.
<b>	
</b>	As the jeep disappears, THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ZOOMING
<b>	IN ON...
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-16
<b>	
</b>	...one of the farm dogs. The SPANIEL. Not the entire
	animal, but one of its three SEPARATE PARTS... it's front
	end... CRUSHED head, BLOODY neck, and a single BROKEN paw...
<b>	
</b>	...which is trying to CRAWL.
<b>	
</b>	Fifty yards away, RAKE'S HAND relaxes. The earth spills out
	through his fingers as the dead man's eyes... POP OPEN.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MORNING
</b><b>	
</b>	THE FIRST OF THE BLACK HUEYS drops, hazardously, into a
	small clearing with barely enough space. Unable to land
	on the scrub-brush, it hovers ten feet off the ground. Its
	rotors CLIP TREE LEAVES as WESKER, BARRY, and TWO OTHER
	S.T.A.R.S. COMMANDOS jump out, heavily armed. The chopper
	lifts off, placed by HUEY NUMBER TWO.
<b>	
</b>	NOT FAR AWAY, CHRIS navigates through undergrowth until he
	can see THE HELICOPTERS through the trees. The THUNDER from
	their rotors masks the grinding of Chris' jeep. He pulls
	within a hundred yards and, leaving his vehicle in the bush,
	moves closer, cautiously, on foot.
<b>	
</b>	THE THIRD HUEY air-drops TWO MEN and TWO WOMEN in S.T.A.R.S.
	uniforms. There are TWELVE COMMANDOS in all... ALPHA TEAM.
	Wesker looks up at the Huey's PILOT, using his radio to speak
	to the man.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			You'll have to rotate or you'll run
			out of fuel, but I want one chopper
			to remain in the air at all times.
			We might need help in a hurry.
<b>	
</b>	A "Roger that", squaks back as the Huey banks away.
<b>	
</b>	Barry looks worried. His instincts are asking... "We might
	need... 'help'".  Against what? We only see this in his eyes,
	he says nothing as...
<b>	
</b>	...Wesker leads the team through the woods, unaware of...
<b>	
</b>	...CHRIS, following behind, crouching around trees and
	bushes, not a trained commando, but comfortable with the
	land, a natural warrior using ancestral instincts.
<b>	
</b>	THE CAMERA TRACKS COMBAT BOOTS as they CRUNCH through the
	low-Lying MIST.. .stopping abruptly when they encounter...
<b>	
</b>	...WEAPONS, AMMO BELTS, bits of SHRDDED UNIFORMS... and
	HUMAN BODY PARTS... strewn all through the surrounding brush,
	remnants of what was obviously a feeding-frenzy.

</b><b>				VICKERS
</b>			Holy... Goh... gaah...
<b>	
</b>	BRAD VICKERS vomits. Unarmed, he's Alpha Team's computer-
	techie. Not a combat soldier, he's a bit of a coward.
<b>	
</b>	Another non-combatant, REBECCA CHAMBERS, is the team's
	medical officer. She digs an ammonia capsule from her
	pack and holds it under Vickers' nose.
<b>	
</b>	RICHARD AIKEN and KENNETH SULLIVAN are buddies, regular
	G.I. Joes, right out of every war movie. Aiken stares at

</b>			You ever eat road-kill, Sullivan?
<b>	
</b><b>				SULLIVAN
</b>			Aiken... a guy with a brain your

<b>	
</b>				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			I'm ready ta shoot somebody.
<b>	
</b><b>				ALKEN
</b>			I'll pass. Shoot Sullivan.
<b>	
</b>	FOREST SPEYER, a wiry Willem Defoe type, finds a bloody BERET
	and brings it to Wesker.  There's an I.D. tag on the brim...
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			(Reading the tag) 'Valentine'. (Beat)
			Radio Washington.  Bravo Team found

<b>	
</b>	In the bushes, Chris overhears, not wanting to believe. He
	sees Wesker angrily pitch Jill's beret into the brush.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			We're goin' in.  Watch your backs.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker advances his troops. When the coast is clear, Chris
	rushes in, picks up the beret, and sees the name tag for
	himself. "Valentine ".
<b>	
</b>	After what happened at the farm... now this... feeling sucker-
	punched, defeated, Chris hangs his head.
<b>	
</b>	One of the HUEYS dips in low.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-18
<b>	
</b>	Chris looks up. The sight of the war machine lifts him from
	defeat... to rage.  His eyes are soft, for the last time, as
	he tucks Jill's beret into his pack.  When he looks up again,
	those eyes have become newly predatory.  He ducks out of
	sight as the helicopter swings lower.
<b>	
</b>	Downdraft from the rotors makes the bushes rustle, catching
	Chris' attention.  He realizes that... it's not just the wind.
	The shrubs are being disturbed by...
<b>	
</b>	SOMETHING DARK which is moving through them.  It pokes
	its head out.  A WOLF! Rake was right.  Chris readies his
	Winchester as the animal stalks forward.
<b>	
</b>	It's not a wolf. It's A DOG. Mottled, its flesh gray,
	covered with rotting lesions... and it has three bleeding
	BULLET HOLES in its belly, chest, neck.
<b>	
</b>	GROWRRR!  It LEAPS at Chris... who fires... BLAM!
<b>	
</b>	Up ahead, Wesker and his commandos freeze.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Who fired? WHO FIRED?
<b>	
</b>	Before anyone can answer, the team is ATTACKED by MORE DOGS
	which BURST out of the surrounding woods...DOBERMANS and
	SHEPHERDS... but something is seriously wrong with all of

	of his bullets hits its target... one of the dogs' heads.
<b>

<b>	
</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			NO! (Shouting) I WANT 'EM ALL
<b>			DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? STAND FAST...
</b><b>			UNTIL THEY ARE ALL DEAD !
</b><b>	
</b>	The dogs don't stand a chance. Alpha Team's firepower is
	overwhelming. But there is a human casualty. JOSEPH FROST
	trips and falls. One of the dogs POUNCES on him, chewing
	out his HEART... through his BACK.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker steps in, RIDDLING the dead man, and the dog, with
	forty rounds from his M-16.
<b>	
</b>	Pg-19
<b>	
</b>	In the next instant, ANOTHER DOG LEAPS at Wesker from behind.
	He hears its snarl... too late.  He dives into the grass...
	too late.  The dog is about to land on him when...
	...it's BLASTED out of mid air by... Barry.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			Even-Steven, boss.  You saved my
			ass in the desert.  I saved yours I
			in Pennsylvania.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker stand, straightening his ever-present sunglasses.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			I don't believe in being... 'Even-
			Steven' with anybody.  A man saves
			my ass...I pay him back.  Before
			this day is over, I'll pay you back,
			Barry.  Just... stick with me, okay?
<b>	
</b>	Wesker checks his equipment belt. Something is missing.
	He looks to where he rolled in the grass. Using a FLASH-
	LIGHT, he finds...
<b>	
</b>	...a small electronic unit the size of a cell-phone. But
	it's not a cell-phone. Whatever it is... Wesker clips it
	onto his belt.
<b>	
</b>	FROM THE BRUSH, Chris sees all this. The guns have gone
	silent. The attack seems to be over. Chris moves stealthily
	to the body of the animal that he shot. It's wearing a
	COLLAR which reads...
<b>	
</b><b>				  SPIKE #26
</b><b>	
</b>	Alongside the I.D., there's a corporate-looking logo... the
	symbol of an UMBRELLA.
<b>	
</b>	GRRROWWWLL! ANOTHER DOG is advancing on Chris. He aims
	his Winchester.  CLICK! The magazine is empty.  No time to
	reload.  The dog is on him.  Chris SCRAMBLES away.  The dog
	BOUNDS after him.
<b>	
</b>	Chris drops to the ground.  Did he trip?  No.  He pushes a
	TREE ROOT, which is FALSE.  It swings open and he dives in,
	pulling the root shut over him.
<b>	
</b>	The dog arrives an instant later.  It lets out an angry
	howl... and is BLOWN AWAY... by RODRIGUEZ, who neither saw
	Chris, nor where he went.
<b>	
</b>	The forest goes dead quiet.  Too quiet.  There's not even
	the chirping of morning birds Wesker is SLAPPED startlingly
	on the back... by Barry.

<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			When you need to know.  Just do
			your job, soldier.  That's what
			I'm doin'.  My job.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker pulls a chain from under his shirt. It holds a card,
	the size of a Visa, like the one Jill found in her secret
	envelope, only Wesker's isn't blue, it's green.
<b>	
</b>	Stepping away from Barry, he slide the card through a slot
	in the iron gate-frame.  BUZZZZ.  The GATES SWING OPEN with
	a rusty SQUEAL.

</b><b>	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MANSION   MORNING
</b><b>

<b>	
</b><b>	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING

	The chandeliers and furniture are covered with sheets that
	ripple on breezes from a thousand faults in the old walls.
	Indistinct NOISES echo within the ceiling, the floor, as
	ALPHA TEAM enters.
<b>

</b><b>	
</b>	Though it's still morning, the windows are sealed over.  No

	dread takes hold of us as...
<b>	
</b>	...dark SHADOWS LURCH...FEET SCRAPE sluggishly... not in
	combat boots, but in Nikes, loafers, Dr. Martens... past an
	accordion GATE of corroded bronze.  A motor HUMS.  Behind
	the gate, an old-fashioned service ELEVATOR rises... but stops
	just below floor level. EYES peer out, waiting for the
	shuffling feet to pass.  Then the car rises the rest of
	the way, revealing its occupant...
<b>	
</b>	Pg-22
<b>	
</b>	...JILL VALENTINE! She's alive! She deactivates the

	gruously modern receptacle. Checking to be sure that the
	coast is clear, she slides the accordion gate aside and
	steps out into the corridor.
<b>	
</b>	With a ghostly MOAN, something LUNGES at her out of the
	shadows. It's A MAN in a lab coat. His skin is ROTTING,
	his teeth SNAPPING, like the dogs'. He tries to BITE Jill,
	not merely to do injury. He seems HUNGRY!
<b>	
</b>	Jill leaps aside, lifting her pistol and FIRING... once,
	twice, three times. The man is shot in the stomach, heart,
	neck...but he keeps coming! Finally, Jill shoots him in the
	head...and he falls.
<b>	
</b>	Jill quickly reloads, on instinct. But as she does it, she
	stares at the corpse, frowning, weighing life-long belief
	against the hideous facts of the moment.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING

	lined with book shelves, but no books. There are doorways
	on all four walls. Wesker pulls out something that looks
	like a Game-Boy. He types on a keypad. A MAP of the mansion
	appears. Wesker scrolls with the arrow-keys. Barry looks
	on very impressed with the high-tech unit.

	HAND pokes out of a drainage ditch beneath the carpet. It
	gropes. Finds purchase on the floor.
<b>	
</b>	Chris is unaware of the danger. He HURLS himself against
	the door. He can't break through.
<b>	
</b>	The thing that climbs out of the ditch was once a man, once
	a SCIENTIST. It's wearing a lab coat and a pair of thick
	EYEGLASSES. But it's long dead. It's... A ZOMBIE.
<b>	
</b>	As it pulls itself up, its eyeglasses strike the side of the
	ditch. They fall, CLATTERING, the rims scraping the zombie's
	cheek, which peels away like onion skin.
<b>	
</b>	Chris hears the noise. Turns and sees...
<b>	
</b>	...the dead man, reaching out hungrily.  Chris is trapped.
	He aims his Winchester. CLICK! He forgot. It's empty.
<b>	
</b>	The zombie pulls itself fully up onto the floor. Chris digs
	in his shoulder bag. Pulls out a handful of bullets and with
	them, accidentally, Jill's BERET. Rising emotion stops him
	for a moment.
<b>	
</b>	The dead man crawls toward him. Chris might not have time
	to load. As he tries to jam a bullet into his rifle, the
	zombie SWATS at him.  Catches the beret.  Looks at it.
	Sniffs it.  The bullet pops out of Chris' nervous fingers.
	He tries to load another.

</b><b>				RIDLEY

<b>	
</b>	...then he drops..
<b>	
</b>	The zombie, in a uniform, once a security guard, gazes dully
	at Chris.  A wet sound comes from inside its gullet as it
	calmly chews on Ridley's flesh.  Swallowing, it reaches out.
	Chris grabs its arms, FLINGS it into the chamber. Then
	FIRES his Winchester, once, putting a HOLE in the thing's
	head. Chris slams the door.

</b><b>	INT   MANSION   DINING ROOM   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	In a Hearst-sized dining room with draped furniture, WESKER
	and the OTHER TROOPERS have heard the new gunfire.
<b>	
</b><b>				SPEYER
</b>			Where'd that come from?
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			Back...where we just were.
<b>	
</b><b>				SPEYER
</b>			Shit, man, we're chasin' our tails!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-26
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS hears the CLATTERING of the troopers heading his way.
	What he doesn't hear is... a slight CRACKLING... in the walls.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	WESKER and his TEAM burst into the corridor with the old-
	fashioned ELEVATOR.  FLASHLIGHTS find... the body of the
	ZOMBIE that was shot by Jill, bullet HOLES allover its body.
<b>	
</b><b>				SPEYER
</b>			Damn. Surnbitch took a lotta lead.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			That's not what killed him. Blood's
			still running. Wounds are fresh.
			But look at his skin. This guy's
			been dead for a couple of days.
<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			He was dead... before he was shot?
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS checks Ridley.  No pulse.  His own rustling movements
	prevent him from hearing... that soft CRACKLING SOUND.
<b>	
</b>	The kitchen is lined with fifty-year-old IVY-PATTERNED
	WALLPAPER.  The printed VINES seem to be MOVING!  Chris
	doesn't notice until the vines begin to WIGGLE furiously...
	and RIP THROUGH the paper.  They're REAL.  Sprouts from
	some sort of exotic plant, that have climbed up the walls...
	with INTELLIGENCE!  They seem aware of Chris' presence.
<b>	
</b><b>				REBECCA (O.S.)
</b>			Ridley?
<b>	
</b>	REBECCA has appeared in an open doorway. Chris looks at her,
	with the tips of the vines beginning to brush his shoulders.
<b>	
</b>				REBECCA (cont.)
			Who... who are...
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			I... I'm one of the good guys, okay
			I'm just trying to...
<b>	
</b><b>				REBECCA
</b>			(Calling) SULLIVAN! AIKEN!
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Shit.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-27
<b>	
</b>	Chris, familiar with the room, opens a SMALL DOOR in the
	wall, barely man-sized, and almost invisible because it's
	covered in matching wallpaper. Chris dives in.
<b>	
</b>	AIKEN and SULLIVAN pop up behind Rebecca, having barely
	caught a glimpse of Chris.
<b>	
</b><b>				AIKEN
</b>			Who was that?
<b>	
</b><b>				SULLIVAN
</b>			Forget him. What are they?
<b>	
</b>	Sullivan points at the vines... which are swirling, groping,
	as if alive, making their way toward Ridley's body.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT  MANSION   CHUTE   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	In a LAUNDRY CHUTE, propping himself against the sides,
	CHRIS descends...down...down... as he did as a child...
	and comes out onto...
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   CRAWL SPACE   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	...a DROP-CEILING, newly installed. Iron frames support
	AIR-FILTRATION SYSTEMS and other heavy MACHINERY. Sheet-
	metal walls have replaced the old soffit and fascia. LIGHT,
	from somewhere below, knifes through gridded iron vents.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Somebody did some major remodeling.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	The VINES continue to advance.
<b>	
</b><b>				REBECCA
</b>			We gotta get him out!
<b>	
</b>	THE TROOPERS rush to retrieve RIDLEY'S BODY. The VINES hover
	around them, occasionally DARTING, then pulling back, as if
	they were timid animals, hungry, but afraid of anew food-
	dish. When AIKEN brandishing his M-16, the VINES RECOIL and
	RETRACT fully... THWIP THWIP THWIP... behind the wallpaper and
	down... somewhere into the bowels of the house.
<b>	
</b><b>				AIKEN
</b>			What? Smart fuckin' plants?
<b>	
</b><b>				SULLIVAN
</b>			No big deal. Most-plants are
			smarter than you, Aiken.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-28
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	THE OTHERS are still puzzling over the DOWNED ZOMBIE.
<b>	
</b><b>				SPEYER
</b>			Why would anyone shoot a dead man?
<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			Lemme guess. Maybe 'cause he was...
			walkin' around?
<b>	
</b>	Barry steps closer to the corpse, notes its collapsed skull.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			Head-shot. We were sprayin' those
			dogs outside... but think about it.
			Were any of 'em brought down without
			a head-shot.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker has been exploring the corridor. Stopping in front
	of the elevator, he shines his light into the car. We expect
	someone... or some-thing... to be lurking inside.
<b>	
</b>	An attack comes from the opposite direction. A FIGURE BURSTS-
	out of the shadows behind Weasker. Another Zombie?  No.  It's
	JILL! In a rage, she holds her pistol to Wesker's head.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			I lost three me.  You killed them,
			Wesker. You did... and I did. Because
			I didn't know what to expect... because
			you... didn't tell me!
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			(Calmly) Tell you what?
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Anything! I wasn't told anything!
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Put down the gun.
<b>	
</b>	Instead, Jill CLICKS the hammer back.
<b>	
</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			Put down the gun.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Not until...
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b><b>			RELEASE! THAT'S AN ORDER, SOLDIER!
</b><b>	
</b>	Jill blinks. Slowly, reluctantly, she lowers her gun.
<b>	
</b>	Pg-29
<b>	
</b>	Wesker turns... and recognizes her.
<b>	
</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			How... did you get in here?
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			(Sarcastic) How ya doin' , Valentine?
			Good to see ya. Glad you're still
			alive. Same here, colonel, I'm...
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			How did you get in here?
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			(Exploding) The same way those fuckin'
			dogs got out! Through their pens!
			(Relaxing some) I... locked them off.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Good thinking.
<b>	
</b>	A VOICE interrupts, from the end of the corridor.
<b>	
</b>				VOICE (o.s.)
<b>			MAN DOWN!
</b><b>	
</b>	The voice is SULLIVAN'S. The troopers run to join him.
	Last to leave the corridor are Wesker and Jill. Wesker
	gestures gallantly.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Ladies first.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Fuck you.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	The TROOPERS trickle into the kitchen to find... REBECCA,
	kneeling over RIDLEY'S CORPSE, examining the ragged bite
	on its neck.
<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			Maybe... they're in the house.
			More of them dogs.
<b>	
</b><b>				REBECCA
</b>			Diameter's too small. It... almost
			looks as if... it was done by a...
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			(Arriving) A human?
<b>	
</b>	Rebecca looks up. The two women make sisterly eye-contact.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-30
<b>				REBECCA
</b>			Yes, but... what kind of... human...
			would do something like this?
<b>	
</b><b>				AIKEN
</b>			Not a vegetarian, that's for sure.
<b>	
</b><b>				SULLIVAN
</b>			Aiken, you'd be better off...
<b>	
</b><b>				REBECCA
</b>			There was a guy. Not part of the
			team. And there was... some kind
			of... plant... that seemed... alive.
<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			Gimme a fuckin' break.
<b>	
</b><b>				AIKEN
</b>			No shit. It disappeared... right
			into the wall.
<b>	
</b>	Rodriguez cringes when she finds a ragged hole in the wall-
	paper near where she's standing.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			I guess it's... time to spill it.
<b>	
</b>	WESKER pulls off his dark glasses for the first time.
<b>	
</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			I don't know... much more than I
			already told you.  I'll tell you
			the rest now.  The labs hare are...
			were...working on special apps for
			bio-eng1neered materials.
<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			Speak English, hombre.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Marcus has been experimenting with
			an artificial... man-made... virus.
			Coded...the 'T'-virus.  Financing
			came from a private corporation, you
			may have heard the name... Umbrella.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			They're... multi-national. Huge.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			So huge that they have... connections...
			in high places.  That's why we're here.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-31
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			This virus... it jumped, right?
<b>	
</b><b>				SPEYER
</b>			Shit! We're all dead! We got the
			bug, and we're all dead!
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			It's not airborne. It was spread...
			in the water supply. Lab animals
			and... the researchers themselves...
			passed it on... by...
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			By... biting.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker hangs his head. It's an affirmation.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			You catch this virus and... what?
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			You die. But... not for long. The
			chemical...revives the brain, and...
<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			You stand back up... and chew on
			the first guy you see.
<b>	
</b><b>				SPEYER
</b>			Christ, this is like... Night of the
			Living Dead!
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			Why, in the name of Jesus, would
			anybody wanna mess with shit...
			that does that shit?
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Victory, friend. Civilization has
			come a long way, but we still have...
			war.  Imagine... a soldier who can't
			die.  That... was the concept.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			But the virus... jumped.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Hopefully... if we got all the dogs...
			we've contained it.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Hopefully?  Jesus... why didn't you
			tell us?
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-32
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			By telling you NOW, I've put your
			lives in jeopardy. Nobody has this
			information. Except a few high-and-
			mightys. Me. And now, you.
<b>	
</b>	The troopers fall silent as all this sinks in.
<b>	
</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			We have to get Marcus out of here.
			He developed this thing. He's the
			only one who... understands it.
<b>	
</b><b>				REBECCA
</b>			I don't know, this all sounds pretty
			shaky to me...
<b>	
</b>	With a lightning move, Wesker draws his pistol and...BLAM!
	FIRES... at Rebecca. She flinches. The bullet flies past
	her and SHATTERS the skull of RIDLEY, the dead trooper who,
	having stood up, was about to attack Rebecca from behind.
	Ridley drops... dead again.
<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			Guess that proves it. A head-shot
			knocks 'em down.
<b>	
</b>	Rebecca turns and looks at the blood-splattered body.
<b>	
</b><b>				REBECCA
</b>			Th-that man.. .was dead. (Freaking)
			I... I'm a doctor! I should know!
			That man was dead!
<b>	
</b>	Vickers reaches in Rebecca's bag, pulls out an ammonia
	capsule, cracks it, and holds it under her nose.
<b>	
</b><b>				VICKERS
</b>			I hope you have a lot of these.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS crawls across the drop-ceiling, into the up-rising
	light from one of the vents. He looks down through the
	grid work and sees...
<b>	
</b>	...the same LABORATORY that was behind Marcus in the opening
	video. No longer pristine, it's wrecked, torn apart. Files
	are scattered everywhere along with smashed fragments of
	furniture and computer hardware.
<b>	
</b>	CAGES that line the walls are filled with LAB ANIMALS making
	NERVOUS CHATTER. Chris watches a MONKEY sip water from a
	dish. Like the other animals, its skin is rotting.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-33
<b>	
</b>	Chris is about to move on, when his eye catches...
<b>	
</b>	...MOVEMENT... outside the cages.  There's A MAN, in a
	lab coat, sitting at a desk, writing on a note pad.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			(Calling) Hey.
<b>	
</b>	CLOSE ON: the man's HAND... flaking, decomposing.  The pen
	it holds is making only random, erratic marks.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
<b>			HEY!
</b><b>	
</b>	The man turns his head, slowly, to look up toward the voice.
	There's NOTHING left of his FACE. RAW TISSUE seeps odd-
	colored fluids. A single eyeball is nested tenuously in
	the ooze. Something like a mouth, recognizable only because
	of its position, opens... and GROANS.
<b>	
</b>	Chris, pumping his Winchester, hears... KRANG! A NOISE from
	below. He looks down again, just as...
<b>	
</b>	...the lab door BURSTS open. WESKER and ALPHA TEAM stream
	into the lab. The thing with. the destroyed face turns toward
	the invaders, stands, and shuffles toward them.
<b>	
</b>	Without hesitation, Wesker, on point, FIRES a quick burst
	into the thing's brain. It drops like a sack. The lab
	animals SHRIEK.
<b>	
</b>	The team files in, not noticing... ANOTHER ZOMBIE... crawling
	across the floor...heading directly for SPEYER. Chris shouts
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont. )
<b>			HEADS UP!
</b><b>	
</b>	He punches out the grate with the barrels of his rifle
	and... BLAM!...punches a sure-fire HOLE in the zombie's head.
<b>	
</b>	BRAD VICKERS, his nerves badly frayed, thinks the team is
	being attacked. He SPRAYS the ceiling with his automatic.
<b>	
</b>	Chris ducks and rolls, narrowly escaping the initial barrage,
	but bullets keep coming, punching a dotted line up through
	the ceiling panels.
<b>	
</b>	Chris scrambles, as fast as he can, his feet barely escaping
	the punch holes.
<b>	
</b>	He finds himself on top of an enormous checkerboard of vents
	and Plexiglas panels. Bullets weaken the framework. It
	sags... then CRACKS, dropping away. Chris is plunged into...
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-34
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   LAB   LEVEL "A" TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	...WATER! CHRIS kicks, paddles with his rifle, righting
	himself, getting his bearings. He's in a huge AQUARIUM
	that's built into one of the laboratory's walls... and he's
	not alone. There are SIX SHARKS in the tank. ZOMBIE SHARKS,
	their flesh rotting, leaking pus.
<b>	
</b>	The largest of them SNAPS at Chris, but its jaws catch only
	a clump of his swirling hair. Chris kicks with his feet,
	remaining upright, and FIRES his wet Winchester.
<b>	
</b>	The bullet wimps-out, restrained by the water. It penetrates
	the shark, but barely. We can see the casing lodged in the
	animal's flesh.
<b>	
</b>	Chris gets an idea. He kicks forward. Plants the barrel
	of his Winchester directly against the aquarium glass...
	only to find himself aiming directly at...
<b>	
</b>	...JILL, who is aiming back at him with her M-16. They're
	both stunned. They stare at each other for a moment, like
	gunfighters, until...
<b>	
</b>	...another shark circles in for an attack. Chris swings the
	Winchester away from Jill and FIRES underwater. The aquarium
	glass CRACKS... but holds.
<b>	
</b>				JILL (cont.)
			Hang on! We're gonna get wet!
<b>	
</b>	Jill FIRES. More CRACKS, but the glass is resistant.
	Chris out. Water SURGES into the lab, knocking Wesker and
	some of his squad down.
<b>	
</b>	They stand up again, only to find themselves knee-high in a
	dark pool...with SHARK FINS slicing the surface. Everybody
	opens fire. The dead fish keep coming.
<b>	
</b><b>				AIKEN
</b>			Where the fuck is a shark's brain?
<b>	
</b><b>				SULLIVAN
</b>			In it's head! I swear, Aiken, you
			would be better off dead.
<b>	
</b>	In a bizarre frenzy, the sharks KICK their tails, making
	startlingly quick turns, darting every which way, SNAPPING
	at the scent of warm flesh. The troopers, hampered by the
	water, SPLASH around wildly, many of them nearly getting
	bitten. The air above thickens with a fog of graphite from
	ten spitting automatics.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-35
<b>	
</b>	The water gets darker as it becomes clouded with BLOOD. But
	thankfully, the level is dropping. The water is seeping out
	through GRATES in the floor. The sharks become more visible,
	moving slower as their bellies scrape the floor.
<b>	
</b>	The troopers pick them off, one by one. The immediate threat
	passes...but as the water drains away, the troopers become
	aware of... a KLAXON-LIKE SOUND. ANOTHER ALARM. The entry
	door glides shut with a BOOOMMM!
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Nice. Very NICE, Valentine! You
			set off a containment breach!
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			It must have been the water. God,

	his "Game-Boy"... getting no response.
<b>	
</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			We can go in deeper.  But we can't

<b>

	shatters into bits.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-36
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			That was a smart move.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker bristles. He's about to confront Chris, but he spots
	his sunglasses where they were deposited on a floor grate by
	the water. He walks over and picks them up, wiping the
	lenses on his shirt. Without looking at Chris, he asks...
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			And... you are?
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Nobody.  Just a...a local guy...
<b>	
</b>	Chris spots a dry lab-coat hanging on a wall hook. He takes
	it down and uses it to dry his rifle.
<b>

	Barry rushes over and looks at the monitor screen.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			A map. Same as on your gizmo. Exits
			marked...blue and green.
<b>

</b>			The greens are the overrides. (To
			Brad) Can you print this out?

</b><b>				VICKERS

	He wrings out the cloth and, using the lab coat, wipes the
	bullets dry.

			(Off the screen) We're on level 'A'.

</b>				WOMAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
			Please...please.. .if anyone is

<b>	
</b>	Brad limps around the desk and spins the monitor for the

	Behind her is a lab we haven't seen yet... with white-

	from ABOVE.
<b>	
</b>	In the next instant... SPLAT... the lens is COATED WITH BLOOD!
	As it oozes down, we see a partial image of the same MAN.
	His HEAD is OUT OF FRAME at the top of the screen.
<b>	
</b>	The thing above must have a hold on it... because the man is
	DANGLING, his arms witching. His back has three GOUGES in
	it, long and so deep that they might have been made by
	piece of heavy machinery. We only see this for an instant...
	before the man is LIFTED, straight UP, with amazing SPEED.
<b>

	look up above their heads.
<b>

	shoulder. The two figures fall to the floor, grappling.
	Wesker can't get a clean shot.

</b>	Marini is first to reach the desk, but he helps the limping
	Brad up ahead of him. TWO MORE ZOMBIES lurch in through the
	open doorway. Wesker shoots them, but he sees MORE... can't
	tell how many...shambling toward the open doorway from the
	darkness beyond.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker focuses on Fox, who is still being MAULED, BITTEN.
	Fox SCREAMS. Wesker still has no safe shot.
<b>	
</b>	Brad is YANKED up into ceiling by SULLIVAN and AIKEN. CHRIS
	leans out of the opening, reaching for Marini.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker KICKS the mauling zombie in the head. It takes three
	hard BOOTS to attract the thing's attention. When it finally
	looks up at him, Wesker BLOWS out its skull.
<b>	
</b>	Fox is lying on his stomach, writhing, BLEEDING profusely
	from a half-dozen bites. Wesker stoops down, trying to roll
	him over, lift him up. Fox resists. He's gone insane.
<b>	
</b>	Chris pulls Marini up to safety. BARRY leans down through
	the opening.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			Haul ass, boss!
<b>	
</b>	The zombies are heading for Wesker. There are three of them.
	Barry shoots at the one in front. Misses. His second shot
	hits the thing's brain.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker again tries to hoist Fox who, this time rolls over on
	his own. He has drawn his pistol. Before Wesker can stop
	him, he eats the barrel and BLOWS out the back of his head.
<b>	
</b>	One zombie is dangerously close. Barry fires two more
	rounds. No head shot, but the zombie staggers and, though
	not dead, FALLS...directly toward Wesker. The colonel rolls
	on his back, kicking himself away, managing to get clear.
	He uses his own pistol to BLAST the zombie.
<b>	
</b>	He scrambles to his feet, darts toward the desk, and jumps
	up. The third zombie grabs his legs. From above, Barry
	risks a dangerous shot. BLAM! Wesker hears the bullet
	WHIZZZ past his head like a mosquito.
<b>	
</b>	The zombie is hit in the skull. It drops. There are MORE
	of them coming out of the darkness. Barry takes hold of
	Wesker and, with a single strong arm, pulls him up into...
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

<b>	
</b>	A horrible MOANING SOUND comes from below, in the lab.
	THREE MORE ZOMBIES can be seen clustering around the desk,
	dumbly trying to climb up, sensing the "food" above.
<b>	
</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			Let's move.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker takes off. SPEYER, RODRIGUEZ, AIKEN and SULLIVAN are
	quick to follow. The others lag behind when CHRIS says...
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Those things could get up here.
			We can't let that happen. This

<b>	
</b>	Chris swings his legs through the grate and JUMPS down...
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	...ONTO THE DESK. He BOOTS one of the ZOMBIES away and
	tries to LEAP over the others. One of them catches his foot
	in mid air. CHRIS isn't hurt, but he TOPPLES to the floor,
	sprawling, losing his Winchester.
<b>	
</b>	The zombies have him cornered. He crawls toward his rifle.
	Reaches it. Pumps a shell into the firing chamber. Aims
	at the closest of the walking dead...
<b>	
</b>	...which was once a young man, a simple laborer, wearing
	overalls, with a name tag...

<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			Caruso! Can you hear me?

<b>	
</b>	Chris has come late to the realization that these things
	were once human. Now he comes late to the realization...
	that they are human no longer.
<b>	
</b>	The zombie grabs the barrel of the Winchester, pushing it
	aside. Chris can't bring it back to bear on the monster's
	head. He BLASTS a round through the thing's belly. It has
	no effect. The zombie reaches for Chris' throat. Starts to
	lean in to bite him.
<b>	
</b>	BLAM! The thing's skull explodes. JILL has jumped down
	onto the desk. She FIRES another accurate pistol round.
	The SECOND ZOMBIE falls.
<b>	
</b>	Jill leaps to the floor and starts to push the desk. Chris
	gets to his feet, rushing in to help her. Together, they
	shove the desk out from under the open ceiling grate.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Thank you.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Any time. How do we get back UP?
<b>

</b>			Shit, if you didn't have a plan, you

			people were down here? How...
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b><b>			HOW DO WE GET UP?
</b><b>	
</b>	With a startling SOUND, A DARK SHAPE swing down from above
	and GRABS Jill! Is it the thing we saw on the video?
<b>	
</b>	No. It's BARRY! His mighty arms lift Jill. She's caught
	by Aiken and Sullivan and pulled up to safety. Barry grabs
	Chris and lifts him as well.

	ends up with a CHUNK of something in its mouth.
<b>

	a small sensor on the end.
<b>	
</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			I'll put a crater in this forest that

	outside. It's got a lock mechanism. Blue.

</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			Not an override. My key won't work
			here on the way out. Prop the door.
<b>	
</b>	The troopers drag a heavy crate over to hold the door open.
	Wesker moves out. The commandos trickle after him. Chris
	holds Jill behind for a moment.
<b>

	clustered at a blind alley which has two doors.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			(Checking his map) It's not clear...
			which way to go.
<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			Want me to flip a coin?
<b>	
</b>	WESKER is annoyed by the remark. Decisively, he selects one
	of the doors and uses his green key card. With a BZZZZ, the
	lock releases. The troop enters...
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   SYSTEMS CENTER   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	...a vast ROOM, fifty-by-fifty yards. It's filled with
	HEATERS, AIR CONDITIONERS, WATER PUMPS. MAIN FRAMES for
	the internal computer network line one wall, FUSE BOXES
	and SWITCHER PANELS another. This is the systems center
	for the entire facility.
<b>	
</b>	There's an attendant's desk just inside the door. AIKEN
	and SULLIVAN drag it over to prop the door open. It makes
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-54
<b>	
</b>	a frightening SOUND as it scrapes the floor, echoing,
	bouncing around in the large space. It prompts a response...
	another of those animal-like SNARLS from somewhere in the
	distance.
<b>	
</b><b>				SULLIVAN
</b>			What's that sound like to you?
<b>	
</b>				AlKEN
			A meat-eater.
<b>	
</b>	There are thick columns, floor to ceiling, every ten feet.
	The spaces between them are very dark. It's hard to see.
	WESKER and some of the OTHERS click on their FLASHLIGHTS .
	Beams cut through dust.
<b>	
</b>	There are ELECTRONIC HUMS.. CLICKS and CHATTERS emit from
	the switchers, PINGS from the heaters, all combining to fray
	everyone's nerves. Light beams dance nervously as the
	commandos start out across the dark and frightening space.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			(Softly to Jill) This is the heart
			of the whole place. They've got to
			have it... protected somehow.
<b>	
</b>	Two things happen, almost at once. First.. .CHRIS notices
	ELECTRIC EYES... on all of the columns.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
<b>			DUCK! HIT THE DECK!
</b><b>	
</b>	Second. A ZOMBIE lurches around a corner and BITES a chunk
	out of MARINI'S face. JILL whirls around to shoot at the
	zombie, but Chris grabs her and FLATTENS her on the floor.
<b>	
</b>	Marini, staggering, screaming in pain, triggers the first
	electric eye. LASER BEAMS shoot in all directions, forming
	a tight NET. Chris and Jill are barely beneath them.
	Many of the other troopers are hit by the beams... which do
	no immediate harm... but wherever they make contact, small
	CYLINDERS above the electric eyes begin to HISS.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
<b>			FOR CHRISSAKE, GET DOWN!
</b><b>	
</b>	The commandos duck under the laser beams... just in time.
	Jets of STEAM spout from the cylinders. It's not just hot
	steam. It's ACIDIC, deadly.
<b>	
</b>	Marini is hit by it. His clothes IGNITE. His flesh BOILS.
	It's a horrible sight, but for the moment, the jets stop.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-55
<b>	
</b>	Marini is dead on his feet. When he falls, he trips another
	of the laser beams. The steam jets SPOUT again. The troop
	is beneath them, though many are burned by liquid drops that
	spit from the nozzles.
	Amazingly, the zombie has avoided contact. But as it begins
	to stumble after commandos, we realize it's going to activate
	the sensors again.
<b>	
</b><b>				SULLIVAN
</b>			There's no way outta this mousetrap!
<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			So we live here now?
<b>	
</b><b>				SPEYER
</b>			We gotta run for it.
<b>	
</b>	The zombie hits one of the laser beams. The steam HISSES
	out again. The zombie is MELTED.
<b>	
</b><b>				AIKEN
</b>			Bad idea, Speyer.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Down. Through these.
<b>	
</b>	Chris has noticed a series of hinged panels in the floor.
<b>	
</b><b>				VICKERS
</b>			Where do they go?
<b>	
</b><b>				SULLIVAN
</b>			Does it matter?
<b>	
</b>	Sullivan whips out a Swiss Army knife and goes to work on
	the screws that hold down one of the panels. Other troopers
	do the same.
<b>	
</b>	Another ZOMBIE lurches out of the darkness. And ANOTHER.
<b>	
</b>	Human hands work furiously, loosening screws. Panels come
	up, Troopers begin to duck through the openings.
<b>	
</b>	A second zombie hits a red beam. STEAM again. Chris and
	Jill are spattered. Burned. But Jill bravely keeps working
	with her own issued knife. She gets a panel open. As she
	drops through, a third zombie triggers a burst of steam.
	Chris ducks and covers.
<b>	
</b>	When the jets stop, Chris begins to climb into the opening,
	but one of his legs is GRABBED from behind by...
<b>	
</b>	...one of the dead things which has already been MELTED!
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-56
<b>	
</b>	Its flesh is bubbling. Bone is beginning to show. But
	the acid hasn't reached its brain yet. The creature is
	still alive.
<b>	
</b>	Chris CRIES out. Acid from the zombie's hands is burning
	his leg. The thing's lips have been eaten away, making its
	teeth look frighteningly skeletal as it leans forward for a
	bite of flesh. Chris jams the stock of his Winchester into
	the zombie's mouth. He's able to hold the thing's head back,
	but he's stuck. He can't let go.
<b>	
</b>	Jill pops up out of the floor. She presses the barrel of her
	own weapon into the zombie's forehead.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			On three...
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			One... two...
<b>	
</b>	Chris pulls his rifle away. At the same instant, Jill FIRES.
	The zombie is PROPELLED through the air. One of its flailing
	arms triggers another laser beam. Chris throws himself in on
	top of Jill as STEAM HISSES over them.
<b>	
</b>	Twenty yards away, Wesker crawls under the cloud of acid.
	Just as he climbs down through one of the openings, he feels
	pressure...on his ear.
<b>	
</b>	A groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the
	wire that runs from the detonator to Wesker's ear-piece.
	For a breathless moment, it seems like the sensor will be
	popped loose. Holding the pulse-reader in place, Wesker
	twists his body, lifts his hand gun, and PUMPS THREE into
	the dead thing's brain.
<b>	
</b>	The zombie flops over, but its fingers cling, entangled, in
	the wire. Wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles
	of the thing's dead hand. THREE MORE SHOTS cut through bone,
	removing the fingers from the hand. The wire is freed.
	Wesker dives into the opening in the floor.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT   AIR DUCT   TIMELESS

</b>	The COMMANDOS find themselves in an AIR DUCT. No room to
	stand. Hardly room to sit.
<b>	
</b>	Chris looks at his rifle stock. It's corroded from the acid
	in the zombie's mouth. Jill notices.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			God...and it doesn't even stop them...
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-57
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			It's not meant to stop them. It's
			meant to stop...something else.
<b>	
</b>	That distant SNARLING SOUND comes again, making Jill shiver.
	The troop is strung out along the metal shaft. REBECCA
	crawls among them, treating the worst burns. WESKER checks
	his maps. SPEYER confronts him again.
<b>	
</b><b>				SPEYER
</b>			We damn near got turned into Rice
			Krispies by that gizmo of yours.
			If you don't want me to nail that
			fuckin' thing into your ear, you
			deactivate it. Right now.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			I can't. They.. .fixed it... so you
			can't chicken out. The system can
			only be turned off at the main panel.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			Where the hell is that?
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Where the explosives are. Down...
			farther than we need to go. We only
			have to make it down one more level.
			If... when... we make it back up to
			the choppers... we can fly out of

<b>	
</b>	Chris calls out from the far end of the shaft
<b>	 
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			I'm not willing to rely on that.
			I live here, this is my town!
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			The town's been evacuated. Just...
			just in case.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			That explains the lie. About the
			plane crash. An airplane down...
			with weapons on board... would nicely
			explain a big explosion, wouldn't it?
			You figured all along you might have
			to blow this place!
<b>

</b>			I don't want to do it. I... I hope
			I don't have to.
<b>	
</b><b>

<b>	
</b>	Chris looks down the dim air-shaft, unable to see Wesker's
	eyes, hidden by distance.. .and by his dark glasses.
<b>	
</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			That's the best I can do for you,
			kid. Good faith. Now... let's
			knock on it.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker moves out. The troop follows.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			I...I can't let this happen. I've
			got to find that bomb.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			I'll help. Once Wesker gets what
			he wants, my obligation is over.
<b>	
</b>	Chris looks at her with appreciative eyes .
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			No. I want you out. With the
			rest of them. Wesker won't push
			the button until you're clear.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			He doesn't want to push the button.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			He has to. Don't you see? He can't
			leave these labs here. And, Jesus...
			walking corpses! He's gotta get rid
			of the evidence.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   AIR SHAFT   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	The light is dim at its best. Long stretches of the shaft
	are pitch black, and there's a constant stream of air that
	MOANS eerily. This whole mission has been like a descent
	into Hell, darker and more frightening with each level down.
<b>	
</b>	There are turn-offs, "T"s and "Y"s. At one point, when JILL
	looks back, she finds ROSIE behind her. Chris is gone. Did
	he leave to deal with the bomb?
<b>	
</b>	No, but he's about to. He's at the rear of the pack, pressed
	against the side-wall, waving others past.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL

<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS

<b>	
</b>	Jill starts back toward Chris, but freezes.. .everyone freezes
	when... the duct-work starts to PING.
<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			Shit. One thing after another.
<b>	
</b>	BOOM! The air shaft is ROCKED, as if punched by a giant
	fist. Then...the whole structure begins to SHIMMY. What
	is it, an earthquake?
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Sit tight. Ride it out.
<b>	
</b>	GRONK! A sheet-metal panel BUCKLES! Others do the same.
	All along the shaft, panels begin to FOLD INWARD. Something
	outside is CRUSHING the duct as if it were a giant tube of
	toothpaste. And the troopers are being SQUEEZED inside.
<b>	
</b>	RIVETS POP! The panels begin to SEPARATE...and large,
	pulsing bits of FLESH appear! Not animal flesh. But the
	flesh of A PLANT! The things that press in through the
	openings are larger versions of the vines we saw in the
	kitchen. Those were its fingertips. These are its ARMS.
	Strong arms that are RIPPING the ductwork apart.
<b>	
</b>	Chris, Rebecca, Aiken and Sullivan end up in one part of the
	shaft. The rest in another... including Jill, who calls out.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b><b>			CHRIS!
</b><b>	
</b>	The section that holds Chris' group FALLS AWAY... with a
	monstrous, CRUNCHING sound.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   ARBORETUM   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS' GROUP spills out of the dangling metal, with cables
	from the torn ceiling...TZZZZZT...SPARKING around them.
	The troopers drop out of Hell, into...PARADISE.
<b>	
</b>	An enormous HOT HOUSE, a lush, indoor JUNGLE of PLANTS,
	IVIES, GRASSES. It's like a RAIN FOREST, complete with
	a thick, damp MIST that makes it difficult to see. We might
	be on another planet. None of the foliage seems indigenous
	to Earth. There are LEAVES the size of bed sheets, FLOWERS ,
	the size of armchairs. And at the center of it all, is the
	mother of the deadly vines...
<b>	
</b>	...PLANT 42, a monstrous schefflera, twenty times normal
	size. Most of its limbs reach upward, where they have opened
	CRACKS in the ceiling and walls, to stretch on into the
	facility above. There are also dozens of shorter, beefier
	"arms", each of which act independently, like tentacles on
	an octopus... and each has a large, drooling POD at its tip.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-60
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	BURSTS OF GUNFIRE from three M-16s shatter our ears... and
	a ceiling VENT. WESKER and THE OTHERS jump down into...
<b>	
</b>	...a very unusual CORRIDOR. It seems to stretch forever, in
	both directions. It has no doors, no visible means of exit
	or entry. The walls are made-up of multi-colored polymer
	TILES, whose irregular shapes fit together like a JIGSAW
	PUZZLE. The floor is HEAVY STEEL, though faceted. It seem
	designed to shift. The whole corridor looks like it might be
	able to bend, to change position, like an airport jet way.
<b>	
</b>	There are disconcerting signs of damage...claw-like GOUGES on
	the tiles, clean cut HOLES punched through the metal ceiling,
	larger in diameter than any that might have been caused by
	bullets.
<b>	
</b>	And there are smears of BLOOD everywhere, as if some terrible
	battle... or battles...took place here.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			This way. (He starts off.)
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			No. That way.  Chris and the others...
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			If they're dead, they're dead. If
			they're alive, they'll still be alive
			in twenty minutes. When we get back.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Maybe not. And how do we know it's
			only going to be twenty minutes?
			How do we know we'll be able to come
			back this way?
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			We don't. But we'll do our damndest
			to try. This is it, guys. The home
			stretch. Let's go.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker trots off. Vickers and Rodriguez follow. Speyer and
	Barry hang back... with Jill, who remains torn.
<b>	
</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			(Looking back) Valentine. You're
			on the clock! Fall in!
<b>	
</b>	Jill wrestles with her emotions but, in the end, dutifully,
	she "falls in".
<b>	
</b>	As the troopers move off, we hear odd SCRATCHING SOUNDS...
	with the high-pitched SQUEAL of metal-on-metal.

<b>

</b>			Th-this thing was no accident.
			It was cultivated!
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			And it didn't rip out the ceiling
			for the fun of it. Stay alert.
<b>	
</b>	The plant seems to behave intelligently, with caution. The
	pods on its "arms" dart, almost as if sniffing... then pull
	back...like the vines in the kitchen, like timid animals.
<b>	
</b>	Chris spots A DOORWAY.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			Here.
<b>	
</b>	As the others follow him, one of the pods swoops down in
	front of REBECCA, and doesn't withdraw. It hovers there.
	Its follicle's open like jaws, which display serrated daggers
	of cartilage that look like teeth. Inside, a pulsing calyx
	emits a pistil that twitches and swells.
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	ANOTHER POD swoops down on Sullivan's back. Its BEAK clamps
	onto the flesh between his shoulder blades. It's PISTIL
	shoots out like a hypodermic needle, stabs him and, within
	the blink of an eye, SUCKS out every ounce of the man's
	blood. His skin turns the color of PARCHMENT, FLAKING OFF
	HIM like powder, as he dies.
<b>	
</b><b>				AIKEN
</b>			Sullivan! JESUS, SULLIVAN!
<b>	
</b>	Aiken rushes to his buddy's side.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Get out of the away!
<b>	
</b>	Chris launches himself off a stone retaining wall around one
	of the gardens. Leaping up, he grabs one of the SPARKING
	CONDUITS and pulls it down.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-62
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			Get OUTA THERE, AIKEN!
<b>	
</b>	Chris ends up having to shoulder Aiken out of the way.
	Tendrils from the plant very nearly get both of them, but
	Chris manages to JAM the semi-rigid conduit into a pool of
	sprinkler-fed WATER around the plant's roots.
<b>	
</b>	A BRIGHT CURRENT stutters through every vine. The plant
	SHRIEKS, hideously, as electricity causes fluids to SQUIRT
	from boils that develop on its flesh, down along its "arms",
	and into its blood-sucking pods...which FLOP, lifeless, to
	the floor, with the same sort of liquid SMACKS that human
	skulls might make.
<b>	
</b><b>				AIKEN
</b>			They.. .they killed Sullivan. The
			bastards... whoever did this shit...
			they KILLED SULLIVAN!
<b>	
</b>	Enraged, Aiken draws a long-bladed KNIFE and wildly attacks
	the remains of Plant 42, slashing at the thing's dead limbs,
	not stopping until he cuts into...
<b>	
</b>	...something that looks like a vine...but BLEEDS RED!
	Aiken traces the thing with his eyes, up to where it's
	coiled in high tree branches. It's the oversized body...
	...of A COPPERHEAD, with a belly SIX FEET in diameter.
	As Aiken gasps, spellbound, he's STUCK from behind.
<b>	
</b>	The snake is so long, its body is draped on one side of the
	greenhouse, but its head is on the other. With the power
	of a dozer-shovel..JAWS like the open hood of a Cadillac...
	TEETH the size of windows...CLAMP onto Aiken's mid-section,
	instantly CRUSHING his ribs.
<b>	
</b>	Chris finds a skein of ROPE. He throws the long end over a
	ceiling beam, then instantly makes a LASSO out of the piece
	in _is hand and tosses the loop at the snake's head .
<b>	
</b>	Aiken's body, in the serpent's jaws, makes the rope miss.
	Chris throws again. In the seconds between tosses, the snake
	has SLURPED Aiken into its mouth. The rope encircles the
	beast's head. Chris pulls. The noose slips down over the
	snake's maxillaries and tightens around its neck. Chris uses
	all his strength. With the ceiling beam as a pulley, the
	snake's head is SLAMMED against the rafters.
<b>

</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
<b>			GET IN HERE, SOLDIER!
</b><b>	
</b>	In this crisis, Chris finds himself sounding a lot like
	Wesker. It sobers him. It sobers Rebecca, as well. She
	rushes in and takes hold of the rope.
<b>	
</b>	Moving fast, Chris rushes to where Aiken's knife dropped
	on the floor. He grabs it, turns back, and sees...
<b>	
</b>	...something MOVING inside the snake's beaded torso. It's
	Aiken... still alive.
<b>	
</b>	Chris charges, PLUNGES the knife into the beast, hacking
	through layers of fat until he reaches a bloody CAVITY.
<b>	
</b>	Aiken is curled within, like Jonah in the Whale. His chest
	has been crushed to half its normal size. Acids from the
	monster's intestine have begun to eat through flesh on his hands,
	his face, but he's still conscious, able to wheeze-out words.
<b>	
</b><b>				AIKEN
</b>			K-kill me. S-Sullvan said...I'd
			be.. .better off dead. That...ain't
			never been truer than now. Kill me!
<b>	
</b>	The snake uses all its strength to lower its head from the
	ceiling. Rebecca hangs bravely onto the rope, but she's
	LIFTED, bodily, off the floor.
<b>	
</b>	The rope SNAPS, cut by the steel beam. Rebecca falls. The
	trailing edge of the noose catches on twisted debris. It
	delays the snake for two seconds.
<b>	
</b>	Those fragile seconds give Chris just enough time to reach
	into the open belly of the monster...and pull the PINS on
	TWO GRENADES that dangle from Aiken's vest.
<b>	
</b>	The giant copperhead SNAPS at Chris from behind, missing him
	by inches. He dives, like a wide-receiver reaching for a
	pass. What he catches is...
<b>	
</b>	...Rebecca's arm. His momentum carries her down to the
	floor. They roll behind another STONE WALL that contains
	tons of earth, which protects them from...
<b>	
</b>	...BOO-BOOOOOM!... the explosions of the grenades... which blow
	Aiken... and yards of the snake's mid-section...into eternity.

<b>	
</b><b>				REBECCA
</b>			Not very old at all. Not nearly
			old enough to...to...
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			None of us is old enough for that.
<b>	
</b>	Rebecca nods, forcing a smile meant to be appreciative.
<b>	
</b><b>				REBECCA
</b>			Jill... told me... you were nice .
<b>

</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	Down in the corridor, the other TROOPERS see...
	...faintly in the dusty reaches of the dark... AGILE SHAPES
	advancing... not along the floor, but along the CEILING!
	They look like apes, swinging from... What could they be
	swinging from? The ceiling is solid metal.
<b>	
</b>	CLOSE ON: A MONSTROUS HAND, both hairy, and scaly. It's
	fingers have ten-inch claws.. .more like horns... which PUNCH
	upward, penetrating the ceiling metal, and clamping on.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-66
<b>	
</b>	THE SHOT WIDENS to reveal A BEAST, unlike any we've seen,
	dangling from the ceiling. It is ape-like... and lizard-
	like. With ferocious eyes that glare from beneath an insect-
	like carapace. This thing is an amalgam of all the nasty
	creatures that have pursued us in our nightmares. It's
	called... A HUNTER.
<b>	
</b>	There are SIX OF THEM... as far as we can see, there might be
	more coming from behind. Their three-toed feet also have
	claws that can pierce the ceiling, enabling them to move
	forward... hand over foot, foot over hand.
<b>	
</b>	One of them lets out a GRRROWLLLL! The same sound we've
	been hearing through the walls. Now it echos in the
	corridor, up close and personal. The troopers open fire,
	even before the creatures get in range.

</b><b>	INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS and REBECCA hear the gunfire.

</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Hurry.
<b>	
</b>	Chris crawls on. Rebecca is stopped when... TCHUNNNNGGG !
	One of the HUNTERS' CLAWS PUNCHES up through the floor ,
	almost stabbing her. Rebecca SCREAMS. In the tight space,
	Chris is barely able to reach back and take her hand.
<b>	
</b>	TCHUNNNNGG! TGG! More CLAWS penetrate the metal.
	The couple plunge ahead of them, the way Chris plunged
	ahead of the bullets on Level "A".
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	WESKER, JILL and the OTHERS spit lead at the advancing
	creatures. Bullets THUNK into their bodies. Blood flows,
	but the creatures seem to feel no pain. Even when they're
	hit squarely in their skulls.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			Head shots. Ain't doin' nothin'!
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			That was the idea.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY

</b>			To win. The idea was... to win.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-67
<b>	
</b>	Jill aims at one of the hunters, pressing the trigger of
	her M-16, and not letting go until her clip runs out.
	The creature's head is turned RAGGED by the barrage...
	revealing an iron SUPERSTRUCTURE beneath the skin.
<b>	
</b>				VOICE (o.s.)
			Now that... is a metal-head.
<b>	
</b>	Jill looks up. CHRIS jumps out of the open grate in the
	ceiling. REBECCA jumps down after him.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			What d'ya think? Should I wait
			for orders, or just wing it?
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Wing it!
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			You know...that just might be
			the ticket. Wing the fuckers.
<b>	
</b>	Chris takes a careful SHOT with-his Winchester. He hits one
	of the Hunters squarely on its WRIST...which SNAPS. The
	creature drops to the floor.
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			Forget the head shots. They're
			useless. Shoot for the joints.
			The JOINTS!
<b>	
</b>	Rebecca opens FIRE with Aiken's M-16, giving the others time
	to reload. Barry is the first to resume firing...at the
	closest of the Hunters... at its wrists, which are SNAPPED
	by the bullets. The creature drops to the floor.
<b>	
</b>	The troopers fire at KNEES, ANKLES, ELBOWS, which seem to
	be the weakest spots. More of the hunters drop from the
	ceiling...but they continue to advance, crawling, pushing
	themselves forward with whatever limbs remain intact.
<b>	
</b><b>				SPEYER
</b>			Run! We slowed 'em down. Run!
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			Where? As far as we'll get, either
			way, is a cement wall.
<b>	
</b>	There are two hunters left on the ceiling. One of them makes
	a mighty, impossible LUNGE... and hits Speyer like a battering
	ram, slashing his CHEST OPEN with its claws.
<b>	
</b>	Two of the hunters on the floor rush forward, not attacking,
	but wanting to feed on Speyer's remains.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-68
<b>	
</b>	Brad, trembling, completely crazed, drops his weapon and
	backs away. He sees...one of those jigsaw tiles, a RED
	one, GLOW from within. He thinks he's hallucinating until...
<b>	
</b>	...the floor JERKS, in a tight spasm. Its steel facets
	begin to separate, sliding away from each other. The
	troopers narrowly escape as.. .
<b>	
</b>	...the floor behind them GRINDS, in and out, left and right,
	as if it were CHEWING. Speyer's body, and those of the
	hunters on the floor, are EATEN by the powerful steel blades.
	But one hunter remains above it all. TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG,
	it continues to advance along the ceiling.
<b>	
</b>	An invisible, JIGSAWED DOOR glides open twenty yards down
	the hall. The troopers run for it, and are met by a
	beautiful Asian scientist... the woman we saw on the video
	playback... ADA WONG.

	and wall. Mucous from its nostrils spits through.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-69
	After a terrifying moment, the claw recedes. The dark
	snout disappears. The snorting fades away. Followed by
	a distant...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...as the hunter departs.
	Everyone relaxes, visibly.
<b>	
</b>	The troopers turn and, for the first time, notice two haggard
	SCIENTISTS standing across the room.
<b>	
</b><b>				ADA

			take him.
<b>	
</b>	Ada stares at a complicated control panel.
<b>	
</b>				ADA (cont.)
			I only saw it used that one time.

<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			You did fine, lady. We're obliged.

</b>			You knew.. .about the bomb?
<b>	
</b><b>				ADA
</b>			The end for a place like this, when

<b>

			But now... that you are here... the

<b>

<b>

<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			How fortunate... that I am.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker steps over to the wall and inserts his green card into
	the slot. The panel slides open. Beyond it is a steel door
	with another green slot. Wesker uses his card again. A lock
	CLICKS. Wesker pushes the door open.
<b>	
</b>				WESKER (cont.)
			Barry. Come with me. The rest of

			close. Remember...
<b>	
</b>	Wesker taps his ear-piece. Everyone gets his meaning. He
	and Barry disappear through the opening. The steel door

<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Oh, yes, this is exactly like me.

</b>	Until now, Wesker has been steadfast. He suddenly seems

</b><b>	INT   SAFETY CHAMBER   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	WESKER and BARRY arrive at a set of PLEXIGLASS DOORS. They
	can't see through them, they're FOGGED. Wesker finds a key
	slot, inserts his access card, and...
<b>	
</b>	...WHOOSH... the doors open. A CLOUD OF HYPER-COLD MIST
	rushes out, instantly coating the men in FROST. Wesker
	doesn't feel the cold. He doesn't feel anything, except
	a surge of triumph. He steps through the opening into...
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT "D" LAB TIMELESS
</b><b>	
</b>	...a laboratory that looks like-the cockpit of a Concorde...
	only a hundred times larger.. Nothing is, recognizable, except
	desks that hold futuristic-Ibokin computers. A befuddling
	array of BUTTONS, SWITCHES, stuttering LIGHTS, covers every
	inch of wall space.
<b>	
</b>	And at the center of it all stands a tall, cylindrical TANK,
	a stasis tube, filled with ICE. It's mounted on a six-foot
	tall platform, like an altar, with cables and flexible tubes
	running out of it. Wesker squints, and through the freeze,
	sees the thing that stands sedated within the cylinder...
<b>	
</b>	...THE TYRANT. It's nine feet tall. Like the hunters, it
	has more or less human form, though it's musculature is more
	defined than Superman's. One of its arms is scaled to size,
	but the other is much longer. Its hand dangles at knee-
	level. Monstrous steel CLAWS depend from its fingers,
	nearly touching the floor.
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			(In awe) It's called... the Tyrant.
			Nobody knows it exists. Except us...
			and Holden.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			Holden?

<b>	
</b>	Laying down his automatic, WESKER hits computer keys until

<b>

			YES! This is it!
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			What about the antidote?
<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Antidote? (Laughing) There is no

</b>	Neither man notices... that the removal of the master disk has
	caused certain systems to fail... indicated by red lights, and

	at the monster with awe...and terror.
<b>	
</b>				JILL (cont.)

	takes a defensive post beside her c.o.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			And I was gonna try to disarm the

			It needs to be destroyed!
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>				WESKER
</b>			Gotcha, son. It's only because
			of Valentine, here, that I didn't
			squeeze the trigger.

<b>	
</b>				JILL (cont.)
			I...can't yell you, Chris...how much
			I wanted...things to have turned out
			differently. (Beat) Goodbye.
<b>	
</b>	Swiftly, unexpectedly, Jill snatches the detonator wire and
	pulls the sensor out of Wesker's ear.
<b>	
</b>	Everyone shuts their eyes, expecting to be blown sky-high.
<b>	
</b>	Nothing happens.
<b>	
</b>	Jill pulls the detonator off Wesker's belt. She stares
	small LED screen which reads... 14:42:16... 15... 14...
<b>	
</b>				JILL (cont.)
			Shit. I got all my courage up...
			and we still have fifteen minutes!
<b>	
</b>	Jill tosses the detonator to Chris. Wesker turns on her,
	lifting his M-16...
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			You shoot. I shoot, boss.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker turns to find Barry's weapon aiming at his belly.
<b>	
</b>				BARRY (cont.)
			Shit.. here I am still callin'
			you 'boss'.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker is holding the data-disk. Suddenly, he feels it
	snatched away...by Ada, who has rushed into the room.
<b>	
</b>	He aims his weapon at her back as she darts away. Before
	he can fire, he's KICKED in the head... by Jill. Buckling,
	dazed, he looks up at her.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			We believed in you. I believed
			in you. Boy, was I a sucker.
<b>	
</b>	She kicks him again, just for the hell of it. He flops on
	the floor, his eye-socket swollen. He's dropped his gun.
<b>	
</b>	He gropes for it. Barry steps in and boots it away.
<b>	
</b>	A KLAXON SOUNDS! Emergency!
<b>	
</b>	The ice in the Tyrant's tank has melted down to a critical
	level. The monster... is beginning to MOVE.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-78
<b>	
</b>	Reaching the doorway, Ada hears a mechanism TRIP in the jamb.
	The Plexiglas doors begin to slide shut. Ada strains to

<b>	
</b><b>				ADA
</b>			Get out! Now! Or you never will!
<b>	
</b><b>				RODRIGUEZ
</b>			So... we'll live here! (Glancing at

<b>	
</b>	Rosie rushes in to help Ada hold the doors. So does
	BENJAMIN, the second of the surviving scientists, who is...
	...MAULED from behind by a ZOMBIE. It's not just any zombie.
	It's BRAD VICKERS, back from death, who BITES out the artery
	in Benjamin's neck.
<b>	
</b><b>				ADA
</b><b>			I TOLD YOU... TO SHOOT HIM!
</b><b>	
</b>	Ada lifts her .45 and blows Vickers way. She looks down
	at Benjamin, writhing on the floor, aims at his head... and
	FIRES again.
<b>	
</b>	Rodriguez is the only one holding the doors. Jill rushes
	to help her.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Everybody! OUT!
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			(Off the LED) Thirteen minutes.
<b>	
</b>	Inside the lab, Barry turns to Toshiro, the other scientist.
<b>	
</b><b>				BARRY
</b>			Go.
<b>	
</b>	Toshiro hesitates... a second too long. KRAAASSSH! The
	stasis tube BURSTS open. WATER and bits of ICE fly out...
	along with an enormous, bionic HAND. Big-enough to grab
	Toshiro's head as if it were a cantaloupe. Powerful enough
	to CRUSH that head as if it were... well, a cantaloupe.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker, still searching for his pistol, sees all this.
<b>	
</b>	The Tyrant is not completely free. Much of the cylinder
	wall has cracked away, but sections of it cling to a now
	misshapen mass of ice that still holds the monster bound.
	Though it won1t for much longer.

	FIRES .BLAM BLAM BLAM... bullets SCREAM off the banister
	rails, but none of them contact Chris' legs which disappear

<b>	
</b>	100%.. .TRANSFER COMPLETED. Wesker ejects the floppy, jams
	it into his flack-jacket, and, FIRING another burst, runs
	for the door. The Tyrant has to move around desks and
	computer consoles to catch him.
<b>	
</b>	Wesker shoves his M-16 through the space that's being held
	open by Vickers' boot. He begins to pry the opening wider.
	A WARNING BUZZER goes off. The Tyrant dimly registers
	the sound. Its eyes dilate, like camera shutters, with
	a CLI-CLICK. It strides forward at top peed, PITCHING
	DESKS easily aside, SMASHING through a CONSOLE as if it
	were made of balsa.

	through him.
<b>	
</b>	He doesn't die instantly. He's still alive and SCREAMING
	when the Tyrant uses the same hand, with Wesker impaled on
	it, to PUSH the doors open wide again. The action causes
	WESKER'S HEAD to be SLICED OFF by one of the steel bumpers.
	The Tyrant steps out of the lab. As the doors glide shut,
	the monster holds the remainder of Wesker's body inside
	their path.

</b>	Pg-92
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			I hope they haven't disabled this.
<b>	
</b>	CHRIS opens the door that covers the clock face. He quickly
	spins the hands until they hit... HIGH NOON.
<b>	
</b>	GRONNNK! A WALL begins to GRIND open, straining against
	rust, dirt, from years of idleness. Cobwebs are pulled
	apart and...DAYLIGHT APPEARS!
<b>	
</b>				CHRIS (cont.)
			Alright. We made it.
<b>	
</b>	Chris urges the OTHERS out through the opening. At the same
	time he checks the detonator. The LED is down to SIX MINUTES
	and counting.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   HUEY   DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	At the controls of his helicopter, LAGUARDIA spots something.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT   MANSION   HUEY'S POV   DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	REBECCA, then ADA, then JILL climbing onto the lawn.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT   HUEY   DAY
</b><b>	
</b><b>				LAGUARDIA
</b>			I'm goin' in.
<b>	
</b><b>				RADIO MAN
</b>			You don't have authority.
<b>	
</b><b>				LAGUARDIA
</b>			Fuck authority.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT   MANSION   YARD   DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	...CHRIS climbs out of the secret exit. THE OTHERS, having
	spotted the incoming chopper, are waving at it. There's a
	sense of relief, of salvation. Only Chris notices...
<b>	
</b>	...a bit of PLASTER falling away from one of the mansion's
	stone walls.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			Watch it. WATCH IIIIT!
<b>	
</b>	KER-AAAASSSSHHH! THE TYRANT BURSTS through the wall. With
	superhuman speed, it ATTACKS the escapees, who run, dodge,
	barely escaping the WHISHING SWIPE of its iron claw.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-93
<b>	
</b><b>	INT   HUEY   DAY
</b><b>	
</b><b>				RADIO
</b>			What in God's name is that thing!
<b>	
</b><b>				LAGUARDIA
</b>			Somethin' we weren't supposed to
			see. Drop the ladder. And drop
			the Stinger.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT   MANSION   YARD   DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	THE HUEY swoops down as low as safety will allow. A faceted
	aluminum LADDER unfurls.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b><b>			GET UP!
</b><b>	
</b>	CHRIS pushes JILL toward the ladder. She pulls on Ada's arm
	and sends her up first. ADA begins to climb. Then REBECCA.
<b>	
</b>	The Tyrant closes in, SWIPING at Chris, who just manages to
	avoid the SLICE of its mighty claw.
<b>	
</b>	The RADIO MAN leans out of the door above, holding something.
<b>	
</b><b>				RADIO MAN
</b>			Catch this!
<b>	
</b>	Chris doesn't hear. Jill does.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			Toss it to me!
<b>	
</b>	The radio man drops the Stinger...a rocket with a shoulder-
	launcher.. .down into Jill's hands.
<b>	
</b>	Chris hits the dirt. The Tyrant tries to crush him by
	stepping on him. Chris rolls away.
<b>	
</b>	The ladder is too wobbly. Jill can't be sure of launching
	an accurate shot.
<b>	
</b>				JILL (cont.)
<b>			CHRIS!
</b><b>	
</b>	Chris looks up. Sees Jill holding the rocket launcher. He
	RUNS past the Tyrant, okey-doking, left, right, then dodging
	left again. The monster SWIPES at him with its elongated
	claw. Chris' flack-jacket is caught. Protective fibers fly.
	But Chris escapes without injury.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-94
<b>	
</b>	Jill pitches the weapon. Chris catches it. The Tyrant is
	on him, about to STOMP him with a bionic FOOT when...
<b>	
</b>	...Chris aims at the monster's rhinoceros heart and FIRES!
<b>	
</b>	The rocket CONNECTS, on target. The casing around the animal
	heart EXPLODES... and the Tyrant drops like a giant Redwood...
<b>	
</b>	...on top of Chris's legs.
<b>	
</b>	As Chris tries to free himself, he checks the detonator.
<b>	THREE MINUTES. TWO-FIFTY-NINE. EIGHT. SEVEN. SIX.
</b><b>	
</b>	LaGuardia drops his chopper a bit lower. The bottom of the
	ladder hits the ground, coming within Chris' reach. He grabs
	on. The helicopter rises again. Chris is pulled out from
	under the Tyrant's steel body and is LIFTED into the air.
	He climbs frantically.
<b>	
</b>	Above him, Jill is still on the ladder as well. Ada and
	Rebecca pull her up. Chris DANGLES as the Huey banks away
	over the forest. The tops of TREES whip his legs, but he
	hangs on, climbing up... up... until the others catch his
	hands and hoist him into the chopper. Chris checks the LED.
<b>	ONE MINUTE, FORTY-FIVE SECONDS.
</b><b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			(Reading over Chris' shoulder) We
			have to get out of range.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			No. (To the pilot) Circle around.
<b>			
</b><b>				LAGUARDIA
</b>			Are there more survivors?
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			No. Just...circle, okay? I want
			to...take a last look.
<b>	
</b>	The Huey banks into a circle. Chris looks down at...
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT   AERIAL POV   DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	...the MANSION. And just over the hills...HIS FARM.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT   HUEY   DAY
</b><b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			It's... your home.
<b>	
</b>	CHRIS looks at her, with a resigned smile.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	
</b>	Pg-95
<b>				CHRIS
</b>			I hoped... it would be our home.
<b>	
</b><b>				JILL
</b>			I guess... we're gonna be moving.
<b>	
</b>	Chris checks the LED. THIRTY-EIGHT SECONDS.
<b>	
</b><b>				CHRIS
</b>			(To the pilot) Full throttle.
			Out of here, man!
<b>	
</b>	LaGuardia pushes his stick. The Huey LUNGES forward at
	top speed. REBECCA, ADA and JILL are pressed back by
	inertia. Chris holds himself erect. Through the window,
	in the receding sky, he spots...
<b>	
</b>	...AN EAGLE, riding the wind.
<b>	
</b><b>	CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT   THE ARKLEY FOREST   THE MANSION   DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	PLOOOOMMMMM! The GROUND ERUPTS from an enormous under-
	ground explosion. The MANSION is reduced to particulate
	as the shock-wave spreads outward.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT   FARM   DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Chris' farm hand, RAKE, is shambling out of the house, a
	ZOMBIE... when the EXPLOSIVE FORCE HITS, tearing him APART.
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT   RACCOON CITY   DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The TOWN is EMPTY...except for NINE LONELY FIGURES, lumbering
	down Main Street. They, too...are ZOMBIES. The hot wave
	HITS. Two are VAPORIZED. FIRE engulfs two more. The BRAINS
	of two others are DESTROYED by flying debris.. .
<b>	
</b>	...which catches the remaining three, as well. Arms are
	torn off. Iron shafts from shattered plumbing, shards of
	window glass, slats from picket fences... PUNCH through
	necks, chests, bellies...
<b>	
</b>	...but the dead things, their skulls undamaged,
	through billows of dust... drooling hungrily.
<b>	
</b><b>	THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.
