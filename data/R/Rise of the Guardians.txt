</b>           Darkness. That's the first thing I
           remember. It was dark, and it was
           cold. And I was scared.
                         
          The silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of
          light, refracted through water, which turns into...
                         
                         
<b>          A MOON - SEEN IN REFLECTION ON A SHEET OF ICE
</b>                         
          The moonlight intensifies almost magically, and the ice above
          begins to spider-web and crack.

          Snow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond
          continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A
          young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense
          moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his
          tousled hair frosted white.
                         
<b>           JACK (V.O.)
</b>           But then...then I saw the moon. It
           was so big and it was so bright,
           and it seemed to chase the darkness
           away. And when it did...I wasn't
           scared anymore.
                         
          Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up
          underneath him.

</b>           Why I was there, and what I was
           meant to do - that I've never
           known. And a part of me wonders if
           I ever will.
                         
          Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight
          as it dims a bit.
                         
          Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something
          with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden
          staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the
          staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd.

          Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in
          contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across
          the ice. Jack is visibly confused.
                         
          He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their
          trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as
          he begins to run across the frozen pond.
                         
          Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the
          air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to
          earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch
          and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.

          A collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs.
          Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one. He stands
          up, still elated, and brushes himself off.
                         
          As Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their
          hands by campfire. Jack doesn't recognize anyone.

          The settlers walk past Jack, not noticing him. Jack crouches
          down as a YOUNG BOY runs toward him.

           where I am?
                         
          The boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost. Jack
          staggers back in shock. He's speechless, as if the wind had
          been knocked out him. His emotions causing it to snow.

          Townsfolk continue to pass through Jack, unaware of his
          presence. Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest.

          trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs SLAM a block of
          ice onto a stone work table--
                         
          IN QUICK CUTS: A CHAINSAW shears the block in half, spraying
          ice. North lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo
          on his arm, the word NAUGHTY clearly visible.
                         
          Three ELVES huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies,
          each licking their own tasty morsel.

          from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear.
                         
          The elves duck out of the way as North launches himself
          across the floor on his rolling chair -- CLOSE as his huge
          HAND gropes furiously among his WORK TOOLS, finally grabbing
          a miniature HAMMER. As North's humming along with his music,
          delicately CHISELING into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve
          tatoo, the word NICE clearly visible--
                         
          His INTENSE BLUE EYE magnified in a JEWELER'S EYEPIECE -- a

          His hands place the finished piece on a curving ICE TRACK: An
          ice LOCOMOTIVE. It belches ice vapor and chugs down the

          One of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the
          plate as it chews with a mouth full of food, to which it then
          unfurls its tongue and lets the half eaten morsels spill out
          onto the plate.

          He takes a bite and leans toward the ice track. He chuckles
          as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair

          The strands are being controlled by a small portly figure,
          THE SANDMAN. Suddenly, North's emergency signal zips by. The
          Sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow, visibly concerned.
                         
          Sandy closes his eyes and in an instant the Dreamsand cloud
          suddenly SWIRLS around him, changing form into a small

          comes into his eyes. A big smile. Make no mistake,

          face. Jack smiles, knowing he's responsible.

          Jack looks down to find an elf pointing at his bare feet.
          The elf then directs his attention to two approaching elves,

          the various flying toys.
                         
          As Jack walks behind North, surveying the factory, a duck toy

          with toys. Sketches and prototypes everywhere.
                         
          North dusts his hands and turns to Jack. His sleeves are
          rolled. Jack notices that on one of North's forearms is
          tattooed the word NAUGHTY, and on the other, NICE. North
          grabs a plate from a nearby elf.

          He twists the doll in half, and inside is another carved
          North doll, this one is a more typical Santa Claus - red
          cheeked and cheery.

          size of a jelly bean.

          A flying toy plane glides by and we follow it as it makes its
          way around the room. A Christmas tree is ablaze with bright
          lights. Two double doors suddenly open as the flying car

          the sleigh vanishes. It leaps off the roof, through a drain,
          and down into the sewers.

          A strand of NIGHTMARE SAND from the Nightmare twirls in the

          scuttling out from the tunnel.
                         
          Bunny grabs his boomerang, North draws his sword, and Jack

          Palace. Mounds of them heaped to the ceiling. And inside
          the drawers are the missing baby teeth. He drops down to a
          mound and begins rummaging through the drawers, looking at

          blocks the attacks of ice and frost -- his control over the
          Nightmare sand has gained considerable strength.

          in the air. Their show of force escalates until they're
          shrouded in a blanket of snow, ice, and wind. As the wind
          and snow settle, Jack looks around stern and alert.

          Light EXPLODES from the staff and terror comes into Jack's
          eyes, clutching his chest as if in pain.
                         
          Suddenly, Pitch sends a burst of Nightmare sand, blasting
          Jack and slamming him into the iceberg wall behind him. As
          the ice cracks, Jack comes loose and falls forward into the
          chasm below.
                         
          Pitch looks down into the ice fissure chuckling. He throws

          casually walks away, disappearing on the horizon.

          She grabs hold of Jack's staff and in one massive effort he
          slings her with all his might to safety. But the movement

          relief.
                         
          Suddenly, the entire factory begins to shake, knocking the

          TOYS to the floor.

          A Nightmare comes barreling towards Cupcake. It screeches to
          a halt, inches from the girl's face. She gently taps the

          As the kids look on in wonder, Sandy throws up his hands
          creating a shower of Dreamsand, which drifts down on the

          Jamie smiles. Jack stands up and heads toward the sleigh.
          Jamie's friends stand off to the side rubbing their eyes as
          they become drowsy.

          Jamie runs over and wraps his arms around Jack. For a
          moment, Jack's astonished and then gives Jamie a warm
          embrace. Jack stands up and gets in the sleigh with the rest
          of the Guardians.

          Jack and the Guardians look toward the kids as the sleigh

          spite of it all, he doesn't want to let go. The sleigh takes
          off into the sky. Jamie stops unable to follow.

          Jack moves to the back of the sleigh as the Guardians pat him
          on the back. Jack smiles...and forms a snowflake in his
