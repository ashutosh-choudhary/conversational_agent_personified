<b>EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT
</b>
Underwater.

Shafts of eroded light slice into the depths of the Hudson
River. The ghostly melody of "Lili Marlene," the ache of the
war-time lover, plays as a strange SHADOW drifts into view.

We realize it is a BODY.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          Some things, once you've loved
          them, become yours forever.

The body BREAKS the surface and we see the face of its owner
---- DAVID KAMMERER, 33, bearded, handsome. He is clothed, open
white shirt, khakis. Dead.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          And if you try to let them go...

Suddenly, a breath: he comes back to life.

David floats back to LUCIEN CARR, 20, (blonde, beautiful,
shirtless and terrified), waist deep in the water.

The scene is playing in REVERSE MOTION.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          They only circle back and return to
          you.

David's body LIFTS into the young man's arms. We see David's
feet and hands are TIED together with shoelaces. Stones rise
back into his pockets.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          They become part of who you are...

A stain of blood on David's chest shrinks, vanishes.

David's eyes OPEN.

</b>
<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          ...or they destroy you.

From behind the bars of a jail cell, Lucien Carr (the young
man from the opening) finishes reading from a paper
MANUSCRIPT in his hand.
<b>                                                           2.
</b>

Lucien, furious, crumples it up.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          You can't show this to anyone.

We PULL BACK to reveal the author of the manuscript: a
eighteen-year-old ALLEN GINSBERG. Unslept and exhausted. But
determined.

Allen stares defiantly at Lucien from the other side of the
bars.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Then tell the truth, Lu.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          You weren't even there. It's your
          truth. It's fiction.

Allen grabs for his manuscript back, but Lucien pulls it out
of reach.

<b>                     LUCIEN
</b>          You wanted him gone too. You sent
          him to me.

Allen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper.

Lucien won't let go -- it's a tug of war between the two
boys, two wills. Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip and
wins. Lucien, panicking.

<b>                    LUCIEN (CONT'D)
</b>          Please. You'll kill me with that.

Allen turns and races towards the exit of the prison.
Desperate, Lucien calls out after him.

<b>                       LUCIEN
</b>          Allen! No!

Allen doesn't turn. An alarm HAMMERS through the prison.

<b>                     LUCIEN
</b>          Allen!   No! DON'T...!

<b>EXT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT
</b>
<b>SUPER: PATERSON, NEW JERSEY. 1943. ONE YEAR EARLIER.
</b>
Over a strip of working-class row homes, we hear the sounds
of a radio announcer giving a dispatch from the war front.

<b>                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          American daylight bombers were busy
          again, as our liberators with
          fighter escort continue the air
          offensive with another sock at
          German coastal installations in
          France.


<b>INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT
</b>
The radio continues playing to a modest home. We see a young
man cleaning house, sweeping in the background.

<b>                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          But the Germans report a big new
          red army push toward Romania. This
          is World War news.

As the war report ends, a stuffy musical piece begins. We
hear a groan from the young man.

From out of the background emerges Allen Ginsberg (now 17,
fresh-faced, horn-rimmed glasses, dutiful son). The kind of
kid who takes care of everything.

He storms up to the radio, switches the station to a fast-
paced boogie-woogie number. He smiles and dances joyfully to
the up-beat number with his broom.

The door slams. Allen looks up, caught in the act, to see his
father LOUIS (40's, school teacher, Jewish working-class
poet) home from work. Allen accidentally drops the broom.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          How was she today?

Louis turns off the music. The playful mood dies. Allen spots
the mail in his father's hand.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Fine. Anything for me?

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          Why? You expecting something?

Allen looks down, a bad liar.
<b>                                                         4.
</b>

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          No.

Suddenly, from upstairs, the sound of glass shattering. Then
a woman whimpering in pain. Allen, worried, looks off, dread
in his face. His father just sighs.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          I told you it wouldn't work.

Allen rushes upstairs.


<b>INT. MASTER BEDROOM, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT
</b>
Allen runs into a dark room, flips on the light.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Mom?

His mother NAOMI (early 40's, Jewish, deep personality
disorder) squats in the corner of the room, in a dirty
bathrobe. Her knuckles are bleeding.

<b>                    NAOMI
</b>          You've got to get me out of here.
          He nailed the windows shut while I
          was in the bath.

She motions to the shattered window pane across the room.
Allen sees her blood on the sill, where she tried to escape.
He moves towards her, to console her. What he's good at.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Dad didn't do that. I nailed the
          windows. Because you're not right.

Naomi, in the midst of a paranoid attack, puts her finger to
her mouth.

<b>                    NAOMI
</b>          Shhh...Allen. He can hear you!

Allen wraps his mother's hand with a dish towel.

<b>                     ALLEN
</b>          You have to rest. Clear your head.
          Do you want to go back to
          Greystone?

<b>                    NAOMI
</b>          He wouldn't dare put me back there.
<b>                                                            5.
</b>

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Then listen to me.

<b>                    NAOMI
</b>          SHHHH. He can hear you!

She's losing it. Allen quickly thinks, turns to her bureau.
He pulls out a RECORD, starts the phonograph and turns up the
volume.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Can he still hear me?

A BRAHMS WALTZ plays.

<b>                    NAOMI
</b>          What did you say?

Allen turns the music up all the way. Allen mimes deafness.
Finally, she understands: their sounds are drowned out by the
music.

Allen reaches for her. She finally softens, takes his hand.

As mother and son waltz together with the music, Naomi
clutches Allen to her, like he's the only thing keeping her
sane. Because he is.

<b>                    NAOMI
</b>          Don't ever leave me.

Allen, trapped, over her shoulder.

From the doorway, we see that Louis has been watching the
whole time.


<b>EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
</b>
Overwhelmed, Allen shakes on the front stairs. She's not
well. The faint sound of jazz, fun from someone else's home
from down the block. Louis comes out onto the porch, with an
open LETTER in hand from the mail pile. He's upset.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          Were you even going to tell me you
          applied?!

Allen spies the "Columbia University" seal on the front. He's
been caught. He looks down, ashamed.
<b>                                                           6.
</b>

<b>                     ALLEN
</b>          I didn't want her to know.
              (beat)
          It was a dream anyway.

Louis lights his own cigarette. Offers his son one. He
declines.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>              (talking to himself,
               dreaming)
          Trilling's there. Van Doren.
          English Professors. Important
          fellows. And New York City, right
          in your goddamn lap.

Louis sits beside his son.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          Love that is hoarded,
          molds at last.

Allen, surprised to hear his Dad reciting one of his poems.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          Until we know,
          the only thing we have--

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          is what we give away.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          Is what we hand away. Have, hand.
          Consonance.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Give, is. Assonance.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          I wrote the goddamn poem. Go write
          your own.

Louis hands over the letter. The hardest thing he's ever
done.

Allen takes the envelope, rips it open. He's looking at the
response in shock. Louis tries to read his son's face.

<b>                      ALLEN
</b>          I got in.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          You got in?!
<b>                                                            7.
</b>

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          I got into Columbia University!

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          You got into Columbia University?!

Allen and his father embrace.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>

<b>EXT. COLUMBIA QUAD - DAY
</b>
First day of college. Allen crosses the grand Ivy League
campus in awe. Before him, the staggering facade of the
library like the Parthenon. A troop of Navy midshipmen pass
by. Wartime is on.


<b>INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY
</b>
Allen sets his bag on his bed. He notices on one wall are
patriotic posters, exercise posters. He's already got a
roommate.

He eyes a map of the New York City subway system. He can't
believe he's really here in the big city. He walks over to
it.

Allen studies the map, his finger gliding down to Greenwich
Village.

<b>                    LUKE (O.S.)
</b>          You don't wanna go down there.

His roommate LUKE, 18, buzz cut, in a sweaty Columbia
sweatshirt, leans over him.

<b>                    LUKE
</b>          Land of the fairies. Head there and
          you never come back.
              (extending a firm hand)
          Luke Detweiler, Danville, Virginia.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Allen Ginsberg.

<b>                    LUKE
</b>              (bright smile)
          You're Jewish, right?

Allen nods. Luke smacks him on the shoulder.
<b>                                                         8.
</b>

<b>                    LUKE
</b>          I'm getting good at telling.


<b>INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY
</b>
The beautiful main hall of Columbia University's Butler
Library. It's Ivy League tradition meets thousands of years
of scholarship.

A pompous TOUR GUIDE shows off museum-like glass vitrines to
new and prospective students with their families.

<b>                    TOUR GUIDE
</b>          The South Hall library is a church,
          and these are the sacraments.

Allen stumbles along on the tour. The tour guide points to
the contents of the vitrines: the wonders of literary
history.

<b>                    TOUR GUIDE
</b>          Original folios of the most
          important texts in history.
          Beowolf. First folio Hamlet. The
          Gutenberg Bible.

Allen looks down, amazed. That's Shakespeare's handwriting.

<b>                    TOUR
</b>          These are among the University's
          most prized possessions.

Suddenly, in a reflection in the glass, a flash of RED
catches Allen's eye.

<b>                    LUCIEN (O.S.)
</b>          Let's hear a bit, shall we?

Allen turns to see Lucien Carr (now 19, devilish, stunningly
handsome) LEAP onto a library desk with a book in hand. He
wears a distinctive red CRAVAT that only the truly beautiful
can pull off. The entire room hushes.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>              (reciting)
          On a Sunday afternoon, when the
          shutters are down and the
          proletariat possesses the street...

The tour guide looks around confused.
<b>                                                         9.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          ...there are certain thoroughfares
          which remind one of nothing less...

Lucien gets on his knees and THRUSTS a lamp between his legs.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          ...than a big cancerous cock.

Parents look around in shock. A female student is instantly
aroused. The prim PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN clomps over.

<b>                    PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
</b>          What is this nonsense?

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Henry Miller.

<b>                    PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
</b>          Get down immediately. That book is
          restricted.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Which is why I committed it to
          memory.

<b>                      PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
</b>          Security!

As two Campus Security Guards rush in, Lucien leaps down in
front of Allen.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Alert the press! Tell them Lucien
          Carr is innocent!

Lucien flees, rushes out of the library.

<b>                    TOUR GUIDE
</b>          That was highly unusual. Campus is
          actually quite quiet. Moving on.

But Allen doesn't hear, he grins to himself. Who the hell was
that?

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES (V.O.)
</b>          The Victorian sonnet has the
          balance of three tenets.


<b>INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
</b>
Patrician, old-guard PROFESSOR STEEVES lectures on the first
day of class, Allen dutifully taking notes in his journal.
<b>                                                           10.

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          Rhyme, meter, conceit. Without this
          balance, a poem becomes slack,
          sloppy. An untucked shirt.

Allen disagrees and raises his hand.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Professor Steeves, then how do you
          explain Whitman?

No one interrupts Professor Steeves. Murmurs from around the
class. Steeves locks down his gaze on Allen.

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          Say more. Two more sentences.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          He hated rhyme and meter. The whole
          point was untucking your shirt.

Professor Steeves smiles to himself. There's one of them
every year.

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          What's your name?

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Allen Ginsberg.

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          Ginsberg? Your father perhaps is
          the poet Louis Ginsberg?

Allen nods.

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          He writes rhyming, metered verse.
          Why do you think he chose that
          form?

All eyes on Allen.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Because it's easier.

The class titters. Professor Steeves hushes them.

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          This university exists because of
          tradition and form. Would you
          rather this building be built by
          engineers or Whitman and his boys
          at play?
<b>                                                          11.
</b>

Allen, realizing he is trapped, unable to answer. Professor
Steeves smiles victoriously and writes on the blackboard.

<b>                     PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          There can be no creation before
          imitation.

The other students take note. Allen sighs, follows suit. From
the back row, Lucien watches Allen and unsheathes a grin.


<b>INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Luke, dressed in a suit, puts on cologne. He looks back at
Allen who is copying from a tome of sonnets.

<b>                    LUKE
</b>          Shut the books. We're taking my
          brother with us to the social. He

<b>                    ALLEN

<b>                    LUKE
</b>          He's Navy. It's catnip for the
          skirts.

Luke pulls out his own waistband and sprays some cologne down
the front. Allen shakes his head. Luke shrugs.

<b>                     LUKE
</b>          You hymies are really all about
          work, huh?

Luke slams the door behind. Allen, alone stares out the
window.

A record starts up down the hall. Clarinet, strings. Allen's
ears prick up. He knows this tune.

It's the same BRAHMS from his mother's bedroom.


<b>INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Allen walks down a darkened hallway, the music leading him
forward. He reaches a door with a lit transom. He knocks.

The unlocked door creaks open.

<b>INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
A mattress lies on the floor, a phonograph on top. Candles
light the room. Books for furniture. And Lucien on the floor,
reading the Times and smoking.

<b>                      ALLEN
</b>          Brahms?

Allen walks inside. Lucien looks up, surprised.

<b>                     LUCIEN
</b>          Finally. An oasis in this
          wasteland.

Nervous, Allen tries to make conversation.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          How come you're not at the social?

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Only the most anti-social have to
          go to an event actually called one.
          Libation?

Lucien rises and grabs a wine bottle corked with a sock.
Allen looks nervously towards the door.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          You drink in your room?!

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          How does a horrible bottle of
          Chianti sound?

Lucien inverts two small glasses and pours. Allen stares. He
doesn't break the rules.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          I don't drink.

<b>                      LUCIEN
</b>          Freshman?

<b>                      ALLEN
</b>          Yes.

Lucien hands him his glass.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Excellent. I love first times. I
          want my whole life to be composed

Lucien toasts Allen's glass.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          To Walt Whitman, you dirty bastard.

Allen, mortified, not sure how to take that reference as
Lucien knocks his wine back in one gulp.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          How's your Yeats? Have you read A
          Vision?

He tosses Allen a BOOK. Dog-eared, underlined and crumbling.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Never heard of it.

<b>                     LUCIEN
</b>          It's completely brilliant and
          impossible. He says life is round:
          we're stuck on this wheel. Living.
          And dying.

Allen opens the book, looks through the old pages, sees a
strange symbol: a diagram of a celestial WHEEL.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          An endless circle. Until. Someone

Lucien looks at Allen, amazed.

</b>          How did you...?

<b>                    ALLEN

Lucien, intrigued, circles in close.

</b>          Are you a writer? Because I've got
          a job for a writer.

Allen, mesmerized.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          No. I'm not.

<b>                    LUCIEN

Allen doesn't even register his name. Lucien smirks.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Isn't that you?

<b>                       HALL MONITOR (O.S.)

Allen groans, snaps out of it.

The Hall Monitor hands Allen the phone.

Naomi grips the phone desperately. We see she has stripped
the wallpaper from the wall and pulled the telephone wire out
from underneath.

Allen, confused. Up the hallway, a door locks.

Lucien quickly waves goodbye to Allen, heads down the
staircase. Allen, torn between his mother and this boy.

Lucien slides down the stairway rail. Allen watching him
disappear.

<b>                    ALLEN

Allen hangs up on his mother and races after Lucien.


<b>INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>
Allen, breathless, storms down a flight of stairs, catches up
to Lucien. Lucien turns, loving this. The puppy following his
new master.

Lucien throws his jacket over Allen's shoulder and leads him
into the wild city around the corner.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Welcome to the edge of the world.

The sound of the IRT screeching takes us to the SUBWAY MAP
from Allen's dorm room which comes to life.

A RED LINE glides down the map from Columbia University all
the way...to Greenwich Village.

Allen, anxious, follows Lucien up a crowded staircase to a
West Village apartment.

The sounds of a party spill out onto the landing and beyond.
It's pure bohemia here.

Smoke, artists flirting, arguing. Allen sees...

A black man making out with a white woman. An older, elegant
woman sharing a cigarette with a boy half her age.

She stares seductively at Allen. Lucien enjoying himself
immensely. This is what a first time looks like.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Allen in Wonderland.

Lucien grabs a DRUNK YOUNG GIRL from the crowd, kisses her
passionately. Then lets her go, keeps walking.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Do you know her?!

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          No, and I don't plan on it. She
          tasted like imported sophistication
          and domestic cigarettes.


<b>INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
A makeshift bar in a sink full of ice. Lucien scavenges
through empty bottles in the sink, looking for any remaining
alcohol.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>              (calling out)
          Dave! Where's the liquor?! I'll be
          right back.

As Lucien walks off, Allen tries to make himself
inconspicuous and sits down on the tub.

<b>                    BILL (O.S.)
</b>          Hrffrff hrffrfffrfrfrrf.

Allen looks down to see WILLIAM BURROUGHS (aka BILL, 29,
tall, gaunt, wry), in a suit, sprawled out in the bathtub: a
gas mask over his mouth. Bill motions to the side of the tub.

<b>                    BILL
</b>              (through the mask)
          You're...pinching...

Allen stands up, realizing his foot is on a snaking black
tube leading to a metal canister of gas.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Sorry. Are you all right?
<b>                                                        18.

<b>                    BILL

          Artifacts in the visual field, some

          hyperactivity.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          What is that?

<b>                    BILL
</b>          Nitrous oxide, for narcoanalysis.
          Know thyself. And beshit thyself.
          Ever done that?

Allen shakes his head no. Bill turns off the gas. Offers a
joint to Allen.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Oh no, thanks. I don't do...the
          cannabis.

Bill eyes Allen, skeptically.

<b>                    BILL
</b>          Show me the man both sober and
          happy, and I'll show you the
          crinkled anus of a lying asshole.

Allen raises an eyebrow. Lucien returns with a paper in hand.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Allen, Willy. Willy, Allen, Lucien
          reefer.

Lucien takes the joint.

Bill puts the tube of gas back in his mouth, back to
business. Lucien grabs Allen's hand, pulls him to the party.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>              (whispered)
          Is he a criminal?

</b>          He wishes he were a criminal. The

Allen spots the TERM PAPER in Lucien's hand.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          What's that?

<b>                    LUCIEN

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
DAVID KAMMERER, the man we saw dead at the film's opening,
runs his fingers on the rim of a wine glass. He's sharp, the
mayor of this scene. An eerie hum from the glass.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          What there is, darlings and
          demoiselles, is a circle. Life is

          deny it.

Allen turns to Lucien.

<b>                    ALLEN

David sees the boys talking. He eyes Allen, curiously.

</b>          Until. The the disruption we long

Uh-oh. Allen's singled out. David pulls him to the center of
the room.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          And you are?

<b>                      ALLEN
</b>          Allen.

Bill walks in, knows what game his friend is playing.

<b>                    BILL
</b>          Play nice, David.

<b>                     DAVID
</b>          Allen, who comes uninvited to my

</b>          Actually I invited him.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          None of us notice him. Look at him.
          Why would we bother?

In his tucked shirt and creased pants, Allen realizes the
entire party is scrutinizing, judging him.

<b>                     DAVID
</b>          So the pattern of our evening, our
          lives, holds. But under the right
          circumstances, even he might change
          the world.

Jazz music sparks, PRE-LAP from where this party's going
next. Lucien eyes Allen -- an idea forming.

The party continuing at this underground speakeasy. Straight,
gay, young, old, a subterranean zoo. A jazz signer owns the
room.

Bill, David, and Allen at a table. David's moment alone with
Allen.

<b>                    DAVID

<b>                    BILL
</b>          Because David was in the same
          godforsaken line.

David and Bill share a knowing look. Lucien returns to the
table and slams a glass down.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Some earjob at the bar just called
          me "boy." So I stole his drink.

Allen scans, sees the famous poet OGDEN NASH looking around
for his glass.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          That's Ogden Nash!

Bill takes out a switchblade.

A realization. Lucien leans in, focuses his charm.

Allen, swept up in the energy. He couldn't be more
captivated.

Allen smiles a mile wide. He's in.

Suddenly, the jazz singer stops. The band puts down their
instruments. POLICEMEN escort a businessman and another

bar chills.

nervously with a suitcase beside a DOCTOR.

          a change in her condition.

document on top.

<b>                    LOUIS

A male nurse leads Naomi from the bedroom. She is still in
her robe, shattered and fogged by sedatives. Allen realizes
what's happening.

<b>                    ALLEN

The nurse takes Naomi to the door. Allen pulls her back, into
the house.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          No, you're not leaving.

Naomi points an accusing finger at Louis.

Naomi babbling. Allen realizing how far she's gone. Allen
shoves the nurse off Naomi.

<b>                       ALLEN
</b>          Get off!

From deep within, Allen can see she is still there, and we
can see she knows that it's too late.

<b>                    NAOMI
</b>          This is your fault.

The nurse escorts a docile Naomi out of the room. Allen
breaks down. Lucien, mute witness to it all.

Allen escapes outside where Lucien is sitting, smoking. Allen
sits beside him, notices: Lucien has been crying.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Complicated enough?

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          At least you have her. My father

A beat of understanding between them. Lucien lays down. Allen
takes his cigarette, lays next to him.

</b>          I've spent my life making other
          people happy.

underway.

</b>          Oh please. Die already.

We PULL BACK again to see Lucien beside, also with a noose
around his neck. Both of them on chairs. Their nooses are
attached to the same pipe.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Where's the verve? The brio?!

From atop the chair, Lucien kicks his record player with his
foot. Grand classical music screeches to a start.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Don't edit me!

Lucien shoves Allen. Allen trips off the chair, the noose
snaps tight...and suddenly he's hanging in mid-air. He
struggles. Lucien tries to help, but falls off his own chair.

The pipe starts to bend.

Allen and Lucien panic as they swing through the room,
suspended in air.

The pipe BREAKS. They crash to the ground.

A beat of relief -- are we alive? -- and the two break out
into hysterics.

Time suddenly slows. The music tapers, the hands of the

confused. What is happening?

A spotlight cuts through the room, capturing the singer's
sweaty ecstasy, the bassist's fingers mid-plucking. The room
freezes.

Unlit cigarette dangling from his lip, Allen turns to Bill.

The girl comes to life and clambers over the young man to a
second, more attractive soldier. And kisses him. The pair
erupt into life, into desire.

Lucien and Allen sit on the stage beneath the frozen
musicians. Lucien pulls out a BOY SCOUT KNIFE.

Wraps Allen's hand in a fist around the blade.

He pulls the knife free. Allen winces in pain.

Lucien does the same to his own palm, then presses their two
bloody hands together. A ceremony. Allen's eyes roll back.

Lucien flips through the term paper.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          You make me too smart, they're
          gonna suspect something's up.

David throws Lucien's coat over his shoulder.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          And get you sent back to your
          mother again? That would just be
          the end of you.

<b>                      LUCIEN
</b>          Fuck you.

David spots Allen watching from the bathroom.


<b>INT. BATHROOM - 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Allen, caught, looks down, pretends he heard nothing. But
it's too late. David walks over and SLAMS the door in Allen's
face.

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES (O.S.)
</b>          Kill your darlings.


<b>INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
</b>
Professor Steeves, intent, in front of the class.

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          Your crushes, your juvenile
          metaphysics. None of them belong on
          the page. It is the first principle
          of good creative work. A work of
          fiction you will deliver as your
          final exam.

He sees Allen, badly hungover and brooding, writing in a
journal. Ignoring class.

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          Oh look. Whitman Jr. graced us with
          his presence today.
<b>                                                           34.
</b>

Steeves walks to Allen's desk, grabs his journal.

<b>                     PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          "The New Vision. Extraordinary men
          propel us forward. It is our duty
          to break the law."
              (to Allen)
          Fantastic.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          There's more life in those five
          pages than in the dozens of bad
          sonnets we've read in class.

Steeves cocks his eye, stares down Allen. The first time
Allen has defied anyone. Ever.

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          You want life? You want the world
          on fire?

Steeves motions to the door. Then to Allen.

<b>                    PROFESSOR STEEVES
</b>          The war awaits. What will it be?

Steeves tosses the journal back down on Allen's desk.

Allen looks down at the "New Vision", ashamed.


<b>INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
A rainstorm beating against the windows. Allen paces as a
drunk Lucien knocks off a bottle of wine and reads from
Allen's journal.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          "The rose that scents the summer
          air/ grows from my beloved's
          hair...?"

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Keep going. That's my sonnet for
          Steeves.

Lucien flips through the journal, closes it, disappointed.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          We have the map. We have the
          manifesto. We need the work.
              (suddenly cold)
          I was wrong. Maybe you're not up
          for this after all.
<b>                                                        35.
</b>

Allen stares at Lucien in disbelief. Shocked, Allen rushes to
Lucien's desk.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Show me your fucking map.

<b>                     LUCIEN
</b>          Stop!

Allen grabs the pages Lucien has been working on: they are
covered in doodles - there's nothing there.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Oh right, you don't have anything
          because David's not here to write
          it for you!

Lucien stands up, drunk. Furious.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          It's complicated.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          I love complicated.

Lucien steadies himself. Furious.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          He's a professor working as a
          janitor so he can be near his
          precious Lu-Lu. He is a goddamn
          fruit who won't let me go.

<b>                     ALLEN
</b>          A fruit?

<b>                     LUCIEN
</b>          A queer.

This detonates inside Allen. Lucien crashes to his bed. Allen
sits beside.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Then let's get rid of him.

Lucien softens, leans against Allen. Passing out from the
liquor.

<b>                     LUCIEN
</b>          Right now, I just need you to write
          us something beautiful.

<b>                                                           36.
</b>

Lucien drifts off. Allen shakes, holding Lucien's body for
the first time.

We follow Allen's P.O.V. as he runs his finger through
Lucien's hair. He can barely breathe, this close to what he
finds beautiful.

Allen's fingers slide to Lucien's cheek. Toward his lips.

Lucien's eyes open. Allen tenses, afraid. But Lucien suddenly
takes Allen's finger in his mouth. Sucks it, eyeing Allen the
whole time.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
A thunder-clap. Lucien passed out in Allen's lap. We were
just in Allen's imagination.


<b>INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY
</b>
Allen at his typewriter. A blank page. Inspired to write
something beautiful.

We see flashes of the past, snippets of Lucien: their
contact, Lucien's smile. Allen searching through their past.
All playing in reverse.

<b>                     LUCIEN
</b>           Allen in Wonderland.

Is it something? He writes the words down. Flash of their
past build in a crescendo as he keeps searching, digging
through moments, leading to...

<b>NOTHING.
</b>
Allen's blocked.

He'll need more help if he's going to get to beautiful.

<b>                       BILL (O.S.)
</b>           Pervitin.


<b>INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Bill with NORMAN (30s, shady, real criminal) and Allen in his
dim, bookshelf-lined lair. Bill gives the secret nod to
Norman.
<b>                                                        37.

<b>                    BILL
</b>          The Germans call it the "wonder
          drug." Prescribed for super-human
          feats.

Norman pops open a briefcase full of drugs. Bill selects a
green pill bottle and gives it to Allen.


<b>INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY
</b>
Allen pops two. Waits for it.


<b>INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - LATER
</b>
The pace of everything has DOUBLED.

Allen, sweating at his typewriter, jubilant, tapping his foot
with the music, typing furiously at the keys. Whatever this
drug is, it's working.

<b>                    BILL (O.S.)
</b>          But beware of the side-effects.


<b>INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Bill rattles off the list.

<b>                    BILL
</b>          Sudden blindness, bouts of
          diarrhea, heart palpitations, and a
          severe decline in moral standards.

</b>
Allen jerking-off at his desk.

Allen racing around his room, burning off energy. The
memories are now flooding in.

David at his party...

<b>                    DAVID (O.S.)
</b>          Take this unbloomed stalwart.

Lucien at the bar...
<b>                                                           38.

<b>                    LUCIEN (O.S.)

          play.


<b>INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - EVENING
</b>
Luke enters, turns on the light.

His jaw-drops: Allen is on his bed, running in place like a
mad-man.

<b>                    LUKE
</b>          What the hell are you doing?

Allen, furious at the interruption.

<b>                     ALLEN
</b>          Writing!


<b>INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Bill, a thoughtful eye on young Allen.

<b>                    BILL
</b>          But the words, oh the words...


<b>INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY
</b>
Allen's got it. He rips the pages from the typewriter.


<b>INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY
</b>
Lucien's door slams open. A sleepless Allen, hair on end,
storms into the room, fresh pages in hand.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Lu! It's very rough but...

David sits at Lucien's desk, writing. Allen stops short.
David spies the pages in Allen's hand.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Ah. The "Vision" at last. Can I
          see?

Allen hides them behind his back.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Where's Lu?
<b>                                                        39.

<b>                     DAVID
</b>          He's out. With a senior, some

          handsome too.

          James? Jack. There it is. Jack.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          You're not allowed to be here.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          That's odd since I'm the only thing
          keeping him here.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Not anymore.

A stand-off. David collects his jacket, approaches.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Piece of advice. You don't know Lu.
          As soon you think you do, he'll
          find someone else.

David smirks, walks off leaving Allen alone with his pages.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Or maybe he already has.


<b>INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
3:00 AM. Allen snoring. Then the sound of the door creaking
open. Allen wakes up to see Lucien entering.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          What are you, moving in?

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Where have you been?!

Lucien starts getting undressed.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          I found a real writer. Already a
          million words under his belt before

Lucien fumbles.

<b>                    ALLEN

<b>                     LUCIEN
</b>          What am I supposed to do?
          Newsreels?

He spots the piece of paper in Allen's hand.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          What's that?

Defensive, Allen pockets his poem for Lucien.

<b>                     ALLEN
</b>          Nothing.

Lucien gets into bed.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          If you're going to stay, don't hog
          the blanket.

Lucien closes his eyes. Allen sits up, jealous, his mind
spinning. He stares at Lucien.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Why is Jack a real writer?

<b>                    LUCIEN

</b>          Hey Al!


<b>INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Handsome JACK KEROUAC (mid-20's, athletic, infamous jaw)
palms a football, fakes a pass to Allen. Allen, on the couch
with a stack of pages, shakes his head.

<b>                     ALLEN
</b>          No.

Lucien drinks wine beside. Jack ignores Allen, wings the
pigskin right at him. Allen ducks. The ball SLAMS into a
painting on the wall. It crashes onto Allen's head.

<b>                    EDIE (O.S.)
</b>          Jack? What was that?
<b>                                                        41.

<b>                    JACK
</b>              (with a wink)
          The damn cat!

The bell around the neck of Jack's cat KIT KAT jingles as it
scurries away. Jack darts over, hangs the painting upside
down.

<b>                    JACK
</b>              (whispered to Allen)
          She painted it. Say nothing.

Jack notices a piece of mail addressed to him next to Allen.
It's an old vinyl RECORD sent by his friend Sammy. He shouts
down the hall.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Hey when'd this come?

<b>                    EDIE (O.S.)
</b>          Today. Where is Sammy now?

<b>                    JACK
</b>          I dunno. Some battleship.

Lucien nods to the huge manuscript on Allen's lap. We realize
it is Jack's novel The Sea Is My Brother.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          What do you think? Brilliant, no?

<b>                    ALLEN

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          It's better than anything you've

Jack sets up an old phonograph. The scratchy record starts as
Jack sidles up close to the speaker.

Jack pulls the stylus off.

EDIE PARKER, Jack's wealthy, vivacious art student girlfriend
(early 20's) walks in. Messy, comfortable, adorable. She
holds a pot, eyes Lucien and Allen.

<b>                    EDIE
</b>          I didn't know we were having

Jack comes to the table. She smacks something down on a
plate: it's brown GLOP.

<b>                    JACK

          in the kitchen is unholy.

<b>                    EDIE
</b>          That's funny. You talk like a

          marry me. How does that work?

Allen and Lucien watch entranced.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Shut your mouth, Edie.

<b>                    EDIE

Jack exits, slams the door shut. Edie stares at Allen and
Lucien on the couch.

Lucien drinks from a wine bottle as the three boys stroll.
Allen trails behind.

Lucien stops. He spots a DINGY, floating off a dock. He gets
an idea.

Lucien RUNS for it, then Jack. Allen, now the third wheel,
reluctantly chases after.


<b>EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

The dingy drifts into view in the middle of the busiest river
in the world - quiet at this late in the night. Jack rowing.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          A "new vision?"

Lucien loves this, raises an eyebrow. Allen pulls out his
poem from his pocket.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Be careful.
          You are not in wonderland
          I have heard the strange madness
          long growing in your soul.
          But you are fortunate.

Lucien listens anew, realizing this poem is about him.

          In your isolation,

          Lest we die unbloomed.

Just the sound of the water. Completely vulnerable, Allen
sits back down.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Allen. Beautiful, kid.

Allen looks up, moved.

Lucien lights up. He comes forward, gathers his friends
close: gawky, emotional Allen. Blustery, sensitive Jack.

<b>                    LUCIEN

A FLOOD-LAMP and HORN shatter the reverie.

A COAST GUARD patrol boat has caught them. A megaphone
squawks to life.

Allen, nervous waits outside. Lucien already inside getting
reprimanded by the Dean. Allen can hear the conversation
through the door.

He leans in closer.

</b>
Lucien in a leather-backed chair. The DEAN (40's, sardonic)
overlooks Lucien's record. Lucien's mother, MARION CARR, a
fallen matriarch, smokes with dispassion.

<b>                    DEAN

Louis Ginsberg rounds the corner with an unfamiliar woman.

The woman, EDITH (early 30s, Jewish, shy), waves nervously.

</b>          Hi. I'm Edith Cohen.

Louis SLAPS his son.

Lucien storms out of the Dean's office, followed by Marion,
putting on her fur coat. Marion inspects her son's new
accomplice then races after her son. Louis motions to Lucien.

<b>                    LOUIS

Allen stares down his father. Gathering courage to defy him.

</b>          No. I stole the boat. And it was
          tremendous.


<b>EXT. SEMINARY GARDENS - NIGHT

In the quiet, Lucien smokes and stares up -- he looks
ravaged. A suitcase beside him.

Allen approaches, surprised.

explodes out of him.

          monologue, all of a sudden, I
          realize: I don't care. I've never
          not cared. So, I told them it was
          my idea. To steal the boat.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Why?

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Because I don't want to be the
          person they think I am. I'm on
          academic probation. I could be
          kicked out. You can't leave. You
          started something and I have no

</b>          It's our turn. Let's show them what

Allen, Lucien, Jack and Bill spy on the PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
and a female PAGE at the main desk. The librarian places a
KEY RING in a drawer.

</b>          It must come back exactly as you
          found it.

The Permissions Librarian heads off. Seeing the young page
alone, Jack tucks in his shirt, SLICKS his hair down. Jabs a
piece of gum from his mouth into Lucien's palm.

<b>                    JACK

Jack strolls up to the desk. Winks at the page.

joins the first.

Gwendolyn paws the front of Allen's pants, undoes his belt.
Uncomfortable, Allen stops her.

Allen and Lucien holding eye contact, Allen thrusts into her
mouth, comes. Gwendolyn rises back up, unimpressed, drops her
sweater.

<b>                          GWENDOLYN
</b>             I knew it.

She grabs the KEYS that are now back on the shelf. Allen
looks to find Lucien. But he is gone.

<b>                       GWENDOLYN
</b>             I bet you don't even read.

Gwendolyn walks off. Allen lifts his pants, ties his belt.

<b>                          ALLEN
</b>             I do.


<b>EXT. COLUMBIA LIBRARY - NIGHT

Shots of the darkened church-like building. Deserted.
Timeless.

<b>INT. CARD CATALOGUE AREA, LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b>
The light from the boys' flashlights SLICES through the dark
as they enter into the library through a heavy door.

Bill reaches into Jack's mouth and takes the chewing gum from
inside it. Jack shoots a glare at him - what the hell?

Bill presses the sticky gum into the strike plate of the door
-- blocking the door from being able to close shut.

The boys look at each other, give each other the silent nod,
then split -- Lucien and Jack sneak off to the main hall,
Bill and Allen up to the stacks.

Behind them, the chewing gum slips, falls from the strike
plate. The door shuts.

And LOCKS.

<b>INT. STACKS - NIGHT
</b>
Outside a gated "RESTRICTED ACCESS" room, Bill grabs the
padded LOCK and fits in his molded KEY. Allen watches as he
turns it...

The lock CLICKS open.


<b>INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT
</b>
Jack and Lucien unscrew the glass from the VITRINES encasing
the historic books and manuscripts we saw earlier.


<b>EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b>
Walking into the light of the street lamp outside the library
is David. He approaches two campus security GUARDS on the
night patrol.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Excuse me. I think I saw some light
          or movement in the library.

The security guards FLASH their lights at the facade.


<b>INT. RESTRICTED ACCESS ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Bill throws open the metal gate between them and the
restricted books inside.

An ALARM explodes into the quiet.

Bill and Allen look at each other: this was unexpected.


<b>INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT
</b>
Jack and Lucien jolt as the alarm goes off, look up from the
vitrines to each other. What is going on up there?


<b>EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b>
The guards hear the alarm coming from inside the library.
They race to unlock the CHAIN holding the doors locked
together.
<b>                                                        56.

<b>INT. RESTRICTED ACCESS ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Bill rushes past the gate, shines his flashlight searching
the books until he finds a box marked RESTRICTED CONTENT.

He empties it, tossing the books to Allen. We've seen this
move before.


<b>INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT
</b>
Allen, carrying the restricted books, runs up to Jack and
Lucien at the vitrines which are now wide open and empty.

<b>                    JACK
</b>              (whispered)
          What just happened?

Jack and Lucien grab the books from Allen and start to set
them in the cases. The alarm suddenly STOPS.

<b>                    SECURITY GUARD (O.S.)
</b>          We know you're here!

The footsteps of the guards approach. Game over. Their work
not done, the boys RACE back to the door they came through.

All EXCEPT LUCIEN. He ducks behind the vitrine, hiding. He
clicks off his flashlight.

The guards ENTER the main hall, searching for the culprits.

Allen, Jack and Bill reach the closed door. They can't open
it.

No way out. Allen turns, notices Lucien is missing.


<b>INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

The guards step right past Lucien and STOP. Lucien ducks,
rounds to the side of the case.

<b>INT. CARD CATALOGUE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Bill, Jack and Allen slide along the wall of card catalogs,
back to the main hall looking for another exit.

Through the arch leading inside, they can see the guards
canvasing the room with flashlights.

<b>                    SECURITY GUARD
</b>          We know you're here!

<b>                    SECURITY GUARD #2
</b>          Come on out!

Across the room, Bill spots TWO GLASS DOORS leading out to a
balcony. He points at the doors.

Jack WHIPS his flashlight in a tremendous arc to another
room. It clatters noisily, a distraction.

It works. The guards CHASE after the noise.

Jack, Bill, Allen BOLT to the glass doors. They throw them
wide open. Allen is about to leave, but stops Jack.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Wait. Lucien.

Allen turns and sees Lucien, still furiously working, books
under his arm.

Jack shakes his head, follows Bill and races out the door.
Alone, Allen RUNS back to Lucien who is madly placing the
books in the vitrines. He is a man possessed.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Lu that's enough. Come on! What's
          wrong with you?

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>              (deadly serious)
          No. Not yet, we have to finish.

A FLASHLIGHT finds them. Allen and Lucien, caught. The guards
pull out BILLY CLUBS.

<b>                    SECURITY GUARD
</b>          Don't move. It's over.

The guards GRAB Lucien. Drag him by the collar. But Allen
flees, breaks free. Lucien struggles, enraged.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Get off of me! Allen! Help!

<b>INT. CARD CATALOGUE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Allen stops, terrified. He sees: a console of switches on the
wall. Desperate, he reaches for them. Flips them all on.


<b>INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
All the lights in the whole library come on at once. A
BLINDING flash.

The guards squint and look for Allen.


<b>INT. CARD CATALOGUE AREA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Allen THROWS down all the switches.


<b>INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
The room PLUNGES into complete darkness.

Lucien realizes: this is his moment.

He wriggles out of his coat and RUNS. Allen JOINS him and the
two, reunited, run around the corner.

The guards give chase.


<b>INT. ENTRANCE FOYER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Allen and Lucien race into the vestibule between the doors
leading out to the city -- and the doors back into the
library.

Lucien presses against the exit doors: they're locked.

The GUARDS turn the corner, see the boys stuck between the
two sets of doors.

Allen blocks the library doors with his shoulder. The guards
POUND on the door.

A SOUND from outside: the padlock unlocking. Suddenly: the
exit door opens. It's Jack and Bill, with lock-picking gear
in hand.

They YANK Allen and Lucien out.

Jack slams the door, Bill runs the chain back through the

<b>                    SECURITY GUARD

The same grand steps the next morning. Students walking up

there the night before.

Inside, the pompous TOUR GUIDE from earlier showing off the
vitrines to a new crowd of parents and incoming students.

</b>          The South Hall library is a church,
          and these are the sacraments.

The crowd mumbles, then laughs. The guide, confused, looks
inside them to see the Kama Sutra opened up to a particularly
salacious page.

The explicit images from a Grecian urn.

Lady Chatterly's Lover, Ulysses, all the books banned,
restricted, kept from public eye.

And lastly: Tropic of Cancer. By Henry Miller.

The prisoners have come out to play.

Four shot glasses. Four hands.

Allen, Bill, Jack and Lucien throw back their drinks in
celebration.

The Mills Brothers "You Always Hurt The One You Love" on the
jukebox plays over this lazy, drunken afternoon.

Allen's eyes scan the wall above them, Columbia's "Hall of
Fame": newspaper headlines, yearbook photos...

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Jack, that's you, isn't it?

He sees a framed photo of Jack in a football play, mid-catch.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Yep. Last year. They still won.

stagings.

Suddenly, David appears in the bar. The group looks at each
other, mystified.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          What's he doing here?

David walks briskly over to Lucien.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Since you didn't show up earlier, I
          just hoped to give you this.

David drops a TERM PAPER on the table: "On the Decline of the
West." Allen leans over the table, inserting himself into
the conversation.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Maybe he didn't want to see you.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          I think he can speak for himself.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Yup. And he says we should all have
          another round...

Lucien stands up to get a drink. David grabs his arm. Lucien
tries to push him off.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          You've had plenty of time to
          celebrate. Your library hijink made
          the morning paper. I'm sure you're
          all very proud.

Allen, Jack and Bill glance at each other suspiciously, then
at David.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          How did you know it was us?

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Did he use that "Bastille" line?
          Cause I gave it to him.

Allen, Jack and Bill look at Lucien, shocked.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          I haven't seen you for days.

David throws down Lucien's cravat to the table. The one we
remember him wearing when we first met him in the library. A
private power move.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          You left this at my place.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>              (to David, a guess)
          You told the guards we were there.
          No one else knew.

David does not respond. Jack suddenly jolts up. Shoves David
back.
<b>                                                        62.

<b>                    JACK

Lucien explodes at David.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          You wanted me to get kicked out?!
          You ratted on me!

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Stop, Lu. You're losing control
          again. You know what comes next. I
          know what comes next.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Yeah.
              (to Lucien)
          Cut him off.

Lucien gives David a fatal look.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Best of luck, Janitor.

<b>                       DAVID
</b>          Excuse me?

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          We are over. Leave.

Lucien spindles the paper and plunges it into a beer. David
in shock, begins to shatter in front of them.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Look at me, Lu.

Tears well in David's eyes. Lucien sits back down, ignores
him. Bill stands up, tries to lead David away.

<b>                       BILL
</b>          Let's go.

<b>                    DAVID

          You said I was everything to you.
          You are everything to me.
          Everything to me. Do you hear me?

David fractures. Utterly vulnerable. This is it: the real
uninhibited, uncensored self.

<b>                    BILL
</b>          Let's go. Time and place, David.

<b>                    DAVID

He turns sharply to Lucien saying loud enough so everyone can
hear.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          You'd be dead if it weren't for me!

Lucien totally dead cold. Allen, unsure what David is talking
about. David turns and rushes outside and Bill follows him.

Alone with Allen and Jack, Lucien suddenly smiles as if
nothing just happened, puts his arm around Allen.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          You'd be boring if it weren't for

</b>          And...go!

Jack crouched inside an empty barrel. Trashed, Lucien kicks
the barrel down a grassy slope.

Allen and Lucien cheer Jack on as the barrel bangs down the
slope. But then it swerves, SLAMS into a bench. At the top of
the slope, Lucien and Allen look on in shock.

<b>                    LUCIEN

              (no response)
          He broke his fucking neck. The

Jack staggers from out of the barrel. Throws his hands in the
air victoriously. Allen and Lucien cheer him on.

<b>                    ALLEN

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          All right Ginsy, your turn.

Drunk, Allen tries to stand up. But then falls right back
down. Lucien laughs, tucks his body next to Allen's.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          This is just the beginning, you

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Your fault, Ginsy. It's all your
          fault.

Lucien's thigh brushes against Allen's.

Allen stares at Lucien, in the full glare of Lucien's warmth.

Allen looks around. The park is empty. Building up the
courage.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          First thought, best thought.

He grazes his hand against Lucien's inner thigh. Lucien looks
down at Allen's hand curiously, then back at Allen.

The decisive moment. Allen leans over. Kisses him. It builds
in passion.

Lucien pulls back, unsure. Then returns the kiss. It builds
in passion.

Everything Allen had hoped for, lensed into a moment.

<b>                    JACK (O.S.)
</b>          I think I just puked on the inside.

Lucien opens his eyes to notice Jack stumbling up the slope.

He tenses, pulls away from Allen.

The moment has been shattered.

As if nothing just happened, Lucien stands and looks at Jack
with his usual devilish smile.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Let's go, Jack.

He throws his arm around Jack's shoulder, turning his back to
Allen. They start to walk off. Jack stops, turns back to
Allen.

<b>                    JACK

Lucien glares at Allen.

<b>                    LUCIEN

          Come on, Lion.

The two of them leave. Allen, abandoned and broken, puts his
head in his hands.

Lucien and Jack stumble into Jack's apartment. Edie sits with

</b>          Then we should have a drink! How
          about a drink, Grandma Frankie? You
          want some red wine?

Jack heads to the cabinet. Edie follows him.

<b>                    EDIE
</b>          Where the hell have you been?!

<b>                       JACK
</b>          I was out.

Edie's rage boils over.

<b>                    EDIE
</b>          I packed all your stuff. It's in
          your bag. I'm going to be at Gram's
          tonight.

Jack reaches for her. She shakes him off.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          Stay. I'm sorry.

<b>                     EDIE

<b>INT. 118TH STREET BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
Edie's gone. The apartment is quiet. Lucien and Jack, crashed
out on Jack's bed.

The sound of a strange KNOCKING against a window outside.
Lucien wakes up. Sees Jack still asleep.

He rises to investigate.


<b>INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Lucien sees David, desperate, alone, on the fire escape.
Lucien can't believe this. He opens the window.
<b>                                                           67.

<b>                    DAVID

          I had to tell you I'm sorry. Let me
          make it up to you.

From behind...

<b>                    JACK (O.S.)
</b>          Lu, where are you?

Lucien stares down David.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          I'm going back to bed. Another word
          and I call the police.

Lucien turns around and leaves David alone at the sill. From
inside the living room, David hears a MEOW.

He spots Jack's cat KIT KAT looking up at him.


<b>INT. 118TH STREET BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
The sound of gas and a violent STRUGGLING from the other
room.

Jack quickly wakes up.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          What the hell?!

Jack jumps out of bed and grabs a baseball bat.


<b>INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Jack walks up the hallway. The living room, eerily empty.
Then a howling from the kitchen.


<b>INT. KITCHEN, 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
Jack rushes in. Turns on the light. The sounds are coming
from the OVEN.

He rushes to the oven door and opens it. Kit Kat struggles in
the oven, gassed and barely alive. Jack turns off the oven,
clutches his cat.

<b>                    JACK
</b>          It's okay. Shhh.

          What kind of sick son of a bitch

</b>          I'll wring his fucking neck.

LUCIEN's P.O.V.: Jack's Merchant Marine duffel bag that Edie
has fully packed for him.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          I have another idea.


<b>INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - THE NEXT DAY
</b>
Allen sits at a table at the library he just broke into and
robbed. But now he's just another student sitting at a study
desk.

He puts in a blank page in the typewriter before him and
types: "On The Decline of the West. By..."

He hesitates, breaking down in tears.

Then finishes typing: "Lucien Carr."


<b>INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY
</b>
Lucien, in a Merchant Marine uniform, packs his clothes into
a sailor's duffel bag. Allen enters, type-written pages in
hand.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Your paper and my apology.

Allen hands Lucien the paper he wrote for him. But Lucien
doesn't take it. Allen registers that he's packing.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Where are you going?

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Sailing out. To Paris.

Lucien grabs his BOY-SCOUT KNIFE. Puts it in his pocket.
Allen is speechless.
<b>                                                        69.

Silence. Lucien continues his packing. Allen breaks down.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Fuck you. You're a phony. You got
          me and Jack and Bill making your
          vision come true. All because you
          couldn't do it yourself.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          No, you got what you wanted. You
          were ordinary, just like every
          other freshman, and I made your
          life extraordinary. Go be you now,
          all by yourself. Leave me alone.

Allen, now in tears, realizing the end is here.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          You don't really mean that.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>              (cold, deadened)
          Allen. Leave.

Allen gathers himself, stumbles out the door. Leaving the
friendship behind.

Alone, Lucien cracks, breaking down as he closes his
suitcase.


<b>EXT. SEMINARY COURTYARD - DAY
</b>
Allen crosses through the courtyard, heading to class. He
comes upon David, waiting for Lucien. Pale. Distraught.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Allen, have you seen him? He's not
          in his room.

</b>          I know who you are. We're the ones

          hurts, doesn't it?

Allen burns, does not respond. David is right.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          All I am asking is tell me where he
          is. Please.

CLOSE ON: Allen, on the blade of a choice.


<b>INT. MERCHANT MARINE, BILLETING OFFICE - EVENING
</b>
Jack and Lucien in a long line of young soldiers waiting to
ship out. Lucien nips at a flask. They reach the front of the
line. A BILLETING OFFICER calls out to them.

<b>                    BILLETING OFFICER
</b>          Lemme see your papers.

<b>                    LUCIEN

Jack tries not to laugh, hands over his paperwork. The
officer points to Lucien.

As they turn to leave, they see David is there, descending
the stairs. Jack is about to pounce.

Lucien holds Jack back, rushes up to David.

</b>          How did you know I would be here?!

<b>                    DAVID

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          The reason I'm leaving is you.

It doesn't register. Desperate, David holds out the passes.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Then you and Jack take them. I'll
          catch up.

Lucien considers this, then makes a fateful decision.

</b>          Come with me. We're taking a walk.


<b>INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

Allen, wrecked, walks into the bar where he first drank with
Lucien.

He sees an older man eyeing him and sits down, terrified.

from crying. Jack drops his duffel bag. Sits with her.

</b>          I'm sorry.

Edie embraces him.

be?

</b>          Lu?

Allen races to him. The man turns and Allen's heart sinks. It
is a SAILOR, a distant echo of Lucien.

The Sailor eyes Allen gently, seductively.

Allen walks up to him.


<b>INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT

Edie breaks the embrace.

<b>                    EDIE

She hands Jack a package from the mail. A new record.

</b>          Sammy...

Jack places it on the record player and listens, clutching
Edie. He knows immediately there won't be another record.

visibly arguing.

Lucien throws his flask into the woods, LASHES out at David.

Realizing what he did the night before and how it felt so
natural -- now he knows exactly who he is.


<b>INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

The BLARE of a prison horn. A guard opens a heavy gate and
Allen walks onto the hall of cells. It's a long, dank walk.

Allen spots Lucien in a small unremarkable cell, behind bars,
reading. Allen can't believe he's here.

Lucien sits up from his cot and rushes to the bars.

The moment right after Lucien stabbed David. What we have not
seen yet. The story continues.

David trembles on the ground, bleeding from the knife would.
Lucien stands above, realizing what just happened.

Car headlamps swipe across Lucien's face. Terrified, Lucien
scans the park for witnesses.

<b>                    BILL (O.S.)
</b>          He might not have wanted you to

Lucien DRAGS David's body from the park under a railing to
the shoreline.

He unties his shoes, LASHES David's hands together with the
shoelaces. Ties them tight.

David groans and gurgles blood. Still very much ALIVE.

Lucien rustles through David's pockets -- pulls out anything
side. He tosses David's pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes, now
speckled with blood - to the sand.

Lucien collects stones from the riverbank, STUFFS them into
David's pockets.

<b>                    BILL (O.S.)
</b>          He put stones in his pockets to

Lucien panics, looks around. He takes off his Merchant Marine
clothes. Fully naked, he drags a bound David into the dark
waters of the Hudson River.

David moans and struggles but is no match for Lucien.

Nothing. He ruffles through the console table. Again nothing.

He notices David's SUITCASE. The one David packed before
planning on leaving by boat with Lucien.

Allen opens it. He digs through it, searching for some clue,
any clue -- something to shed light on the past.

He pulls out a pile of clothes and underneath them...a book.

It's a copy of Yeats' A VISION, covered in notes. It's
David's.

It's the same edition of the copy that Lucien showed Allen in

A stack of PAPERS fall from the book. Allen rifles through
them.

And finds a faded pink hospital "ADMIT" form.

Cook County Hospital, Chicago. March 1943.

He scans down the page: "Carr, Lucien. Suicide Attempt. Gas
Inhalation. Admitting Person: D. Kammerer."

At the bottom, the form reads "Next of Kin."

Beside is the name: David Kammerer.

Below, Allen sees POSTCARDS, PHOTOS. Photos of the beach, of
Lucien and David, reclining together. It's their trip to
Mexico.

In photo, the two of them, posing for the camera together.
Smiling. Looking very much like a couple in love.

Lucien's signature red CRAVAT hangs around David's neck.

On the backside, written by hand is:

His mother, Naomi, approaches, tentatively. The first time

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          So in Chicago, you tried to kill
          yourself.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          How can you say that? You know
          that's not true.

Lucien stops short. Stares hard at David.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          I will never give up on us.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          He rescued you. He saved your life.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          You're pathetic.

Lucien walks on, but David lunges for him. They struggle.

Lucien throws David off, spins free from his grasp, pulls out
his Boy Scout knife from his pocket.

The two men face each other.
<b>                                                          89.
</b>

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          You needed him as much as he needed
          you.

The bare blade FLASHES between them. David, looking at the
knife, shocked that their relationship has come to this. He
looks back up at Lucien.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Now I know how you felt.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          When?

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          When you wanted to die.

David takes a step, closing the gap between him and the
knife. Daring Lucien to strike.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Do it.

Lucien moves forward. The gap narrows. Just inches away from
each other.

David steps forward onto the blade. Lucien does not back off.
David gasps, notices the knife deep in his chest to the hilt.

Blood pumps from the gash.

Lucien frees the knife. Then pulls back and STABS David a
second time. With malice.

And again. Plunges the blade into his chest. He grinds the
knife into David even further..

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Oh my god...

David DROPS, clutching his shirt, his life pulsing from his
chest.

<b>EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK
</b>
Out in the Hudson River, Lucien cradles David's dying body in
his arms. David looks up at Lucien, his last moment of life.
The opening shot of the film.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          And if you try to let them go...

David's eyes CLOSE. Lucien releases David out into the
current.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          ...they only circle back and return
          to you.

David sinks into the depths of the Hudson, becoming just a
shadow then disappearing altogether.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          They become part of who you are.

<b>INT. THE TOMBS - DAY

From his cell, Lucien Carr finishes reading Allen's
<b>DEPOSITION.
</b>
<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Or they destroy you.

We have returned to the opening scene of the movie. Lucien
crumples the paper in his hand.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          You can't show this to anyone.

Allen stares at Lucien defiantly through the bars.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Then tell the truth, Lu.

<b>                    LUCIEN

Allen grabs for the manuscript. Lucien pulls it out of reach.

<b>                     LUCIEN
</b>          You wanted him gone too. You sent
          him to me.

Allen SNATCHES the manuscript -- it's a tug of war through
the bars.

<b>                    LUCIEN (CONT'D)
</b>          Please. You'll kill me with that.

Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip. He heads towards
the exit of the prison. Desperate, Lucien calls out after
him.

<b>                    LUCIEN
</b>          Allen! No! DON'T!

An alarm HAMMERS through the prison, sending us to...


<b>INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
The New York City's District Attorney's SECRETARY at her
reception desk. Allen enters the room, his deposition in
hand. He is visibly nervous as he approaches the desk.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Allen Ginsberg.

<b>                    SECRETARY
</b>          He'll be with you in a minute.
          Please, have a seat.

Allen waits, glances at the deposition in his lap. The title
reads, "The Night in Question."


<b>INT. JAIL - DAY
</b>
From his prison bed, Lucien stares down the cellblock,
hopeless. His eyes alight on his sheets.


<b>INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
The camera moves in an arc, rotating past Allen, sweating,
toward the door of the DISTRICT ATTORNEY...
<b>                                                        92.

<b>INT. JAIL - DAY
</b>
...the same circle finds Lucien as he RIPS the bedsheet into
strips. Frantic...


<b>INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
The circle discovers Allen, unable to sit still. The weight
of his decision crushes him...


<b>INT. JAIL - DAY
</b>
...Lucien fashions a noose around his neck. He ties the sheet
to one of the cell bars. We glide past him back to...


<b>INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
...Allen spies the shadow of the District Attorney behind
frosted glass of his office...


<b>INT. JAIL - DAY
</b>
...the circling suddenly STOPS at Lucien as the knot on the
noose catches. He is hanging, choking, desperate to die and
yet fighting for life.

But the knot on the cell bars releases. Lucien FALLS to the
ground.

Alive.


<b>INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
The secretary hangs up the phone.

<b>                    SECRETARY
</b>          Mr. Ginsberg. He's ready for you.

She looks at the chair. No one is there.

<b>                    SECRETARY
</b>          Mr. Ginsberg?

The sound of the door closing. Allen is gone.

<b>                    MALE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          How did you expect us to react to
          this?

</b>

<b>INT. COLUMBIA DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Allen's manuscript HITS the Dean's desk.

The deposition's title page now reads "The Night in Question
by Allen Ginsberg." It's been refashioned into a novella.

Allen sits in the same chair where Lucien was reprimanded.
Professor Steeves sits silently beside the Dean at his desk.

<b>                    DEAN
</b>          No, please tell me. Professor
          Steeves says you submitted it as
          your final.

Allen, nervous in the chair.

<b>                    DEAN
</b>          Well, then, let me tell you. It is
          smutty and absurd.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          But you finished it.

The Dean loses his patience.

<b>                    DEAN
</b>          You've taken incompletes in two
          classes. And you are already on
          academic probation. There are rules
          you agreed to upon admittance into
          this university. And you have
          managed to break and keep breaking
          them. You don't seem to have much
          respect for this institution. So
          you may either retract this fiction
          as your final. Or you may choose to
          be expelled. What will it be?

Professor Steeves eyes Allen.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Fine.

Allen stands, making his decision.

<b>                    ALLEN
</b>          Consider me expelled.

Allen reaches for his manuscript. The Dean SLIDES it out of
reach.

<b>                    DEAN
</b>          This remains with us.
<b>                                                           94.

Professor Steeves keeps a close eye on Allen as he leaves the
office.


<b>INT. GINSBERG HOME - DAY
</b>
Back in the Ginsberg residence, but the house is quiet now,
peaceful. No Naomi. The radio playing softly in the living
room. Louis jotting down verse on the back of the mail.

Allen, shirt untucked, composing a poem on the back of a
bill.

They both reach for their cigarettes at the same time.

Louis looks at Allen writing. A mirror between father and
son. A moment of warm appreciation.

Louis hands Allen a package from the mail pile.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          This came for you today.

The package is from Columbia University. Allen opens it,
mystified as to what it might be.

It's his manuscript.

On it, a note: "Walt Jr.: Keep this, Keep Going. - Professor
Steeves."

The music on the radio suddenly stops for a news broadcast.

<b>                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          This is Bill O'Connell reporting
          from Paris and these are the sounds
          of liberation.

Over the radio comes the sound of a ROARING CELEBRATION.

<b>                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          Crowds have assembled in the
          streets.

Allen takes in the historic news. He looks at his father. The
world, forever changed.

<b>                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          This is the end of a long darkness.
          France and Europe are finally free.

Crowds ERUPT in whistles and cheers. Allen takes it in. The
moment Lucien had dreamed of.
<b>                                                           95.

The Mills Brothers' "You Always Hurt The One You Love" starts
to play.


<b>EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - DAY
</b>
Sun streaming on Allen, standing at the bank of the Hudson
River, at the place where David died.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          Another lover hits the universe.

But the night here has passed, a new day begun. It's now
pastoral, shimmering. Strolling couples, families walk by.

Allen closes his eyes.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          The circle is broken.


<b>INT. WEST END BAR - DAY
</b>
A raucous crowd now fills the boys' old haunt. Soldiers, New
Yorkers of all kinds, pouring champagne, toasting the end of
the Second World War.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          But with death comes rebirth.

The camera searches through the crowd to find Allen smoking
in a banquette towards the rear of the bar, dressed-down,
scruffy - a hint of the man he will soon become.

He is joyous, writing in his journal.

<b>                    ALLEN (V.O.)
</b>          And like all lovers and sad people

The camera then pans past Allen, up and across the old
college photos on the wall.

We find a framed newspaper article on the Columbia's football
team's latest victory.

In the corner of the article, we see a familiar face.

As we move closer, we can read the edge of the headline
reads: "HONOR SLAYING."

The face belongs to Lucien Carr, staring down, frozen in
time.

Lucien is now on the wall.
<b>                                                         96.

The following TEXT CARDS fade up on screen.

<b>FIRST CARD:
</b>
Portraying David Kammerer as a homosexual predator, Lucien
Carr pled guilty to first degree manslaughter. He served 18
months in a reformatory.

He worked as an editor at United Press International, where
he remained until his death in 2005.

He married twice and had three children.



<b>SECOND CARD:
</b>
Edie Parker's family bailed out Jack Kerouac, on the
condition they marry and move to Michigan.

Craving friends in New York, he annulled his marriage and
began a journey that would inspire his novel On the Road.



<b>THIRD CARD:
</b>
William Burroughs left his family to pursue a criminal life
in New York that he documented in his novels Junkie and Naked
Lunch. He co-wrote his first novel with Jack, a novel based
on David Kammerer's murder.

It was kept from publication for over sixty years.



<b>FOURTH CARD:
</b>
After his expulsion from Columbia University in 1945, Allen
Ginsberg became one of the most awarded poets in American
history.

He dedicated his first published collection Howl and Other
Poems to Lucien Carr.
<b>                                                        97.
</b>

In response, Lucien asked that his name be withdrawn from all
further editions.
