<b>        PRAGUE - MORNING
</b>
        The Old Town is quiet.  It's very early in the twisted
        streets of this ancient ghetto.  Dark corners casting a
        medieval spell over a modern century oblivious to their
        romance and mystery.

        The River is the dividing line.  Elegant gardens on the
        opposite bank embracing the monotonous solemnity of the New
        Town, tower steeples silhouetted against the sombre sky.

        An empty motor bus rattles along a deserted street.

        A Gothic bridge links the two halves of the strange city.
        Its half-moon arches becoming circles as they meet their
        reflections in the water.  Thin mist swirls over the
        cobblestones above.

        A few boats in the water.  Fishermen casting their lines in
        silence.  One or two lights now burning in buildings beyond.

        In the Old Town Square the great clock on the cathedral
        strikes six.

<b>                                                       CUT:

<b>        A MAN'S FACE
</b>
        His eyes filled with terror, beads of sweat crawling on his
        brow.

        He stands in the middle of a murky courtyard, perfectly
        still.  Waiting.  Watching.

        The balconies overlooking on successive floors, looming all
        around him, are empty.  All is quiet.

        The man's name is EDUARD.  He dares not move for fear of
        missing a single sound.  And then he hears it.  A small noise
        of movement nearby.  He runs.

<b>        TINY ALLEYWAY
</b>
        He runs alone in the dim light of the deserted morning.

<b>        CROOKED PASSAGEWAY
</b>
        Running for his life.

<b>        NARROW LANE
</b>
        Running on sheer pumping fear, long after the verge of
        collapse.

<b>        BLACK TUNNEL
</b>
        Coming out into the light, but by no means out of danger, he
        allows himself a brief pause, gasping for air, just for a
        moment looking back into the gloom, starting to retreat again
        even as he does, then turning running ...

<b>        WINDING STREET
</b>
        He runs on, past boarded-up houses and shuttered inns,
        strange relics of the Middle Ages casting frightening
        shadows.

<b>        AROUND A CORNER
</b>
        Eduard appears suddenly, quickly flattens himself back
        against the large notice board that covers the wall here,
        layers of expressionistic theatre and film posters pasted on
        it.

        He breathes painfully in short bursts, as silently as he
        can.  He watches the corner he's just come from, the ornate
        archway through which any pursuer must emerge.

        Nothing there.  But then a shadow moves.

        Eduard's shoulders tense.  His eyes widen.  He holds his
        breath.

        The shadow ... spreading ...

        Eduard edges away ever so slowly, keeping his unblinking gaze
        on the archway, backing off, one arm brushing the notice
        board as he feels his way along it, macabre images on the
        posters, some torn and incomplete, revealing other fragments
        behind, Eduard's eyes staring constant, no noise here at all
        and --

        A HAND!  clamps over his face from behind.  All of a sudden
        and out of absolutely nowhere and not a thing he can do about
        it.

        But he tries, his hands coming up to grip the arm that grasps
        him, an arm of iron.

        The hand is huge.  It covers Eduard's face almost entirely,
        only one eye gaping bloodshot through the fingers, ghastly
        fingers that, just for a second, seem almost inhuman, perhaps
        even fingers that seem incompatible on the same hand, a hand
        covered in scar tissue, starting to squeeze as it pulls
        Eduard swiftly away.

<b>                                                       CUT:
</b>
<b>        A ROW OF TYPEWRITERS - DAY
</b>
        Clacketing incessantly under slightly more agile and refined
        fingers.  Beyond these, another row of desks.  And beyond
        that another, the office workers in their neat suits tapping
        away.

        And beyond that another, at which one worker scribbles
        furiously at his figures, the next rolls a new sheet into his
        typewriter, the next answers his clanging telephone, the next
        rifles through the pages of a massive record book, the next
        sits erect in his chair playing his machine like a piano, and
        the last, by the window, dusty light streaming across him,
        contemplatively taps the end of a pencil onto his desk.  This
        is KAFKA.

        A rather tall young man with a kind, sensitive face.
        sensitive perhaps because his eyes, ears, and nose seem
        slightly bigger and more inquiring than most, and his gaze
        one of almost unrelenting intensity.

        He's looking off at something now.

        A desk, not very far from his own.  But empty.  The chair
        pushed squarely under it.  The typewriter covered.

        Kafka is wondering why -- when his concentration is
        interrupted.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      Kafka.

        Kafka turns to see BURGEL, a creep.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      The keeper of the files is still
                      waiting for your final summation
                      of the Erlanger claim.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      I gave it to him yesterday.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                            (doesn't understand)
                      You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      No, I left it in his office.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      Did you see him?

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      I've never seen him.  I don't
                      believe there is a keeper of the
                      files.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      He's usually in the storage room
                      sorting things out.  He can't
                      close the file on a case until he
                      has the concluding report.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      He has it, he just hasn't noticed
                      it yet, all right?

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      Who's to say he ever will?  He's
                      a timid old man and quite careful
                      not to tread on anyone's toes --
                      In fact, I'm the only one he trusts
                      and he wouldn't even look at a
                      document if it didn't first come
                      through me.

        Burgel just won't go away.  Kafka tries to get on with his
        work.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      In an organization as efficient as
                      ours, if a document once in a great
                      while gets lost it might never be
                      found at all.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                            (tiring of this)
                      Burgel, I thought it would be
                      easier, as long as I was passing --

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error
                      like this damages my credibility.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Your credibility -- yes, it's well
                      known.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                            (flushed)
                      When I deliver a message the very
                      act of delivering it, you might say,
                      gives it an official stamp, and only
                      in this way are both the sender and
                      the receiver satisfied that it was
                      delivered at all.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      I'll commit that to memory.

        They stare at each other with mutual antagonism.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      Your position in this firm is not
                      unassailable.

        He waddles away.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Has one more look over at the empty desk before returning to
        his work.

<b>        THE OFFICE
</b>
        The desks make a checkerboard pattern of the huge floor as
        Burgel calculates his path among them.

<b>        LODGING HOUSE - MIDDAY
</b>
        Kafka comes up the stairs to the top landing.  He knocks on a
        door.  Waits.  Knocks again.  Leans a little closer to listen
        for a moment, then goes away back down the stairs.

<b>        GROUND FLOOR
</b>
        Kafka comes through the door that divides the stairs from the
        hall, goes to knock on the door of the first apartment down
        here.

<b>                                  BIZARRE VOICE
</b>                      Yes?

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      I'm sorry to disturb you -- I
                      wonder if you know where my
                      friend Eduard is?

<b>                                  BIZARRE VOICE
</b>                      I can't hear you! -- You'd better
                      come in.

<b>        APARTMENT
</b>
        Kafka comes in tentatively, seeing the CONCIERGE in a far
        corner of the cluttered room, in bed, covers tucked right up
        to her chin.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      -- I didn't want to bother you.

<b>                                  CONCIERGE
</b>                      Well, you have.  What do you
                      want?

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                          (pointing upstairs)
                      My friend Eduard, I wonder if you've
                      seen him?  He hasn't been in to
                      work, I thought he might be ill.

<b>        STAIRS
</b>
        The Concierge trudges up to the top floor, Kafka following
        guiltily.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      You didn't have to get out of
                      bed -- I could have taken the key.

<b>                                  CONCIERGE
</b>                      Yes, I'm sure you could.

        She treats him like dirt.

<b>        EDUARD'S ROOM
</b>
        The door unlocks and the two of them come in.  Kafka goes to
        open the window curtain.  He turns around to see the
        Concierge already poking about in drawers.

        He ignores her and looks around the room on his own.  Eduard
        isn't here.  Nothing else seems out of place.  He wonders
        instead how he can dissuade the Concierge from her
        unbelievable snooping.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Well, he's not here.

        The Concierge takes a tie from one of the drawers and models
        it over her own ample chest.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Do you think you ought to do
                      that?

        She looks at him indignantly.

</b>                      The manners of a tramp!  It's my
                      house, isn't it?

<b>        OFFICES - AFTERNOON
</b>
        Kafka is in another section of the building, finding his way
        through a department he's vaguely unfamiliar with.  He
        searches out a particular person -- a strikingly beautiful
        woman with flaming hair and wild eyes.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Miss Rossmann?

        GABRIELA looks around from a file cabinet.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in

<b>                                  GABRIELA

<b>                                  KAFKA

</b>                      Why would you suppose so?

</b>                      Oh -- well, I thought he once
                      mentioned --

                      One of you must be mistaken.

        He follows her to a counter where someone stamps the document
        she thrusts forward without even glancing at her or it.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      I'm sorry, but I just wondered --

                      Excuse me, I have to copy this for
                      Central Docketing by 2:30.

        Kafka watches her go -- then notices some smarmy young clerks
        giggling over what they suppose was a romantic rebuff.

<b>        KAFKA'S DEPARTMENT

        Burgel sees Kafka coming back in toward his desk, immediately
        walks to intersect him.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      You're late -- I knew it would
                      happen one day.

        Kafka ignores him utterly, leaving Burgel standing clutching
        his files with a sour expression.

        Kafka pauses at Eduard's desk, still untouched, then
        continues on to his own.

<b>        OFFICE OF THE CHIEF CLERK
</b>
        Partitioned off from the rest, but commanding a full view of
        all.  Through the glass windows the CHIEF CLERK, a stern-
        Looking fellow, notices Kafka and takes his watch out of his
        pocket for a look.

        RINGS, signalling the end of the work day.  The office

<b>        OFFICE STAIRWELL
</b>
        The office workers stream down the stairs that wind around a
        central elevator shaft, the gated elevator grinding upwards
        at the same time.

        When Kafka reaches the ground floor he passes a pair of
        SENIOR PARTNERS conferring together -- and does a double-take
        when he hears his <u>name</u> mentioned -- then sees the two men
        shake hands conclusively and turn away.  Kafka continues
        walking away himself, worried about his future.

<b>        OUTSIDE
</b>
        The office workers pour out of the building, all going in
        different directions.  Three of them get jammed in the
        doorway, untangle themselves, and Kafka is the next to
        emerge.

        regular gathering and, from their warm reception, considered
        incomplete without him.

</b>                      I've been hearing all about you.

        Kafka cringes.

</b>                      Don't worry, Kafka -- I championed
                      your virtues.

<b>                                  KAFKA

                      wouldn't frighten her needlessly.

</b>                      I've lived all my life in this city
                      -- it frightens me.  As it draws me
                      closer into its web.

                      has no <u>present</u>.

</b>                      Even the so-called New Town isn't
                      so new.  Only the people.  People
                      of the future living in buildings
                      of the past.

                      Has anyone seen Eduard?

                      My friend Eduard from the office --
                      I've brought him here lots of times
                      -- you used to marvel at his travel
                      stories.

<b>                                  JULIUS

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      What d'you mean, oh him?  He's
                      a perfectly nice person, he's never
                      missed a day before.

<b>                                  ERNST
</b>                      Perhaps he's taken up with those
                      traveling players you two were
                      so fond of.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      No, it's me who always wanted to
                      run away with them -- except that
                      that life would be far too hectic
                      for me.  I'm worried about him, no
                      one's seen him.

</b>                      Haven't you ever called in sick
                      and gone roaming about, free of
                      responsibility to anyone, if only
                      for a day?

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      When you work for a medical firm
                      you can't call in sick.  They know
                      malingerers like a dog knows fleas.

                      work.

        Kafka shrugs shyly.

        Smoke heavier in the air, the coffee house more crowded with
        strange groups of characters.  Kafka and his friends
        preparing to leave.

<b>                                  STELLA
</b>                      The cabaret will be packed this

</b>                      Well, it has to be the cabaret
                      because there's nowhere else to go.

                      You know I can't stay up late.

</b>                      Home is the last resort --

<b>        BIZZLEBEK
</b>
        The owner of the voice.  A man sitting at the bar nearby,
        turning on his stool to face them.  A dissipated dandy of a
        man.

<b>                                  ERNST
</b>                            (introducing him)
                      -- Do you know Bizzlebek --
                      the gravedigger?

<b>                                  BIZZLEBEK
</b>                      <u>Stonecutter</u>, if you please.

<b>                                  MARGARETE
</b>                      <u>Sculptor</u>, if only he'd admit it.

<b>                                  BIZZLEBEK
</b>                      No one should admit being an artist
                      unless they're paid for it.  If
                      you go to the cabaret mention my
                      name -- they'll find a table for you.

        Turning round again.

<b>                                  ERNST
</b>                      Bizzlebek has ways and means denied
                      lesser mortals.  It comes from working
                      in the cemetery all day -- he's able
                      to transcent the physical world.

        Bizz1ebek turns round again, with a bored sign.

<b>                                  BIZZLEBEK
</b>                      No -- it only makes me view people
                      dispassionately as so many ... slabs.

        He looks about, characterizing various coffee house types:

<b>                                  BIZZLEBEK
</b>                      Quartz ... slate ... gravel ...
                      granite ... flint ...
                            (and then)
                      Marble.

        It's GABRIELA from the office.  Kafka is surprised to see
        her, instinctively walking over to where she's sitting at a
        far table.

<b>                                  JULIUS
</b>                      My God, look, he's marching forward
                      willingly to make human contact.

        Anna smiles.  She's interested in Kafka.   (Which means we
        must see this warm attractive girl as a threat, a curse, a
        trap!)

<b>        GABRIELA
</b>
        --On the other hand, is an enticement.  Kafka can't <u>help</u>
        walking towards her.  Sitting with her own friends, though
        there is something less than friendly about them.  Two men,
        two women.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                            (as Kafka comes over)
                      Hello again.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      I've never seen you here before.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Have you looked?

        Kafka feels as awkward as she knows he feels.  He looks to
        her friends, expecting an introduction, but no one makes a
        move.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Well -- nice to know life exists
                      outside the office.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                            (ironic)
                      Yes.

        Kafka nods goodbye and walks away, berating himself for
        banality.

        Kafka resists going along with the others.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      No, really, I have to go home too.

                      vocation.

<b>                                  JULIUS
</b>                      I know, he <u>consists</u> of writing.
                      We wouldn't be his friends if we
                      didn't threaten his solitude!

        Julius is a little drunk.  The others help him with his coat.

<b>        ANNA
</b>
        Has a private moment with Kafka.

<b>                                  ANNA
</b>                      Where do you live?

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Up there.

        He gestures in the direction of the River, and the castle
        that looms on a far hill beyond, huge and brooding, regally
        dominating the city.

<b>                                  ANNA
</b>                      I tried finding a place on Castle
                      Hill when I arrived.  I wanted to
                      share the majesty.

        (The majesty of marriage is what he fears she represents.
        This innocent scene could very well be a subjective
        Kafkaesque nightmare as sinister in its own way as any of the
        more outright horrific scenes to come.)

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      It's only majestic from here.
                      When you get closer you see it
                      for what it really is.

<b>                                  ANNA
</b>                      What is it really?

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      A glorified office block.  They
                      keep all the old records there --
                      the final resting place for facts
                      and figures that have ceased to
                      matter in the world of the living.

<b>                                  ANNA
</b>                      Well, as long as I admire it from
                      afar it shouldn't worry me if it's
                      hollow.

        (The castle of marriage <u>tempts</u> him -- but would suffocate
        him.)

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      It's more than hollow.  It's
                      stillborn.  For all its size it
                      serves no purpose.  It's just
                      there -- like death -- hovering
                      over a breathing city.

        in the coffee house doorway.  A figure in the shadows.

                            (looks impressed)
                      Very good.

        Kafka suspects he's being mocked.  But perhaps not.
        Bizzlebek steps out, buttoning his coat.

<b>                                  BIZZLEBEK
</b>                      If I could sculpt as well as that,

        He's already quite proud of himself -- tossing his scarf over
        his shoulder with a flourish -- and striding off into the
        night.

        Seen from just below, from the ancient cemetery that borders
        its high, impregnable, imperial walls.  The all-seeing-eye of
        the city.  An awesome edifice.

<b>        THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER
</b>
        Kafka walking across from the Old Quarter toward the New
        Town.

        He passes some working-class types who seem vaguely
        threatening.  Do they mutter some remark behind his back?

<b>        ALCHEMISTS' ROW - NIGHT
</b>
        A bizarre street.  Tiny little houses that look fashioned by
        a toymaker, all bunched tightly next to each other, forming a
        continuous rooftop of odd configurations and angles and
        pointed chimneys.  The street named after practitioners of
        the black arts and dark sciences who inhabited it in the
        Sixteenth Century.

        Kafka's house is toward the back, a light shining from the
        single upper window.  Through it, Kafka is seen sitting at
        the only desk that really matters to him -- his writing one.

<b>        KAFKA'S ROOM
</b>
        He's struggling to get a sentence right -- rereading it to
        himself.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      "As Gregor Samsa awoke one
                      morning from disturbing dreams
                      he ... from unsettling dreams ...
                      uneasy dreams ... Gregor Samsa ...
                      Gregor ...?"
                            (wondering)
                      Carl.  George.  Rudolf ...

        Suddenly there's a loud KNOCK on the front door below.

<b>        DOWNSTAIRS
</b>
        Kafka opens the tiny front door of this almost-miniature
        little house.  Two intimidating MEN stand outside, one tall,
        one short, wearing similar black suits and grim expressions.

<b>        ANOTHER DOOR - NIGHT
</b>
        Kafka tries to match the exacting pace of his two warders,
        flanking him as they walk him along a corridor, through
        another doorway.

<b>        MORGUE
</b>
        Kafka tugs his collar up a bit, his breath visible in the
        air.  He has a feeling what's going to be under the sheet on
        the lonely trolley in the middle of the room before the first
        man summons him over to it.

        Kafka goes.  The first man yanks the sheet off the face in
        one quick movement.  The face of Eduard.  White and bloated,
        the tongue jutting, the eyes bulging.

        Kafka recoils, stepping back instinctively.

<b>                                  SECOND MAN
</b>                            (still behind Kafka
                             at the door)
                      You know him?

<b>                                  KAFKA

</b>                      ... Yes.

        And now he hears a stirring in a dark corner.  He looks up
        again.

        A third man steps out of the shadows where he's been quietly
        standing and walks over to Kafka.  He is a severe man,
        stolid, dedicated, and never smiles.  He reminds Kafka of his
        father.

<b>        HALLWAY
</b>
        Kafka comes out of a door that closes behind him.  He stands
        and waits.  At a high desk a POLICEMAN is reading a
        newspaper.  Without even looking up from it he extends his
        arm and pushes Kafka slightly to one side so he's no longer
        blocking the light.

        Two other MEN are here waiting, sitting on a bench, sharing a
        private joke.  Kafka glances down at himself, wondering if
        his appearance could in any way inspire ridicule.

        The door opens again and the Inspector is back.

<b>                                  INSPECTOR

        Kafka does.  And the Chief Clerk stands up.  He paces up and
        down a bit, making Kafka awfully nervous before he finally
        clears his throat and starts to get to the point.

                      work -- there are other people to
                      consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we

                      I can't imagine the impression you
                      make on lesser employees.

        The Chief Clerk, towering over him, also reminds Kafka of his
        father.  Kafka tries putting up a defense.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      -- Eduard --

<b>                                  CHIEF CLERK
</b>                      -- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too
                      much like you -- even more so
                      perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as
                      you, so I didn't know him as well --
                      but I could see the influence he was
                      having.  I simply want you to be
                      aware of this because you'll be
                      happier for it.

        Kafka merely nods, starts to get up.

<b>                                  CHIEF CLERK
</b>                      In any case -- don't ask me why --
                      the word has come down you're to
                      be promoted.

        Kafka sits back down in the chair.

<b>                                  CHIEF CLERK
</b>                      Your colleague's death has helped
                      precipitate the need, though I can
                      tell you it's been under
                      consideration for some time.  You're
                      to be given two assistants and a
                      commensurate rise in salary.
                            (sits back behind
                             desk)
                      That's all.

        Kafka nods once, starts to go again.

<b>                                  CHIEF CLERK
</b>                      Kafka.

        Kafka turns.

<b>                                  CHIEF CLERK
</b>                      I understand you fancy yourself an
                      author.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                            (almost visibly
                             cringes)
                      In a small way.

<b>                                  CHIEF CLERK
</b>                      You might find a more athletic
                      hobby -- put some color in your
                      cheeks.

        He returns to his paperwork.  Kafka leaves.

<b>        OUTSIDE CHIEF CLERK'S OFFICE
</b>
        Walking away, Kafka notices Gabriela striding along an office
        corridor -- and sneaky Burgel confronting her.

<b>        GABRIELA
</b>
        She looks distressed, walking tall as if to bolster her
        composure.  Sneaky Burgel does not help matters by
        characteristically appearing from the sidelines.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      Good morning --
                            (she ignores him)
                      Or should I say good afternoon?

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Say what you like -- no one pays
                      the least attention.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                            (walking quickly
                             alongside her)
                      Oh, don't they?  I think you
                      underestimate my station in this
                      office and overrate your own.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Not today, Burgel.  Send one of
                      your memos, write up one of your
                      communiques, but for God's sake
                      don't bother me today.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      It's my place to offer advice, not
                      yours -- and by advising the Chief
                      Clerk of your unpunctuality it's
                      certainly not my situation that's
                      compromised, if that's what you're
                      implying.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                            (stops to glare at
                             him)
                      You're just doing your job.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      It's what I'm paid to do.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      You're detestable.

<b>                                  BURGEL
</b>                      And you're late!

        Suddenly, in a terrific release of pent-up emotion, she slaps
        him hard across the cheek, the first of what would be a
        flurry of blows if not for the fact that the unexpected force
        of it throws Burgel reeling backwards before she can deliver
        any more.  Instead she rushes away, very upset.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        As startled as the rest of the office by the incident.

        Burgel recovers, straightening up in shock and
        embarrassment.  He immediately resolves to march directly to
        the office of the Chief Clerk.

        Seeing him coming, Kafka quickly starts away.

<b>        THE ASSISTANTS - DAY
</b>
        OSKAR and LUDWIG.  They look almost the same.  At first
        glance almost identical.  It's only a closer inspection that
        shows them to be imperfect twins.  Dressed in matching suits.

        One is sitting on Kafka's new desk, the other in Kafka's new
        chair.  They're rummaging about in his papers, and whenever
        one selects a particular document for closer scrutiny, the
        other promptly snatches it out of his hand.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Coming this way, has paused, having spotted the weird duo.

<b>        THE ASSISTANTS
</b>
        Continue with their mischief until one of them notices Kafka
        coming and nudges the other so strongly he almost falls
        over.  They're both standing at attention, looking guilty, by
        the time Kafka arrives.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      My assistants, I presume.

<b>                                  ASSISTANTS
</b>                      Yes -- that's us.

        Kafka smiles at them, half in friendliness, half in amusement
        at their quirky appearance.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                            (offers his hand)
                      I'm Kafka.

        Oskar responds first, but Ludwig knocks his hand out of the
        way to get there first.

<b>                                  LUDWIG
</b>                            (shaking hands)
                      Ludwig.

<b>                                  OSKAR
</b>                            (now it's his turn)
                      Oskar.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      You look like brothers.

<b>                                  ASSISTANTS
</b>                      Yes -- we do.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Have you worked here long?

<b>                                  ASSISTANTS
</b>                      No, no, no -- quite a long time,
                      yes.

        Kafka doesn't quite know what to make of these two, but they
        seem pleasant enough fellows and they're looking at him with
        such wide-eyed innocence he doesn't know what more to say to
        them.  So he turns to look around the new area he's been
        assigned -- a burrow all to himself now -- even a personal
        clothes peg on the wall for his coat.

        The Assistants make stupid faces at each other behind his
        back, but look serious again when he turns around.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Well, we'd better move things
                      from my old desk.

<b>        ASSISTANTS
</b>
        Look at each other with identical frowns, then back at
        Kafka.  Oskar nods, as if to say "oh, all right, if we
        must."  And Ludwig grins.

        Kafka types up forms.  He hears some noise and glances over
        his shoulder to see how the Assistants are getting on --
        they're sharing another desk, facing each other, and seem to
        be working quietly, though with pouting expressions.

        Kafka rolls a new form into the typewriter -- when a shadow
        falls over the page.

<b>        THE EMBANKMENT - MIDDAY
</b>
        Kafka and Gabriela stroll by the River, Kafka finishing off
        his lunch as they go, occasionally offering tidbits to
        Gabriela who either samples or refuses them.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      I was having an affair with
                      Eduard.
                            (notes Kafka's reaction)
                      He didn't tell you?

<b>                                KAFKA
</b>                      No.

<b>                                GABRIELA
</b>                      He would have.  You were his best
                      friend.  A better friend than me.

<b>                                KAFKA
</b>                      I suspected that he -- well.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      What?

</b>                      That he was -- satisfied in that
                      regard.  I didn't want to pry.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                            (throws her hair
                             back proudly)
                      It's not that we wanted to deceive
                      anyone -- but you know how these
                      things are looked upon at the office.

        Kafka lets out a smile at that.  Gabriela is suspicious of
        smiles.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      What's funny?

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      This morning it was suggested to
                      me that my own sense of office
                      fellowship could bear improving.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      As long as it's on their terms.
                      If your work and your private
                      life don't correspond to their
                      specifications you're labelled a
                      dangerous agitator -- with no
                      recourse whatsoever.

        The gnarled, barren branches of a nearby tree shiver over the
        two of them.

<b>                                  KAFKA

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Two or three months, that's all.
                            (adds)
                      -- I seduced him.

<b>        HIGH TERRACE
</b>
        A flight of stone steps takes them up here to this vantage
        spot overlooking the River and the city beyond.  Kafka stands
        by a railing -- and the huge, distorted shadow of SOMEONE
        looms suddenly on the high wall under him.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      You know as well as I do that he
                      didn't commit suicide.

        Kafka looks at her.

<b>                                 KAFKA
</b>                      No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone
                      is able to bear life with any
                      assurance at all.

<b>                                 GABRIELA
</b>                      Eduard didn't see it as something
                      that needed bearing.

<b>                                 KAFKA
</b>                      The police would know the
                      difference, wouldn't they?

<b>                                 GABRIELA
</b>                      Do you think people in the New
                      Town care what happens over here?
                            (nodding across the
                             water)
                      This will always be the ghetto.

<b>                                 KAFKA
</b>                      He wasn't robbed.  He was

<b>                                 GABRIELA
</b>                      And you believe everything the

<b>                                 GABRIELA
</b>                      The very fact that they're
                      authorities should give you reason.
                      People will do anything to protect
                      their own interests.  For all you
                      know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of
                      the police.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      -- What could he have done to
                      warrant that?

        For a moment she seems about to tell him, but then looks
        away.  Kafka follows her gaze.

<b>        IN THE DISTANCE
</b>
        Someone else has paused at the embankment wall further away
        to stare at the roiling water.  He's too far away to see
        clearly.  Probably nothing sinister about him at all.
        Still ...

<b>        GABRIELA
</b>
        Turns back to Kafka.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Are you free tonight?

        Sit laughing, jowls gyrating, around a table filled with an
        abnormal amount of food.  One of them stops laughing then,
        and the others follow suit, one after the other in turn,
        until they're all silent, looking at the same thing.

        We're in a fancy restaurant, and the other customers have
        also turned away from their dinners for the moment to stare
        at the Man in Black who stands before the Fat Men.

        The man wears a black mask as well.  He presents the Fat Men
        with a covered tray.  They look at it, then back at him --
        but he's walked away.  They look at the tray again -- and one
        of them lifts the cover.  Underneath lies the classic black
        bowling ball -- with a fuse burning at the top.  The Fat Men
        all try to stand up at once but --

        BOOM!  Their booth explodes with them in it.

        At the doorway, holding a revolver loosely in one hand to
        discourage heroes, the Man in Black turns calmly to face the
        stunned restaurant.

<b>        THE OLD TOWN - NIGHT
</b>
        Kafka walks the crooked streets -- in the direction of the
        plume of smoke and illumination coming from the burning
        restaurant.

        In the dark distance behind him there seems to be a person
        following him.

<b>        NOISY BEER SHOP
</b>
        Neighborhood denizens have come out, hearing all the
        excitement not far away.  Kafka walks past.  He looks behind
        him, but the following figure has gone.

<b>        TWISTED LITTLE STREET
</b>
        Kafka comes around a curve -- and sees ahead a dark figure
        a black cape standing waiting under a lone lamppost.  When
        Kafka gets a bit nearer, the figure starts to walk slowly
        away, as if expecting Kafka to follow.

<b>        DIRTY YARD
</b>
        The dark figure walks alongside a row of black window panes,
        turning around the corner where they end.  Kafka follows
        around the corner -- and through a dingy doorway.

<b>        A LOPSIDED STAIRWAY
</b>
        Leads him up to a large attic.  Warning shadows.

<b>        ATTIC
</b>
        Gloomy except for the light around a table at a far end.
        Kafka advances, seeing Gabriela sitting there with her same
        companions from the coffee house.  Kafka stops in front of
        the table.

<b>                                  VOICE FROM BEHIND
</b>                      Please sit down.

        Kafka turns to see the last of the group come in, having
        obviously tailed him all along.  A burly man with a BEARD.
        The leader of this anarchist cell.

        Kafka sits down, in between a SOLEMN man with a moustache and
        a woman with a POCKMARKED face.  The seedy YOUTH who led him
        in completes the circle.

                      And perhaps you recall last month --
                      the explosion at the Municipal
                      Courthouse that sent one of the
                      examining magistrates to join the
                      heavenly choir.

</b>                      The last to join us, the first to
                      leave us.

        Gabriela darts a fierce look at her overly-flippant
        colleague.  And Kafka is sad about his dead friend for a
        different reason.

<b>                                  KAFKA

                      have an opening for a new member.

        After a moment's pause, Kafka stands up.

<b>                                  GABRIELA

</b>                      You strike me as a man with a
                      defined notion of injustice -- a
                      high concern for the lot of your
                      fellow men.  And yet you're able to
                      remain an outsider.  With the
                      concomitant air of ... superiority?

                      we want.  It's what we need.

        Kafka notices that the Bearded Anarchist has a tattoo on the
        back of his hand.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      The distance to my fellow man is
                      for me quite a journey.  As for
                      being an outsider, it's never been
                      a matter of choice.

                      -- They may have instituted proceedings

                      all they need.

        Kafka sits down again.  He tries not to be distracted by the
        Solemn Anarchist who says nothing but who takes an uncommon
        interest in seeing how many matches there are in the matchbox
        he's been fiddling with.

                      Apparently one of his claims was
                      relevant.

                      excited when he brought us the news
                      of this chance invitation. He set off
                      that evening carrying one of our

<b>        MANIACAL LAUGHTER - BEFORE DAWN
</b>
        Seeming to emanate from pitch blackness -- but then suddenly,
        fast, out of a tunnel under a bridge come running three
        terrified VAGRANTS, roused from slumber and scared out
        their wits by the ghastly, crazed CACKLING chasing after
        them, ECHOING under the arches.

        They're at the river's edge, all running wildly, slipping and
        stumbling, every man for himself, as they desperately try to
        escape from whatever madness is closing in behind them.

        Now from out of the tunnel appears their pursuer, seen only
        from the back, literally shaking with insane, involuntary,
        howling LAUGHTER.  A horrific human hyena, far further gone
        than the sad wretches he's cornered here on this foul,
        moss-covered ledge in the cold wind.

        Seeing him, the vagrants freeze in their various positions --
        then turn in panic to flee again as he starts after them,
        moving like an animal, a killer predator, laughing horribly
        as he goes.

        The First Vagrant, propelled by fright, manages to make a
        stunning leap up a wall to grab onto some overhanging chains
        and pull himself up.  The Second Vagrant finds himself
        trapped at the edge of the ledge -- with the Laughing Man
        choosing him as the one to go after first.  He turns and
        jumps into the river.  The Laughing Man, face still unseen,
        turns toward the climbing vagrant instead -- who clambers
        over the top just in time as the Laughing Man's fingernails
        claw the moldy wall beneath him.

        The Third Vagrant has made it to some steps, and down them --
        glancing back to see the Laughing Man coming after him -- to
        the small patch of muddy beach at the bottom, grey river
        water lapping at his ragged shoes.  He doesn't know what to
        do -- he doesn't know how to swim!  The Laughing Man is
        running down the steps now.  The Vagrant starts wading out
        into the water, crying out in fear as the HOWLS behind him
        come closer and closer -- he throws himself forward,
        splashing vainly -- and feels the Laughing Man grabbing his
        ankles, pulling him back.

        The Vagrant's screams join the Laughing Man's insane giggles
        as they thrash around violently in the water.  The Laughing
        Man drags the Vagrant back to the beach, then back up the
        Steps, the Vagrant struggling helplessly, his head banging
        from step to step, his hands flailing around but finding
        nothing to clutch onto, his screaming going unheeded in this
        lonely part of the sleeping city.

        The Laughing Man drags him on, back to the slippery ledge and
        along it, dragging the Vagrant on his back through a filthy
        sewer alongside the wall, the Vagrant's cries choked by the
        stagnant water, but continuing as the Laughing Man drags him
        back into the dark tunnel, under the bridge, the two of them
        disappearing into the blackness again, their combined
        SHRIEKING louder than ever as it ECHOES horribly around the
        damp stone, then dimming as they go deeper and further away,
        unseen, until the screaming and the laughter can no longer be
        distinguished.

<b>        KAFKA'S OFFICE - MORNING
</b>
        Kafka walks toward his desk.  Nearing, he sees the Assistants
        laughing in lunacy between themselves.  They hush up
        immediately when they notice him, and are pretending to work
        when he arrives.  He watches them out of the corner of his
        eye as he arranges himself at his chair.

        Kafka stands up, pleased for them in their innocence.

        The Assistants look at each other, perplexed by this
        attitude.

                      You should be content, you know!

        The stick-like figure of Kafka turns into the long center
        aisle, walking between the endless rows of busy desks.  He
        sidetracks, taking a shortcut along a narrower aisle toward
        the exit he's heading for.  Another clerk is coming the other
        way and they both at the same instant turn sideways to sidle
        efficiently by one another, an almost balletic maneuver,
        perfected after years of office experience, nothing more than
        a short breath of air passing between them.

        Empty.  The chair pushed squarely under it.  The typewriter
        covered.

        Stares at it -- then at the ermine Mr. Burgel who has once
        again popped up out of nowhere.

        Burgel bows sarcastically to hand Kafka an envelope.  Then
        chuckles spitefully, obviously knowing something Kafka does
        not.  He walks off, leaving Kafka uneasy.

        She's stuffed the last of the clothes into a small bag,
        goes to take the few other possessions from shelves and
        elsewhere.

        Kafka notices that he's standing by a dumbwaiter.   For lack
        of anything better to do he pulls the rope to bring it up.
        It's filled with more clothes.  Gabriela comes over with her
        bag, holding it out for him as Kafka puts the clothes in --
        but not as many clothes as they thought.  Behind the bundle,
        hidden at the back, is a briefcase.

        Gabriela recognizes it.  Kafka sees her surprised reaction.
        He removes the case and carefully flips the latches.  Inside,
        a complex mechanism, wires connected to a clock -- and a
        clump of dynamite.

        Kafka just looks at it sadly.  He closes the case.

        The ratty old concierge peeks up the stairs inquisitively.
        In the doorway of his room, a LODGER clips his fingernails at
        a little folding table, neatly lining them up.  The concierge
        turns and notices.

                      to spare me such spectacles!

        slamming that door too.  The hallway is empty now.

                      jealous?  He's too cautious.

        Gabriela clears some more items off a mantelpiece with a
        sweeping gesture.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Of course he is -- the Castle
                      precincts are not the safest part
                      of the city after dark.  People
                      disappear up there regularly.   If
                      you want to lie in wait for someone,

        Putting the bag down, Gabriela goes closer to Kafka, so close
        he almost cowers.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Or what if there really <u>was</u> an

                      any kind that needed correcting --
                      and what if Burgel was responsible
                      for it?  One mistake -- even a small
                      one in a firm like ours -- it could
                      cost him a promotion.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      First these nameless authorities
                      were the root of all evil, now it's
                      insignificant Burgel.  If indeed
                      there was a mistake -- and a minor
                      one at that -- you're suggesting
                      someone went to a lot of trouble
                      over something so trivial as to
                      not matter at all.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      What seems important to these
                      people is not determined by the
                      amount of work it entails -- you're
                      far from understanding the
                      authorities if you believe that.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Now Burgel's one of the authorities?

        She turns away from him, reddening.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      For all his big talk he is.  Does
                      he really have access to the Directors

                      or only the Deputy Managers -- people
                      of no importance whatsoever.  Someone
                      ought to follow <u>him</u> for a change.

        Kafka sees an opportunity to go to her, to try to calm her,
        to make a timid approach to this woman.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      You won't make any sense of it

        -- But she breaks away.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Burgel is only there for one
                      purpose -- to spy on the employees
                      and report any and all indiscretions,
                      real or imagined.  If he didn't
                      send Eduard to the Castle, you can
                      be damn sure he's in league with
                      whoever greeted him there.
                            (very upset now)
                      All those bastards are in league
                      with each other -- why can't you
                      see that!

        She takes hold of him as if to shake some sense into him --
        but really because she needs someone to hold.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      ... I don't see anything.  I see
                      a message on its way to me -- with
                      all the right answers.  Only it
                      never arrives -- it's always just
                      on its way.

        Gabriela doesn't seem to be listening.  She's looking around.
        the little room, as if it's someone else she's holding ...

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Eduard ...

        Her head against his, Kafka tentatively touches her hair
        and she pulls away, the spell broken.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Your ignorance of the way things
                      are here is so appalling that it
                      makes my head spin to listen to
                      you and compare what you say and
                      have in mind with the real situation!

        She storms out, vehemently picking up her bag on the way out,
        and slamming the door quakingly behind her.

        Kafka is too astonished at her behavior to make a move for a
        moment, then he glances at the bomb-case she's left behind,
        then he goes out to the landing.

<b>        GABRIELA
</b>
        Rushing down the stairs in anger, tearing open the door at
        the middle landing and slamming that one too once past it.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Following her down.

<b>        GABRIELA
</b>
        Coming down the final flight of stairs, disappearing through
        the door at the bottom, slamming that one as well.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Almost caught up with her, coming down to the last door.

<b>        GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY
</b>
        Kafka comes through the door from the stairs, out of breath,
        and stops.  He's too late.  The hallway is empty.  The front
        door at the end of it is shut.  He makes a face and a moment
        later starts to go back up.  Then stops again.  Turns.  Looks
        back at the front door.  ... The one he <u>didn't</u> hear slam.

<b>        OUTSIDE
</b>
        The front door opens and Kafka steps out.  He stands on  the
        stoop.  He looks up the street one way.  Deserted.  He looks
        down the street the other way.  Deserted.

<b>        INSIDE - DAY

        Kafka leads the police Inspector back along the lodging house
        hallway.  The two subordinate policemen follow behind.

<b>                                  INSPECTOR
</b>                      You said she was extremely upset.
                      People who are extremely upset --
                      Kafka -- are given to disappearing
                      in a hurry.  They go and calm down
                      for a day or so and then they come
                      back.

        They've come to the door to the stairs now.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      But that's just my point -- she was
                      more than upset, she was livid.
                      She slammed every door on her way
                      downstairs -- except that one.
                            (points at front door)
                      I was just behind her and I didn't
                      even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at
                      all.

                      hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't
                      they have shut the door as quietly
                      as possible?

        The Inspector stares at him.  The two other policemen roll
        their eyes at each other.

<b>        EDUARD'S ROOM
</b>
        Kafka keeps his eye on the two policemen as they poke around,
        one of them getting close to the dumbwaiter.

<b>                                  INSPECTOR
</b>                      Why would someone want to kidnap
                      this woman -- the name is Rossmann?

        He says it rather derisively, separating the syllables of the
        name.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      You told me to contact you if
                      anything relevant came up --
                      Gabriela is relevant.  When I
                      spoke to you before I didn't know
                      she'd been seeing Eduard.

<b>                                  INSPECTOR
</b>                      That's been noted.  But where
                      does it lead us?  Unless you have
                      something more to add.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      She's missing.  I went to her house
                      and she hadn't returned there.

        The policeman at the dumbwaiter peers down the shaft -- but
        then moves on.

<b>                                  INSPECTOR
</b>                      She lost her job today.  Just
                      between you and me, I'd probably
                      go away and brood a bit myself.

        He signals his men, time for them to go.

<b>        STAIRWAY
</b>
        The two Policemen lead the way back down, the Inspector
        behind them, Kafka remaining on the top landing.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                            (manages to blurt out)
                      Maybe it's true then what she said.

</b>                            (pauses)
                      What did she say?

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      That the police may have allegiance
                      to something other than truth.

        The two other policemen look at each other ominously.  The
        Inspector turns to them, giving them a look, and they go off
        down the stairs.  The Inspector plods back up to Kafka Like a
        stern parent.

        They confront each other, Kafka trying not to cringe too
        baldly.  Scary shadows around the bizarrely-angled stairway.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      -- She didn't think Eduard

                      Any more than I do.
                            (then)
                      She was convinced of it.

        Pause.

</b>                      I'm going to say something, and
                      I hope it's quite clear because
                      I won't be repeating it.

        People treat Kafka like a child.  And other people seem big
        to him anyway.  The Inspector leans his face very close.

<b>                                  INSPECTOR

                      We're drawn towards them.  The

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      I haven't got the energy.  I
                      mean, I have to conserve my energy.

<b>                                  BIZZLEBEK
</b>                      Why do you work in that hideous
                      insurance office?  -- dealing with
                      people who fall off ladders.  Now
                      take me -- I make my living as a
                      stone mason.  It's not my art --
                      but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You
                      could be -- a journalist.

        Kafka shakes his head sadly.  He's obviously heard
        argument before.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      That would be even worse -- it would
                      be a compromise.

<b>                                  BIZZLEBEK
</b>                      Success or nothing?

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      No -- not even success.  My writing
                      is not for making a living -- it's
                      for living.  Not for other people,
                      it's for me.

        He stares at a woman who reminds him slightly of Gabriela --
        a sexy woman and the man with her treating her as a sexy
        woman.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      ... I'm the exile.  Gabriela was
                      right about that too.

        Being chased around a table by a big bearded man in
        flickering black-and-white.

<b>        AN AUDIENCE
</b>
        Watching, laughing.  A great sea of grinning teeth and teary
        eyes.

        Except one.  Kafka sits grimly alone near the back.  But
        suddenly he's not alone -- the Bearded Anarchist has sat down
        in front of him -- and now turns round, startlingly.

</b>                      We may have attached too little
                      importance to the reason Eduard
                      was summoned to the Castle to begin
                      with.

        And the Youthful Anarchist is behind him, thrusting his head
        suddenly forward.

        The Solemn Anarchist is on Kafka's other side -- but he just
        watches the movie.

                      discrepancy?

</b>                      Perhaps Eduard was closer than he
                      knew to discovering it and so had to
                      be silenced.

</b>                      -- Oh, yes, it's mad.

        The Solemn Anarchist suddenly laughs -- probably at Charlie
        Chaplin.

                      big, Eduard's responsibility would
                      still have to be small.  No poor

        Kafka follows the KEEPER OF THE FILES along labyrinthine
        alleys between shelves packed with files.  Walls are obscured
        by columns of documents tied together, piled on top of each
        other.  There's Hardly room to move.  Stacks of files are
        everywhere, balancing precariously, even falling from time to
        time, from sheer Pressure in all directions.

        They turn down another row, walking further, turning again.
        Kafka keeps flinching as thick bundles of documents CRASH
        down around him, narrowly missing him.

        Looks up from his desk and sticks his chin out, which is his
        way of asking Kafka what the hell he wants.  Kafka dares to
        come in.

                      to them.

        The Chief Clerk has little time for such sentimentality.  He
        gives Kafka a little exasperated look before reaching down to
        -- a right hand desk drawer -- which Kafka notices -- and
        taking out a folder.

        Kafka reluctantly turns.

<b>                                  CHIEF CLERK
</b>                      You're too sensitive.  Let your

                             paperwork)
                      I've known suicides.  Such a song-
                      and-dance about nothing.

        Kafka nods once.

</b>                      Yes, sir.

        The Chief Clerk looks at him with seemingly genuine misguided
        concern.

</b>                      Give it up.

        He goes back to his paperwork.  Kafka leaves.

<b>        OUTSIDE CHIEF CLERK'S OFFICE

        Kafka shuts the door behind him, breathes a sigh of relief.

        Looking very annoyed, leading Kafka back through the stacks.

                      Without a proper request I'm not

                      this one occasion.

<b>        ANOTHER ROW
</b>
        Kafka glances nervously around as shelves CREAK threateningly
        under the weight of documents.  Up on a ladder, the Keeper of
        the Files finds the Orlac folder.

<b>                                  KEEPER
</b>                      At least the account is current
                      even if the employee isn't.

        He pulls it out -- with great difficulty.  The Orlac file is
        very, very thick.  Kafka prepares himself to catch it, but
        the Keeper of the Files manages to hand it down to him
        without serious injury.  Still, it's quite cumbersome and
        heavier than Kafka expects.

                      seem to have any trouble propagating

<b>        THE OFFICE - EVENING
</b>
        Kafka works at his desk, finger tapping at an adding machine.
        He checks the office clock -- nearly the end of the day.

<b>        THE ASSISTANTS
</b>
        One is sweeping the floor.  The other is scribbling at their
        desk.  His pen blotches his paper.  He has a fit and crumples
        it up and throws it down.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Looks over at the Chief Clerk's office -- sees him writing
        intently at his desk, pausing to turn on a lamp.

<b>        THE ASSISTANTS
</b>
        The sweeping one bangs his knee against a desk and starts
        hopping about.  The pen of the other one leaks again.  He
        crumples up his new sheet and flings it away even more
        angrily than before.  Then he examines his pen, determines
        that the cap at the back is loose, and starts banging it on
        his desk in an attempt to tighten it -- while the other
        assistant keeps jumping around holding his hurt kneecap.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Glances over his shoulder at them, starts to say something --
        but then notices Burgel, not far away, sometimes blocked by
        other employees, walking in the direction of the Chief
        Clerk's office.

<b>        THE ASSISTANTS
</b>
        The one assistant has just fixed his pen when the other one,
        still hopping around, bumps into him, causing him to knock
        over a bottle of ink.  The two of them start shoving each
        other about.

        Kafka whirls around, can't ignore them any longer.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Do you mind!

        The Assistants look at him, surprised at this outburst.

<b>                                  OSKAR
</b>                      -- I was just trying to finish

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      You mean you've actually begun
                      some?

<b>                                  LUDWIG
</b>                            (pointing at Oskar)
                      -- Just because he's done nothing
                      today, he doesn't want me to show
                      him up!

        Oskar tries to lunge at Ludwig, but Kafka holds him back.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      My assistants!  You might as well
                      have fallen from the sky for all
                      the thought that was spent in
                      choosing you!

        The Assistants look at each other sheepishly.  Then smile at
        Kafka, submissively or mockingly, it's hard to tell.

<b>                                  OSKAR
</b>                      It's not our fault.  We're
                      naturally nervous.

<b>                                  KAFKA

</b>                      We've been together too long.  His
                      personality is overflowing into
                      mine and vice versa.

<b>                                  OSKAR
</b>                      -- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a
                      horrible situation like that?

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        He wouldn't.  It's the nightmare of his life.
        But now he's distracted again -- noticing Burgel walking away
        from the Chief Clerk's office (without ever having seem him
        actually enter it).  And Burgel is carrying a parcel under
        his arm.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                            (to Assistants again)
                      All right, you might as well go
                      home -- go on.

        The Assistants do as they're told, Oskar returning to his
        desk to clear up, turning his back on Ludwig -- at which
        Ludwig  immediately rushes up very close behind him and shakes
        his fist strenuously at him, turning away quickly when Oskar
        turns around again to try and catch Ludwig at it.

        Kafka isn't paying them any attention anymore.  He
        efficiently cleans up his own space, keeping an eye on the
        Chief Clerk's office.

        When the office bell RINGS the Chief Clerk immediately turns
        off his desk lamp, puts on his overcoat, and shuts his office
        light on his way out.

        Kafka doesn't think twice.  He forces himself to start
        walking to the Chief Clerk's office.  Other departing office
        employees crisscross past him, but he walks in a straight
        line, businesslike, toward the Chief Clerk's office.  He has
        a piece of paper in his hand.  He enters the Chief Clerk's
        office, holds the paper out to drop on the Chief Clerk's desk
        -- but lets it slip off onto the floor.  When he bends to
        retrieve it he quickly opens that bottom drawer where
        Eduard's file was -- but it's now empty.

        Pauses in some shadows.  He glances up at the distance, the
        way Burgel is going, up at --

<b>        THE CASTLE
</b>
        Almost glowing as it's outlined against the blue of the
        darkening night.

        Giving Kafka the eye as he goes past doorway after doorway
        filled with their frightening/tempting forms.  But he tries
        never to lose focus on the small form of Burgel further up
        the street.

        Men milling about, up and down the street, prostitutes
        roaming amongst them, Kafka negotiating his way through.  An
        urgent moment when he almost loses Burgel -- then sees him
        turning down an alley.  Kafka hurries after him, avoiding a
        pair of drunken louts in the way.

<b>        FURTHER ON
</b>
        The Castle visible, but still a little in the distance.
        Kafka comes into view.  He sees Burgel entering a building.

        Peeking around the corner, he sees a YOUNG GIRL embracing
        Burgel in her doorway before letting him in.

</b>
        Kafka comes out of the building.  He hears a noise, turns
        around, sees Burgel and the girl on the tiny baroque balcony
        outside her room.  Kafka retreats into the shadows.  He
        watches the girl unwrap the <u>parcel</u> Burgel's given her.  She
        smiles as a box of chocolates is revealed.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Watches -- with an expression of guilt, sadness?
        Until a door suddenly opens at his back.  A MAN shuffles out
        past him.  A rather ugly WOMAN in a dressing gown holds the
        door open, giving Kafka a cursory look.  Beyond her inside, a
        quick glimpse of MASOCHIST yelping as he's whipped.

</b>                      Well, what're you waiting for?

        She's nodding him inside.  Kafka backs away from her and her
        invitation.

<b>        DIRTY YARD - NIGHT
</b>
        Kafka heads for the dilapidated building or the anarchists.

<b>        DINGY DOORWAY
</b>
        He goes through.  A MOUSE scurries past him across the
        threshold.

<b>        THE LOPSIDED STAIRWAY
</b>
        Leads him up to the attic.

<b>        THE BEARDED ANARCHIST
</b>
        Watches Kafka's approach.  But sees nothing.  His eyes are
        wide open, but lifeless.

        Kafka stops at the anarchists' table.  They're all lying
        around it on the floor except for the Pockmarked Anarchist
        who's slumped over it, her face sunk in a pool of her own
        blood.

        The Youthful Anarchist lies on his back, mouth open, still
        dribbling red.  The Solemn Anarchist seems less than solemn
        due to the almost comic, convoluted, broken-backed position
        he's in.  And the neck of the Bearded Anarchist is all
        twisted.

        Kafka just stares in disbelief -- then SCRATCH! -- a noise
        from a spiral staircase close by, leading to the roof.  Kafka
        looks around in panic -- the attic entrance is too far to run
        to and there's nowhere else to hide.

<b>        THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE
</b>
        A man appears from above (MR. PICK).  Legs draped in
        expensive trousers, the skirt of his high-buttoned coat
        flowing around them due to the breeze from the roof.

<b>                                  MR. PICK'S VOICE
</b>                      -- Come on -- there's no one up
                      there.  We're going now.

        He raises his arm up to help down whoever it is he's talking
        to.  We hear a strange GROAN.  Followed by the appearance --
        unclear, from the back, face hidden, or otherwise blocked by
        Mr. Pick -- of A STRANGE hunched figure.  He moves in a
        halting, cowering way.  Mr. Pick helps him down the steps.

<b>                                  MR. PICK
</b>                      That's it -- it's all right --
                      you've done very well.

        Mr. Pick's voice is reassuring, though he has a dark,
        diabolic face.  They're at the bottom of the staircase now,
        Mr. Pick leading his odd companion toward the exit.  The odd
        companion lurches towards the dead anarchists, but Mr. Pick
        restrains him.

<b>                                  MR. PICK
</b>                      Never mind them -- they'll be
                      attended to.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Pretending to be one of the dead anarchists.  Hiding under
        the large body of the Bearded Anarchist.  Trying hard to
        emulate his lack of movement.  Blood from the Bearded
        Anarchist's ear drips onto Kafka's face.  He tries to blink
        it away while his other eye remains fixed on the two figures
        walking away to the doorway until they're through it and
        gone.

        After a moment, he unloads the Bearded Anarchist and softly
        hurries over to the attic doorway.

<b>        STAIRS
</b>
        The Strange Man utters another low moan as Mr. Pick leads him
        like a dog down the creaking old steps.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Comes cautiously out onto the landing.  He leans over the
        bannister, watching the two figures slowly going down the
        long stairs, vanishing from sight at a certain turn of the
        staircase on every floor and coming into view after a moment
        or so.

        Follows at a respectable distance.  He pauses when he hears a
        WAGON -- looking back at the anarchists' building to see it
        pulling up outside.  The DRIVER jumps to the ground.

        Kafka looks from the wagon to the two men walking away in the
        distance and makes his choice -- continuing after the two
        men.

<b>        THE QUARRIES - NIGHT
</b>
        On the outskirts of the city, beyond the Castle.

        Mr. Pick and the Strange Man approach.  Some distance behind
        them, Kafka takes cover behind a tree, watching.

        Mr. Pick leads the Strange Man down the central quarry to
        where a third man, a LABORER by the look of him, is waiting.

        Kafka finds a vantage point somewhere above the central
        quarry.  He flattens himself on the ground and peers over the
        edge.

        In the quarry, Mr. Pick steps back a pace from the Strange
        Man as they meet up with the Laborer and suddenly grabs the
        Strange Man, pinning his arms behind him, baring his chest
        or the Laborer to stab a dagger into!

        Kafka is shocked by the abruptness of this.  He sees the
        Strange Man slump to the ground.  He crawls a little closer.
        He sees the Laborer replace the knife in its sheath on his
        belt, then help Mr. Pick drag the Strange Man off to some
        side shadows where they dump him.

        Kafka strains forward a little, trying to make out their
        faces -- and the ground gives way!

<b>        MR. PICK AND THE LABORER
</b>
        Spin around at the noise.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Lands at the bottom of the incline, dazed.  He's still quite
        far away from the other end of the quarry where they are.

<b>        MR. PICK AND THE LABORER
</b>
        Look at each other once -- then go after the intruder.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Sees them coming.  Scrambles to his feet.  It takes him a
        split second to establish his options.  Namely, the best
        route is back up the way he came.  If only he can get up it
        again as fast.

        Mr. Pick and the Laborer start to run.

        Kafka starts to climb.  The incline is steep.  The gravel is
        loose.  He slips back down.

        Mr. Pick and the Laborer are gaining speed.

        Kafka digs his fingers into the dirt, pulling himself up with
        all his might, even though his shoes don't sustain holds.

        Mr. Pick is a better runner than the burly Laborer.  He's
        almost there.

        Kafka slips back down again.  Mr. Pick could almost grab him
        -- but Kafka literally throws himself up the slope again,
        gasping -- and Mr. Pick stretches but can't reach that far
        and Kafka's nearly at the top again -- Mr. Pick climbing
        after him now -- and Kafka's arm comes over the edge, he
        struggles over, kicking gravel back down in Mr. Pick's face.
        Mr. Pick slides back down to the bottom -- and Kafka's gone.

        The Laborer fell over Mr. Pick as he came crashing back down,
        now Mr. Pick pushes him off in one direction while he goes
        another.

<b>        SLOPING STREET

        Escaping back into the Old Quarter, Kafka runs downhill.  But
        even the momentum doesn't carry him as fast as he'd like.

<b>        SMALL SQUARE
</b>
        A number of streets branching off.  Kafka sees Mr. Pick
        coming down one of them -- and the Laborer coming down
        another.  Kafka runs off along a third.

<b>        CIRCUITOUS PASSAGE
</b>
        Kafka runs.  Looks behind him.  Mr. Pick is coming.  He runs
        faster, under a weird archway.  Looks behind him.  Mr. Pick
        and the Laborer are coming.  Kafka darts down a side street.

<b>        SIDE STREET
</b>
        Another twisting little road.  He winds around one corner
        only to be met by another, the end of this street impossible
        to determine.

<b>        BEHIND HIM
</b>
        Mr. Pick and the Laborer are catching up.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Turns another corner and finds himself at the bottom of an
        incredibly long flight of steps.  A staired street.  On and
        on and on.  He doesn't know if he can make it.

<b>        MR. PICK AND THE LABORER
</b>
        Come around -- look at the steps -- look at each other.  They
        take deep breaths and start up.

<b>        THE TOP
</b>
        Here they come, huffing and puffing.

<b>        THE BOTTOM
</b>
        Kafka comes out from behind an extravagantly designed iron
        gate grillwork.  He sneaks away, back the way he came.

        The body of the Strange Man lies face down where it was
        dropped.

        Kafka walks toward it, looking around nervously in case
        anyone's coming.  Someone is.  When he gets to the corpse he
        hears the sound of an approaching WAGON.  He crouches quickly
        by the body to do what he's come here to do -- turn it over
        to look at --

<b>        THE FACE
</b>
        Of a monster.  Horribly disfigured, scarred and stitched.
        And it isn't the kind of patchwork mess caused by acid or
        accident.  There seems to be <u>design</u> behind it.  Human
        design.  And beneath all this warped, mutilated flesh, almost
        unrecognizable ... the features of the vagrant snatched from
        the River.

<b>        KAFKA'S FACE

        Revulsion.  He goes.

<b>        THE WAGON
</b>
        Parks above the quarry.  The evil-looking Driver jumps down
        and pulls a large sack off the back.  He starts down into the
        quarry.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Appears over another edge.  He looks over at the wagon.  He
        sees that now the back is loaded up, and covered by a sheet
        of tarpaulin.

                      why he didn't simply return it.  If
                      it's too small for him why do you

        The BARKING of a DOG outside distracts him.  He stands up to
        stretch by his open window -- and we SEE that he's wearing a
        suit that's far too big for him, sleeves overhanging his
        skinny arms and  ands, trouser bottoms drowning his shoes.
        He looks out at the sky which is turning blue.

        Two men walk across the river.

        Rolls along one of the moribund streets of the Old Town.  The

        suggests Evil.

        Kafka puts a stamp on his letter, then adds it to the <u>stack</u>

<b>        THE OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
        Dead silence after the daily racket of typewriters and
        telephones and adding machines.  Kafka works alone in the
        utterly deserted office building.

        He looks out the window and sees a POLICEMAN walking by on
        the street below.  He thinks again about going to the law --
        but goes back to work.

        He hears a SOUND.  He looks around.  A sort of a SCRATCHING
        sound.  It's coming from the other end of the office
        somewhere.  Maybe the bathroom.

        Kafka walks slowly back there.  At the bathroom door he
        pauses momentarily, then turns the handle to go inside.

<b>        BATHROOM
</b>
        SCRATCH, SCRATCH.  Kafka looks for the source of the sound --
        and in sudden startled shock instantly finds it -- where a
        <u>huge arm</u> has just been thrust through a small, high window --
        and the ugly hand at the end of the arm is feeling around for
        the window-latch.

        Kafka starts backing away -- as the hand flips open the latch
        -- and now the window, swinging open with a bang, and the
        rest of the intruder starts coming into view -- out before
        all of him appears Kafka has run out and slammed the door
        behind him.
<b>         
</b><b>        OFFICE

        Kafka pulls a desk across the bathroom doorway.

<b>        BATHROOM

        The MANIAC -- because that's what his posture and breathing,
        seen from the back, suggest -- lurches into the bathroom from
        the window.

<b>        OFFICE
</b>
        Kafka grabs his coat -- and an umbrella off a rack.  He looks
        back at the bathroom -- the desk rocking back and forth as
        the intruder behind the door pushes.  Kafka runs away.

<b>        HALLWAY
</b>
        He runs to the elevator, sliding open the gate.

<b>        OFFICE
</b>
        CRASH!  The desk tips over as the bathroom door is forced
        open.

<b>        ELEVATOR
</b>
        Kafka descending.  The elevator cranking slowly downwards.
        Then, nearing the ground floor, it slows down even further.
        Then it suddenly stops dead.  Kafka reaches for the walls to
        steady himself.  He looks through the gate, assessing the
        distance to the ground floor below.  He tries the gate but it
        won't open.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                            (calls down there)
                      -- Help!  HELP!

        He looks around the tiny space of the elevator.  The roof
        hatch.  He reaches up, pushes it open, starts to climb up --
        and YAAHH! -- the Maniac's face appears in the opening!  It's
        another <u>monster</u> face -- this one even worse than the one
        Kafka uncovered at the quarries.  A groaning, drooling,
        misshapen lump of wrinkled tissue.  And its owner's arms now
        come through to stretch after Kafka.

        Kafka beats them back with the umbrella while still trying to
        pull the unyielding gate open.  The Maniac yelps as Kafka
        bashes the umbrella up at him, dodging his head out of the
        way each time the umbrella sweeps back at him, swinging his
        thick arms wildly to ward off blows and try and snatch the
        umbrella for himself.  He finally retreats under the barrage
        of blows and Kafka quickly takes the opportunity to lever
        open the gate with the umbrella.

        The Maniac's face reappears overhead.  Kafka stabs the
        umbrella up at him some more -- and the Maniac manages to
        grab it.  Kafka sits down on the elevator edge to jump down
        to the ground floor and --

<b>        THE MANIAC
</b>
        Lunges forward from above, scooping both arms down in a vain
        attempt to catch Kafka just as he drops out of sight --
        landing on the ground floor with a roll.

        The Maniac HOWLS at his failure, his features even more
        horribly contorted, Practically filling the small opening of
        the roof hatch as he SHRIEKS.  And as his atrocious face
        comes CLOSER and CLOSER and CLOSER -- one of his eyeballs
        falls out! -- POP! -- out of the socket suddenly -- dangling
        into the elevator, hanging by a single sinewy bloody thread.
        The Maniac cries out and reaches for the eyeball, bringing it
        back up to try and stuff back in place ...

<b>        STREET OUTSIDE

        Kafka runs away from the office building, in horror, off into

        He stands at a corner, looking at his own house, scared even

<b>        CEMETERY - NIGHT
</b>
        Ancient tombstones crumbling with age, slanting out of the
        ground at bizarre angles, and cluttered so close together
        that a way can scarcely be made between them.

        Bizzlebek leads Kafka along the crooked little pathways,
        overgrown with crawling weeds, upwards towards the high
        section of the cemetery under the dark wall of the Castle.

        Bizzlebek, who knows his way around, seems more cheerful here
        than we've seen him before.  Kafka more fearful.  Wind
        WHISTLES.  Leaves RUSTLE.  CREAKING trees cast ghastly
        shadows.  Scary tombs, all shapes and sizes, strange symbolic
        symbols on them, mystical figures and designs.

        Trying to keep up with Bizzlebek, Kafka spots a horrendous
        shape looming ahead of him.  He starts to bypass it -- and
        <u>jumps</u> when a tall plant brushes against him.

                      going through official channels?

        The awful dark shape turns out to be no more than a
        particularly large tombstone, crumbled in places to give it
        an animal-like suggestion.

        They're at the graves at the very back of the cemetery, right
        up against the bottom of the Castle wall that stretches high
        above them into the black sky of night.

        Trees quiver around them.  Shadows dance.  Bizzlebek pauses
        at a particular grave, apart from the others, more hidden by
        overgrowth.  He runs his fingertips over the old, strangely
        lettered inscription.  He looks around the graveyard, making
        sure they're alone, then he moves to one side of the stone
        and leans his weight against it, pushing.  It shifts and

<b>        SECRET PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

        A stooping Kafka makes his way along this gloomy underground
        artery, the lantern lighting the way.

        He comes to the end of it and what appears to be a little
        door.  He bends low to listen at it -- then unlocks the
        latch.  He pushes -- and the door moves forward.

        Kafka stands up -- and he's <u>inside a big filing cabinet</u>

        He steps out of it and looks around.  He's in an entire room
        full of file cabinet drawers.  A morgue of file cabinet
        drawers.  He shuts the one he came out of before walking
        away.  "D-7" says the label on the outside of it.

        Kafka makes his way through the shadows down here in the

        giant furnace.

        A sudden door SLAM.  Kafka dodges back around a corner.  He
        HEARS:  the quick cry of a man's agony, a scuffle of shoes on
        hard stone floor, a dull thud, a wave of peculiar shouts,
        running footsteps, more mumbled mingled voices -- which soon
        die out, leaving silence.

<b>        AROUND THE CORNER

        Kafka walks slowly, straining his neck a bit in expectation
        of whatever lies ahead.

        The passage brings him to a row of dungeon cells.  A line of
        doors with a barred window in each.  One of them isn't closed
        -- and lying across the threshold is the Laborer who chased
        Kafka from the quarries the other night.  The knife is gone
        from his sheath and his scull is caved in, a wooden stool
        lying on the floor beside him.  At the other end of the row
        of cells another door swings open at the top of a few steps.

        SUDDENLY fingers spear through the bars of another cell to
        touch Kafka!  A GAUNT MAN inside.

<b>                                  GAUNT MAN
</b>                      You've killed him!  Like a dog!

        Kafka dropped his lantern in surprise, and shrinks back,
        CRUNCHING glass.

<b>                                  GAUNT MAN

        The inhabitants of the other cells start RATTLING their bars
        and beseeching Kafka.  He looks around, bewildered and
        horrified.  Hideous faces looking back at him.

<b>                                  GAUNT MAN
</b>                      You'll incriminate the rest of us!
                      Let me out too!

        Shuddering, Kafka is moving away, making it through the
        shocking gauntlet, toward the door at the other end.

                      You've thrown yourself in it now!

        A HAGGARD MAN who may have had his tongue cut out gestures
        desperately at a lever on the wall to unlock the cells.
        Kafka starts to tentatively reach for it -- when there's a
        sudden SHRIEK beside him.  He whirls to see, behind more
        bars, the raving, convoluted face of the creature that
        stalked him at his office (whose loose eye has now gone
        completely) -- BANGING violently against his door.

<b>                                  GAUNT MAN

                      together!

        But now the evil Mr. Pick appears at the end of the passage
        from which Kafka came -- a gun in his hand.

        Kafka yanks the lever and runs away.  Mr. Pick FIRES after
        him, starting to chase -- but the prisoners are coming out of
        their cells -- coming for him.

<b>        ANOTHER FLOOR

        Here is a part of the Castle Kafka can understand -- office
        workers toiling away.  Kafka walks past one long row of them,
        SCRIBES sitting at a single <u>endless</u> desk.  They look like
        students under examination, hunched over their writing, a
        virtual conveyor belt of paperwork.

        In the center of this floor is an <u>actual</u> conveyor -- a chain
        pulley running slowly up and down, presumably throughout the
        entire Castle, through small holes in the floor and ceiling.
        There are little pockets on the chain which the clerks
        continually pluck papers out of and slip papers into.

        The ink bottle of one of the scribes runs dry.  He takes it
        over to a sink with three taps -- Hot, Cold -- and the third
        one he turns -- <u>Ink</u>.

        Mr. Pick leans against a door, trying to keep back the
        howling horde of prisoners pushing from the other side.
        Another JAILER joins him, helping him to try and push the
        door closed.  Then a SECOND JAILER too.  A <u>bestial hand</u>
        reaches through and Mr. Pick presses his pistol muzzle into
        the outstretched palm --

<b>        BANG!
</b>
        -- A book falls to the floor like a pistol-shot -- and
        Kafka hides back in shadows hoping no one heard.  He's in a
        round --

<b>        LIBRARY
</b>
        -- Surrounded by books from floor to ceiling, even on the
        tall door through which he entered.  A sliver of light gives
        it away -- and on the other side of it he hears FOOTSTEPS.
        But they pass by.

        There's another sliver of light indicating another door in
        the books opposite him.  He walks over and pulls on the
        shelves.  Here the dark wood is merely a disguising cover for
        the shiny modern steel he discovers on the other side of it
        And he finds more than that as he enters --

<b>        THE LABORATORY
</b>
        A real mad scientist's workshop.  Chemicals of bizarre colors
        rush and FIZZ through mazes of glass pipes and beakers, in
        some places boiling and steaming, in others frosting or
        freezing.  Circuits and test tubes flash and glow as sparks
        and filamentary arcs CRACKLE with electric incandescence.
        insane instruments and devices, interconnected with complex
        wires, perform strange and villainous functions.  It's the
        most modern setting we've yet seen -- but at the same time
        all this futuristic technology seems somehow archaic, as if
        put together from old, familiar materials and elements, both
        eccentric and eclectic.

        The chain that runs through the floors of the Castle carrying
        documents runs up and down through the laboratory too.

        Amidst this feast for the eyes, what Kafka now focuses in on
        a simple cigarette -- left smoking in an ashtray.  And by
        the look of the ash, not very long ago.  Kafka looks around
        anxiously -- notices an archway leading to another room.

        Kafka comes into what looks like a small museum -- vertical
        glass cases in which naked BODIES float suspended in
        preserving gelatin solution.

        Kafka seems deadened himself by all that he's seeing -- until
        he sees someone he recognizes.  The Bearded Anarchist.  Kafka
        goes closer.  Looking down, he sees that the Bearded
        Anarchist has a hand missing.  The other anarchists are here
        in glass cases too.  Now with a gasp Kafka turns around --
        looking for Gabriela -- but she's not here.

<b>        MAIN LAB
</b>
        Holding himself together, and with new determination etched
        on his face, Kafka walks to the center of the lab -- and an
        operating table.  Ignoring the implications of the table, he
        sets down the bomb-briefcase -- flicking the latches to open
        it.

        The sight of the explosive mechanism inside causes him a
        moment's hesitation, but a look round at various animal parts
        hanging from hooks above the table or bobbing in jars
        alongside sinister implements laid out in preparation for an
        operation renews his anger -- and he decisively turns the
        dial on the bomb's timer-clock, setting it to the maximum
        allowance of one hour.

        He closes the case and locks its latches.  The case begins to
<b>        TICK.
</b>
        Kafka takes it to a dark spot beneath the mass of elaborate
        laboratory equipment, hides it under there, and leaves.

        Just as he reaches the light something <u>lunges</u> at him from one

        SEEN for the first time, SCREECHING, salivating, eyes
        watering.  The human hyena.  His grin contorts his face from
        ear to ear, his CACKLING is truly terrifying, and the hand he
        stretches forward has a <u>tattoo</u> on it (Bearded Anarchist's
        hand) -- a hand too big for his wrist -- reaching, reaching,
        reaching for Kafka.

        Someone else is sitting in darkness behind a huge desk
        (MURNAU).  His hand holds out a small vial.  The Laughing Man
        grabs it and leaves, gulping down its contents voraciously.

        The door behind Kafka opens again and an officious bureaucrat
        (EKMAN) comes in.  He sits in a chair and looks at Kafka.

                      -- Not something we encourage, mind

        He's coming around the desk.  He's drying his hands on a
        towel.

        "manhole" cover through which the chain passes.

        They pass another of those grinding chains carrying memos and

                      In fact, he didn't die at all.
                      He was simply recalled -- by

        The Laughing Man giggles crazily.

        The Laughing Man, subdued for a moment, merely smiles a
        little, opening the door to let Kafka in first, guarding him
        close.  Dr. Murnau then leads the way across to his
        laboratory door.

        He pushes the tall door open into his lab.

        Murnau spreads his hands proudly as they enter, displaying
        his amazing factory.

                      it, that is.  You might say I'm
                      a student of human reaction.

        Ekman, who's seen it all before, goes to lean somewhere,
        bored.

                      too, you know -- but a much
                      more pragmatic one.

        As if in response to that the Laughing Man convulses anew.
        Ekman immediately turns to a shelf for another vial and goes
        to give it to the Laughing Man.

<b>                                  MURNAU

                      our most valuable acquisition.

        The Laughing Man gulps down the potion and starts to calm
        down a little.

        minutes away from blast-off.

        Murnau walks to where the elaborate distillation processes
        are going on.  The very section where Kafka hid the bomb.
        Kafka wipes his brow, quickly, conscious of Ekman staring at
        him.  Murnau gazes obsessively at his contraptions, his
        piercing eyes following the routes of the flowing chemicals.

        He's concocting another potion now, pouring an acidic-looking
        liquid from one container to another.  Kafka is looking
        increasingly worried.

        mixing his cocktail, he picks up some sort of suturing tool,
        pressing the trigger on it to start the end burning and

                      start instead at the very
                      inception -- with the embryo --

                      man-made man.  You appreciate
                      that, I know.

        Ekman takes Kafka by the arm to lead him toward the operating
        table.  The Laughing Man moves in closer too, emitting a
        psychotic chortle.

                      being born here.  A more resilient
                      man ... A superman.

        Kafka attempts an escape around the operating table, but the
        Laughing Man blocks his way and corrals him back to where he
        was before.  Dr. Murnau holds out the sinister aperitif for
        Kafka to take and drink in toast.

                      and monsters.

        The glass comes closer and closer to Kafka's lips -- if he
        leans away from it any further he'll be lying on the
        operating table -- but now a WRENCHING noise makes everybody
        turn.

        The body of Mr. Pick, bloody and ragged, is dragged up with a
        SMASH through a breaking floor-panel by the great chain.

        Kafka has his chance.  The next time anyone looks at him he's
        holding the nozzle of the burning device under Ekman's
        throat, finger on the trigger.

        -- And on the other side of the laboratory a wide elevator
        platform rises into view -- carrying the prisoners from the
        dungeons!

        Throws Ekman aside and runs away.

        Falls to the floor, holding his hands up over his head with a
        SCREAM as the ghastly creatures from the depths converge on
        him -- but they pass him by -- intent on getting Murnau.

        The last out of the elevator is the most horrible BEAST-MAN
        yet -- and we finally see the use to which various
        animal-parts have been put.

        Just stands by the operating table, waiting for them.  He
        knows there's no way out and he's far too practical a man to
        waste energy running or screaming.

        One by one, the prisoners file past the intricate surgical
        tools neatly laid out on white cloth.  Each prisoner selects
        the implement of his choice.

        Ekman, too, runs away out of the laboratory.

        in his panic to escape -- out onto a metal walkway around a
        central area of offices.

        Murnau can't be seen, only the deranged men huddled closely
        around the operating table.

        Abruptly stops ticking.

        The floors SHUDDER as the BOOM in the laboratory is heard and
        felt.  The metal walkway breaks and Ekman goes sliding off it
        -- while Kafka manages to hang on.  He ducks his face down as
        glass from all the surrounding office windows SHATTERS and
        SHOWERS -- and then paper starts sailing down all around.
        Literally a hailstorm of documents.

        On the floor below where he fell, Ekman tries to stand, but
        the falling flurry of paper keeps him at bay.  He waves his
        hands wildly trying to see his way through it all, but it's
        too much.  Now his feet are trapped in it.  It's starting to
        rise around his legs.  Papers are fluttering down from floors
        and floors of surrounding offices above, filling the air.

        Ekman suffocates and drowns and disappears in the paper
        piling up around him -- one lone arm and hand the last we see
        of him.

        Kafka is managing to climb back onto the unsafe metal walkway
        -- when ZING! -- a bullet ricochets near him.

        The Assistants!  They've nearly fallen through another
        doorway where the walkway on that side broke, but got each
        other stuck in the door just in time.  One of them is wildly
        FIRING a revolver in Kafka's direction.  The other tries to
        grab it and both FIRE it together in all directions.

        Kafka runs away, avoiding a snake of broken wire, flipping
        about, SPARKING off the metal.

        The Assistants, shoving each other, extricate themselves back
        through their doorway to find another way to chase Kafka.

        The burst ink pipes drip empty.  The sound of maniacal
        LAUGHTER abruptly stops.  The ink has filled the lab halfway

        A last bubble pops, leaving a lake of ink with a surface
        smooth as glass.

        they've forgotten all about looking for Kafka.

        On the Old Town side of the River.  Foggy.

<b>        KAFKA
</b>
        Walks slowly, tiredly.  He looks up at the sky, but the sky
        is a silver shield against anyone who looks for help from it.

<b>        FURTHER ON
</b>
        Kafka stops.  Turns.  Did he hear something other than the
        wind and the water?

<b>        FURTHER ON
</b>
        He passes through a small park, approaching a gate on the
        other side of it.  Leaves RUSTLING.  Mist swirling around
        him.  He opens the gate and -- BOO!

<b>        GABRIELA
</b>
        Standing there, half in shadow, in profile.  Her glorious
        profile.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Gabriela! -- you did get away.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      I knew you walked this way to
                      work.  I wanted to find you
                      before they did.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      -- I've just come from the
                      Castle.  It's over.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                            (her eye glancing
                             far away)
                      Over?  It's only over when
                      you can crawl to a clean little
                      spot on earth where the sun
                      sometimes shines and you can warm
                      yourself a bit.

        Kafka is beginning to sense something quite wrong with her.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      Gabriela ...?

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Should I tell you why I joined
                      our late lamented nihilists?
                      Why I became a murderer?
                      Because murder ... is bliss.
                            (looks at him)
                      It's easier than you might
                      think to absorb and assimilate
                      Evil -- once you've adopted its
                      procedure.

        Kafka just watches her ... The breeze sings in
        the air.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Have you ever watched a person
                      deteriorate?  Day by day.  I
                      don't mean in a spiritual sense.

        Kafka doesn't answer.  She turns fully to him.  The other
        side of her beautiful face is ... fungus.  Alive.  Seething.
        Frothing.  Bubbling.  Kafka backs away a couple of steps.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Only two steps back?  Even the
                      man they left to guard me
                      retreated further than that.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      I -- I found your jailer.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      This is the result of their
                      elixir of youth.  They were
                      to come and check on it during
                      the night.  I contrived to
                      miss the appointment.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      They're dead now.  We can
                      get help.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      I know how they reward failure.
                      If they saw this I'd be rotting
                      in the quarries by the afternoon
                      -- with all the others.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      There's a new potion -- he
                      said it was perfected.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      I know there is.  And you're
                      what I have to bargain with.
                      For now you're the last one
                      in their way.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's
                      finished.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      Why should I believe a man who
                      never believed me?  They're
                      absolutely right, you know --
                      guilt should never be doubted.
                      It's easier that way.

        Kafka starts to back away some more.  Gabriela starts to
        follow him.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      I think you've just escaped for
                      the moment.  Just as I did.  As
                      Eduard did.  As they let us do.
                      But only for the moment.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      No -- not this time.

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      I know better than you what
                      people will say when they have
                      to.  When they brought me in
                      for questioning I informed on my
                      friends the very first day.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      -- Listen to me --

<b>                                  GABRIELA
</b>                      I do.  Always.  You understand
                      the world better than any of
                      us, Kafka.  And what it's
                      becoming.
                            (pause)
                      I've always held you in the
                      highest regard.

        And suddenly she's slashed a <u>knife</u> across Kafka's chest.  He
        shouts in pain, staggering backwards.  She comes after him.

<b>                                  KAFKA
</b>                      -- Gabriela!

        She comes after him, blade glistening.  Kafka does his best
        to run.

<b>        THE BRIDGE
</b>
        Kafka giddily staggers forward, one arm wrapped around his
        bleeding chest, Gabriela close behind him.  Too close for him
        to get away.  He turns to face her as he reaches the bridge
        and as she comes upon him again with the knife, raising his
        arm to block the thrust and hold her wrist back.  She's
        strong, though, made more so by her madness.  She forces him
        down to the ground, straddling him, the knife pushing
        closer.  Kafka gasps in pain, finally succumbs, no longer
        able to hold his hand up in defense, simply shutting his eyes
        with a terrible sigh to await the fatal stab.

        It doesn't come.  Almost.  But not quite.  Gabriela's arm
        pauses, shaking in the cool, cloudy air, her sleeve trembling
        in the breeze off the River, the sharp blade, inches from
        Kafka's throat, flashing in the new day's light.

        Gabriela stares away over the River, the destroyed half of
        her face in shadow again, the other more strikingly beautiful
        than ever.  As Kafka watches, passive, she gets off him and
        slowly walks to the wall of the bridge, letting the knife
        drop from her hand along the way.  Kafka manages to lift
        himself to his knees, clutching his wound.  He looks up.
        Gabriela in one graceful movement climbs over the wall and
        throws herself into the River.

        Kafka lowers his head.

<b>        CONTINENTAL COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
</b>
        Quiet in here.  Breakfast business not as crowded as
        evening.  Kafka sits alone at  his usual table.  Looking
        dazed, almost in shock.  Mostly just tired.  Waiting.  He
        sips from his coffee cup.  He COUGHS a little into his napkin
        -- and notices blood on it.

        He has a pen in his hand.  Tapping it slowly on a newspaper
        on the table ...

        Bizzlebek comes into the coffee house.  He sees Kafka sitting
        in the far corner and gives a grand smile and wave.  But then
        he notices Kafka's other friends entering and he'd rather not
        have to deal with them -- so he gives Kafka a "catch you
        later" gesture and turns onto his own usual stool at the bar.

        Kafka stares at his friends over there.  They're taking off
        their coats and  greeting other people.  The girl, Anna, is
        the first to start walking to join him.

        He starts to write, a first line that has occurred to him,
        the pen moving as if he can't help himself ...

        Anna's approaching.  Kafka just watches her coming.  He
        knows he'll end up going out with her, sleeping with her,
        getting engaged to her ... We see the future on Kafka's
        face

<b>        KAFKA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
        Alone again in his little room, Kafka writes on into the
        night.  The famous "Letter To His Father" is pages and pages
        long.  We notice too that his chest has been bandaged.  He
        COUGHS a little as he forces himself to keep writing.

<b>                                  KAFKA'S VOICE
</b>                      Naturally things cannot in
                      reality fit together the way
                      the evidence does in my letter
                      -- life is more than a Chinese
                      puzzle.  But in my opinion
                      something has been achieved
                      which so closely approximates
                      the truth that it might reassure
                      us both a little and make our
                      living and our dying easier.

        The Assistants sit on a big packing crate, brushing soot from
        their suits, shaking dust out of their hair, fiddling with
        the rips in their jackets and trousers.

                      late for all of us.

                      What's to become of us now?

        Oskar has a long think.

<b>                                  OSKAR
</b>                            (looks at L.)
                      Amerika.  That's the place to go.

        Ludwig jumps off the box and gapes at Oskar, tremendously
        impressed by this brainstorm.

<b>                                  LUDWIG

        And, linking arms, they do a strange dance along the quay ...
