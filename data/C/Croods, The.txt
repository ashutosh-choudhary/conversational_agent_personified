           my family, the Croods. If you weren't
           clued in already by the animal skins and
           sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most
           days we spend in our cave, in the dark.
           Night after night, day after day. Yep.
           Home sweet home. When we did go out, we
           struggled to find food in a harsh and
           hostile world. And I struggled to
           survive my family.

           to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a
           mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand
           snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs,
           common cold. And, the Croods. That's
           us. The Croods made it...

          growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT

          Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a

          A LITTLE GIRL, SANDY, charges out next. Her display is

          A CAVE WOMAN, UGGA, scrambles out next. She is mostly
          focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to

          Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug. Thunk
          picks up a boulder and throws it. It ricochets off the
          cliff wall and careens into Grug. Grug gets plowed over
          by the boulder.

          Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small
          cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips
          over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the
          ground and fumbling the egg once again.
                         
          Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down
          on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks.
          The family members meet up as they begin their long run
          back to the cave.

          back to their cave.

          Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a
          launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant.

          The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the
          crash. The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the
          canyon, sending the Croods flying in. They all tumble.
          Grug makes an extraordinary football catch. He holds
          tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. Grug holds up
          the egg.

          mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty.

</b>           A long time ago, this little bear was
           alive. She was alive because she
           listened to her father and lived her life
           in routine and darkness and terror. So
           she was happy. But Krispy had one,

          ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting.
                         
          But then, SILENCE.
                         
          And then cutting through the primordial night is a
          MUSICAL SOUND. Unsettling. Unearthly. Eep creeps

          WHOOSH! A bright light blazes through the gaps around
          the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW.
          She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to
          catch it in her hands.
                         
          Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to
          get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more
          than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the
          disappearing light.
                         
          Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the
          cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she
          shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes
          all of her strength, but she manages to move it just
          enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.

          Eep stands outside at night for the first time ever. Her

          and through her hair. The forbidden sensation is
          exhilarating.
          The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it
          will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her
          hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels
          herself.
                         
          Eep LETS GO and DASHES after the light, SCRAMBLING
          through the SANDSTONE NARROWS, bounding from side to
          side. As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon,

          a TORCH. As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was
          following. Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches.
                         
          REVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on
          the palms of her hands and her face. TENSE. EXCITING.
                         
          But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her,
          something MOVES. A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and
          creeps up behind her.
                         
          Eep reaches out to TOUCH the flame. The torch blows away
          from her. The wind has changed direction. The breeze at
          her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her. On her
          face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs
          the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder.
          It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground. Eep jumps
          back, GRABBING a good-sized rock - she's poised to bash
          the Creature's brains in.

          their rocks.
                         
          Eep is incredulous. The dust clears - the panting Croods

          The Land Whale stands up and then SPITS the Croods out

          It looks at the Croods with delight. Suddenly, the

          Then as Guy begins walking towards the sound, Guy notices
          the circling birds in the sky. Alarmed, he DASHES off.
                         
          Guy appears at the treeline. He spots Eep standing alone

          two STONES. The birds close in, blotting out the
          remaining light. All goes BLACK.
                         
          Then, a tiny leaf of flame FLUTTERS to life before Guy.

          The Turkey Fish HITS the trigger. The snare TRIPS. The
          bird BITES at the cavemen, but comes up short. The
          Turkey Fish WHOOSHES BACKWARDS into the air. He FLIES a

          The rest of the Croods open their umbrellas to take cover

          Guy CANNONBALLS. Then SURFACES.
                         
          Eep tentatively HOPS in. Guy STEADIES her. Then shows
          her how to move her arms in a swimming motion.
                         
          Guy SUPPORTS Eep by holding one hand under her tummy.
          She begins to SWIM.
                         
          Gran and Ugga SMILE mischievously - a positive vibe is
          building.
                         
          The Croods ALL JUMP at once.
                         
          Grug is left alone. Belt uses Grug's arm as a diving
          platform. Gran, Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized
          swimming. Then Grug sees Eep and Guy SURFACE - Eep is on

          Grug's huge tidal wave SWAMPS Guy and Eep. Grug SINKS to
          the bottom.
                         
          ON GRUG laying on the bottom. His family SWIMS above him
          on the tails of Fishcats, confident and free and buoyant.
                         
          A lone bubble escapes Grug's nose, like oil oozing from a
          sunken wreck. He's feeling mighty extraneous.
                         
          Grug sees the Macawnivore swimming towards him. Grug
          swims for his life. Ends in a big splash.

          Belt makes music, which grabs the Macawnivore's
          attention.

          Belt plays a little melodramatic tune.
                         
          Grug halfheartedly moves the bones he's holding.

          Grug shakes the puppet and makes a frightening sound of
          terror.
                         
          Suddenly, the Macawnivore leaps forward and jumps on the
          puppet. He grabs it and pulls it up out of the tar,
          bringing Grug and Guy along with it.
                         
          Grug and Guy hang on to the bones of the puppet frame.
                         
          The Macawnivore shakes the puppet, pulling it out of the
          tar along with Grug and Guy.

          The puppet breaks apart, the Macawnivcore turns to Grug
          and Guy. He is not pleased.

          The Macawnivore dashes towards the pair. They try to run
          from him. The Macawnivore's paws slip slowly backwards
          into the nearby tar--he's stuck. The tar snaps him back
          and throws him far from Grug and Guy.
                         
          Belt blows a whistle signalling a field goal!

          When the Croods rush toward "Tomorrow," it is a golden,
          ethereal image created by a perfect alignment of sun,
          clouds, and mountain. From the Croods POV it looks as if
          they can cross a solid bridge of clouds and climb onto a
          waiting sun.

          Even Grug is taken with the sight - it's there after all.
                         
          The Croods stare at the open meadow across from them.
          Tremors violently SHAKE the ground.

          When the rift OPENS in front of them, the hot gasses and
          blasts of hot ash BURST the clouds from beneath. The
          debris shades the sun, revealing a very Earthly landscape
          beyond.
                         
          From the Croods perspective, Tomorrow vanished before
          their eyes.

          KABOOM! A gargantuan jet of ash STABS at the sky. Ugga
          PULLS the Croods away from the ledge. She herds them
          back toward the gunsight.

          But Grug doesn't join them. Instead, Grug takes a step
          TOWARD the precipice, peering into the curtain of ash as
          if trying to burn a hole straight through it.

          Grug spies a wispy shaft of light STRUGGLING through the
          ash cloud. He HOLDS UP his hand to feel it. A beam of
          light settles on his palm. Grug is ENLIGHTENED.

          greatest throw of his life.
                         
          The tumult parts briefly. Grug can see his entire family
          safe on the other side. He waves a last goodbye. To his
          surprise, a shaft of sunlight has settled on his open
          hand.

          Another earthquake shakes the cavern. Grug moves over to
          a wall and uses some nearby mud to paint a portrait of
          his family. He paints each member individually and then

          Grug uses a log to wipe tar all over a giant rib cage.
          Grug runs out of the cave and into a nearby field and
          startles a pack of nesting PIRANHA OWLS. He turns back
          to the Macawnivore.
                         
          The meat-eating birds begin to chase Grug.

          in closer. The ground begins to break up violently as
          lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways.
                         
          The Macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that Grug
          has coated with tar. The Piranha Owls hit the rib cage
          and stick to it. As they fight to free themselves, the
          rib cage lifts off the ground. Grug takes a giant tree
          branch, ignites it, and uses it as a rudder, scaring the
          Piranha Owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent
          direction.

          under a nearby rock. He GRABS the Liyote. Grug sees the

          Grug has a wonderful picture making contraption they are
          about to experience. The slab of rock smacks them all in
          the face leaving the first family photo.

</b>           Let's do that again. I think I blinked.
                         
          BACK TO THE SHORELINE, RUSHING ever closer to the beach.

</b>           Our world is still plenty harsh and
           hostile. But now we know the Croods will
           make it.
                         
          ON BELT riding on the back of the Crocopup, delivering a
          drink to Gran, PULL OUT to reveal she is in a sled,
          hitched to a team of Liyotes. The liyotes are tending to
          her. Gran sips her drink.

</b>           Because we changed the rules. The ones
           that kept us in the dark.
                         
          On Ugga sharpening a spear. The Macawnivore comes in to
          frame with Grug riding on top. Ugga tosses him the spear.
          Eep, flips from out of the trees. She blows her horn to
          call Guy and the BearOwl for a ride.

</b>           And because of my dad, who taught us that
           anyone can change...
                         
          The Macawnivore LEAPS through the trees onto a broad,
          beautiful beach with Grug and Ugga atop.

<b>                          EEP
</b>           Well, sort of.
                         
          Thunk breaks through the trees riding a LANDWHALE. Sandy
          and Belt are riding the Crocopup. Eep and Guy are riding
          the BearOwl.

</b>           So from now on we'll stay out here.
                         
          The first camera picks them up as it reaches the beach.
          It FOLLOWS the Croods as they TURN and ride toward a
          sunrise.

          Belt and Sandy poke their heads up at the base of the
          screen.
