<b>   CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S LEG
</b>
   A nervous leg shakes under the table. The appendage seems
   to be attached to someone who has a lot on their mind.


<b>   INT. CAFE-DAY
</b>
   LOUIS, a college student in his late twenties stares at a
   friend who is sitting off screen. Louis is calm, almost
   villainous in how collective he is.

   He stares at this unseen friend, trying to assess the
   cause for his anxious state.

</b>                 (smug)
          Something is bothering you...

   We finally see QUINN, also in his late twenties. He is
   obviously uneasy about being out in public with this
   person.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          I appreciate the faux concern but I'm
          fine.

   Louis is taken aback.

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>          My concern is genuine...

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          With our history can you honestly say you
          care about my well being?

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>          Yes I can, our connection is a product of
          destiny. I have no ill-will against you.

   Quinn scoffs.

</b>          -The Stephen Speilberg film?

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          No, there was that little French girl I
          liked. You..you violated her and torched
          her farm killing her family-

</b>          -Actually you are jacking up the story, I
          violated her father in front of
          her...then I torched the farm.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          Well...that makes it ten times better.

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>          Quinn that was war, people do crazy
          things midst of wide spread conflict. I
          have gotten jaded over time. It's not
          like the dark ages when I had style.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          When you would rape the horses and ride
          away on the women?

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>          Yeah I was such a ham.
          (beat)
          Quinn, this is what we do. I have gotten
          carried away in the past, but now I'm
          tired. I just want to get this over with.
          It's our calling, we help bring order and
          balance to the universe.
           (beat)
          Maybe I would feel less removed if you
          would let me win just once.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          This isn't a 1930's boxing match. If I
          take dive, I'm not lining the pockets of
          some bookie...I'm bringing on the
          apocalypse.
Louis takes a drink of his coffee.

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>          See at least our obligation would be
          over.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          Louis I might be nervous, but I accept my
          role as savior of this world.

<b>INT. CAFE-DAY-MOMENTS LATER
</b>
We pan across the cafe to the table of ZOEY and RICK, a
young college aged couple. Zoey is obviously trying to
have a serious conversation, while Rick hides behind his
laptop using it as a shield.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          ...I'm not saying this is an
          intervention.

Rick doesn't look up from his laptop screen.

<b>                       RICK
</b>          Wouldn't there be more people here if it
          was an intervention?

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          See and I don't want it to be-

<b>                       RICK
</b>          (disinterested)
          -That's because it's not

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          It's just...I mean...are you gambling
          again?
<b>                       RICK
</b>          (totally removed)
           Nope.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Because...um...the laptop, and you never
          go anywhere with out it-

<b>                       RICK
</b>          -it's my lifeline-

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          -Yeah well...I just know when I met you I
          saved you from that downhill spiral...you
          know...uh...the online poker-
<b>                                                      4.

<b>                       RICK
</b>          -I'm not a project, you know that right?

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Of course not...I never said you were.

<b>                       RICK
</b>          Because you act like it...I wonder if I
          didn't have this "so called problem" if
          you would have even been interested in
          me.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Of course I would. I just-

<b>                       RICK
</b>          -Take it upon yourself to save people.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          OK...maybe. Honestly we have to save each
          other, who else is going to do it.

<b>                       RICK
</b>          (continued to be removed)
          People could just save themselves.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          True. Is that human nature? People rely
          on false deities, self help books...Rick
          the day I realized we were alone in the
          universe was the day I realized we have
          to be there for each other.
          (beat)
          Plus don't you find it romantic that I
          want to save you? Like a movie...

<b>                       RICK

</b>          Oh well...so do you want to see what I'm
          doing on the computer?

Zoey feels like she has broken down the "wall".

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Yes...of course!

Zoey, still confused, slowly turns the laptop back toward
Rick.

Louis kicks at the ground, almost as if he was searching
for something. His foot finally rests on a broken tree
limb.

He places his foot under it and kicks it up to his right
hand.

<b>                       LOUIS

He throws it over to Quinn, who catches it in one swift

A young BOY is sitting on another little boy's head. It
looks like he is passing gas on him.

The boy is now doing the same to Zoey.

ZACK, a young teenager is selling drugs on the street
corner. His bags of coke should be exaggerated, as well
as the customers coming up to buy from him. Think if
South Park was crossed with HBO's The Wire.

<b>                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            Good old Zack the neighbourhood drug
            dealer-
Zoey takes Zack into a room labeled "Rehab" on the door.

<b>                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            -You took it upon yourself to be his
            personal savoir. What did it get you?

Zack is out with Zoey when a few of his old GANG FRIENDS
show up looking to collect. Zack opens his pockets to
show he doesn't have any dough on him.

<b>                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            Well when Zach's old business partners
            wanted to collect on a debt-

Zack slowly pushes Zoey toward them.
<b>                                                          9.
</b>

A few days later we see Zoey being used as a human coffee
table as the gang uses her back to cut cocaine.

<b>                       ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          - they used you to replace their missing
          coffee table they broke during a drunken
          party.

<b>ZOEY 17 YEARS OLD.

A gang member looks directly into the camera. He smiles
showing his golden grille.

<b>                       ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          -And then you have Toothpick. What kind
          of name is Toothpick?

<b>                       ZOEY (V.O.)
</b>          It was his gang name.

<b>                       ANNA (V.O.)
</b>          Of course.

It's prom night and Toothpick is in his "pimp" tux. He
takes a swig of his "40" while he dances with Zoey.

<b>                       ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          We won't talk about prom night. Needless
          to say it wasn't romantic.

Toothpick and Zoey are in an hotel room. Toothpick is
standing over Zoey, who is facedown on the bed. It
appears he is urinating on her. It's hard to tell with
the black censor bar.

Zoey is overcome with emotion as she makes her way down
to the riverside. She is holding something tight in her
hand.

<b>CLOSE UP-HAND
</b>
As her hand opens a class ring was digging into her palm.
It appears this might have belonged to Rick.


<b>PARK-RIVERSIDE

Still teary eyed, Zoey angrily throws the ring toward the
river. A gust of wind causes the ring to curve and it
slams into the temple of a man sitting on a park bench.

Zoey walks over to apologize and meets Quinn for the
first time.

the ring.

Quinn scoots over and motions for her to sit.

down on the couch.

</b>          Can we get back to the matter at hand?

Louis brings his sword back up into attack position.
Quinn is back to his "swashbuckling" self. The two battle
it out on the field, matching each other blow for blow.


<b>INT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER
</b>
We creep upon Ryan Blood as he works at his computer. On
closer inspection, it appears he is editing video of
Quinn and Louis' mock fight earlier in the day.

<b>INT. LOUIS APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS
</b>
Louis' set up is more lavish than Quinn's. It's obvious
he indulges just a little too much.

Louis comes out of the bathroom with a towel around his
waist. He starts singing "Motown" songs to himself.

He walks back off screen to the bedroom. We still hear
him singing, as we pan around the apartment.

We swing back around to the entrance of Louis' bedroom.
He finally comes out fully dressed. He uses the towel he
was wearing to finish drying his hair.

He walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself.

</b>

<b>LOUIS' POV
</b>
He starts to run his hands through his hair. He tries to
straighten up the mess on his head. He picks up some gel
and squirts a small amount in his hand.

He runs it through his hair, getting the desired look.

<b>                          LOUIS
</b>             (to himself)
             You are a handsome devil.


<b>LOUIS APARTMENT
</b>
Louis spins around and grabs his keys off of the coffee
table. He then dances right out the door.


<b>INT. QUINN'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Louis walks into Quinn's room and finds him not there.

<b>                          LOUIS
</b>             (puzzled)
             Weird?

Louis walks out into...


<b>HALLWAY
</b>
...the hallway. Ryan Blood is standing in the doorway of
his room, across the hall.

<b>                          RYAN BLOOD
</b>             You looking for Quinn?

Takes Louis' a second to register Ryan's question.

<b>                          LOUIS
</b>             Yes?

<b>                          RYAN BLOOD
</b>             (nodding toward the exit door)
             He just left.


<b>EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING
</b>
Louis runs outside. He looks up and down the street. In
the distance he finally spots them, Quinn and Zoey
holding hands.
<b>                                                      31.

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>          (to himself)
          What do we have here?


<b>EXT. CAFE-MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Louis stands across the street, staring right into the
window of the cafe. He clearly sees Quinn and Zoey on a
date.

His eyes widen as their hands touch.


<b>EXT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING-LATER
</b>
Zoey and Quinn walk holding hands through the apartment
building parking lot. Zoey stops for a second and turns
to face Quinn.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Why haven't I seen your place?

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          My place isn't very exciting.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          That doesn't surprise me. I can't imagine
          you having a vast Blu Ray collection.

<b>                          QUINN
</b>          Blu Ray?

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Wow...Quinn, you have to start enjoying
          the world around you.
<b>                       QUINN
</b>          You know I realized today you are right
          about that.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          So you're saying you want to come up
          stairs and watch "They Call Her One Eye"?

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          (laughs)
          Uh...no. I'm still trying to get I am
          Curious Yellow out of my head.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Yeah...sorry about that...
<b>                                                         32.

<b>                         QUINN
</b>          (smiles)
          It's OK.

Suddenly, guided by instinct, Zoey kisses Quinn on the
lips. Quinn is completely thrown.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          I...I..I'm sorry.

<b>                         QUINN
</b>          No don't be.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          I shouldn't have been that aggressive.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          No...it's OK.

<b>                         ZOEY
</b><b>          OK?
</b>
<b>                       QUINN
</b>          I need to get back though.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Puzzling...but I know...virgin and all-

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          -Well...I mean...

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          That came out rude...I just mean...I
          wanted to do it. I should have taken it
          slower.
<b>                       QUINN
</b>          It's OK. I'll be by tomorrow.

<b>                         ZOEY
</b>          You sure?

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          Yes of course.

<b>                         ZOEY
</b>          (worried)
          I hope so.

Quinn slowly turns around and walks away. Zoey looks at
him like she is unsure if she will see him again.
<b>                                                         33.

<b>DUMPSTER
</b>
Meanwhile, leaning against the dumpster, Louis watches
the display unseen.


<b>INT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER
</b>
Ryan is working at his PC when a KNOCK is heard. He gets
up from his messy desk and makes his way over to the
door.

As he swings it open we see Louis on the other side.


<b>RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT- A FEW MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Ryan leans back in his desk chair. Louis has cleared off
a spot on a messy couch.

The apartment, simply put, is a "shithole"

<b>                        RYAN BLOOD
</b>           You're here to learn more about his

<b>                        LOUIS
</b>           So far you are dead on.

<b>                        RYAN BLOOD
</b>           It's more than that Louis-

<b>                        LOUIS
</b>           -You know who I am?
<b>                        RYAN BLOOD
</b>           I know pretty much everything. I've
           watched you, studied you...I feel I'm

</b>           Really?

<b>                       RYAN BLOOD
</b>           Oh yes.

Ryan picks up a stack of documents and throws the papers
one at a time at Louis.

          - It was decided two great warriors had
          to fight. The winner would determine the

          course needed someone to represent his
          interests. Who better than Quinn's old

Louis brushes the pile of papers of his lap.

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>          Where are you going with this you weird
          little man?

          Let's take a step back for a second. The
          Old West. Lack of faith, corruption,
          these things make Quinn weak. The chink
          in his armor is his faith in people. You
          knew that, and corrupting America...a
          young land...was the key.
          (beat)
          Quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked
          for a human ally. That ally was Joseph
          Smith, and Quinn...or I mean Moroni...led
          Joseph to the plates that later when into-

Ryan picks a book up and throws it at Louis. Louis looks
down at the "Book Of Mormon".

</b>          -His little plan didn't work, but the

          could have destroyed him. The problem is
          you've allowed yourself to become fond of
          him. YOU need to embrace your destiny.

<b>                       LOUIS

          this point I'm afraid he isn't even going
          to fight you.

<b>                       LOUIS

<b>INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Quinn opens the door to his room and spies a silhouette
in the far corner.

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>          Where have you been?

The silhouette comes out of the darkness and into view.
It should come to no surprise that Louis is emerging from
the darkness.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          You've been waiting long?

</b>          -because you are spying on me again? So I

</b>          Who's the girl?

<b>                       QUINN

<b>                       QUINN

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>          No, I'm being serious. You care about the
          girl, it's obvious. Not in a friendship
          or I'm curious about human behavior way.

Quinn sits down beside him.

<b>                       QUINN

</b>          She has a best friend who is very guarded
          of me...It's odd she eluded to the same
          thing. You know the whole "I'm hiding
          something, and I need to come out into
          the open" thing.

<b>                       LOUIS

Quinn gets up and walks to the door.

</b>          Well I better do this now then.

<b>                       LOUIS

Quinn slowly opens the door and walks out. The door
creeps shut behind him.

Louis smiles to himself, feeling satisfaction. His face
looks evil, almost demonic.


<b>EXT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING- SOMETIME LATER

In almost a "romantic movie" way, Quinn runs toward
Zoey's apartment. When he reaches the door he knocks like
his life depends on it.

Anna swings the door open, she's obviously surprised to
see Quinn.

Quinn grabs her by the arm and pulls her outside, pushing
her right past Anna.

Anna slams the door shut, leaving Zoey and Quinn outside.

Zoey touches his face.

Zoey puts her finger up to his lips to quiet him.

</b>           Shhh. You need me more than ever.

Zoey reaches down and takes a confused Quinn's hand. She
leads him to the door. Like a sheep herder, she takes
Quinn inside of the apartment.

The last image we see is the apartment door slamming
behind them.

<b>FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-YEARS EARLIER-DAY
</b>
Zoey, roughly 2 years old, sits in the floor of her
parent's home playing.

Her DAD, only seen from the waist down, walks in front of
Zoey with his bible in hand. He makes it to Zoey's MOM,
on the other side of the room

<b>                        DAD
</b>           You're not even helping me!

<b>                        DAD
</b>           I can't run my congregation with this
           sickness!

</b>           The sickness is in your head.

<b>                        DAD
</b>           You're too busy running around doing
           whatever you feel like. I'm going to fall
           apart and it's all on you.


<b>FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-TEN YEARS LATER-DAY
</b>
Zoey, now 12, is going through some boxes in the closet.
Her head bumps a shelf and a box falls on her.

When she goes to pick up the box she finds a ton of VHS
tapes.

She goes through the box looking at the labels: "Anna age
7" "Anna age 10" "Anna age 12".


<b>FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER

The glow of Zoey's TV fills her face. We can neither see

Louis walks into Quinn's room with his black tote bag
from earlier. It's obvious he was meeting Quinn to go
train.

He looks through out the room, but quickly realizes Quinn
is probably with Zoey. He slumps down on Quinn's bed.
Anger and hurt is portrayed upon his face.

Quinn and Zoey are having coffee. It's obvious Zoey had a

</b>          My father, I mentioned him before, was a
          Baptist minister. He always said he had
          this "sickness". He begged my mom for
          help, it was more important though for
          her to having shopping and dinner dates
          with her girlfriends. Anna, my friend
          that "loves you", has been in my life
          since I was tiny. She used to come over
          all the time. My Dad adored her. When I
          was around twelve I found something in
          the closet...tapes. My Dad and Anna from

          I showed my Mom, and Dad...well he got
          out of prison when I was seventeen. I
          don't see him anymore. His church, even
          though they knew he had a problem
          disowned him. He wouldn't have done that
          to Anna if my mom would have supported
          him, got him help.

Quinn looks at Zoey. He loves her, but a part of him
pities her too.

Zoey is curled up under Quinn's arm as they sit on the

the corner of his eye.

Quinn doesn't answer. He gets up and runs to the...

Quinn looks behind the tree, but Ryan is long gone. Zoey

          from the beginning. One of the staff
          members was Mormon and they would read
          stories to Quinn out of the Book Of
          Mormon. That employee was later fired,
          but a seed was planted in Quinn's head.
          He kept going on about how he and Louis
          were meant to fight to the death. Some of
          the children at the time claim Louis
          would encourage this behavior. He
          probably thought this was Quinn's attempt
          at playing.

          As things continued the staff at the
          orphanage thought Quinn needed help

          already know.

<b>                       ANNA

Zoey picks the documents up and places them in the
folder. She then tosses the folder on the coffee table.

<b>                       JACK
</b>          Why don't you let us save you? Please
          Zoey.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Let me be guys.

Zoey walks to her bedroom, leaving Anna and Jack
exhausted.


<b>ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING
</b>
The apartment is quiet. Anna no where in sight, more than
likely in her room sleeping.

Jack is passed out on the couch. Zoey walks in, it's
obvious she hasn't slept all night.

She scoots Jack's legs over and sits on the couch. She
proceeds to pick up the file folder.

She starts thumbing through the documents. After a few
moments she finds one of interest.

She reaches over and pushes Jack.

<b>                       JACK
</b>          (rousing up)
          Ehhh...what? You better be a hot bear of
          a man.

Jack looks up and sees Zoey.

<b>                       JACK (CONT'D)
</b>          Or Zoey...What do you need hun?

Zoey hands Jack a document from the folder.

<b>                         ZOEY
</b>          What's this?

Jack's eyes try to focus on the document.

<b>                       JACK
</b>          Looks like a room list from the psych
          hospital.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          I gathered that. Under Quinn's room...

<b>                       JACK
</b>          Quinn and his roommate is listed.

<b>                       ZOEY

blows through his hair.

Ryan Blood comes up from behind and pats Louis on the
back.

Louis laughs.

</b>          Oh I am so all ears.

<b>                       RYAN BLOOD
</b>          Well the first thing you need is a battle

<b>                       RYAN BLOOD

<b>                       RYAN BLOOD

Ryan let's out a scream that sounds as though he is being
sodomized.

<b>                          RYAN BLOOD

Louis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream. It comes
out more like frightened little girl.

<b>                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh come on! That sounds like you are
          scared of the battle. What? Are you
          scared of Quinn? You probably are-

Louis lets out another scream, this one is slightly
better.

<b>                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
</b>          That's good! Come on!

Louis lets out another one that actually causes Ryan to
jump back.

<b>                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
</b>          Yes that's what I'm talking about!

Out of nowhere, Quinn walks up to the two of them.

<b>                       LOUIS
</b>          (to Ryan)

Louis walks with Quinn to a spot that gives them some
distance away from Ryan.

Louis starts to walk away from Quinn. He turns around as
he continues to walk backwards.

<b>EXT. ORPHANAGE-DAY
</b>
Zoey's car pulls up in front of an historic brick
building. She slowly gets out and starts to look the
structure over. It's almost like she is trying to assess
if she has the right place.

<b>INT. ORPHANAGE-CONTINUOUS
</b>
A awkward young man, JAKE, is sorting through boxes. He's
kneeled on the floor organizing a mess of files. Zoey
walks up and tries to attract his attention.

</b>          Excuse me?

Jake comes out of his world of file sorting. He looks up
at Zoey.

Jake stands.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          I'm looking for Mrs. Rhodes. I believe
          the people here referred to her as

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Is there something wrong with you?

MRS. RHODES, a 60 year old odd looking lady, comes out of
the back.

<b>                       MRS. RHODES
</b>          Calm down. You need to calm down and
          count to ten.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          What? I don't know what that means.

Mrs. Rhodes starts waving her hands at Zoey. She flaps
them up and down in her face.

<b>                       MRS. RHODES
</b>          You have to calm down and meditate.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Um...no...listen do you know Quinn Wilson
          and Louis Marks? They grew up here.

Mrs. Rhodes steps back like a vampire who has just seen a
cross.

<b>                       MRS. RHODES
</b>          No...You need to leave!

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Um...no.

Zoey turns around and starts to leave. Mrs. Rhodes starts
screaming at the top of her lungs.

<b>                       MRS. RHODES
</b>          You better make your peace with God girl!

          ushering in a new era!

Zoey runs down the hallway toward the front door.

Zoey runs outside and makes it to her car. She hits the
roof of her vehicle in anger

creepily behind her.

<b>                        ZOEY

Zoey is parked in a parking lot, while she chats on her

<b>                        JACK
</b>           You might be right sweetheart. The

<b>             JACK
</b>Mrs. Rhodes was pretty well known in
Huntington. I think she felt this guy was
getting in the way of her master plan.
Finally, nearly 20 years later, he
convinced the state what was really going
on there.

<b>             ZOEY
</b>Well...elaborate.

<b>             JACK
</b>That girl you talked to was "pants
crapping nuts". She actually makes your
boyfriend look sane. I guess she believes
that Lucifer came to her in a vision-

<b>             ZOEY
</b>-How is that different than a dream? Just
saying-

<b>             JACK
</b>-I don't know. I think you have to be
awake for a vision.
(beat)
Will you please pay attention? Anyway he,
meaning Lucifer, gave her this jazz
about...well you know the story. Two
angels, fighting to the
death...blah...blah...Anyway he told her
she needed to look after Louis and get
Quinn out of there. I guess trying to
stack the odds in Louis' favor.

<b>             ZOEY
</b>So she had Quinn committed?
<b>             JACK
</b>To the same hospital where her nephew was
a patient. All on the dark lord's orders
I guess.

</b>Your friends are fucking whack.

<b>ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT

Jack realizes Zoey hung up on him. He slowly puts his
phone down and steps away from the computer.

He walks over to the couch and sits down. He lets out a
sigh of exhaustion as he leans back on the couch.


<b>ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-A FEW HOURS LATER

Jack is now sprawled out on the couch. Anna walks in the
room and sets a beverage on the coffee table in front of
him.

Anna just gets the door opened a crack when...

Ryan and Louis BURST into the room. Anna SCREAMS. Louis
restrains her against a wall.

Jack gets up from the couch, but he meets a gun handle to
the head from Ryan.

<b>                       RYAN BLOOD
</b>          Good afternoon boys and girls! I need
          your assistance.


<b>INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Quinn walks into his room. To his surprise, Zoey is
sitting on his bed. It appears she has been there for a
while.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          How do people keep ending up in my room?

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          (laughs)
          You need to learn to lock up.

Quinn walks over and sits on the bed beside her.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          I'm not fighting Louis.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Why the change of heart?

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          I think you might be right. I don't think
          it's necessary. I think the world will
          keep turning one way or another. I'm not
          dependant on that.
           (beat)
          I'm not a savior.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          Yes. I do believe it. I know it actually.
          Since I have been with you, I've doubted
          what I know to be fact though. Then it
          hit me, it really doesn't matter.

<b>                       ZOEY

</b>          I don't want to do it because I feel I

          from my past...That's not a reason to
          help anyone. It makes me fucking selfish
          actually.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          You're not selfish Zoey.

Quinn hugs her and they slowly lay down on the bed

</b>          (in pain)

Louis has a hold of Zoey. Quinn gets up and goes for
Ryan.

Louis drop kicks Quinn and sends him flying across the
room.

Louis throws Zoey at Ryan. Ryan then holds her at gun
point.

Ryan beats her repeatedly with the gun until she passes
out cold from the trauma.

Quinn tries to get to his feet, but Louis kicks him back
down.

<b>INT. QUINN'S ROOM-HOURS LATER

Quinn slowly gets to his feet. He walks over to the
doorway and kneels down.

He sees a puddle of blood...Zoey's blood. He puts his
fingers in it. He inspects his hand, rubbing the blood
between his index finger and thumb.

He jumps up and screams in anger. That would be Quinn's
version of a battle cry.

<b>CLOSE SHOT-JACK'S FACE
</b>
A hand rips duct tape off of Jack's mouth. He let's out a
loud scream.

</b>            Mother fucker!


<b>INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT- CONTINOUS
</b>
Quinn crouches down beside Jack.
Jack and Anna are both tied up, Anna still has duct tape
across her mouth. You can hear her muffled screams as
they fill the room.

Quinn puts the duct tape back on Jack's mouth. Even
though we can't make out what he is saying, he is still
running off at the mouth.

<b>                       QUINN
</b>          That actually felt kind of good.

Quinn pats Jack on the head.

<b>                       QUINN (CONT'D)
</b>          I'll be back guys.

Quinn leaves the room. Muffled cursing can be heard
through out the apartment.

<b>CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S BED
</b>
A long black box is pulled out from under Quinn's bed. We
see Quinn's hands unlatch and then open it.

Inside we see Quinn's katana. His hand grips the hilt.


<b>INT. QUINN'S ROOM
</b>
Quinn gets up, holding his katana and ready for a fight.
He's dressed in a black biker jacket, kind of looking
like the Bride from Kill Bill.

He walks to the doorway. He stands still for a second.
He's preparing his next move.

Quinn and Louis charge each other. Zoey doesn't bother to
stay to watch the battle. She slowly walks away.

Quinn and Louis' swords meet. The clang is triumphant.
Details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by
the actors involved, but think high flying Shaw Brothers
film.

We don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at
it until we can't tell who is who.

back toward where the battle is going on.

She starts to walk back. The walk turns into a jog.
Finally the jog turns into a full run.


<b>OPEN FIELD

When she gets to the field Quinn and Louis are gone. All
that can be seen is Ryan Blood's body, two katanas and an

</b><b>                                                        70.

<b>INT. UNIVERSITY CONFERANCE HALL
</b>
The camera slowly pans toward an older ninety year old
Zoey. She's behind a podium, there is a sign on the front
that reads: Marshal University Association of Free
Thought.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          For years we have thought absence of the
          impossible indicated that we were
          exercising free thought. In my experience
          ladies and gentleman, that's not the
          case.
          (beat)
          Believing in hope my friends, opening
          yourself up to accepting there might be
          more than the world around you. That's
          truly being a free thinker.

The camera ends with a close shot on Zoey's face.


<b>EXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATER
</b>
Zoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn. Her
great-granddaughter, JENNIFER walks up. She sits down
beside her grandmother.

<b>                         JENNIFER
</b>          Hey Grandma.

<b>                         ZOEY
</b>          Hey...

<b>                       JENNIFER
</b>          You look solemn.
<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Just sitting here...thinking...

<b>                       JENNIFER
</b>          What are you thinking about?

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          I've had a great life. A wonderful
          husband, children, grandchildren...
          (motions to Jennifer)
          ...great grandchildren...I spent so much
          of my youth being angry. I wish I could
          relive my life now, knowing what I know.

<b>                       JENNIFER
</b>          You do have a lot of wisdom.
<b>                                                         71.
</b>

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          I've tried to pass it on to you.

<b>                       JENNIFER
</b>          You've taught me a lot.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Just remember, you can believe what you
          want to believe Jennifer. Live by what
          ever moral code you want to live by. Just
          make sure it's yours. Don't let it stem
          from anger or past tragedies.
          (beat)
          Let it come from your heart.

Jennifer turns around.

<b>                         ZOEY (CONT'D)
</b>          What is it?

<b>                       JENNIFER
</b>          My new boyfriend. The one I wanted you to
          meet.

Zoey turns around to see the BOYFRIEND walking toward
them. It shouldn't come to a surprise that he looks a lot
like Quinn.

Jennifer gets up and grabs her boyfriend around the
waist. He reaches his hand out to Zoey.

<b>                       BOYFRIEND
</b>          (nervous)
          Nice to meet to ma'am.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          (shakes his hand)
          Likewise.

Jennifer grabs his hand right after his handshake with
Zoey.

<b>                       JENNIFER
</b>          We better get going. We're going to grab
          something to eat.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          (to the boyfriend)
          I didn't catch your name.

<b>                       BOYFRIEND
</b>          I'm so sorry. I'm being rude.
<b>                                                         72.
</b>

<b>                       JENNIFER
</b>          (laughs)
          He can be like that.

<b>                          BOYFRIEND
</b>          I'm Louis.

Zoey is stunned.

<b>                          JENNIFER
</b>          (to Zoey)
          You OK?

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          Yeah I'm fine.
          (snapping out of it)
           Enjoy dinner.

<b>                       JENNIFER
</b>          See you later on.

<b>                       BOYFRIEND
</b>          (making eye contact with Zoey, smiling)
          Nice to meet you.

<b>                       ZOEY
</b>          (returning contact, and smiles)
          Likewise.

The two lovebirds walk away. Zoey stares at them for a
second. A it "can't be look" crosses her face.

<b>START "DONE AND DUSTED'
</b>
<b>CLOSE UP-ZOEY'S FACE
</b>Zoey smiles almost to say to the camera that there is
more out there. Things that we don't fully understand.
The smile then fades.

Her final look is that of content. And then as Done and
Dusted plays we...

<b>                                                FADE OUT.
</b>


<b>                       THE END
