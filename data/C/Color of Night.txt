          Close-up on a silver lipstick stand made into a bad taste musical
          box. We see Michelle's hand selecting a lipstick then we see
          Michelle putting the lipstick on her lips, seated in front of the
          mirror of her dressing table. She is dressed in a green frock, and
          her face shows that she is quite disturbed.
           Her apartment's decoration is very heavy, with a lot of various
          useless objects and gold-plated furniture and many mirrors.
           She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe, and get mad at not
          finding it. She then goes to a sofa covered with cushions, which
          she throws all around the place, still madder at not finding her
          dress. A cat, who was lying on the armrest of the sofa, runs away
          hurriedly from the mad Michelle.

          Michelle is back in front of the mirror of her dressing-table. She
          takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips, then on her
          teeth, then all around her mouth. She makes faces to herself in
          the mirror. She seems more and more disturbed.
           She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put
          it in her purse, then takes it out, spins the cylinder of the
          revolver, and puts the revolver in her mouth, as if she wanted to
          kill herself. But instead, she starts sucking the barrel, while
          she strokes the revolver in a quite erotic way.

          Large planes of ground glass. We hear, without understanding them,
          some voices and laughs. Then a male voice becomes more
          understandable...

          ... then Michelle appears on the screen. She is dressed in a green
          suit, she is heavily made up, et she still seems very disturbed.
           The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich New-
          York psycho-analyst. Beautiful and good taste furniture. Shelves
          with leather-bound books.

           pissed off and He shrivels up your cock, so that it points
           straight down to Hell, where you belongs !...
                         
          During this reply, Bill Capa has appeared on the screen. He is
          seated. He is wearing a long-sleeve shirt, a necktie, but no
          jacket. He laughs at Michelle's last sentence.

</b>           Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a
           keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have
           to fill in the blanks. We invent things.

           moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder
           who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember
           and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ?

<b>                          MICHELLE

           I see... I see your reflection over my shoulder... I see... there
           is nothing much that I really like... I think I prefer the
           view outside actually...
                         
          During this last reply, Bill, standing up, is fidgeting with
          something on his desk. At Michelle's last words, he turns toward
          her, looking alarmed. But he doesn't have time to do prevent her
          from breaking through the glass pane and jumping outside. He yells
          «Michelle» twice.
                         
<b>          A STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY
</b>                         
          We see Michelle's body falling all the way down. Capa's office
          must be around the 25th floor. The body crashes on the street. A
          police horse, who was near the impact, rears up in fright. As if
          the asphalt were translucent, we see Michelle's body from
          underneath, with the blood flowing around it.

          We see Bill with tears in his eyes. He walks to the broken window,
          and look outside.
                         
<b>                          BILL

           My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around
           her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared...
                         
<b>          OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY

          Bill is seated with a huge ophthalmologic device on his head. He
          finishes the preceding reply.
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color broadcast from
           Hell. And then the red started to fade away.
                         
          The ophthalmologist moves the device away. We see Bill's face, and
          behind him, projected on the wall, an abstract drawing made of
          colored spots close together. The red spots start to blink and
          then they become grey.
                         
<b>          LARRY'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY
</b>                         
          It is the apartment of an old New-York intellectual. A bit messy.
          A old Earth globe on a stand. Objects and books everywhere, but
          with an warm atmosphere. Larry wears an open shirt and a sweater.
          Bill also is in open shirt, with a sleeveless sweater. At the
          beginning of the scene, Bill is lying on a couch.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Poor Capa ! You're here for me to pity you.
                         
          Larry puts down the newspaper he was reading. It is the New York
          Post. On the front page, a title in large prints : «Patient's
          family sues Manhattan shrink»
                         
<b>                          BILL

           don't care to see the color of my patients' blood.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           I'm a little surprised that this happened to you.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Starts to stand up.
           Sure. You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a
           bitch.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here.
          Bill laughs.
           Do you really believe that you're responsible for her
           illness. You were a small recent part of her life.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Yes, that's right, that's right. But it's all too fucking
           glib for me, Larry. I cannot dispose of this woman that
           easily.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Well, you always were a romantic. Are you involved with
           anyone else ?
                         
          Larry starts to make tea in a corner of the room. Bill is seated
          on an armchair during the following reply, and strokes the grey
          cat who is lying on the table.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           No. I am still a romantic. I just don't have anybody to be
           romantic with. They want to fuck me or marry me... None of
           them want to love me
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Maybe you don't want to be loved. You had a happy marriage
           once.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           She loved me to death. Then she ran off and loved somebody
           else to death.
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           Of course, there is something else here. To deny red is to
           deny emotion.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Oh yeah !
                         
<b>                          LARRY
</b>           As you know, that could be very dangerous.
                         
          Bill stands up.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Yes, yes, I know. Very dangerous. I know and I have got
           something broken. I know it's gonna take some time to get
           fixed.
                         
          He picks up his jacket on a chair and put it on.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

          During the two last replies, Bill has walked to the front door.
                         
<b>                          LARRY

          He shows his forehead and pretends he is shooting a bullet in it.
           Pow !... It's a package deal. The head goes with me.

          The voice in the radio is covered by the voice of the taxi driver.
          He wears a French cap and a striped shirt. He has a strong foreign
          accent, which makes his sentences a bit hard to understand. Bill
          is seated at the back of the taxi. He is wearing a black polo
          shirt, jeans and sunglasses.

          Car horns. A car bumps into the back of the taxi. Bill moves
          forward and backward, and then massages the back of his head.

          A wide sitting room, called «Group Room» is reserved for group

          denim jacket and walkman earphones on his head, walks behind her
          without looking at her, and gets seated in an armchair. We hear
          voices, but we understand only a few words here and there. Then a
          voice becomes clearer than the other ones. It is Clark's voice

           What do you think, Doctor Clark ?...
                         
          Bob straightens up the armchair and Casey stands up sneering.

          He starts crying.
           ... I... I can't talk about it...
                         
          Sondra turns her head away : she looks disturbed and moved. Clark
          wipes his eyes.

<b>                          CASEY
</b>          He talks in articulating his words in an affected manner.
           I am Casey Heinz. I am a painter. I live in a loft
           downtown, and I guess... you could say... I'm alienated...
          At the end of his reply, he seems to be ready to cry. He puts his
          head in his hands, then shows his laughing face.

<b>                          CASEY

          He sneers.
                         
<b>                          CLARK
</b>           The problem is that if you and Buck are going to smoke in
           here, then the door to Doctor Moore's office must remain
           opened in minimum of fifteen inches.
                         
          Buck comes and sits next to Casey. They smoke together.

          Buck and Casey puff clouds of smoke.
                         
<b>                          CLARK

           ashtrays...
                         
<b>                          SONDRA

           anything about this, Bob ?

</b>           ... that sucks up the smoke and purifies it. They cost nine
           dollars and ninety-nine cents, half of which is four-

<b>                          CLARK
</b>           One of you will have to pay an extra penny, but I'm sure
           you can work that out.

          General laugh. Several incomprehensible words. We understand only
          Sondra's next reply.

          Richie walks behind Bill to reach his seat.

          The end of the preceding scene fades in the beginning of this one.
          We are now later in the same day. Night has come. The atmosphere
          seems more relax. Buck is half lying on a sofa. Sondra is
          finishing her story with a sweet voice, and does not simper
          anymore.

</b>           Way to go.
                         
          Bob gets up very quickly. Everyone does like him, but more slowly.
          Bob turns back before he leaves the room.
                         
<b>                          BOB

           Nine.
                         
          Bill remains seated and nods to the people getting out. Clark
          remains, behind Bill, in front of the shelves. He puts something
          back in a plastic bag and mumbles something we don't understand.
          Bill turns toward him.
                         
<b>                          CLARK

<b>                          CLARK
</b>          He puts the bag in the pocket of this jacket, and takes a book on
          a shelf. He gives it to Bill.
           It's really... it's quite excellent.

<b>                          CLARK
</b>          He wipes his hand with a white handkerchief, wipes the handle of
          his black leather case before taking it, and then puts the
          handkerchief in the pocket of his pants.
           Very much. Good night, Doctor Capa.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>          Bill holds his hand out, but Clark does not take it. He just nods
          in a friendly way and goes out.
           Good night.
          Alone, Bill flips through the books.

          Bill and Bob come out of the building where Bob's office is
          located. Bob has his jacket on and Bob is wearing a brown leather
          jacket. He is carrying his traveling bags.

          Bob's expensive convertible Mercedes starts away. On the back
          license plate, we can read «WAY TO GO». The roof of the car is
          open. The rest of the scene takes place inside the car driving
          through Los Angeles.

          Bob turns on his left to enter his residence.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           All right, if I diagnose a schizophrenia, what do you
           recommend ?

<b>          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
</b>                         
          A huge sliding metallic door, with spikes on the top, moves
          smoothly to let the car enter. Bill seems impressed by the
          residence of his friend. He looks at the security camera. Bob
          stops the car and they get out of it. Bill takes his luggage.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           It's all one place ?...
          They come near a door shaped like a giant keyhole.
           Goddamn...
          A metallic gate slides behind the door to let them in.
           Like peeking through a keyhole...
          They get down a few steps and reach a lawn.
           You get a very limited... view of the truth....
                         
<b>                          BOB

          Bill looks with admiration at the pool, and at the huge and
          impressive house, very Hollywood-like.
                         
<b>                          BILL

<b>                          BOB
</b>           After you, wise guy... Come on.
          Bill laughs.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Oh, men...
          He laughs, looking at the luxury that surrounds him. The best and
          the most expensive in modern furniture. Large expensive paintings
          hanged on the walls. Leather armchairs. Bob types a secret code on
          a keyboard. Then he switch on a small TV set that shows the
          pictures from all the security cameras.
           So, how are we as we approach forty ?
                         
<b>                          BOB

           divorced. We have some money...
          He puts back in place a painting that was slightly crooked.

<b>                          BILL

<b>                          BOB

<b>                          BILL
</b>           She's too young for you.

<b>                          BILL
</b>          He sits behind the bar.
           Always get the clichés and you won't be disappointed.
                         
<b>                          BOB
</b>           This woman is not a cliché.
          He has taken two bottle of beer from the fridge and he gives one
          to Bill.
                         
<b>                          BILL

          They clink the two bottle and drink the beer from the bottle.
           Good to see you, Bob !

</b>           You too !... So...
          Bill plays with a «piece of art», consisting of an assembly of
          square pieces of glass glued together into a larger square. The
          object can pivot on his stand and, when you look through it, you
          get a distorted view of whatever is behind it.
           You're ready yet ?
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Ready to what ?
          We see the distorted face of Bill through the «piece of art», or
          rather several distorted view of Bill's face seen through each of
          the individual square of glass. Bob pivot the object to have a
          better view of his friend.
           So hard to talk about... So hard to talk about...
          Bill pivot the object again to hide behind it.
           I's just a game... dumb, deceitful game. So I quit my
           practice.
          He gets up.
                         
<b>                          BOB

          Freud on the cover.
           Well, I certainly lost my belief in the scriptures.
          He puts the book back, and with his hand, makes a masturbation
          gesture.
                         
<b>                          BOB

           the pain that I know that I'm supposed to be feeling right
           now. And I think I'm going crazy...
          We feel that Bill is ready to cry.
           I'm lost, man, I think I'm going crazy.
          He has tears in his eyes.

          In front of Bob's residence. The sun is shining. Bill is wearing a
          brown tank top and white jogging pants. Bob is wearing a blue
          cyclist shirt and black pants. They're both wearing caps. They are
          ready to go cycling. We hear the voice over of Bob, finishing the
          sentence from the preceding scene.
<b>                          BOB

          Bill dismounts his bike. Bob gets his bike upside down and sets it
          upright standing on the saddle and the handlebar. He checks the
          chain. Bill is leaning on his bike.

          They ride even faster while clowning, like riding on the back

          workroom. Bob's desk is decorated with two wrought iron eagles.
          Bob is wearing jacket and necktie. He is just finishing a session
          with a patient.

          valet. He then stops by the shelves behind his desk and starts the
          music : a concerto for piano and orchestra. He sits behind his
          desk, and starts writing in a large notebook. He hears a strange
          noise, and raises his head. He puts his pen down, open a drawer
          and takes his revolver out. A draught flips the pages of his
          notebook. He seems to feel better, puts the revolver back and
          closes the drawer. Then he closes the notebook, takes it and goes
          to the shelves. He seems to be looking for something, and feels
          worried not to find it. He gets out of his workroom.

          He enters the meeting room and goes directly to the shelves. He
          looks around and takes an art book about Van Gogh. He checks that
          the size of the art book and the size of his notebook are similar.
          He takes off the dustcover of the art book and puts it on his
          notebook, puts his notebook on the shelf where the art book was
          and puts the art book in the bottom of the shelves. A shadow moves
          on the shelves and a strange noise is heard. Bob, a bit nervous,
          goes to the door and opens it. The classical music stops. Through
          the open door, we can see Bob opening the door of his workroom.

          He comes back into the meeting room. When he enters the room, the
          light is suddenly switched off. He crosses the meeting room. We
          can hear someone chuckling, and we can see a shadow through the
          glass on the door.

          covered in black leather, jumps through a large ground glass
          paneI, and jumps on Bob's back. Short fight on the floor. Bob gets
          up, bumps into the drinking fountain which falls on the floor, and
          falls down.
           Close-up of the mysterious man's hand. It is covered with a
          glove. The hand closes itself and a long blade appears on the top
          of the hand. Bob gets up and is stabbed in the chest. He staggers
          a bit, takes a blue vase on a table and tries to hit the head of
          the mysterious man. He misses and the vase crashes on the wall. He
          is stabbed again in the chest. His staggering increases. He turns
          around and the man stabs him several time in the back. He stumbles
          to the front door. Another stab in the back. The man grabs him by
          his hair to bring him back into the workroom.

          The man stabs him several times. Bob is covered with blood. He
          falls on a glass door. The glass is shattered. Bob falls on his
          back. A big piece of glass goes through him and comes out of his
          stomach. Through the window, we can see an helicopter flying over
          Los Angeles.

          revolving light keeps on moving on top of the car. An helicopter
          is flying above the building. It could be the same that is seen at
          the end of the preceding scene. Officer Anderson goes around the
          car and opens the door for Bill. Bill is wearing a T-shirt, a

          entrance of the bar, a truck with two floodlights, the beams of

          playing the drums, a girl is playing the guitar. Bill, dressed
          exactly like in the preceding scene, is looking for someone.
          Eventually he founds him, Hector, who is already seated. Bill sits
          down at Hector's table. Hector is wearing an open dark pink shirt.

           Let me ask you something. Are you really color-blind, or is
           that some shit you feed them with so they feel sorry for
           you ?

          Hector gets in his car, while the valet is holding the door for
          him. He closes the door and the car moves away, leaving a pensive
          Bill on the sidewalk.

          Bill comes to the keyhole shaped door. We can see his car parked
          behind him. He dial a code on a keyboard and the gate opens behind
          the door. He looks cautiously around him before walking further.
          He presses a switch to close the gate.

</b>          Bill enters the house. It is very dark. He opens a glass door and
          walks slowly, while the door closes behind him. He hesitates a
          moment, then walk more decidedly... and falls heavily on the floor !
          He stands back up with some difficulty, and discovers that the
          whole floor is flooded.

</b>                         
          Bill enters the kitchen without switching the light on. He takes a
          big butcher's knife in a stand on the table, and looks in the
          corridor.
                         
<b>          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
</b>                         
          Bill wades in the flooded corridor. He seems worried and we see
          the knife blade shining. He enters the bathroom, the door of which
          is wide open, and opens the shower stall. A rush of water runs out
          of it. An alarm starts sounding. He goes back into the corridor
          and turns off the garden hose faucet.
                         
<b>          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR NIGHT
</b>          The alarm has stopped sounding. Bill is wearing short pants and he
          is emptying a bucket of water on the lawn. Then he spreads a wet
          cloth on the back of a seat. Several other wet clothes are already
          drying.

          We see Rose entering through the keyhole-shaped door.

          Rose gets down the few steps to the garden. She is wearing a light
          flowered summer dress.

          We still hear Bill's laugh slowly fading out. We are looking above
          the main hall of a big luxurious hotel. Two attendants are pushing
          a baggage cart. We move with them to the restaurant room. Bill and
          Rose are seated at a table.

           There is something about me that I bet you find a little
           strange. Right ?
                         
          In several shots during this dialogue, we see Bill seated in front
          of a mirror wall and Rose's reflection in the mirror behind Bill's
          back.

           thinking of a female.

          Rose kisses Bill very tenderly, and even with some spirit. While
          kissing, Bill moves Rose to a more discreet place near the
          entrance. He strokes her shoulder and gets the strap of her dress
          a bit down. Then he moves up the bottom of her dress to stroke her
          thigh.

          Tracking shot starting on a large painting showing a naked woman
          tied with ribbons. We hear the phone ringing. The answering
          machine gets on while the tracking shot moves to a painting
          showing another woman naked but for very small leather panties.

          motorcycle, looking old, then to another painting showing a
          redhead woman wearing a bustier, a garter belt and hoses, all red.
          She is standing on hands and knees and she is wrapped with chains.
          We hear Bill's voice leaving a message on the answering machine.

           sent me a check for the private sessions you were having
           with Bob. Should I send the check back or do you want to
           continue ? Let me know, okay ?

          on a human male body. Then the tracking shot moves more quickly to
          another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a close-fitting
          sexy black overall. Then a close shot on a painting of a woman
          wearing a harness with spikes. Further away we see another
          painting showing a redhead woman being whipped. At the end of
          Bill's message, the tracking shots ends on Casey lying supine on a
          weightlifting bench. His writs are tied to the vertical bars where
          a dumbbell is resting.

          We hear the crack of a whip. Since the shot is showing only
          Casey's head and chest, we don't see who is whipping him.
           You bitch !
          Another whip crack.
           I called you a bitch !
          Whip crack.
           I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
          Whip crack. The tracking shot starts moving backwards, but with a
          larger angle.
           Oh!
          Whip crack. Casey's voice is softer. Medium long shot on the room.

<b>          ROAD IN FRONT OF BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY
</b>                         
          We see Bill, bare chest, wearing sneakers short pants and cap,
          running toward us. His T-shirt is hanging at his side, partly
          stuck in the elastic band of his shorts. Bill stops running when
          he reaches the mailbox, hesitates one moment, comes two steps back
          and opens the box. Close-up on the box, inside of which a coiled
          rattlesnake whips a menacing forked tongue. The snake rattles,
          then the front half of the snake jumps out of the box, with its
          mouth wide open. Bill falls on the road, where he remains seated
          without moving. The snake, with the back half of his body still in
          the box, doesn't seem to know what it must do next.
           A car arrives at a high rate of speed. Since a pick-up is parked
          on the other side of the road, the car must zigzag and it barely
          avoid driving on Bill.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>          Yelling to the driver.
           Hey !
                         
          The car honks. We get a close-up of the driver when the car comes
          very close to Bill.
                         
<b>                          THE DRIVER
</b>           You idiot !
                         
          Bill looks at the departing car and notices a city worker blowing
          dead leaves on the bank of the road.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>          He yells to the city worker, but, with the loud noise of his power
          blower, the man does not hears him and remains concentrated on his
          work.
           Hey ! Hey !... Help !... Shit !
          Bill crawls back a little, then he eventually stands up. He
          crosses the road, and takes a big shovel in the pick-up truck.
           Fuck !
          He crosses the road back. The snake is back in the mailbox.
           Hello !
          Bill hits the box very hard with the shovel. Snake and mail fall
          on the road. Bill laughs and throws the shovel on the side of the
          road.
           I am not goin' back to New York, you hear me ? You're stuck
           with me !
          Bill stoops to pick up the letters scattered on the road. He looks
          at the envelopes.
           Fuckin' bill. Great.
                         
          We see the snake disappearing through the grass on the side of the
          road. Bill, with his back to the road, is getting ready to enter
          the house. A car stops and honks. Bill turns around to face
          Hector.

           Back to the lovers couple. They are sweating profusely. Their
          position and their movements suggest, without actually showing it,
          that Bill is inside Rose. Bill turns Rose around to put her lying
          on her stomach. Rose holds the two sculpted bed posts very
          tightly. It is suggested that Bill could be sodomizing her.
           They both moan. The moaning increases with a suggestion of an
          orgasm.
                         
<b>                          ROSE
</b>          Still holding the bedposts. She speaks with a breathless voice.
           I want you to get dressed up... Get dressed up... All right ?
          She turns around to face him.
           I want to get dressed up.

          Through the window, we notice that the night has fallen. Bill,
          seated behind the table, is wearing brown suit and necktie, very
          elegant. On the table, wine and water glasses and two chandeliers,
          with a lighted candle. In front of Bill, a plate with food. Rose
          enters the field, carrying another plate, which she sets on the
          other side of the table.
           In the plate, a piece of grilled beef, noodles et vegetables.
           Rose sits behind her plate. As the table is made of glass, we see
          that Rose is naked.
                         
<b>                          ROSE

<b>                          BILL

<b>                          ROSE
</b>           Okay.
          Rose moves the plate to her left, showing her naked body though
          the glass table.
           But if you don't like this... I have something else for
           you.
           She laughs.

          Bill wakes up, naked, and alone in the bed. One of his hand is
          cuffed to one of the bedpost with a long strap. He laughs.

          An archives room, congested with shelves from floor to ceiling. On
          these shelves, hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of files, stacked
          not too cleanly. Bill is leaning on one of the shelves. The
          archivist, a forty-year old lady, appears from behind another
          shelf, apparently coming down some steps. Bill stands up.
                         
<b>                          THE ARCHIVIST

          She starts walking between two rows of shelves. Bill follows her,
          putting his glasses on.
           Here he is. Richie Dexter. Legal guardian: Dale Dexter.
           That's his brother. Kids were put under care, let's see,
           about six years ago.

           Dr. Niedelmeyer in Pasadena. A child psychiatrist. Richie
           was 12.
          Bill tries to come back to the preceding page, but the archivist
          looks angrily at him, silently meaning he is going a bit too far.
           No foster parents. Looks like the doctor retired a couple
           years after that. Then we lost track of the kids until
           recently.

          The room is decorated in quite a luxurious way, but with a lot of
          good taste. Paintings on the walls. Bed covered with an
          embroidered bedspread, and many cushions. At the foot end of the
          bed, a small upholstered bench.
           Two women enter the room, laughing and carrying many parcels,
          which they throw on the bed.

          Bonnie takes one of the parcel, a large white box.

          a close-up of her face, and we discover she is Rose, different
          hairdo, a lot of almost vulgar make-up, but still, she is Rose.
           Here it is. Oh, Sondra, it is so beautiful. Isn't it

          stands naked, save for her panties, in front of Sondra.
           Oh, the man that was staring at you in the shop... was so
           funny.
          She laughs. Sondra freezes watching the naked body of her friend.
           I think I should have got it in green or something.

          She gets up from the bed to zip up Rose's dress.

          through the parcels.
           I need some more money.

          Rose takes off the large rings she is wearing to replace them by
          the earrings Sondra just gave her. She sighs.
           Oh, my God. I love these. Aren't they pretty ?

</b>          Sondra doesn't move, feeling very embarrassed by the idea of
          undressing in front of her friend.
           Okay.
          She eventually gets up, an starts taking off the belt from her
          suit. Rose is putting her jacket on. A long silence : Sondra looks
          more and more embarrassed. She snickers stupidly. Rose looks at
          her without really understanding what's going on.

           all.

           Um, mmm, okay.
          She stammers a little.
           N... My trainer's coming at 2:30, but that's... Yeah. You
           are? Okay !...
          She goes to the window and moves the curtain aside. We see Bob's

          He enters the sitting-room, followed by Sondra.
           This is a really lovely place you have here. Yeah.
          He sits on a cushions-covered sofa.

           do with all of you. And I know that you're very close with
           Richie. And I was wondering if you could tell me anything
           that might help me... understand him a little better.

           I think it's a mistake too.
          He goes to the window and looks at the children playing in a park.

<b>                          BILL
</b>           But he obviously seems to care for Richie a great deal.
           There's a big gap in Richie's life up until about a year
           ago. Did he ever mention a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you ?
                         
<b>                          SONDRA

           you know that he was... molested as a child ?

</b>           No, I didn't know that.
          He comes back to her.
           It's sticking out all over.
          He sits on the bench of the piano.

          She laughs nervously.
           I mean, it pays well. At least, you know, you can write a
           book, go on Oprah.

           Oh. Let's cut to the chase. Richie did not kill Bob Moore.
           You know... it's really swell. Snooping around here...
          She gets up.
           ... sniffing for blood on other people's hands... while
           pretending to help your patients ?

<b>                          SONDRA
</b>          She gets upset.
           Richie wouldn't hurt a fly ! Why don't you take a look at
           someone dangerous. Why don't you take a look at someone who
           could do it ! Why don't you take a look at Clark !
                         
<b>                          BILL

<b>                          SONDRA
</b>          She gets more and more upset.
           Clark ! Clark ! Clark is a sneaky, lying, button-down son
           of a bitch... who pretends to be this gentle creature ! I
           heard him screaming one night at Bob. It made the hairs on
           my neck stand up ! Anyway... I hope that they fry...
           whoever did it, and it takes a really long time. And
           then... And then a fuse blows. They have to start all over
           again.
          She sits back. Bill has been listening to her outburst without
          reacting.
           We hear the front door chimes, and Sondra's expression changes
          immediately. Her angry face becomes suddenly softer.
           She snickers and puts her tongue to her lips.
           Wow ! That's my trainer.
          She gets up and sniffs a bit.
           I gotta go. I gotta get the door.
          She goes to the front door and opens it to a very muscular young
          man wearing a sleeveless T-shirt.
           This is my trainer, Chris.

</b>           Hi.
          Chris just nods his head.
           Bye-bye.
          Bill gets out. As soon as the door is closes, Sondra literally
          jumps in Chris' arms, and starts giggling.
                         
<b>                          SONDRA

</b>           Let's do something else.
          She bursts laughing.
           Through the low window, we see Bill going down the stairs to the
          street. He stops for two seconds to look at the tender couple !
                         
<b>          DALE'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY
</b>                         
          Bob's car stops in front of a slightly dilapidated building, on a
          desert parking lot. The building could be an old factory
          reconverted by Dale into a workshop to make his furniture. A very
          high chimney above the building.
           Bill, dressed in jeans and light-colored shirt, gets out of the
          car and walks toward the building. He passes a board that
          indicates the location of the «office». He knocks at a door with a
          window and a grating and a sign that says «beware of the dog». The
          dog starts barking. Bill knocks again. He tries to look through
          the door window. The dog keeps on barking.
           Bill comes back the way he came toward the «office». He stops in
          front of a window and bends to try to see something inside. He
          knocks on the window. He turns around, and we catch a quick
          glimpse of someone behind the window.
           Bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men
          are unloading.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Hey! Is this Dale Dexter's shop here?
                         
          One of the men nods and shows the main door to Bill.
                         
<b>          DALE'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY
</b>                         
          Entrance of the workshop. The door opens and Bill appears. He
          takes off his sunglasses, puts them in the pocket of his shirt and
          gets in.
           The workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit dilapidated.
          On the roof of a small structure (perhaps the quoted «office»)
          sits the impressive statue of a lion who gives the impression to
          watch Bill.
           Bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks.
          Someone must be using a blowtorch in the neighborhood.
           Bill looks around him, looking a bit anxious. Several men are
          working. He approaches one of them, wearing a sleeveless T-shirt,
          and who is welding, with a protection mask covering his face.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Excuse me.
                         
          The man stands up and puts down the piece he was welding. He
          raises his mask : It's Dale.
                         
<b>                          DALE

           No problem. So, uh, did you make up your mind ?

<b>                          DALE
</b>           No. No, we moved.
          Dale goes around a huge, geometrically shaped, metallic structure.
           Richie went to school. Everything was fine.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Well... that's the problem, Dale. I look at Richie, and I
           don't see that everything is fine. I see a kid that's on
           the brink.
                         
<b>                          DALE
</b>          He starts working on the metallic structure, but stops to look at
          Bill.

           just leave it there 'cause... to fuck around in the brain

</b>           No. I want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs. Let
           the demons rest. You dig around in Richie's head, he's
           gonna blow up in your face.

<b>          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
</b>          Bill gets out of his car. He is wearing light-colored pants, a
          shirt, and a very elegant leather jacket. He walks up a few steps
          toward the house.
           He crosses the garden, then reaches the very impressive main door
          of the house. Above the door, two similar faces are carved in the
          stone. Probably Doctor Niedelmeyer's face.
           A small panel opens in the door and Edith Niedelmeyer's face
          appears.

          he takes out a tattered piece of clothing.
           Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was
           wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming. The next
           day she came back, did this to my friend's dress. I'm

<b>          FREEWAY, THEN ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY
</b>                         
          Cars on the freeway. Among them Bob's car. The car phone is
          ringing. Bill picks up the phone, while he keeps on driving. He is
          wearing sunglasses.
                         
<b>                          BILL

<b>           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE
</b>          Giggly voice sounding like a child's voice.
           Hey, puke-face. Look around. Can't you see me ? I'm in the
           red car.
          Bill looks around him on the freeway, and sees a red car on his
          right.
           You got doo-doo in your eyes... or caca on the brain, Dr.
           Shithead Capa.
          Strange sounding giggles.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket?
                         
<b>           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE

           scalpel, Doctor.
                         
          Bill puts the phone down and speeds the car up to avoid the red
          car which is still following him. The red car catches up with him
          and bumps into him. Bill jumps up.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Goddamn it !
                         
          The red car bumps into him a second time, and looses part of its
          radiator grill.
           Third bumps. Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road
          downtown.
           The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars. Lot of
          honking.
           Without warning, Bill turns on a side street on his right, and
          gets honked by the other cars. In spite of the very dangerous
          driving of Bill among the other cars, the red car keeps on
          following him.
           To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and
          bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the
          pavement.
           The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere. It catches
          up with Bill, overtakes him, and bumps violently into Bill's car
          right side.
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Fuck you !
          The red car hits him on the right side twice in a row.
           Fuck you!
          Bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it.
          They move together, and Bill tries to bring the red car as close
          to the curb as possible.
           Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck...
          The red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open
          door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of
          a woman. Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her
          shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump
          again into each other and arrive into a main road.
           When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on
          the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The
          truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on
          the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road.
          Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and
          causes a pile-up on the road.
           Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a
          railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill.
          Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then
          starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and
          keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the
          railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away.
           Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ?
          We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and
          looking to the red car with terror in his eyes.
           Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car
          forward and the red car quickly moves backward.
           Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back.
          We see the train moving behind him.

          A very bright light, coming from above, suddenly shines on the
          bar. Hector and Bill raises their heads. We hear the engine of a
          helicopter and a voice coming from a loudspeaker.

          We get a better view of the helicopter. The word «police» is
          written on its fuselage. Two uniformed cops are standing on the
          right skid. One has a megaphone.

          side of the car, we can see the dents from the chase with the red
          car. Bill stops in front of a big vehicle. He switches off the car
          lights, gets out of the car, and pulls the collar of his jacket
          up. He stops near a car parked in front of Buck's house. He goes
          round the vehicle. There is a bullet hole in the windshield. Bill
          touches the bullet hole. He then walks toward the house, and stops
          in front of the open garage door. Inside is a red car. Bill enters
          the garage to have a better look at the car. When he gets up after
          inspecting the car, we see Buck standing behind him. Bill turns
          around. Buck has a gun in his hand.

          Buck gets into the bathroom, the door of which is wide open, and
          grabs a towel. He dries himself and throw the towel to Bill. Bill
          sits down. Buck sits down on an armchair covered with a tartan
          rug. Bill dries his face. He looks at the gun, still in Buck's
          hand.

          Buck shoves angrily the gun between the armrest and the cushion of
          his seat. He lies back in his armchair which rocks a little. Bill
          takes his jacket off.
           A lightning floods the room with a very bright light. Buck puts
          his hands on his face. He moans.

           nothing." So I stopped. Never even made it to the other
           car. I could hear the shots being fired, but my eyes
           wouldn't open. L...

          the keyhole-shaped door is open. He shuts his car door, and walks

          behind the table, stands up. She smiles when she sees Bill.

          Bill doesn't react at all. He looks shocked.
           No ? Okay.
          She crosses the room to get something in a drawer, showing her
          naked buttocks. All of a sudden, she seems to remember she is
          naked and put the two square fireproof cloths she is holding on

          The tank skid on Rose's naked skin and doesn't succeed in climbing

           for both of 'em.

          groans through the gag.

           Casey !
                         
          He comes back to the door and presses the intercom button several
          times. He raises his eyes and notice a folded fire-exit ladder. He
          test the strength of the folding gate pulled in front of one of
          the doors. It seems strong enough for him to climb it. He reaches
          the ladder, which he brings down.

          Bill is now on the roof of the building. He jumps down in a sort
          of yard, in which are scattered various objects : plants, modern
          furnitures and a full-size very realistic plastic sculpture of a
          cow. Bill remains crouched a few second, pats the cow's snout,
          stands up and walks towards a glass wall located on one side of
          the yard. He notices he is above Casey's workshop. He walks along
          the glass wall to a closed window, from which smoke is coming out.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Oh, Jesus Christ.
          Bill succeeds in forcing the window open. A big cloud of smoke
          gets out of it.
           Casey ! Hey !
          He walks through the open window.
           Casey!
                         
<b>          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY
</b>          Bill walks on the upper gallery, coughing with the smoke. He takes
          off his sunglasses. Down he sees flames around the mantlepiece. He
          gets very quickly down the steps to ground level.
           He goes to the mantlepiece. What looks like pieces of paper are
          burning on the floor around the mantlepiece. He first tries to put
          the flames out with his foot, then he takes a small shovel and
          shovel the flaming papers back into the mantlepiece.
           A curtain suddenly opens on the glass wall above the workshop,
          flooding the room with bright light.
           Bill walks to the center of the room, and notice that paintings
          have been lacerated. On each one, it is the face of a red-hair
          woman which has been taken away. Bill runs back to the
          mantlepiece, where he picks up a piece of what he first thought
          was a piece of paper, but which is actually a piece of canvas from
          the paintings. On the half-burned piece of canvas, the face of a
          woman, who is heavily made up but looks slightly like Rose.
           He puts the piece of canvas down, and notice a slimy liquid on
          the floor. He turns around to try to find out more about this
          slimy liquid.
           He pulls a rope and the painting, hooked on an horizontal cable
          line, start moving toward him. Behind the paintings, hooked on the
          same cable, comes Casey's body, hanging upside down. He looks dead
          and sill have the gag on this mouth. The half-naked body is
          covered with graffitis. The slimy liquid on the floor is Casey's
          blood.

          Suddenly the blood, which was grey seen through Bill's eyes, turns
          red.

          of the car. She waves to the passing cars. She then sits down and
          moves tenderly very close to Sondra.

          Sondra bursts laughing and takes her hand away. Rose keeps on

          Sondra gives the glass back to Rose, who puts it on a furniture.
          The two faces come very close, and the two girls start exchanging
          tender little kisses. Then Rose moves Sondra's dress down and
          takes her own top off, showing her breast. Sondra seems very moved
          by what she sees. She strokes Rose's face. Their lips are getting
          very close.
           We see Sondra's hand going down Rose's back, and slipping under
          the top of her skirt, showing her buttocks. We see the tattooed
          rose.

          Rose flips the page. A picture of Bob.
           Oh, God. I forget that he's dead.
          She kisses him tenderly to comfort him.

</b>           Maybe. Hold on.
          He gets up and goes to the shelves. He start looking for another
          album.
           I don't know why he kept this hidden back here except
           maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which
           leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead
           as they were pretending.
          He sits back next to Rose, and start looking at the new album.
           I don't know who these people are.

           No. It's morbid. I don't want to see anymore. Let's go
           outside. Let's pretend it's Sunday. Yeah? You wanna?

          We hear the birds chirping. By the poolside, Bill is lying on his
          back on a mattress. He is wearing sunglasses, and is naked except
          for a white towel spread on his pelvis. Rose is lying on her
          stomach, head to foot with Bill. She is naked but is wearing one
          thick woolen sock on one foot.

          crotch with the towel.
           About a half hour before group. I'm gonna get a shower. You

          Rose has dressed up. She enters the room and goes directly to the
          shelf where the photo album was hidden. She gets it and starts
          turning the pages.

          Bill comes out of the dressing room, and into a gallery above the
          sitting room. He sees Rose looking through the album, taking a
          picture out of the album and then putting the album back where it
          was. He hides behind a wall for her not to see him. She is looking
          inside a photo-lab envelope. Bill comes out of his hiding.

          out.

          Rose gets out of the residence and runs to her car, a small ORV.
          She climbs in and starts very fast. Bill gets out of the house.

          We see Bill driving his car. He chases Rose, whom we then see in
          her car. Tires screech with the high speed driving. Bill comes
          closer to Rose and tries to memorize her license plate numbers.

          The chase goes on. Rose drives very recklessly, Bill too. He
          drives through the cross roads without slowing down.
           A man, who was seated on a low wall, has to climb on it to avoid
          Bill's car, which is driving on the sidewalk. Bill stops near him.
          We hear the voice of an angry woman.

          tries to read above his shoulder. Close-up of the book. It is
          Bob's diary. Close-up on one paragraph. We hear Bob's voice

          naked.
           Everything that you said last week in group was right, and
           that's why I lost my temper. Uh, the young lady that I
           mentioned last week... that relationship has been
           terminated. No reason and no hope. She just, just called...

          him from the roof.

          falls down to the ground. Bill raises his head, sees the car
          coming down, jumps away and falls flat on the ground, just
          avoiding the falling car, which crashes on two other parked cars.

          Edith picks up a cordless phone on a table. Bill tears the phone
          away from her hands.
           Put that phone down.

          She gets up goes to the window bay and open a glass door. She
          leans against the frame of the door.
           He hung himself with a belt. He was 12. I didn't know ! I
           mean, how could I know ? Nobody knew.

</b>           He is survived by his brother, Dale. If Richie Dexter were
           alive today... he'd be 16 years old. He also had a sister,
           Rose.
                         
          Bill stands still for a few seconds. He has just understood the
          truth. Then he sighs and rushes out of the house. He runs near a
          impressive mantlepiece decorated with a fierce lion head pulling
          its tongue out.
                         
<b>          DALE'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR NIGHT
</b>                         
          Bob's car arrives on the empty parking lot in front of Dale's
          workshop. The atmosphere is even more uncomfortable at night than
          during the day. Lightnings in the sky. There are lights evenly
          placed all along the high chimney. Several windows are lit on the
          first floor of the building.
           Bill parks the car in front of the building, gets out the car
          and runs toward the building. He enters using the door with the
          sign «Beware of dog».
                         
<b>          DALE'S WORKSHOP - LIVING QUARTERS - INTERIOR NIGHT
</b>          Bill gets in the living quarters of the Dexter. It is quite dark.
          In one corner, a large kitsch statue of Christ of the Sacred
          Heart. A sink with two cabinets with glass doors..
           Bill pushes the sliding door leading to the workshop.
                         
<b>          DALE'S WORKSHOP - WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT
</b>                         
          Bill walks between statues being worked on. He bumps into a small
          cage hanging from the ceiling.
           He opens a door which leads him into a small room covered with
          spiderwebs. Something liquid drops on his hand. It's blood. Bill
          raises his head.
           Though a gate in the ceiling, he sees the crying face of Richie.
           He gets out of the small room, takes a big piece of carved wood
          on a table, and climbs the steps leading to the upper parts of the
          workshop.
           When he arrives in the upper gallery, he menacingly waves the
          piece of wood, and walks very cautiously. Richie is seated with
          his back to him. He has blood on his T-shirt.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Richie.
          He gets nearer and puts the piece of wood down.
           Jesus Christ !
          When he is close to Richie, he sees that his T-shirt is badly torn
          down and full of blood. He wants to touch it, but Richie starts
          moaning. Bill kneels near him.
           What did he... What did he do to you ?
                         
<b>                          RICHIE

           from me.

          He takes off Richie's glasses.
           I need her.
          He takes off Richie's wig, and Rose's face appears.
                         
<b>                          ROSE

<b>                          ROSE

           "Richie, come here." And I told him, I told him, "My name
           is Rose !" He slapped me so hard, I couldn't get up. A-And
           he, he made me dress in these clothes... and h-he did
           things to me that made me not want to be a woman anymore. I
           was Richie from then on.

<b>                          ROSE

<b>                          BILL
</b>           And you had to come to group.

<b>                          BILL

<b>                          ROSE
</b>           No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out. Bonnie
           was first.
                         
<b>                          BILL

<b>                          ROSE
</b>           Help me, please ! Help me.
          Rose moves her eyes down and Bill follows her eyes. He discovers
          that Rose's hand has been nailed to the carved armrest of the
          armchair.
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Jesus! Oh, my God !
          Bill stands up.
           Oh! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ !
          He goes to the table where he had dropped the piece of wood and
          start looking for an appropriate tool. He finds a big hammer.
           That crazy bastard !
          With the forked end of the hammer, he raises the nail.
                         
<b>                          ROSE
</b>          She cries and yells.
           Oh, God !
                         
          Bill gets the nail off. Rose can't breathe anymore. Her eyes are
          rolling upwards.
                         
<b>                          BILL

<b>                          ROSE
</b>          She goes back to Richie's voice and face. She starts stammering
          again.
           Get away f-from me!

           And then I met you and the fog... Started to lift.
          Bill takes off the other nail.
           It did. It did.
                         
<b>                          BILL

          He helps her to stand up, and then to walk.
           Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh. Come here.
          They start going down to the workshop.
           Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.
                         
          We hear the sound of a nail-gun, and a nail clicks on a piece of
          metal near them.
                         
<b>                          ROSE

          Several nail-gun shots. Nails are getting stuck in the various
          wooden objects around them.

          nails.
           Back up!
          He sticks a nail in Bill's shirt. Bill remains nailed against a
          carved wooden panel.
                         
<b>                          ROSE

          Bill tries to take the nail off. The nail must have gone through
          his flesh, because there is blood on his shirt.
           Deadly.
                         
          Dale raises his nail-gun slowly, but Hector appears from behind a
          wall, holding a «real» gun.
                         
<b>                          HECTOR

<b>                          BILL

<b>                          HECTOR
</b>          He talks to Bill who is behind him, but without taking his eyes
          away from Dale.
           Aren't you glad I'm here ? Anderson snitched you out !
           That's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop ! Let
           that be your psych lesson for the day !
                         
          At the end of his sentence, Hector slightly turns his head toward
          Bill. Immediately Dale shoots him. Hector bends down a little
          because of the pain, and stands back up to shoot Dale. But Dale is
          faster than him and nails both of his hands against the wood
          panel.
                         
<b>                          HECTOR

          Dale keeps on shooting and sticks several nails in Hector's
          fingers.
                         
<b>                          HECTOR

          Bill succeeds in getting the nail off his arm. He runs away with
          Rose.
           We follows them through the workshop. As they reach a staircase,
          we hear an engine starting. Then a whole block of shelves falls in
          front of them. We see Dale in a small glass cabin, his hands on
          the controls of a handling machine.
           Bill moves Rose away from him...
                         
<b>                          BILL

          ... just as a huge piece of furniture falls on Bill, who falls
          down, stuck under the furniture.

          Dale appears behind Bill, and wraps a leather belt around his
          neck. He tightens the belt. Bill suffocates. Dale pulls him by the
          belt across the workshop.
                         
<b>                          DALE
</b>           Come on ! Come on !
                         
          He puts him inside a metal cage. He ties the belt on the top of
          the cage. Bill tries, with both hands to move the belt away from
          his throat.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           You fucking son of a bitch !
          Dale takes a small electric saw, switches it on and tests it on
          the bars of the cage. Sparks spring up.
           You really fucked it up, didn't ya ? Got your little
           brother killed.
                         
<b>                          DALE
</b>           No !
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him.
                         
<b>                          DALE
</b>           No, I saved him !
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           You knew what was happening...
                         
<b>                          DALE
</b>           I didn't know !
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Because it happened to you before !
                         
<b>                          DALE
</b>           Would you goddamn shut up ?
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Could have saved your little brother, but he killed
           himself.
<b>                          DALE
</b>          He is getting angry.
           Shut up ! Shut the fuck up !
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           You failed, Dale. And you made Rose become Richie !
                         
<b>                          DALE
</b>          He calms down and smiles.
           Oh, you're smart. You're really smart. Bob Moore was smart,
           but I put a stop to that.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Yeah, you did.
          He coughs.
           Why'd you kill Casey, Dale?
                         
<b>                          DALE
</b>           Why are you head-shrinkers all alike, huh ? Y-You can't
           keep your fucking hands off of us. Huh ? Always pokin' and
           pushin'. Huh ?
          While talking, he keeps on switching his saw on and off.
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Why'd you do it, Dale ?
                         
<b>                          DALE
</b>           Because... that little bitch, Rose, she started sneaking
           out... playing like Bonnie, modeling for him night after
           night. Christ, Bill, he was lookin' right through her...
           gonna recognize Richie in group. Well, I might have missed
           old Niedelmeyer... but I sure as hell got Bob... real good.
           - And now...
          He starts his saw. Sparks spring up on the edge of the cage.
           I'm gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>          He snickers.
           The inspiration of madness, Dale.
                         
<b>                          DALE
</b>           The tyranny of normalcy, Bill.
                         
          He starts his saw again, and slowly moves it close to Bill. We
          hear the sound of the nail-gun and a nail gets stuck in Dale's
          shoulder. The saw stops. Dale walks back a few steps to face Rose,
          holding the nail-gun pointed on him.
                         
<b>                          DALE
</b>           Richie.
                         
<b>                          ROSE
</b>           My name is... My name is Rose.
          He rushes on her. She shoots and sticks a nail in the middle of
          his forehead. Dale falls down. Rose starts screaming.
           No ! No !
          Bill tries to get the belt off his neck. Rose raises the gun to
          her throat, and presses the trigger. But it doesn't work. She
          tries again. It still doesn't work. The gun must be empty.
           No !
          Bill eventually succeeds in getting free, but Rose, after she has
          thrown the gun away, starts running through the workshop.
           No !
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>          He runs after her.
           Rose ! Rose ! Come back ! Rose !
                         
<b>          DALE'S WORKSHOP - CHIMNEY - EXTERIOR NIGHT
</b>                         
          Rose starts climbing the ladder mounted on the body of the
          chimney. Bill follows her and yells.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Rose ! Rose ! Stop ! Rose !
          Rain is soaking both of them, but they keep on climbing. Thunder
          is rumbling.
           A long distance shot shows the whole chimney, with Rose and Bill
          climbing on it.
           Wait ! Rose!
                         
<b>                          ROSE
</b>          She sobs.
           Don't !
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           For God's sakes, don't jump ! Rose !
                         
<b>                          ROSE
</b>          She has reached the circular platform on the top of the chimney.
          She yells.
           No !
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Rose ! Stop !
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>          He reaches the platform.
           No ! No. No !
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Wait !
                         
<b>                          ROSE
</b>           Why ?
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Rose ! No ! Stop, please !
          Rose jumps on the very narrow ring which circles the platform.
           Just stay there !
                         
<b>                          ROSE
</b>           It's too late. I've gone too far. I can't go back.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           If you go, I go ! I swear to God ! I swear to God.
                         
<b>                          ROSE
</b>           Why would you do that ?
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Please, God, just come over here. I don't want you to die.
           Just give me your hand. Take a risk ! There's no risk in
           dying. Come on.
                         
<b>                          ROSE
</b>           Oh, Capa.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Come on.
                         
<b>                          ROSE
</b>          She puts her hand out to Bill's strutted hand. We hear the sound
          of a high gust of wind, and Rose looses her balance and starts
          falling backward.
           L... No...
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           No !
                         
<b>                          ROSE
</b>           Capa !
          She yells.
           No !
                         
          Bill jumps from the platform and catches a chain hanging under the
          platform. His momentum makes him swing and he catches Rose's arm
          just as she was falling from the outer ring. With his other arm he
          holds on the chain and they start swinging back and forth. They
          eventually reach the chimney ladder. Rose grabs one of the rungs,
          followed by Bill, who pushes her up.
                         
<b>                          BILL
</b>           Come on.
                         
          They move back to the platform, and, as soon as they reach it,
          they hug each other very tight. Bill looks at the beacon on the
          top of the chimney. From white, the beacon becomes red, which is
          its real color. Bill smiles : he sees red again. He hugs Rose even
          more tightly.
                         
<b>                          HECTOR'S VOICE
</b>          While the camera pans away from the platfom, showing the whole
          platform with Bill and Rose holding each other, we hear Hector's
          voice.
           Hey! Listen up, you fucking daffodils ! You gonna leave me
           hanging here all night, huh ?
          Bill starts laughing.
           Get me down, you goddamn cuckoos ! Get me some fucking
           Band-Aids !
          Bill keeps on laughing. Rose starts laughing too.
           Come on, you fucking daffodils ! Get me out of here !

          During the credits, we hear the following song :
