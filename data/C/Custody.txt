</b>          RICK STEVENS, thirty-six, is Middle America personified. He
          blends in at the crowded ballpark. Blue jeans, work boots, a
          ball cap and leather jacket complete his attire. He snacks on
          a bag of popcorn. The CRACK of the bat and the CROWD is on
          their feet. A BALL PLAYER slides safely into second with a
          double. JOHN SILVERSTEIN, thirty-three, business clad, talks
          on his cell phone. Calm and collected he appears unaffected
          by the cheering crowd. The sits with the crowd.

                    occasional birthday, and maybe when
                    they had friends over for dinner,
                    but only as a status symbol. It was
                    like they'd say, "Here's the white

                       he'll sleep the whole night
                       through. Kris' favorite subject is
                       math. He loves to read and write,
                       but he doesn't do so well in social
                       studies. He knows how to ride a

                       always afraid he'll fall. Nicky
                       just likes to Flintstone his

                    There is an honesty about you that
                    reminds me how deceitful I can be.
                    There is a beauty in your eyes that
                    reminds me how ugly I've become.
                    There is a kindness in your voice
                    that contradicts my coarseness.
                    There is a glow around you that
                    illuminates my dullness. There is
                    spirit in you that challenges my
                    laziness, but most of all, there is
                    a woman in you, that sparks my
                    desire, a desire to be graceful and
                    honest and beautiful and kind. A
                    desire to be better than I am or
