            A violent electrical storm.  Veins of light pulse outward, branching
            off into a spidery network of

            We are inside a human brain.  A pack of neurons FIRE OFF to the left,
            and rocket their way across synapses to the optic nerve.  Passing the
            eye socket, they speed toward a silky, curvilinear membrane (the
            retina) on which we see an image projected:

<b>            AN UPSIDE DOWN COMPUTER SCREEN
</b>
            Neurons PING into the membrane: the picture suddenly FLIPS RIGHT SIDE
            UP and we follow the light, flashing in a blur through the iris and
            cornea until, exiting the eye we reverse POV and

            Deep deep blue.  Radiating more intelligence than wisdom.  Inside
            each pupil is the reflection of a COMPUTER SCREEN.  A deferential
            VOICE sounds from off camera.

<b>                                VOICE

            Pentcho raises his blue eyes from the computer screen and up at
            ARLETTE (50's), his mannish Swiss assistant.

            as Pentcho and Arlette stride through the facility.  They pass a
            group of green-tagged VISITORS and their Swiss-accented GUIDE.

                      Cal Tech?

            They are facing the CAPSULE/ELEVATOR that leads to the tunnel.

            Next to the elevator, two plants are dying in their pots, their
            growing lamps off.  Pentcho looks around, finds the plug, pushes it
            into the socket.  The lights glow.  He peers at a leaf: a tiny bug
            crawls across...

            He breaks out of it, swipes his I.D. card.  The capsule doors WHOOSH
            open.  Pentcho nods at the man inside.  This is JACQUE, his accent
            heavily Italian.

<b>                                JACQUE

</b>                      That's not an official nickname, Jacque.

            Pentcho looks from Jacque to Arlette, who blushes.  Pentcho sits down
            in the heavily consoled captain's chair.

<b>                                JACQUE

            Jacque nods.  They hit bottom.  Pentcho keys in data on the console
            computer as the capsule moves LATERALLY on a track parallel to the
            beam pipe, stopping in front of the RF CAVITY, bursting with a
            billion dollars worth of nanotechnology.

            The camera surges forward into Pentcho's eyes:

<b>            DOUBLE CLICK
</b>
            We see an image draw itself on the empty 'page' of the field: 

<b>            A BLACK DOT LOOPING INTO A STRING
</b>
            accompanied by the following thought text:  
                      "...two spatially separated particles will
                      irresistibly attract..."

<b>            MOUSE CLICK - A WOMAN'S FACE

            wide-set brown eyes brimming with emotion.  A hint of a SONG playing
            somewhere in the BG.  

<b>            MOUSE CLICK
</b>
            to the previous 'page' where the LOOP has formed into a sheet moving
            through space, followed by the floating thought text: 
                      "...until the force of the collision fuses

            the BROWN-EYED WOMAN, her face dreamy, her body naked beneath silk
            sheets.  PULL BACK: she's floating on an enormous Renaissance mural -
            a wedding scene - that is a bedroom floor.  Off in the corner,
            PENTCHO sits hunched over a clunky laptop, his fingers dancing,
            dervish-like, across the keyboard.

            CRACK!  Suddenly, the woman drifts away.  Pentcho looks up: THEIR

            as we follow the PULSE SIGNAL from the keyboard to the CPU, across
            the LOCAL AREA NETWORK to the MAINFRAME in the RF cavity, sending its
            own signal into the BEAM PIPE, where two soon-to-be accelerated
            ELECTRONS are released,  like horses bolting from the same starting
            gate, but in opposite directions.  THE ROLLER-COASTER RIDE BEGINS. 

<b>            POV - ONE LIGHT INFUSED ELECTRON 
</b>
            BLASTING through the beam pipe like a COMET, fused inside of a
            looping, twenty seven kilometer single lane race track. WHOOOSH!

            As the electron accelerates, so too does the sound, rushing to GUT
            SPLITTING, EAR WRENCHING DB'S.  Heading around the turn, it barrels
            STRAIGHT INTO THE PATH OF THE SECOND ELECTRON on its own speed-of
            light power surge.

            HERE COMES THE IMPACT POINT... but SCREEEEECH!  

            What disc brakes might sound like, slammed to the floor of a vehicle
            travelling six hundred sixty six million miles per hour.

<b>            SUDDENLY THE ELECTRON HAS STOPPED, SUSPENDED,

            its phosphorescent glow trained like a spotlight on:

            the dual computer screens reflecting out of his pupils, again.  A
            VOICE speaks from nowhere, sonorous and packed with reverb:

</b><b>                      WHAT DO YOU WANT?
</b>
            The camera SURGES into Pentcho's eyes as the brain field opens to the
            sounds of a nine alarm fire.  DING DING DING DING DING! The thought
            text marches by in giant, attention-getting letters: "ELECTRONS DON'T

            More thought text scrolls by on the field, now in RED LETTERS:
                      "I'm having a psychotic episode."

            The field collapses back into PENTCHO, ashen-faced, watching his
            computer screen, and seeing: the cursor (electron) blinking.

            A particle meteor shower of magnificent proportions.  They glow and

            sliding slowly across the tray table.  It stops near the edge and

            Mia turns onto a private road.  A MANSION appears in the distance,
            cresting the hill.  

    23a     EXT/INT.  XANADU - NIGHT                               23a

            A massive wooden door.  Mia holds a flashlight, slips an oversized
            key into the lock and turns.

            An enormous hall.  Scaffolding rises from the stone floor.  Forty

            They enter like thieves.

            Mia stands on top of an eight foot riser.  Pentcho passes up
            harnesses and rope to her outstretched hands.

            Mia slings the gear over her shoulder.  Looks very much in her
            element.

                      relationship?  

            Pentcho starts his own climb up the scaffolding.  Reaches the first
            plank.

            Pentcho clips a safety line to his belt.  The two of them wear 
            yellow hardhats and climbing harnesses.  They suddenly KICK OFF the
            scaffold and DANGLE twenty five feet above the stone floor.  Hand
            over fist, they start to ascend, hoisting themselves up the tug
            ropes.

            They spin around slowly like tops as they hoist themselves up.

            Mia reaches an electric box, hanging a yard below the ceiling.

<b>                                MIA
</b>                      Baby, reality is what you choose to make it.

            She flips the switch.  A set of lights FLARE ON.  Pentcho swallows a
            breath.  In awe.

<b>                                PENTCHO

            Flocks of ANGELS fly above a GODDESS.  Cherubs.  Heralds.  

            Pentcho's face flushes.  He's exhilarated.  She takes note:

<b>                                MIA

                      you experience every moment as discovery.  

            Pentcho's already there.  He kicks his legs out.  Joyrides on the tug
            rope, arcing back and forth like a mad pendulum.

<b>                                PENTCHO

                      universe.

            She beams from his excitement.

            His wayward motion swings him STRAIGHT INTO HER.  They lock arms. 
            The ropes shudder. 

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      If you're right, we have a chance. (beat) To
                      be together.

            Pentcho reaches out to kiss her.  Doesn't see that their collision
            has jogged the clutch on his harness rope.  Now it opens all the way.

<b>            WHOOSH!
</b>
            In an instant, he's gripping air, FALLING at the speed of Newton's
            discovery.

            He hurtles downward in slow motion.  There's a SOUND rushing in
            behind him, the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE.  

            Pentcho catches a glimpse up over his shoulder: the angels, the
            goddess, Mia, all of it has been

<b>            SUCKED OUT OF EXISTENCE...
</b>
            as Pentcho's eyes stare for a millisecond at 

<b>            THE VOID.  NOTHINGNESS.  NADA.
</b>
            And then he's FALLING again, accelerating toward his own last
            particle collision, when a VOICE murmurs from somewhere.

<b>                                VOICE (OC)

            THWACK!  The safety line holds, dangling Pentcho a meter above the
            stone floor.

            They camp on old couch cushions, side by side, staring up at the
            illuminated fresco.  Pentcho is bruised, battered, vulnerable.

                      catch a glimpse behind me.  

            Mia props her head up on one elbow.

            She traces a line from his forehead to the bridge of his nose,
            quoting Yeats (from "The Second Coming") as a celebration:

            He pulls her close to him.  They lie, spooned together, breathing in
            unison, gazing up at the painted heaven.  

            A firefly enters from outside, flutters in the air above them,
            blushing a trace line of yellow light.

            Rivulets of water run from an open window, across a large desk, and
            down onto the wood floor.  Pentcho scans around, unfazed.  Locates a

            forming a puddle on the floor.  LIGHTNING cascades across the sky,
            visible through the large bay window behind the desk.  Pentcho's eyes
            stray back to the screen

<b>            STILL SCROLLING E-MAIL MESSAGES
</b>
            as the thunder follows almost immediately.  CRACK!  He looks up: 
            Veins of light pulse outward, branching into a spidery network

            A voice SOUNDS from somewhere non-local:

            Pentcho leans toward the glass, looking out as we reverse POV:

            A SINGLE LIGHTNING BOLT descends from the heavens on its own speed-of
            light path straight at...

            WHOMP!  It strikes the BEETLE dead on -- (SLOW MOTION) -- scorching
            the roof.  Reverse POV:

            wild, white Einstein hair.  He CLUTCHES suddenly at his chest, like a
            heart attack victim.  His lips call out, but no voice follows.  He
            fades, ominously, to black at the sound of

            Pentcho blinks once, his face illuminated by a dozen flashes of
            lightning.  He touches his fingers to the glass:

</b>
            on the exact same path toward...  KABOOM!  THE RED BEETLE.

            A plume of smoke rises out of the punctured roof.

            to him.  There's a glass.  It doesn't move.

            The rain has stopped.  The red bug parks in front of a

</b>
            Ditto the neighborhood.  A 7-Eleven sign blinks on the corner.
            Pentcho walks up the cracked sidewalk to a sagging wooden porch.  
            Looks for signs of life.  A light.  Something.  

            He pushes on the front door.  Locked.  Rummages through his key ring
            in the dark.  Slides one into the top lock.  Won't turn.
            Tries another key.  Gets stuck.  He pulls it out.  Presses his face
            close against the window.

            Foreign voices, jabbering at high speed.  Policemen BARK BACK on
            loudspeakers.  Walkie-talkies.  

            Pentcho RAPS ON THE GLASS.  He's frantic.  Harder now.  A THUNK
            sounds from inside.  Or was it?  He picks one last key out in the
            glare of the blue lights.  Jams it in the lock.  Twists and

            He SPRAWLS forward as

<b>            A GUNSHOT ERUPTS ABOVE HIS HEAD
</b>
            He drops, convulsed with fear.  Snaps his head back to see:

<b>            THE EINSTEIN MAN (ALEXANDER)
</b>
            in bathrobe and slippers, hands shaking around a shotgun.

<b>                                ALEXANDER

</b>                      I... I thought you were dead.

            Alexander drops the gun.  In shock, a whisper:

            Alexander, recomposed, marches to the burners.  There's anger in his
            every movement.  Restlessness.  This is no feeble old man.  He pours
            tea like he was filling shot glasses.  Doubles.

<b>                                ALEXANDER

            He shoots upright.  Peers out the row of double sash windows, covered
            by impenetrable iron grates.

            Pentcho shifts, uncomfortably, in his seat.  Ditto Alexander's mood. 
            He does a startling one-eighty into nonchalance.

            Alexander reaches out a finger, touches the dab of paint on Pentcho's
            forehead.

            Now he wanders off, disappears into the dark.

            ON PENTCHO: wired, incredulous, heart thump thump thumping.  

            He calls out after his father.

            Standing in the dark.

            Pentcho slogs down the wharf.  Running from it.  Looking for it. 
            Past homeless people slipping in and out of the shadows.  He snaps
            his head back over his shoulder, sees an OLD WOMAN playing  the
            accordian.  She stops.  Her eyes bore in on his own.

            Pentcho blinks.  The woman is suddenly FIFTY YEARS YOUNGER:

            blinking above a tatto parlor.  His eyes lock on, see the heart

            Running from it.  Looking for it.  He stops dead in his tracks, tries
            one last time to play gunfighter with the quantum reality:

<b>            HE SNAPS HIS HEAD BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER

            and we see him, making the same move, from four different camera

            A single piece of thought text floats across the emptiness, almost

            A face, peering down at Pentcho.  The face belongs to the MAGIC MAN,
            in a mad hatter hat, and a potpourri of found item clothing.  Like a
            Baptist preacher on his sidewalk pulpit:

            He stands beneath the stream of hot water, cleansing himself of a day
            that began a very long time ago.

<b>            INT.  THE GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
            Pentcho dresses, taking in the smell and texture of fresh clothes
            against his body.  He sits down on the bed.  Sees a clock.  5:00 a.m. 
            TUGS UP one of the double sash windows that faces the 7-Eleven. 
            VOICES rise from the parking lot.  

            Pentcho stretches out on the musty bedspread, eyes on the carved
            plaster ceiling.  Suddenly, floating up through the open window:

            The old sash falls shut.  BOOM.  It's like a dam bursting inside him,
            only the flood is LAUGHTER that starts deep in his belly, as a
            giggle, then a chuckle that cascades upward and out into enormous
            GUFFAWS.  The sound rocks the house.  Pentcho's smile is a mile wide. 
            His eyes sparkle, then tear up as the

            He jumps off the bed, and bounds down the stairs.

</b>                      I didn't want to leave things the way we
                      did.  Not this time.

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      Wait.  I want to tell you something.

            He takes her arm, steering her away from Alexander, into the living
            room.  She stops cold at the sight of the MURAL.

<b>                                MIA
</b>                      I've been dreaming about this.

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                          (excited)
                      Then you get it.  You'll understand.

<b>                                MIA
</b>                      What?

            His face has the look of the little boy who has just stumbled upon
            the pirate's treasure.  

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      I know what I want.  I let go, and a second
                      later you materialized at the door.  You
                      see?  

<b>            CLOSE ON PENTCHO
</b>
            feeling the feelings.

<b>                                PENTCHO (CONT'D)
</b>                      Mia.  I can create reality.  (beat) I can
                      choose to love you with all my heart.  

            Tears pool along the rims of her eyes.  She stares straight at him,
            hiding nothing.

<b>                                MIA
</b>                      You know those people who won't be
                      photographed because they're afraid you're
                      stealing their souls...?  
                          (long beat)
                      I came to take back my picture.  The one I
                      keep leaving with you.

            His heart deflates.  His voice follows.  Barely audible:

<b>                                PENTCHO
</b>                      Why?

<b>                                MIA
</b>                      So I can move on.  You too.

            A horn blares from outside.

<b>                                MIA (CONT'D)
</b>                      Be who you are, Paul.  I love who you are. 
                      I do.

            She turns and runs out the front door.

<b>     55     EXT.  ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT         55
</b>
            Mia runs down to the curb where where boyfriend WILL holds open the
            passenger door of the red Durango.

<b>                                MIA'S VOICE
</b>                      I'll drive.

            She circles the car, disappears behind the wheel.  Will gets in his
            side.  

<b>            ON THE FRONT PORCH
</b>
            Pentcho, agitated, pushes open the door.  Alexander's already
            outside, watching Mia motor off.  He turns, stares at his son.

<b>                                ALEXANDER
</b>                      Do you want to think about it some more?  

            PENTCHO SPRINTS DOWN TO THE CURB.  Jumps into the Beetle.  The
            headlights FLASH ON in the pre-dawn night.

<b>     56     INT.  THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT                     56
</b>
            Mia grips the wheel with two hands.  Will feigns nonchalance. 

<b>                                WILL
</b>                      You okay?

            She nods.  Barely.  They merge onto the highway. 

<b>     57     INT.  THE BEETLE (DRIVING) - NIGHT                      57
</b>
            Pentcho grips the wheel.  Eyes focused.  We surge into 

<b>     58     INT.  PENTCHO'S BRAIN FIELD - OPENING ON                58
</b>
<b>            PEARLS, PLAYING OUT, LOOPING INTO A STRING 
</b>
            whose shape recalls the original brain field.  Thought text scrolls
            below, accompanied now by Pentcho's own inner voice.

<b>                                VOICE AND TEXT
</b>                      Each part of physical reality is constructed
                      of all the other parts...

<b>            EXTREME CLOSE-UP, ON A SINGLE PEARL
</b>
            inside of which, the entire strand is reflected.

<b>                                VOICE AND TEXT (CONT'D)
</b>                      A web of connections created by the
                      interdependence of all things...

            The field collapses back into:

<b>     59     INT.  MIA IN THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT              59
</b>
            eyes on the rear view mirror, as a horn BLARES from the entrance to
            the Long Beach bridge.

            She re-checks the mirror, filled with bobbing headlight beams.  One
            beam LOCKS ON, straight into the center of the glass, blinding her
            for a split second.  She blinks.  Gasps to herself as the beam seems
            to 

<b>            LIFT OUT OF HER MIRROR 
</b>
            and train its phosphorescent glow on:

<b>            MIA - EXTREME CLOSE UP
</b>
            the point of light reflecting out of her pupils.  PENTCHO'S VOICE
            speaks from nowhere, sonorous and packed with reverb:

<b>                                PENTCHO'S VOICE
</b>                      What do you want?

            Mia blinks again.  The beam is gone.  She looks over at WILL,
            oblivious, checking his watch. 

<b>            BACK ON MIA
</b>
            the understanding flooding her eyes as 

<b>            SHE SNAPS HER HEAD BACK (JUST LIKE PENTCHO THE GUNFIGHTER)
</b>
            And we see her making her move from FOUR DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLES,
            from her left, right, up above, and from the back seat of the car as
            the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE WHOOSHES BY...

<b>            POV MIA: THE BRIDGE, THE CARS, THE BAY
</b>
            all sucked out of existence until nothing remains but         

<b>            THE VOID.  NOTHINGNESS.  NADA.   CRASH!
</b>
<b>     60     INT.  THE DURANGO (SLAMMING INTO THE CAR AHEAD) - NIGHT 60
</b>
            triggering a chain reaction of vehicles fish-tailing across the
            bridge.  In quick succession come a STREAM OF IMAGES:

            The pearls colliding...

            Mia and Will exchanging a LOOK...

            Traffic HALTING on the bridge...

            Will getting SCORCHED by the MAN they plowed into...

            Mia, exiting her side, looking BACK BEHIND HER...

            PENTCHO, ditching his Beetle, ten car lengths south...

            HE RUNS FORWARD, straight down the path of a tunnel-like headlight
            beam.  

            MIA PICKS UP SPEED, churning from the other direction.  

<b>            PULL BACK: FROM THE BRIDGE
</b>
            as the two of them move toward the same point.  Suddenly, tiny sparks
            of light GLOW and JUMP from portions of the bridge cable.

<b>            SLOW MOTION: PENTCHO AND MIA
</b>
            gliding still closer.  A VOICE sounds:

<b>                                VOICE
</b>                      Impact!

            Their bodies CONNECT, arms intertwine, lips touch lips...

<b>            PULL BACK - HIGHER
</b>
            It's like a plug in the socket of the physical landscape

<b>            LIGHTING THE ENTIRE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM
</b>
            Every cell line, radio wave, satellite feed, fiber-optic cable, all
            stretching in every possible direction 

<b>            FROM BRIDGE TO SEA TO SKY
</b>
            pulsing outward into a spidery network of

<b>            GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS. 
</b>
<b>                                     THE END
