<b>1	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
</b><b>	SHOT - HELICOPTER'S POV - 
</b>
	Moving through clouds.  The clouds separate and, far below, we can
	see a giant outdoor amphitheatre.  There is no SOUND but the WIND.
	As we move closer to the amphitheatre, we can hear SNATCHES OF WORDS
	and PHRASES as though from a public address system.

<b>2	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - PODIUM - DAY - SHOT OF BEN
</b>
	in cap and gown, standing in front of a microphone.  The WIND is
	BLOWING.  He has to hold on to the papers from which he is reading.

<b>3	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF AUDIENCE - DAY
</b>
	Thousands of expressionless STUDENTS are sitting there.

<b>4	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF PODIUM - DAY
</b>
<b>				BEN
</b>		- and today it is right that we
		should ask ourselves the one most
		important question: What is the
		purpose of these years, the purpose
		for all this demanding work,
		the purpose for the sacrifices
		made those who love us?  Were
		there NOT a purpose, then all of
		these past years of struggle, of
		fierce competition and of uncom-
		promising ambition would be mean-
		ingless.  But, of course, there
		is a purpose and I must tell it
		to you.  I ask you to remember
		this purpose always and I pledge
		that I shall endeavor to carry it
		with me forever.

<b>5	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY
</b>
	staring at him impassively.

<b>6	INTERCUT BETWEEN SHOTS
</b>
	of impassive students, seated, watching; of Ben standing
	alone on the huge amphitheatre stage; of CLOSEUPS of Ben
	speaking; of loudspeakers; of wind-blown papers on the
	podium.

<b>7	EXT. PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
</b>
<b>				BEN
</b>			(continuing)
		The purpose, my fellow graduates - 
		the purpose is -

	He stops, trying to think of the word.

<b>8	CLOSEUP - BEN
</b>
	He begins to sweat.

<b>9	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE
</b>
	watching.

10	SHOT - PODIUM of AMPHITHEATRE

	Ben's hands searching through the pages of his speech.
	The pages begin to blow away in the wind.

<b>11	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY
</b>
	staring.

<b>12	SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
</b>
<b>				BEN
</b>		- there is a reason, my friends,
		and the reason is - 

<b>13	CLOSEUP - BEN
</b>
	He is in a panic.  He looks up from his papers at the audience.

<b>14	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
</b>
	The audience is gone.

<b>15	SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
</b>
<b>				BEN
</b>		- the reason is - the purpose is -

	SOUND of the WIND becoming the ROAR of an AIRCRAFT coming at
	us through the air.

<b>16	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
</b>
	Huge and empty.  SOUND of AIRCRAFT.

<b>				CAPTAIN'S VOICE
</b>
		Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
		to begin our descent into Los Angeles -

	SOUND of a SONIC BOOM.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>17	INT. PLANE - CLOSEUP - BEN - NIGHT
</b>
	His eyes open suddenly.

<b>				CAPTAIN'S VOICE
</b>		The sound you have just heard is the
		landing gear locking into place.  The
		Los Angeles weather is clear and the
		temperature is a pleasant 72.  We do
		not expect any traffic delay and will
		make our four hour and eighteen minute
		flight plan smack on the nose.  We
		enjoyed having you on board and look
		forward to seeing you again in the near
		future.

<b>18	SHOT
</b>
	PULL BACK SLOWLY from a CLOSEUP of a television screen with
	snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the
	ceiling of the aircraft.  There is snow on all of them.

<b>19	REVERSE ANGLE
</b>
	PULL BACK from the CLOSEUP of Ben to reveal a row of passengers
	staring straight ahead, their headsets on.  Ben turns and
	looks out the window.

<b>20	EXT. LOS ANGELES - FROM THE AIR - NIGHT
</b>
	Los Angeles, at night, its lights stretching endlessly in every
	direction.

	SOUND - MUZAC and the STEWARDESS' LANDING SPEECH.

<b>	START OF MAIN TITLES
</b>
	UNDER titles:

<b>				STEWARDESS' VOICE
</b>		Ladies and gentlemen please fasten your
		seat belts in preparation for the landing
		and observe the no smoking sign.  After
		we land, you will notice an increase in
		the sound level as the thrust of the engines
		is reversed to help reduce forward speed.

<b>21	INT. AIRPORT - MOVING SIDEWALK - NIGHT
</b>
	Ben and the other passengers on the automatic sidewalk.

<b>				MAN'S VOICE
</b>		Your attention, please!  American Airlines
		Flight Number 4, 21 Club service, non-stop
		to New York is now leaving from Gate
		Number 40.  All aboard, please.

<b>28	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN
</b>
	His eyes are open and he is trying to remember something.
	There are the SOUNDS of many people TALKING and LAUGHING
	in other rooms.  A RADIO nearby PLAYS MUSIC.  After a
	while, there is the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING.  The SOUNDS
	of the people TALKING are lower.  MRS. TERHUNE'S voice
	can be heard among them.

<b>				MRS. TERHUNE'S VOICE
</b>
		-- associate editor of the college
		newspaper in his junior year - 
		managing editor in his senior
		year -

	The SOUND of the DOOR CLOSING.  Mrs. Terhune's VOICE and
	the VOICES of the other guests FADE DOWN.  Mrs. Terhune's
	VOICE can be HEARD with varying clarity through the
	remainder of the sequence.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of a LIGHT SWITCH
	being SNAPPED and light, as though from an overhead fixture,
	falls across BEN's face.  He does not move.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of the RADIO being
<b>	SNAPPED OFF.
</b>
<b>				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
</b>		What's the matter?

	Ben's mouth opens a little bit and closes again.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
</b>		The guests are all downstairs,
		Ben.  They're all waiting to see you.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Look, Dad - could you explain to
		them that I have to be alone for
		a while?

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
</b>		These are all our good friends,
		Ben.  Most of them have known you
		since - well - practically since
		you were born.

	Ben has not moved.  Now the bed on which he is lying moves
	as though someone has sat down upon it next to him.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
</b>		What is it, Ben?

	The CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK SLOWLY.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'm just - 

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		- worried?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well - 

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		About what?

				Ben
		I guess - about my future.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		What about it?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I don't know.  I want it to be -

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		To be what?

<b>				BEN
</b>			(quietly)
		Different.

	As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and
	MRS. BRADDOCK looks in.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Is anything wrong?

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		No!  No - we're just on our way
		downstairs!

	Mr. Braddock gets off the bed and goes to a chair and
	picks up Ben's jacket which is lying across it.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		The Carlsons' are here.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>			(to Mrs. Braddock)
		They are?
			(to Ben)
		Come on.

	Mr. Braddock puts the jacket on Ben.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		They came all the way from
		Tarzana.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		It's a wonderful thing to have
		so many devoted friends.

	They move out of the door, Mr. Braddock steering Ben.

<b>29	INT. HALLS AND STAIRWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	PHIL and MIMI CARLSON are coming up the stairs as the
	Braddocks are moving down.

<b>				MR. CARLSON
</b>		Hey - there's our award winning
		scholar.

<b>				MRS. CARLSON
</b>		We're all very proud of you,
		Ben.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

<b>				MR. CARLSON
</b>		Is that the new car out there?
		The little red Wop job?

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		That's Ben's graduation present.

<b>				MR. CARLSON
</b>			(putting his arm
			across Ben's shoulder)
		Won't have much trouble picking
		them up in that, will you?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Sir?

<b>				MR. CARLSON
</b>		The girls.  The chicks.  The -
		the teeny boppers.

<b>				MRS. CARLSON
</b>		I think Ben has gotten beyond
		the teeny bopper stage - haven't
		you, Ben?

	Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink.  Ben tries to smile
	and return the wink politely.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes, ma'am.

	They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Excuse me - I think I'd just
		like to check something on
		the car for a minute -

	Ben moves to the front door and opens it.  MR. LOOMIS
	steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand.

<b>				MR. LOOMIS
</b>		Here's the track star himself.
		How are you, track star?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

	Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the
	hall.

<b>				MR. LOOMIS
</b>		I want to get a drink and then
		I want to hear all about that
		thing you won.  That Hopperman
		award.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Helpingham.

<b>				MR. LOOMIS
</b>		Helpingham!  Right!  Now you
		wait right here.

	Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room.  Ben
	moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of
	the living room.  One lady takes Ben's right hand, another
	lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket.

<b>				LADY 1
</b>		Ben - we're all so proud of
		you.

<b>				LADY 2
</b>		Proud, proud, proud, proud,
		proud.

<b>				LADY 3
</b>		What are you going to do now?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I was going to go upstairs for a
		minute -

<b>				LADY 3
</b>		No - I meant with your future.

<b>				LADY 2
</b>		With your life.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well - that's a little hard to say -

	MR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben.

<b>				MR. MCQUIRE
</b>		Ben!

				Ben
			(to the ladies)
		Excuse me.
			(he turns around)
		Mr. McQuire

<b>				MR. MCQUIRE
</b>			(overwhelmed with pride)
		Ben.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mr. McQuire.

	Mr. McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall
	toward the back of the house and out through the back door.

<b>30	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT
</b>
	The pool is eerily lit.  There are FOUR PEOPLE standing and
	TALKING, drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard.

<b>				MR. MCQUIRE
</b>		Ben - I just want to say one word to
		you - just one word -

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes, sir.

<b>				MR. MCQUIRE
</b>		Are you listening?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes I am.

<b>				MR. MCQUIRE
</b>			(gravely)
		Plastics.

	They look at each other for a moment.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Exactly how do you mean?

<b>				MR. MCQUIRE
</b>		There is a great future in plastics.
		Think about it.  Will you think
		about it?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes, I will.

<b>				MR. MCQUIRE
</b>		Okay.  Enough said.  That's a deal.

	Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house.  The
	people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben.

<b>				WOMAN #1
</b>		Here he is now.  Here's Ben.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Excuse me just a minute -

	Ben goes into the house through the back door.

<b>31	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT
</b>
	We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his
	way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he
	goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room.

	SOUND of a door SLAMMING.

<b>32	INT. - EXT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Ben stands with his back against the door.  The SOUNDS of the
	PARTY downstairs and, as Ben walks across the room to a
	window, the SOUND of the WIND.

32A	SHOT - LONG SHOT (Location)

	Over Ben to pool area and people below.  SOUND of the door
	OPENING.  Ben turns.  MRS. ROBINSON enters the room.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Oh.  I guess this isn't the
		bathroom, is it?

<b>				BEN
</b>		It's down the hall.

	They stand for a moment, loocking at each other.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		How are you, Benjamin?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Fine, thank you.  The bathroom is
		down at the end of the hall.

	Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge
	of the bed.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't
		mean to be rude but -

	Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and
	lights it.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Is there an ashtray in here?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.
<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Oh - I forgot.  The track star
		doesn't smoke.

	She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on
	the bedspread.  Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over
	to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the
	wastebasket.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Is it a girl?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Is what a girl?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Whatever it is you're upset
		about.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh - no.  I'm just sort of
		disturbed about things.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		In general.

<b>				BEN
</b>		That's right.

	There is a long pause.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin, I want to ask you
		something.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Will you take me home?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		My husband took the car.  Will
		you drive me home?

	Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson
	a set of car keys.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Here - you take it.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Do you know how to work a
		foreign shift?

	Mrs. Robinson shakes her head.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You don't?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		No.
			(there is a pause)

<b>				BEN
</b>		Let's go.

	She throws the keys to him.  He catches them.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>33	EXT. BRADDOCK HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	SHOOTING THROUGH THE OPEN FRONT DOOR.  Mr. Braddock is
	talking to the Terhunes at the door.  Ben and Mrs.
	Robinson come down the hall.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Dad - Mrs. Robinson needs a ride
		home.  I'll be right back.

	Mr. Braddock pats Ben on the shoulder.  Mrs. Robinson
	is walking ahead through the front door.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>			(as she passes the
<b>			CAMERA)
</b>		Wonderful party.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>34	OMITTED
</b>
<b>35	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	The car comes to a stop in the Robinson driveway.  They sit
	for a moment.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Right.

	She doesn't move.  Ben gets out and goes around to her side
	and opens the door.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Will you come in, please?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I want you to come in till I get
		the lights on.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What for?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Because I don't feel safe until
		I get the lights on.

	They move to the door.  She takes out her key and opens
	the door.

<b>36	INT. ROBINSON HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT
</b>
<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Would you mind walking ahead of
		me to the sun porch.  I feel
		funny about coming into a dark
		house.

<b>				BEN
</b>		But it's light in there now.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Please.

	Ben turns and walks down the hall.  They enter sunroom.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What do you drink?  Bourbon?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Look - I drove you home.  I was
		glad to do it.  But I have some
		things on my mind.  Can you
		understand that?

	She nods.

<b>				BEN
</b>		All right then.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What do you drink?

	He looks at her.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this
		way, but I don't want to be
		alone in this house.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Why not?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Please wait till my husband
		gets home.

<b>				BEN
</b>		When is he coming back?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I don't know.

	She pours herself a drink.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Drink?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.

	She hands him a drink.  There is a pause.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Are you always this much afraid
		of being alone?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well, why can't you just lock
		the doors and go to bed?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I'm very nuerotic.

	She turns on the phonograph.  SOUND of PHONOGRAPH.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		May I ask you a question?

	Ben looks at her.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What do you think of me?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What do you mean?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		You've known me nearly all of
		your life.  You must have
		formed some opinion.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well - I've always thought
		that you were a very - nice -
		person.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Did you know I was an alcoholic?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Did you know that?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Look - I think I should be
		going -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Sit down, Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson - if you don't
		mind my saying so - this
		conversation is getting a
		little strange.  Now I'm sure
		that Mr. Robinson will be here
		any minute and -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		No.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		My husband will be back quite
		late.

	They look at each other.  Ben is half standing.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		He should be gone for several
		hours.

	She takes a step toward him.  He puts his hand up and
	retreats around the other side of the chair.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh my God.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Pardon?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What's wrong?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -
		I mean you didn't expect -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I mean - you didn't really
		think that I would do something
		like that.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Like what?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What do you think?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Well I don't know.

<b>				BEN
</b>		For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson,
		here we are, you've got me into
		your house.  You give me a
		drink.  You put on music, now
		you start opening up your
		personal life to me and tell
		me your husband won't be home
		for hours.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		So?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson - you are trying
		to seduce me.

	There is a pause.  She looks at him.

<b>				BEN
</b>			(weaker)
		Aren't you?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Why no.  I hadn't thought of it.
		I feel rather flattered that
		you -

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
		me for what I just said?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		It's all right.

<b>				BEN
</b>		It's not all right, it's the
		worst thing I've ever said
		to anyone.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Sit down.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Please forgive me.  Because I
		like you.  I don't think of you
		that way.  But I'm mixed up.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		All right.  Now finish your drink.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
		that I said that to you.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		We'll forget it right now.
		Finish your drink.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What is wrong with me?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Have you ever seen Elaine's
		portrait?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Her portrait?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes.

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		We had it done last Christmas.
		Would you like to see it?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Very much.

	We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom,
	into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to
	the doorway to Elaine's room.

<b>37	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Elaine certainly is an
		attractive girl, isn't she?

	In the b.g. Mrs. Robinson watches him.

<b>				BEN
</b>			(looking at the
			portrait)
		I don't remember her as having
		brown eyes.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Will you unzip my dress?

	He steps back.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I think I'll go to bed.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh.  Well, goodnight.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Won't you unzip my dress?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		If you still think I'm trying
		to seduce you -

<b>				BEN
</b>		No, I don't.  But I just feel
		a little funny.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin - you've known me all
		your life.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I know that.  But I'm -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Come on.

	She turns her back.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		It's hard for me to reach.

	Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Right.

	Ben walks toward the door.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What are you so scared of?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Then why do you keep running
		away?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Because you're going to bed.  I
		don't think I should be up here.

	Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Haven't you ever seen anybody
		in a slip before?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes, I have -

	He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.

<b>				BEN
</b>		But I just - Look - what if Mr.
		Robinson walked in right now?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What if he did?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well, it would look pretty
		funny, wouldn't it?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Don't you think he trusts us
		together?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Of course he does.  But he
		might get the wrong idea.
		Anyone might.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I don't see why.  I'm twice as
		old as you are.  How could
		anyone think -

<b>				BEN
</b>		But they would!  Don't you see?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin - I'm not trying to
		seduce you.  I wish you'd -

<b>				BEN
</b>		I know that.  But please, Mrs.
		Robinson.  This is difficult
		for me.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Why is it?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Because I am confused about
		things.  I can't tell what
		I'm imagining.  I can't tell
		what's real.  I can't -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Would you like me to seduce you?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Is that what you're trying to
		tell me?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'm going home now.  I apologize
		for what I said.  I hope you can
		forget it.  But I'm going home
		right now.

	Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall.  The
	CAMERA PUSHES with him to the door.  We see the entire
	stairway and part of the downstairs hall.  Ben gets to
	the stairs and starts down.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b><b>		BENJAMIN?
</b>
<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		Will you bring up my purse before
		you go?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I have to go now.  I'm sorry.

	Mrs. Robinson walks into the hall.  Her back is to us.
	She is holding her dress in front of her.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I really don't want to put this
		on again.  Won't you bring it
		up?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Where is it?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		On that chair in the hall.

	She walks out of the shot.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		I'm in the bathroom.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well here's the purse.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		Could you bring it up?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well I'll hand it to you.

	Ben starts back up the stairs.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Come to the railing and I'll
		hand it up.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		Benjamin - I am getting pretty
		tired of all this suspicion.
		Now if you won't do me a simple
		favor I don't know what.

	Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'm putting it on the top step.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		For God's sake, Benjamin, will
		you stop acting that way and
		bring me the purse?

	Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly
	down the hall.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'm putting it here by the door.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		Will you bring it in to me?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'd rather not.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		All right.  Put it in the room
		where we were.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Right.

<b>38	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the
	bed and puts the purse down.  As he starts to turn
	back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a
	movement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He
	turns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the
	door to the bedroom behind her.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh God.

	She smiles.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Let me out.

	She turns the lock on the door.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Don't be nervous.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Get away from that door.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I want to say something first.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Jesus Christ!

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin - I want you to know
		I'm available to you.  If you
		won't sleep with me this time -

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh my God.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		If you won't sleep with me this
		time, Benjamin, I want you to
		know you can call me up any
		time you want and we'll make
		some kind of arrangement.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Let me out!

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Do you understand what I said?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes.  Yes.  Let me out!

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Because I find you very attractive
		and any time -

	There is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside.
	Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside,
	struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into
	the hall and down the stairs.

<b>39	INT. SUNROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down.  SOUND of
	FOOTSTEPS on the driveway outside.  Ben jumps up, gets
	the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again.
	SOUND of the front door OPENING and CLOSING.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		Is that Ben's car in front?

<b>				BEN
</b>			(jumping up)
		Yes, sir!

	FOOTSTEPS approach the sunroom.  MR. ROBINSON enters.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson
		home.  She wanted me to drive
		her home so I - I drove her home.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Swell.  I appreciate it.

<b>				BEN
</b>		She's upstairs.  She wanted me
		to wait down here till you got
		home.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Standing guard over the old
		castle, are you?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes, sir.

	Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Here.  It looks like you need
		a refill.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh no.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I've got to go.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Is anything wrong?  You look
		a little shaken up.

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.  No - I'm just - I'm just
		a little worried about my
		future.  I'm a little upset
		about my future.

	Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Come on.  Let's have a nightcap
		together.

	Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks.
	Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie
	and checks to see if his fly is okay.  Mr. Robinson
	turns and brings him the drink.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Thank you very much, sir.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Ben - how old are you now?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Twenty.  I'll be twenty-one
		next week.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>			(taking out a
			cigarette)
		That's a hell of a good age
		to be.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		I wish I was that age again.
		Because, Ben -

<b>				BEN
</b>		Sir?

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		You'll never be young again.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I know.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Ben, can I say something to
		you?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		How long have we known each
		other now?

	Ben shakes his head.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		How long have you and I known
		each other?  How long have
		your Dad and I been partners?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Quite a while.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		I've watched you grow up, Ben.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes, sir.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		In many ways I feel as though
		you were my own son.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		So I hope you won't mind my
		giving you a friendly piece
		of advice.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'd like to hear it.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Ben - I think - I think you
		ought to be taking it a little
		easier right now than you seem
		to.

	Ben nods.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Sow a few wild oats.  Take things
		as they come.  Have a good time
		with the girls and so forth.

	Mrs. Robinson enters the room.  She is now wearing the
	dress she wore earlier.  Ben starts to get up.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Don't get up.

	Ben sits.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		I was just telling Ben here he
		ought to sow a few wild oats.
		Have a good time while he can.
		You think that's sound advice?

	Mrs. Robinson nods.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes, I do.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I've got to go.

	He stands.  Mr. Robinson stands up with him.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		You have yourself a few flings
		this summer.  I bet you're
		quite a ladies' man.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh no.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		What?  You look like the kind
		of guy that has to fight them
		off.
			(to Mrs. Robinson)
		Doesn't he look to you like
		the kind of guy who has to
		fight them off?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes, he does.

	They start out of the sunroom.

<b>40	INT. ROBINSON HALL - NIGHT
</b>
<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Oh say - Elaine gets down from
		Berkeley on Saturday.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh yes.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Ben - I want you to give her a
		call.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I will.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Great.

	Mr. Robinson opens the front door and Ben goes out.

<b>41	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	SHOOTING OVER THE CAR toward the house.  Ben comes toward
	the car.  Mrs. Robinson appears in the doorway; the light
	behind her makes it difficult to see her face.
<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Thank you for taking me home.

	Ben nods.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I'll see you soon, I hope.

	Ben continues to walk toward us.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
</b>		Ladies and gentlemen - your
		attention, please - for this after-
		noon's feature attraction.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>42	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
</b>
	The sun shines brightly.  Standing and sitting around
	the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR.
	and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and
	LOUISE, who are eight or nine.  Watching from across the
	fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next
	door and her boy friend.  Across the fence on the other
	side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed
	as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch-
	ing.  One of them holds a baby.  The Braddocks, the
	Arnolds and their children are dressed in California
	Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely
	too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too
	old for them.

	Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the
	house.  The others are grouped, more or less, at the other
	end.  Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		Hey, over there -- I mean you!
		Your attention please!

	Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the
	house, the window into the kitchen.  He speaks quickly -
	in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		Are you ready in there, feature
		attraction?

<b>				BEN'S VOICE
</b>		Could I speak to you for a second,
		Dad?

	But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window
	and is readdressing his audience.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		- what was I saying?

<b>				MRS. ARNOLD
</b>		Feature attraction.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		Right.  Hey - I'm glad to see
		you're paying attention.  A
		feature attraction that will be
		one of the most astounding
		events ever to take place in
		this particular backyard.

	They all laugh and some applaud.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		Now I'm going to ask for a big
		round of applause to bring this
		boy out here - wait a minute -
		let me amend that - to bring
		this young man out here - because
		today he is twenty-one-years-
		old -

<b>				MR. ARNOLD
</b>			(his hands like
			a megaphone)
		Let's get on with the show!

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		Just hang on a minute because
		I have a few words to say -

<b>				MR. ARNOLD
</b>		You always do.

	They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as
	he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy
	comeback.

<b>				BEN'S VOICE
</b>		Dad - could we just talk about
		this for a second?

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		Twenty-one-years-old, ladies
		and gentlemen; four of those
		years spent accomplishing some
		rather extraordinary things at
		one of our nation's leading
		seats of learning -

<b>				MR. ARNOLD
</b>		Bring him out!

<b>				PETER AND LOUISE
</b>		On with the show!  On with the
		show!

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>			(to the window)
		I can't hold them much longer,
		Ben.  You better get out here.

<b>				BEN'S VOICE
</b>		I'd like to discuss this.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>			(to his audience)
		This boy - I'm sorry - this
		young man - is soon to continue
		his education as a Frank Halping-
		ham Award Scholar - but before
		he does -

	Mr. Braddock darts back to the window.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		- before he does -
			(to the window)
		You're disappointing them, Ben.
		You're disappointing them.

<b>				BEN'S VOICE
</b>		Dad - can you listen -

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>			(meaning it)
		I'll give you ten seconds.
			(back to the
			people)
		He is going to give us a
		practical demonstration of
		what I feel safe in saying is
		a pretty exciting birthday
		present - and it better work
		or I'm out over two hundred
		bucks - so let's hear it for -

	Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open.
	It slams against the wall inside.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		- Benjamin Braddock!

<b>44	INT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY
</b>
	At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben,
	dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers
	on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the
	mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling.
	He holds a spear gun in his hand.

	The people applaud.

<b>45	EXT BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
</b><b>	SHOT - FROM BEN'S POV
</b>
	The people in the backyard.  His father stands just
	outside the screen door.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		Folks - this remarkable young
		man is going to perform for you
		some spectacular and amazing
		feats of daring in water that is
		over six feet deep -

	Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down.

	We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD
	down the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through
	the glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing
	apparatus in it.

	SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
	SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
	applauding and chattering noiselessly.

	We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock
	is running back and forth, clapping his hands and
	delivering his now soundless pitch.

	We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
	pool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool,
	motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He
	joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both
	begin to motion us toward them.

	We get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals
	us with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge
	of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us
	under.  He has a big smile.

	We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The
	figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask
	of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling;
	the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their
	fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding
	encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees,
	smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us
	under.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.

<b>46	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
</b><b>	OVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV)
</b>
	Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at
	the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking
	down into it.

<b>	PULL UP AND UP AND UP
</b>
	Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners,
	swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing,
	sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools.
	SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND
	of the WIND.

	Hold for a few seconds, then:

	SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING.

<b>								DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>47	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN
</b>
	In a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of
	the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.  Ben holds
	the receiver to his ear.  SOUND of PHONE RINGING.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		Hello.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite
		know how to put this -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		Benjamin?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Look - I was thinking about that
		time after the party -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		Where are you?

<b>				BEN
</b>		- and I was wondering if I could
		buy you a drink or something -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		Where are you?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Uh - The Taft Hotel.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		Did you get a room?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.  Now I know it's pretty
		late and if you'd rather -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		Give me an hour.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
</b>		I'll be there in an hour.

	SOUND of her HANGING UP.  Ben hangs up slowly.
	He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about
	uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and
	carrying it folded across his arm in front of him,
	leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that
	lead to the main lobby.  As he is about to go in, the
	doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming
	out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering
	to each other and helping each other out of the door and
	down the steps.  Ben holds one of the doors open for them
	and stands politely to one side.  As they get through,
	Ben starts to move inside.  At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG
	PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push
	him to one side and move past him into the lobby.  He
	moves back against the other door, holding it open and
	allowing them to go in first.  He smiles politely and they
	pay no attention to him at all.  He follows them into the
	lobby.  They move toward the front desk and he moves with
	them.  One of the boys at the front of the group leans in
	and says something to the CLERK behind the desk.

	The clerk points across the lobby and says something to
	him.  There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some-
	where.  The group of young people passes by the desk
	and Ben moves in behind them.  He pauses at the desk and
	looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against
	the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the
	keys dangling suggestively.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		Can I help you, sir!

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?  Oh - no - I'm just -

	He points vaguely in the direction of the other young
	people.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		Are you here for an affair,
		sir?

	Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes.  He looks
	helplessly at the clerk.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		The Singleman party, sir?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh - yes.  The Singleman party.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		It's in the main ballroom.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Ahh - thank you.

	Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby.
	He puts on his jacket as he goes.  He gets to the entrance
	to the main ballroom.  He pauses at the door, looks in.

	What he sees:  People dancing, talking, sitting, etc.
	He turns back toward te lobby.  He stops.

	What he sees:  The room clerk scross the lobby watching
	him.

	Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom
	as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman
	affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.

<b>48	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	As Ben steps inside.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		Hello.

	Ben turns.  Four people stand in a row.  Official greeters,
	they are:  A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, AN OLDER MAN, AN ELDERLY
	LADY AND A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BOY, dressed formally and they
	are smiling with great determination.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Hello.

	It is the older lady who has said hello.

<b>				MRS. SINGLEMAN
</b>		You must be one of the Porters.

	She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it.

<b>				BEN
</b>		No - actually I'm not -

<b>				MRS. SINGLEMAN
</b>		I'd like you to know my sister,
		Miss DeWitte -

	MISS DEWITTE, who, from the looks of things, always has
	been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand.

				MISS DeWITTE
		How do you do?

<b>				BEN
</b>		How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

<b>				MRS. SINGLEMAN
</b>		- and my husband, Mr. Singleman -

	Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's
	hand.

<b>				BEN
</b>			(apologetically)
		Oh - sorry -

<b>				JEFFREY SINGLEMAN
</b>		Fine, thank you.

<b>				MRS. SINGLEMAN
</b>		That's Jeffrey, of course.

	Ben switches to Mr. Singleman's hand.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Of course.

<b>				MR. SINGLEMAN
</b>		I didn't get your name, sir.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Benjamin Braddock, sir.

	Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been
	holding.

<b>				MRS. SINGLEMAN
</b>		Braddock - Braddock?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes, but I'm afraid -

<b>				MRS. SINGLEMAN
</b>		I'll find your table in a moment.
		Braddock.  Not Braniff?  We have
		a Braniff.

<b>				BEN
</b>		No - actually I'm just looking
		for a friend.

<b>				MRS. SINGLEMAN
</b>		I'm afraid I don't understand.

<b>				BEN
</b>			(backing off)
		I'm not with your party - I'm
		sorry.

<b>				MRS. SINGLEMAN
</b>		Hey - I don't get it.

	Ben is backing out.

				MISS DeWITTE
		I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr.
		Braniff.

<b>				MRS. SINGLEMAN
</b>		Angela - please!

	Ben backs out of the ballroom.

<b>49	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
	Ben crosses the lobby, passing PEOPLE going in and out of
	the hotel.  He stops at the entrance of the Veranda Room:

<b>50	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	This is a large room with a bar and many tables along the
	windows that look out over the hotel grounds.  It is quite
	dark and cool inside and there are no more than a dozen
	people seated around.

	The CAMERA STAYS at the door as Ben walks into the room
	and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table
	by the window.

	PUSH IN toward Ben as he sits there.  MUZAK is playing.

<b>								CUT TO:

<b>54	ANGLE ON BEN
</b>
	In the door to the lobby in the b.g. is Mrs. Robinson.
	She pauses, looks into the room, sees Ben and starts
	toward him.  Ben is looking out the window.  He does
	not see her approach.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Hello, Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh.  Hello.  Hello.

	He rises quickly.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		May I sit down?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Of course.

	He pulls out a chair, for her.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Thank you.

	They sit down.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		How are you?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Very well.  Thank you.

	Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down
	at the center of the table.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		May I have a drink?

<b>				BEN
</b>		A drink?  Of course.

	Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand.
	The waiter pays no attention.  Ben looks back at Mrs.
	Robinson apologetically.

<b>				BEN
</b>		He didn't see me.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Waiter!

	For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede.  The
	waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them.  The waiter
	moves to their table.  The noise in the room comes back.
	The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I will have a martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Yes, madam.

	The waiter moves away.  Ben watches him go.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		You don't have to be so nervous,
		you know.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Nervous.  Well, I am a bit
		nervous.  I mean it's - it's
		pretty hard to be suave when
		you're -

	He shakes his head.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Did you get us a room?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Have you gotten us a room yet?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I haven't.  No.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Do you want to?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well - I don't.  I mean I could.
		Or we could just talk.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Do you want me to get it?

<b>				BEN
</b>		You?  Oh no.  No.  I'll get it.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Do you want to get it now?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Now?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well - I don't know.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Why don't you get it.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Why don't I get it?  Well -
		I will then.
			(he stands up)
		If you'll excuse me.

	Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby.

<b>55	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
	Ben walks to the front desk and stands there.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		Yes sir?

<b>				BEN
</b>		A room.  I'd like a room,
		please.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		A single room or a double
		room?

<b>				BEN
</b>		A single.  Just for myself,
		please.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		Will you sign the register,
		please?

	He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben.  Ben writes his
	name on the card and then stares at it for a moment,
	crumples it up and fills out a second card.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		Is anything wrong, sir?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?  No.  Nothing.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>			(taking a key from
			behind the counter)
		Do you have any luggage, Mister --
			(looks at registration
			card)
		Gladstone?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		Where is it?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		Where is your luggage?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well it's in the car.  It's
		out in the car.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		Very good, sir.  I'll have a
		porter bring it in.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh no.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		Sir?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I mean I'd - I'd rather not
		go to the trouble of bringing
		it all in.  I just have a
		toothbrush.  I can get it my-
		self.  If that's all right.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		Of course.

	Ben reaches for the key.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		I'll have a porter show you the
		room.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh.  Well actually, I'd just as
		soon find it myself.  I just have
		the toothbrush to carry up and
		I think I can manage it myself.

<b>				ROOM CLERK
</b>		Whatever you say, sir.

	He hands Ben the key.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Thank you.

<b>56	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Mrs. Robinson sits, patiently and calmly.  Her face betrays
	absolutely nothing as she stares ahead of her and sips
	her martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Mrs. Robinson.

	She looks up.  A waiter is standing next to the table
	with a telephone.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes?

	The waiter plugs the phone into the wall socket next to
	the table and hands her the receiver.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Thank you.

	The waiter nods and leaves.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>			(into phone)
		Hello.

<b>				BEN'S VOICE
</b>		Mrs. Robinson?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes?

<b>				BEN'S VOICE
</b>		It's Benjamin.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes?

<b>				BEN'S VOICE
</b>		Benjamin Braddock.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin -- where are you?

<b>				BEN'S VOICE
</b>		Can you look through the glass.

	Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the
	glass into the lobby.

<b>57	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - WHAT SHE SEES
</b>
	Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty
	feet away.

<b>				BEN'S VOICE
</b>		Can you see me now?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes, I can.

<b>58	INT. LOBBY PHONE BOOTH
</b>
	Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the
	glass door and, through it, Mrs. Robinson sitting in
	the Veranda Room.

<b>	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION
</b>
<b>				BEN
</b>		I got a single room.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		That's fine.

<b>				BEN
</b>		But there's one thing.  The desk clerk
		seemed to be a little bit suspicious.
		I mean - I don't know what their policy
		is - but -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Well - do you want to go up first?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes - I think that would be good.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I'll be up in five minutes.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well - goodbye then -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Isn't there something you want to
		tell me?

<b>				BEN
</b>		To tell you?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well - I want you to know how much
		I appreciate this - really -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		The number.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		The room number, Benjamin.  I think
		you ought to tell me that.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh?  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely.
		It's 512.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You're welcome.  Well - I'll see you
		later, Mrs. Robinson.

	He hangs up.

<b>59	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - SHOT - BEN
</b>
	He leaves the hpone booth and walks back into the main lobby.

<b>60	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
	As he passes the desk, on his way to the elevator, he starts
	to pat his breast pocket.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I've got it.

	The desk clerk looks up.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I say I've got it.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Sir?

<b>				BEN
</b>		The toothbrush.  I got it all right.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Very good, sir.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes.  Well - goodnight.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Goodnight, sir.

	Ben walks out of shot.

<b>60A	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
	Ben leaves elevator, walks down corridor to hotel room and
	opens door.

<b>61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Ben closes the door behind him and leans with his back against
	it for a few moments looking at the room.  The only light
	is that coming in the window.  Ben turns on the light switch
	on the wall near the door.  The room blazes with the light
	from three lamps and an overhead fixture.  He turns the switch
	off.  He crosses to the bathroom.  Ben steps in and turns on
	the light.

<b>61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Ben steps out, moves to the window.  We see the pool area
	through the window.  Ben closes the blinds.

61Cont.There is a KNOCK on the door.  Ben crosses to the door and
	opens it.  Mrs. Robinson moves to the bureau and puts her
	purse and gloves on it.  She looks at herself in the
	mirror for a moment then turns slowly, looking at the room,
	finally ending on Ben's face.  She steps toward him.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Well?

	He clears his throat and then he kisses her.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I'll get undressed now.  Is that all
		right?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Sure.  Shall I - I mean shall I just
		stand here?  I mean - I don't know
		what you want me to do.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Why don't you watch?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh - sure.  Thank you.

	She takes off her jacket.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Will you bring me a hanger?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		A hanger.

	Ben opens the closet door.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh - yes.  Wood?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Wood or wire?  They have both.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Either one will be fine.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Okay.

	He brings her a hanger.  She puts her jacket on it.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Will you help me with this,
		please?

	She turns her back.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Certainly.

	He undoes the zipper at her neck.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You're welcome.

	She turns and looks at him.  He backs away.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Would this be easier for you
		in the dark?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson - I can't do
		this.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		You what?

<b>				BEN
</b>		This is all terribly wrong.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin - do you find me undesirable?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.  I think -
		I think you're the most attractive
		of all my parents' friends.
		I just don't think we could
		possibly --

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Are you afraid of me?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No - but look - maybe we could
		do something else together,
		Mrs. Robinson - would you like
		to go to a movie.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin, is this your first time?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Is this - what?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		It is, isn't it?  It is your
		first time.

<b>				BEN
</b>		That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
		That's really a laugh.  Ha ha.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		You can admit that, can't you?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Are you kidding?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		It's nothing to be ashamed of -

<b>				BEN
</b>		Wait a minute!

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		On your first time -

<b>				BEN
</b>		Who said it was my first time.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		That you're afraid -

<b>				BEN
</b>		Wait a minute.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		 - of bring - inadequate -  I mean
		just because you happen to be
		inadequate in one way - 

<b>				BEN
</b><b>		INADEQUATE!
</b>
	LONG pause.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>			(starting to dress)

<b>				BEN
</b>		Don't move.

	He slams the bathroom door shut.  The light in the room
	disappears.

<b>62	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
</b>
	The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool
	and on Ben who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the
	pool.  Ben wears dark glasses, is deeply tanned, and holds
	a beer can in one hand.

	SOUNDS:  teenagers YELLING and swimming in nearby pools;
	a radio PLAYING rock and roll; a television set TUNED to
	a ball game.

	moves his head slightly.

<b>66	WHAT HE SEES
</b>
	Mr. Braddock is passionately stoking a barbeque fire.  Mrs.
	Braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some
	ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil.

<b>67	SHOT - BEN
</b>
	He rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool.  He
	climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a
	chair and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and
	goes through.

<b>68	INT. SPECIAL SET - TAFT HOTEL ROOM
</b>
	Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him.  He
	is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers.

	PAN WITH BEN as he walks across the room past Mrs. Robinson
	who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her brace-
	let and watch.  He moves to a chair and sits.

	He picks up a cigarette from an ashtray on a table next
	to the chair.  Mrs. Robinson moves in to Ben, kneels in
	front of him and starts to unbutton his shirt.

	He takes the cigarette out of his mouth.

<b>69	INT. SPECIAL SET - BRADDOCK DEN AND DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	SHOT - NEW ANGLE
</b>
	We now see behind Ben the door that leads from the Braddock
	den, in which Ben is sitting.  In the dining room, Mr.
	and Mrs. Braddock are sitting, having their dinner, looking
	through the doorways toward Ben.  Ben stands, crosses back
	to the door to the den and shuts it.

<b>70	INT. BRADDOCK DEN - NIGHT - REVERSE
</b>
	On Ben's back as he returns to the chair and sits.  A
	television set, facing the chair, is on.  Ben picks up a

	CLOSEUP Ben watching.  PULL BACK and we are in the Taft
	Hotel Room.  Ben is sitting on the bed, leaning against
	the headboard, watching the television set which is on a
	stand facing the bed.

	SOUND of the HUM of the test pattern.

	PULL BACK to a WIDE SHOT of the room, lit only by the light
	from the television set.  Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot,
	half dressed.  She passes between Ben and the television
	set and goes out of frame.  Ben continues to stare at the set.

	SOUND of a ZIPPER being pulled up.

	Mrs. Robinson appears again and passes the other way.

	SOUND of BRACELETS being put on.

	Mrs. Robinson passes back the other way again.

	SOUND of CLOTHING being put on and a PURSE being snapped
	closed.  Mrs. Robinson, now fully dressed and carrying
	her purse, passes through again and, without looking at
	Ben, goes to the door of the hotel room, opens it and
	exits.

<b>76	INT. BENS' ROOM - CLOSEUP - BEN - DAY

	SOUND of DOOR closing.  Follow Ben as he gets up and moves
	to the windows of what is now his BEDROOM in the Braddock
	house.  He opens the closed blinds over the window.  The
	sun is bright outside.  His bathing suit is on the window
	sill.  He takes the suit and puts it on.  He moves to
	the bedroom door, opens it and goes out.

</b>
<b>				BEN
</b>		- here - in the pool.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		Why?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well - it's very comfortable -
		just to drift here.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		Have you thought about graduate
		school?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		Would you  mind telling me then -
		what were those four years of
		college for?  What was the point
		of all that hard work?

<b>				BEN
</b>		You got me.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>			(trying unsuccessfully
			to control himself)
		Now listen, Ben.  I think it's
		a very good thing that a young
		man - after he's done some very
		good work - should have a chance
		to relax and enjoy himself, and
		lie around, and drink beer and
		so on.  But after a few weeks
		I believe that person would
		want to take some stock in him-
		self and his situation and start
		to think about getting off his
		ass.

	Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		The Robinson's are here.

	Mr. Robinson steps in beside the others.  They blot out
	the sun.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Hi, Ben.  What are you doing with
		yourself these days?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh - not too much.  Taking it
		easy.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		That's what I'd do if I could.
		Nothing wrong with that.  Hey
		Ben, Elaine's coming down from
		Berkeley soon.  I want you to
		call her up this time.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I will.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Because I just think you two
		would hit it off real well
		together.

	Mrs. Robinson steps in beside them.  (A long pause)

	Ben, halfway dressed to go out, in slacks, shirt and tie,
	sits in a chair.  The door opens and Mrs. Braddock enters.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Can I talk to you a minute?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Sure.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Benjamin?  I'm going to ask you
		something but you don't have to
		tell me if you don't want.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Well I'm going to ask you what
		you do when you go off at night.

<b>				BEN
</b>		When I go off?

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		You don't have to tell me if
		you don't want.

<b>				BEN
</b>		No, I do.  I want to tell you.

	There is a pause.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I drive around.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		What else?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Nothing else.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Well you don't drive around from
		midnight until noon the next
		day, Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh, no.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Then what do you do?  Do you
		meet someone?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Meet someone?

	She nods.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Why did you say that?

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Well this is your business,
		Benjamin.
			(she starts toward
			the door)
		If you -

<b>				BEN
</b>		No wait.  Wait.

	She stops.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I don't meet anyone, mother, but
		why did you say that?

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Benjamin, I'm not going to pry
		into your affairs, but I'd
		rather you didn't say anything
		at all than be dishonest.
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well, wait.

	She looks at him.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You think I'm being dishonest?

	She nods.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well why do you - why do you
		think that?

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Because I know you don't drive
		around for twelve hours.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh.  Well, I don't.  Shall I
		tell you what I do?

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Not if you don't want to.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I do.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		But I don't want you to make
		up something.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'm not.  But I'm - I'm not very
		proud of what I do.  I usually
		get kind of drunk.  I usually
		drive over to Los Angeles and
		go to some bars and get kind of
		drunk.  Then I take a hotel
		room.  So I won't have to drive
		home on the freeway.  I mean it
		kind of scares me to drive home
		after - 

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Goodnight, Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You believe me, don't you?

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		No.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You don't?

	She shakes her head.

<b>				BEN
</b>		But I want you to.  Please. Please
		will you believe me.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Wait a minute.
			(he pushes her
			hand away)
		Sit down a minute.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Will you please sit down a
		minute.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the bed and sits.  She reaches
	down to take off a shoe.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Will you leave that shoe on for
		a minute.  Please.

	She straightens up.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Now - do you think we could say
		a few words to each other first
		this time?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		If you want.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Good.  I mean are we dead or
		something?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Well I just don't think we have
		much to say to each other.

<b>				BEN
</b>		All we ever do is come up here
		and throw off the clothes and
		leap into bed together.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Are you tired of it?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'm not.  No.  But do you think
		we could liven it up with a
		few words now and then?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Well what do you want to talk
		about?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Anything.  Anything at all.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Do you want to tell me about
		some of your college experiences?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh my God.

<b>			MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Well?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson.  If that's the best
		we can do let's just get the god-
		damn clothes off and --

	She reaches for her shoe.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Leave it on!  Now we are going to
		do this thing.  We are going to
		have a conversation.  Think of
		another topic.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		How about art.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Art.  That's a good subject.
		You start it off.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		You start it off.  I don't know
		anything about it.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Don't you?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes I do.  I know quite a bit
		about it.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Go ahead then.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Art.  Well what do you want to
		know about it.

	She shrugs.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Are you interested more in modern
		art or more in classical art.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Neither.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You're not interested in art?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		No.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Then why do you want to talk
		about it?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I don't.

	Ben nods and looks at the rug.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Can I take off my clothes now?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.  Think of another topic.
		Tell me what you did today.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Do you really want me to?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes I do.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I got up.

	Ben starts shaking his head.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Do you want to hear it or not?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes.  But you might try and spice
		it up with a little originality.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I got up.  I ate breakfast and
		went shopping.  During the after-
		noon I read a novel.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What one.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What novel did you read.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I don't remember.

	Ben nods.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Then I fixed supper for my husband
		and waited until -

<b>				BEN
</b>		There!

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson!
		There's something we could have
		a conversation about.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Him?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I mean everything.  I don't know
		anything about how you - how you
		work this.  I don't know how you
		get out of the house at night.  I
		don't know the risk involved.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		There isn't any.

<b>				BEN
</b>		There's no risk?

	She shakes her head.

<b>				BEN
</b>		How do you get out of the house?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I walk out.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You walk right out the door.

	She nods.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What do you say to him?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		He's asleep.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Always?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin, this isn't a very
		interesting topic.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Please.  Now tell me.  How do
		you know he won't wake up
		sometime and follow you.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Because he takes sleeping pills.
		He takes three sleeping pills
		every night at ten o'clock.

<b>				BEN
</b>		But what about the noise from
		the car.  What if -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		The driveway's on my side of
		the house.

<b>				BEN
</b>			(smiling)
		We're talking.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		We're talking, Mrs. Robinson.
		We're talking.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Calm down, Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Now let's keep going here.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Can I undress and talk at the
		same time?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Right.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Now.  You say the driveway's on
		your side of the house.  So I
		guess you don't sleep in the
		same room.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		We don't.

<b>				BEN
</b>		So you don't - I mean I don't
		like to seem like I'm prying
		but I guess you don't sleep
		together or anything.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		No we don't.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well how long has this been going
		on.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>			(looking at the
			ceiling for a moment)
		About five years.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh no.  Are you kidding me?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		No.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You have not slept with your
		husband for five years?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Now and then.  He geats drunk a
		few times a year.

<b>				BEN
</b>		How many times a year.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		On New Year's Eve.  Sometimes on
		his birthday.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Man, is this interesting.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Is it?

<b>				BEN
</b>		So you don't love him.  You
		wouldn't say you -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		We've talked enough, Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Wait a minute.  So you wouldn't
		say you loved him.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Not exactly.

<b>				BEN
</b>		But you don't hate him.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		No, Benjamin.  I don't hate him.
		Unhook my blouse.

<b>				BEN
</b>			(unhooking her blouse)
		Well how do you feel about him,
		then?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I don't.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well that's kind of a bad
		situation then, isn't it?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Is it?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I mean it doesn't sound like it
		could be much worse.  If you
		hated him at least you'd hate
		him.

	She nods and takes off her blouse.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well you loved him once, I
		assume.  When you first knew
		him.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		No.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I never did, Benjamin.  Now
		let's -

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well, wait a minute.  You married
		him.

	She nods.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Why did you do that?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>			(taking off her
			stockings)
		See if you can guess.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well I can't.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Think real hard, Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I can't see why you did, unless
		...you didn't have to marry him
		or anything, did you?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Don't tell Elaine.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh no.  You had to marry him
		because you got pregnant?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Are you shocked?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well I never thought of you and
		Mr. Robinson as the kind of
		people who...

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		All right.  Now let's get to bed.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
		So how did it happen?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I mean do you feel like telling
		me what were the circumstances?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Not particularly.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Was he a law student at the time?

	She nods.

<b>				BEN
</b>		And you were a student also.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes.

<b>				BEN
</b>		At college.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What was your major?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Why are you asking me all this?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.
		Now what was your major subject
		at college?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Art.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Art?

	She nods.

<b>				BEN
</b>		But I thought you - I guess you
		kind of lost interest in it over
		the years then.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Kind of.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well how did it happen?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		How do you think.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I mean did he take you up to
		his room with him?  Did you go
		to a hotel?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin, what does it possibly
		matter?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'm curious.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		We'd go to his car.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh no.  In the car you did it?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I don't think we were the first.

	Ben thinks for a moment.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What kind of car was it?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Do you remember the make of the
		car?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Oh my God.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Really.  I want to know.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		It was a Ford, Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>			(jumping up)
		A Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a
		Ford!  That's great!

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		That's enough.

<b>				BEN
</b>		So old Elaine Robinson got started
		in a Ford.

	There is a pause.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Don't talk about Elaine.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Don't talk about Elaine?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		No.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Why not?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Because I don't want you to.

	She walks to the bed.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well why don't you?

	She pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his
	jacket.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I wish you'd tell me.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		There's nothing to tell.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well why is she a big taboo
		subject all of a sudden?

	Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well - I guess I'll have to ask
		her out on a date and find out
		what's --

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin, don't you ever take
		that girl out.

	Ben looks at her.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Do you understand that?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well look.  I have no intention
		of taking her out.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Good.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I was just kidding around.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Good.

<b>				BEN
</b>		But why shouldn't I?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I have my reasons.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Then let's hear them.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		No.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Let's hear your reasons, Mrs.
		Robinson.  Because I think I
		know what they are.

	She pulls the covers down.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'm not good enough for her to
		associate with, am I?  I'm not
		good enough to even talk about
		her, am I?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Let's drop it.

<b>				BEN
</b>		We're not dropping it.  Now
		that's the reason, isn't it?
		I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't
		I?  I'm not fit to -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'm good enough for you but I'm
		too slimy to associate with
		your daughter.  That's it, isn't
		it?  ISN'T IT?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Yes.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You go to hell.  You go straight
		to hell, Mrs. Robinson.  Do you
		think I'm proud of myself?  Do
		you think I'm proud of this?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I wouldn't know.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well, I'm not.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		You're not.

<b>				BEN
</b>		No sir.  I am not proud that I
		spend my time with a broken-
		down alcoholic!

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I see.

<b>				BEN
</b>		And if you think I come here
		for any reason besides pure
		boredom, then you're all wrong.

	She nods.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Because - Mrs. Robinson this
		is the sickest, most perverted
		thing that ever happened to
		me.  And you do what you want
		but I'm getting the hell out.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Are you?

<b>				BEN
</b>		You're goddamn right I am.

	He starts putting on his shirt.  She sits on the edge of
	the bed and watches him.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		That's how you feel about me.

	He nods.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		That I'm a sick and disgusting
		person.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Now don't start this.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Don't start acting hurt.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Don't you expect me to be a
		little hurt?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson, you stand there
		and tell me I'm not good enough
		for your daughter.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Did I say that?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Of course you did.

	She shakes her head.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Benjamin, I want to apologize
		to you if that's the impression
		you got.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well two minutes ago you told
		me I wasn't good enough for
		your daughter.  Now you say
		you're sorry I got that
		impression.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I didn't mean it.  I don't think
		you'd be right for each other.
		But I would never say you
		weren't as good a person as
		she is.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You wouldn't.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Of course I wouldn't.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the closet.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What are you doing?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Well it's pretty obvious you
		don't want me around any more.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well look - I was kind of upset
		there.  I'm sorry I said those
		things.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		If that's how you feel -

<b>				BEN
</b>		But it's not.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>			(smiling at him)
		That's all right.  I think I
		can understand why I'm disgusting
		to you.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh no.  Look - I like you.  I
		wouldn't keep coming here if
		I didn't like you.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		But if it's sickening for you -

<b>				BEN
</b>		It's not!  I enjoy it!  I look
		forward to it.  It's the one
		thing I have to look forward
		to.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		You don't have to say that.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well I wouldn't.  I would never
		say it if it wasn't true.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		May I stay then?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes. Please.  I want you to.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well don't thank me, because I
		want you to.

	There is a long pause.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		But you won't ever take out
		Elaine, will you?  I want you
		to promise me that.

	There is another long pause.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Look.  Why the hell did you
		bring this up.  It never
		occured to me to take her out.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Then give me your word you won't.

<b>				BEN
</b>		This is absurd.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Promise me, Benjamin.

<b>				BEN
</b>		All right, for christ's sake.
		I promise I will never take
		out Elaine Robinson.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Thank you.
			(pause)
		Benjamin -

<b>				BEN
</b>		Let's not talk about it.  Let's
		not talk at all.

	At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each
	other, they begin to take off their clothes.

	Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking
	at the back of a cereal box.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock
	are there.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		Elaine's back from school.  I
		think it might be a nice gesture

	Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues
	eating and reading.

	Ben is lying on his bed.  Mrs. Braddock stands in the

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Don't you think that she's a

		Because I think she's one of

	Ben gives a small whimper.

</b>
	Ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the
	Braddock pool.  The sun shines down.  His diving mask
	is on over his eyes.  His face is in the water, looking
	down at the bottom of the pool.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock,
	in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around
	Ben.  During the entire conversation they continue to
	swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep
	their heads above the surface.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		It's pretty embarrassing.  I
		really don't know what to tell
		Mr. Robinson.  It's ackward
		and strained for me every time
		he suggests that you call up
		Elaine.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Next time he suggests it,
		I'll tell him I have no
		intention of ever calling
		her up in my life.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		I guess she's not good enough
		for you, is that it?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Look - Elaine Robinson and I
		do not get along.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		How do you know?  You haven't
		seen her since high school.  I
		guess your evenings, whatever
		you do with them, are just too
		valuable.

<b>				BEN
</b>		That has nothing to do with it -

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK
</b>		I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson
		that you're just too busy every
		evening - doing God knows what -

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		Don't go on like this.  Now if
		Benjamin absolutely refuses to
		take her out -

<b>				BEN
</b>		I do.

<b>				MRS. BRADDOCK
</b>		- then I'll simply invite all the

	He slides off the raft and goes underwater.

	The dining room is one tenth its normal size.  At a
	table for two are seated, jammed in against each other,
	the three Robinsons and the three Braddocks.  Elaine's
	back is to us.  Ben is at the other end of the table,
	facing us.  The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along
	the sides.  Mrs. Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is
	eating, looking down at their places.  After a few moments
	Ben throws his head back ans starts to scream.  As he
	continues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs.
	Robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up.

	Ben surfaces and pulls himself up on the side of the

	The door opens.  Mr. Robinson stands there with a huge

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		Well, Braddock - it's about

		Come on in.  I'm afraid the

	Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.  Mrs. Robinson is
	sitting there.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Hello.

<b>				MR. ROBINSON
</b>		What would you say to a short one?
		Bourbon still your drink?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes.

	Mr. Robinson hands him drink.

</b>
<b>102	EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	SHOT - BEN AND ELAINE in Ben's car.  From the back.  Ben
	leans forward slightly, pushing the car recklessly in
	and out of the traffic.  Ben is wearing dark glasses.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		You're living at home now.  Is
		that right?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Do you know what you're going
		to do?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Are you going to graduate school?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.

	He leans on the HORN.  The car directly ahead of him
	does not move to the right.  Ben jerks his car over to the
	right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn
	down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the
	driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him.
	Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Do you always drive like this?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes.

</b>		I'd love some.

	A waiter moves forward toward them.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Bring a menu.

<b>				WAITER #2
</b>		Dinner for two, sir?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.  Just for her.

	The waiter moves away.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Aren't you eating?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Why not?

<b>				BEN
</b>		If it's all right with you,

	Ben and Elaine walking on the strip.

<b>105	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT
</b>
	Ben pushes through the people crowded in around the
	entrance.  Without turning around, he waits for Elaine
	who has difficulty following him.  As she gets to him,
	he starts forward again.  He starts up the stairs.
	Elaine is just behind him.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>106	INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT
</b>
	Seedy, ugly, three quarters filled.  A tuxedoed HOOD leads
	them through the tables to a table directly under the stage
	on which a STRIPPER is in the process of removing her
	dress.  There is one chair facing the stage, the other with
	its back to and up against the stage.  Ben sits down in
	the chair facing the stage.  Elaine stands for a moment,
	unsure.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Sit down.

	Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage.
	She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them.
	Ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and
	puts them on.  The two chairs are slightly angled toward
	each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without
	looking directly at Elaine.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Why don't you watch the show?

	The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Benjamin - do you dislike me
		for some reason?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No - why should I?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I don't know.

<b>107	SHOT - ACROSS BEN - THE STRIPPER
</b>
	She is down to a tasseled bra and g-string.  She is
	twirling the tassels.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You're missing a great effect
		here.

	Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns
	back.

<b>				BEN
</b>		How do you like that?

	Elaine doesn't answer.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Could you do it?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		No.

	The stripper sees Elaine look.  The stripper smiles toward
	Ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she
	walks.  Ben smiles as he watches her approaching.

	The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair.  The
	spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's
	face.  As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield
	her eyes.

	The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it
	and holds it up in the air.  The music stops and a
	DRUM ROLL starts.  The stripper bends over Elaine's head
	and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in
	front of Elaine's face.

<b>108	SHOT - BEN
</b>
	He leans forward slightly to watch the action.  The
	swinging tassels are reflected in his glasses.

	The DRUM ROLL gets louder and faster.  The tassels
	swing more frantically.

<b>109	SHOT - ELAINE
</b>
	She pulls her hand down from in front of her eyes.

<b>110	SHOT - BEN

	With Elaine's face reflected in his glasses.

<b>111	SHOT - ELAINE

	Through Ben's glasses.  Elaine's face seen darkly but
	fully for the first time.  The tassels swing in front
	of it.  Tears start out of her eyes.

<b>112	SHOT - BEN
</b>
	He reaches up to remove the glasses.

<b>113	SHOT - ELAINE
</b>
	As the glasses come off and her face is seen in the harsh
	spill from the spotlight.  The tears are running down
	her face.  Only her eyes are crying as she looks straight
	at Ben.

<b>114	SHOT - BEN
</b>
	With his glasses off, he watches her.  He reaches forward
	and puts his hand in the way of the tassels.

<b>				STRIPPER
</b>		Hey!

	Some of the customers start to boo.  Ben rises, takes
	Elaine's arm and leads her toward the exit.

	The entrance to the strip joint.  Elaine runs to the
	bottom of the steps.  The Sunset Strip sidewalk outside
	is crowded with people moving back and forth.  Ben follows
	her.  She pushes through the crowd on the sidewalk.  Ben
	catches her and holds her arm.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Elaine - I'm sorry.

	Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls
	her arm away.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Will you take me home now?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I'm sorry I took you in there.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I think I'd better go home now
		please.

<b>				BEN
</b>		But, Elaine -

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Where is the car?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I just want to tell you something.

	Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying
	to get her to look at him.  She keeps looking away.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I want to go home.

<b>				BEN
</b>		But could I just tell you this
		one thing?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		This whole idea - this date
		and everything.  It was my
		parents' idea.  They forced me
		into it.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Oh - that's very nice of
		you to tell me.

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.  What I mean is - that's
		why I've been acting this way.
		I'm not like this.  I hate
		myself like this.

	She starts to cry.  People on the sidewalk are looking at
	them.  She turns away from them.  Ben moves away from
	them.  Ben moves around in front of her.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Listen - could you stop crying,
		please?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		No, I couldn't.

<b>				BEN
</b>		But could you try?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		No.

	She brings both hands up to her face.  Ben looks at her
	for a few moments in agony.  Then, very determined, he
	takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from
	her face.  She looks up startled.  She starts to give a
	little cry but before she can he is kissing her.  She closes
	her eyes.

	He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side
	of her face.  He opens his hands against her face, freeing
	her hands.  Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang
	on.  After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly
	to one side.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Elaine -

	He starts to pull her head back.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Not here.  Not here.

<b>116	EXT. DRIVE IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine are sitting in the car in a drive-in
	restaurant.  There are trays hooked onto windows along
	side of both of them.  They are eating and drinking
	furiously.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I've had this feeling - ever
		since I've graduated - this -
		kind of compulsion that I have
		to be rude all the time.  Do
		you know what I mean?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Yes, I do.

	He looks at her.

<b>				BEN
</b>		It's like I've been playing
		some kind of - game - but the
		rules don't make any sense to
		me -

	She is watching him carefully.

<b>				BEN
</b>		- they're being made up by all
		the wrong people - no - I mean
		no one makes them up, they seem
		to have made themselves up.

	A car with a COUPLE OF TEENAGERS has driven up in the
	slot on their right.  Its RADIO is tuned into a rock
	and roll station and it is playing LOUDLY.  Ben leans
	across Elaine and speaks through the window to the
	kid behind the wheel.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Say - I wonder if I could request
		you to turn that down a little?

	The kid turns the radio up.  Ben and Elaine roll their
	windows up.

<b>117	SERIES OF SHOTS

	hand touching her shoulder.  It is very quiet.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Well - maybe I'd better go in.

	He nods.  They continue to sit there for another long
	moment.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Would you like to come in?  I
		could make some coffee.

<b>				BEN
</b>		No, I mean - I wouldn't want to
		wake anyone up.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		We won't.  Let's go inside.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Wait a minute.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Is anything wrong?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No - I was just thinking -

</b>		Of course there is.  Look -

	ONE of the CAR PARKERS passes them on his way out.

</b>		Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.

	Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the

				MISS DeWITTE
		Hello, Mr. Brannif.

	SOUND:  Car STARTING noisily.

	Ben and Elaine in his car.  He takes his hand off
	the ignition, jams on the accelerator and drives the car
	speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes.  He
	turns off the ignition and the lights.  He puts his
	head down on the steering wheel.  He lifts his head.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Elaine - I like you.  I like you
		so much.  Do you believe that?

	She nods.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Do you?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You're the first - you're the

	She takes his hand.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I mean my whole life is such a
		waste.  It's just nothing.  I'm
		sorry.  I'll take you home now.

	He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Benjamin - are having an

	He freezes with his hand still on the key.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I'm sorry.

	He turns off the engine.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I'm sorry.  That is not my

<b>				BEN
</b>		It just happened.  It was just

	She nods.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Was she married or something?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Yes.

<b>				ELAINE

	It is raining.  On the seat beside Ben is a package.
	From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift.
	Ben's right hand is on it as he drives.  The radio is
	playing.  Past Ben and through the windsheild as the
	Robinson house comes closer and closer.  The front door
	of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out,
	dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps,
	reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side
	and climbs in.  Ben moves the package over into his lap.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Drive down the block.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson - I have a date
		with Elaine.  We're going for

	Ben starts the car forward down the driveway.

</b>		Now it seems to me -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Listen to me very carefully,

		Elaine again.  Ever.  Those
		are my orders.  Is that clear?

	Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down
	the block.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson -

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		I can makes things quite unpleasant.

<b>				BEN
</b>		How?

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		In order to keep Elaine away
		from you - I am prepared to
		tell her everything.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I don't believe you.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Then you'd better start believing me.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it.  I'm
		asking you please not to wreck it.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Go home now.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I just don't believe you would do that.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him for a moment.

<b>				MRS. ROBINSON
</b>		Try me.

	There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression.  Then
	he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on
	his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package.

	TRACK WITH BEN as he runs up the street and up the drive-
	way toward the Robinson house.  Ben gets to the front

	Ben runs up the stairs.  He still carries the package.
	Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door
	to her bedroom.  She is wearing a skirt and slip and
	carrying one shoe.

	Ben turns and looks.

	Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house.

	Ben pulls Elaine around behind the open door.  They stand
	in the angle formed by the door and the wall as though
	they are hiding from someone.  Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS
	can be heard coming up the stairs.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Elaine - I have to tell you

	He holds her against the wall in the corner.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		What is it?

</b>		That woman -

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		That woman.  The older woman.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		You mean the one who -

</b>		Yes.  The married woman - it

	Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS can be heard coming down the

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		What are you telling me?

	The FOOTSTEPS stop.

<b>131	ANGLE - CLOSE ON ELAINE
</b>
	Back in the corner.  Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the
	crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder.  Elaine looks from
	Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her
	mother's eyes staring.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Please - will somebody tell me -

	She looks back at Ben, then back at her mother's face again.
	Mrs. Robinson's eyes watch her through the crack in the
	door.  Elaine looks away.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Oh - no.

	Ben backs up.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Elaine -

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Oh my God -

	Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben
	as possible, Elaine moves away from the door.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Please.

	Elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room
	then turns back toward Ben.  The tears are starting out
	of her eyes.

<b>				BEN
</b>		No - don't cry -

<b>				ELAINE
</b><b>		GET OUT!
</b>
<b>				BEN
</b>		Don't cry.

</b>		About an hour ago.

</b>		No.  She doesn't know about it.

<b>				MR. BRADDOCK

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.  Actually - she doesn't

</b>		We haven't.

</b>		Ben - this whole idea sounds

<b>				BEN
</b>		No - it's not.  It's completely

</b>		But what makes you think she

	Ben comes out of the door just as Elaine gets into a bus
	and the doors close behind her.

	The bus starts off.  Ben runs after it.  The bus gets to
	the next corner and stops for a red light.  Ben catches
	up with it, runs to the front door and knocks on the
	door.  The door opens and he climbs in.

	She is seated next to an OLDER LADY by the window immediately
	in front of the rear exit door.  She keeps looking out
	the window, almost holding her breath as she hears:

<b>				BEN'S VOICE
</b>			(getting closer as
			he moves past people
			toward her)
		Excuse me - I'm sorry - I
		wonder if I could get by -
		excuse me -

	There is a pause and then, immediately behind her:

<b>				BEN'S VOICE
</b>			(cheerfully)
		Well - how about this for a
		coincidence.

<b>175	NEW ANGLE
</b>
	Ben's face is right behind Elaine, between her and the older
	lady sitting next to her.  Ben is standing on the steps
	to the rear exit door.  Elaine continues to look out the
	window.

<b>				BEN
</b>			(leaning in a little)
		I was wondering where you were
		headed.

	Elaine doesn't answer.  The lady sitting next to Elaine
	takes a look at her, turns around and looks at Ben,
	then looks at Elaine again.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I'm meeting someone.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Ah.  Where?

	She doesn't answer.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Where are you meeting this person?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		At the Zoo.

<b>				BEN
</b>		The Zoo.  They have a pretty good
		one here, do they?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I've never been to it.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh.  Well, I haven't either.  I
		might just ride out there with you.

	Hold on them riding.

<b>176	EXT. ZOO - DAY

	Ben and Elaine are walking along in front of one of the
	outside animal cages.  Ben is walking a step or two behind
	Elaine.  He is darting glances to the right and left.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Is that him over there?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		No.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Where did he say he was going
		to meet you?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I thought he said by the monkey
		house.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh.

	She stops.  Ben stops.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Benjamin - I would like to know
		what you're doing here.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Here?  In Berkelely?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Well, I have this very pleasant
		room on Carter Street - and I've
		been getting to some classes -

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		But you're not enrolled.

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.  I just sit in.  They don't
		seem to mind.  They've been
		very congenial about it.

	She looks at him and starts to shake her head.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Benjamin - you're - I don't
		know what to say - you're --

<b>				BEN
</b>		Maybe we could get together
		some time and talk about it.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		- really incredible -

<b>				BEN
</b>		Here he comes.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		What?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I've got a real feeling that
		this is the fellow.

	Elaine looks.  A good-looking young man is striding
	briskly toward them.  It is CARL SMITH.

<b>				CARL
</b>			(waving)
		Elaine!

<b>				BEN
</b>		He certainly is a good walker.

	Carl strides up to them.  He takes the pipe out of his
	mouth and puts it in his pocket.  He reaches out and
	takes Elaine's hands.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Am I late?  I'm sorry.

<b>				BEN
</b>		We thought you said by the
		monkey house.

	Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben.
	Ben smiles.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		This is Benjamin Braddock.
		Carl Smith.  Benjamin rode
		here with me on the bus.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Glad to meet you, Ben.

	Ben steps forward and grasps Carl's hand.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Great meeting you, Carl.

	Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder.
	The three of them look at each other for a moment.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Swell seeing you.  Have a good
		time.

	Ben turns and starts walking back the way he came.  Carl
	and Elaine turn and go in the opposite direction.  Ben
	stops after a few steps and walks over to one of the
	cages.  He grips the rail with his hand and looks back
	at:

<b>177	SHOT - CARL AND ELAINE
</b>
	Walking away, his arm over her shoulder, his other hand
	gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks.

<b>178	SHOT - BEN
</b>
	As he watches them go.  His artificial smile disappears.
	The agony is such that he has to steady himself with
	his hand on the rail.  He turns his face away, toward the
	cage.  There is an animal in it, staring at Ben.  They
	look at each other.  There is a box - an automatic device
	with a recorded desciption of the animal - that begins
	to deliver its RECORDED MESSAGE.

	He runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place.
	He goes to the window sill, picks up an empty beer can,
	crosses to the bureau, opens a bureau drawer.  He crosses
	to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and
	takes a newspaper out of it.  He crosses to the chair and
	sits down.  He holds the newspaper in front of him.  It
	is hopelessly crumpled.  He gets up, crosses to the
	bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron.
	He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires
	to straighten it out with the iron.

	There is a KNOCK on the door.  He rises, puts the iron
	back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can,
	then back to the chair, sits down and holds the newspaper
	on his lap.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Come in.

	There is another KNOCK.  Ben crosses to the door and opens
	it.  Elaine is standing in the hall.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I want to ask you a question.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Come in.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		No.  I want to know why you're
		here in Berkeley?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Because - I am.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Is it because I'm here?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What do you think?

	Ben nods.

</b>		I said I think it is.

</b>		All right then!  Yes!

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Well, I want you to leave.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Elaine - I love you.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>			(looking down)
		How could you do that, Benjamin?

	Ben moves in behind her and puts his hand on her arm.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Do you just hate everything?
		How could you possibly rape
		my...

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I don't understand -

<b>				BEN
</b>		Did you say rape her?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		- how you - how anyone - could
		do a thing like that.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What did she say?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>			(holding his arm)
		Let me go.

<b>				BEN
</b>		You've got to tell me what she
		said.

	He touches her hair.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Why?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Because it isn't true.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I don't feel well.

	Ben pushes her down softly onto the bed.  He kneels
	along side her.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Tell me.

	Ben sits next to her and puts his hand on her shoulder.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		She said she was having a drink
		in the hotel with a friend.
		You waited for her in the parking
		lot and told her she was too
		drunk to drive home and that
		you would get her a room for
		the night.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Then what?

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Then you took her upstairs and
		you raped her.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Elaine - that is not what happened.

	She puts her hands on his shoulder.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Please let me go.

<b>				BEN
</b>		All right - but listen to me.
		What happened was there was
		this party at my parents.  I
		drove your mother home - then
		we went upstairs to see your
		portrait -

	Elaine tightens her arms around his neck.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Don't tell me -

<b>				BEN
</b>		- and when we got up in the
		room she starts taking her her
		clothes off - and -

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Benjamin - this is my mother!

<b>				BEN
</b>		- suddenly there she was without
		any clothes on - I mean really
		naked -

	Ben is almost lying on top of her.  Elaine screams - a
	long, loud scream.  Ben looks at her.  He leaps off
	the bed and runs to the sink.  He fills a glass with
	water and brings it to Elaine.  He starts toward the
	door.

	SOUND OF FOOTESTEPS on the stairway and in the hall.
	Ben goes to the closet, opens the door, takes a jacket
	from a hanger and puts it on.

	SOUND:  A KNOCK on the door.

				MR. McCLEERY'S VOICE
		What's going on in there?

	Elaine sits up and drinks the water.  Ben looks at
	her then goes to the door and opens it.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Oh - hello, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Who screamed?

<b>				BEN
</b>		It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Screaming isn't all right.  Not
		in my house it isn't.

<b>				BEN
</b>		It was just a visitor.  But it's
		all right now.

	Several BOYS are gathering in the hallway trying to see
	into the room.  Ben edges through the door into the
	hallway.

				MR. McCLEERY
		What did you do to her?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Look - she's all right.  She's

		she's okay now.

<b>				A BOY
</b>		Shall I get the cops?

<b>				BEN
</b>		What?

<b>				A BOY
</b>		I'll get the cops.

	He starts for the stairs.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Hey - wait a minute.  Now damn
		it - look.

	He opens the door a little way.  They all try to see in.

<b>				BEN
</b>		See - she's just having some
		water.  Now there's no need
		for the cops or anything.

				MR. McCLEERY
		All right, boys - I think you
		can get back to your rooms.  I
		don't think we'll have any more
		of this agitation.  Will we,
		Braddock?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No, sir.

	The boys start back to their rooms.  Mr. McCleery and Ben
	stand and look at each other for a few seconds.

				MR. McCLEERY
		I want you out of here.

	Mr. McCleery turns away and walks down the hall and starts
	down the stairs.

</b>		Mr. McCleery?

				MR. McCLEERY
		You heard me.  Out of here.

<b>				BEN
</b>		What for?

</b>		I'm sorry I screamed.

	Ben opens the suitcase.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Benjamin, when you came up here,
		what did you think was going to
		happen between us?

<b>				BEN
</b>		Elaine - right now I don't feel
		like talking much.  I'm sorry
		about everything but I think I'll
		just do this now.

	He stands, looking into the empty suitcase.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Can I just sit here while you're
		packing?

<b>				BEN
</b>		If you want.

	Elaine sits in the chair.  She watches him as he goes to
	the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer and puts them
	in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau.  He gets
	down on his knees and looks under the bureau.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		What are you looking for?

<b>				BEN
</b>		My belt.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Don't you have it on?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.  I have two.  The other one
		is the one I'm looking for.
			(he reaches under

		What's this?
			(he brings out a

		It's from my grandmother.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		The marble?

<b>				BEN
</b>		The belt I'm looking for was
		from my grandmother.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Oh.

	Ben takes the marble to the suitcase and packs it.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		What are you going to do now?

<b>				BEN
</b>		I don't know.

	He goes back to the bureau, gets some socks and underwear
	and carries them to the suitcase.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Are you going home?

<b>				BEN
</b>		No.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		Well - where are you going?

	He goes back to the bureau, opens a drawer, takes out
	some T-shirts and the beer can and carries them to the
	suitcase.

<b>				BEN
</b>		Elaine - you're going to have to
		stop asking me that.

	He packs the T-shirts, then carries the beer can back to
	the bureau and puts it back in the drawer, takes some
	ties from the drawer and crosses to the suitcase.  Elaine
	gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

<b>				BEN
</b>		I don't understand.

<b>				ELAINE
</b>		I don't want you to go anywhere
		until you have a definite plan.
