MOTHER: . . . at a car wash . . .
DIRK: What?
MOTHER: You work at a car wash, school never occurred to you?
BUCK: -- so basically you're gettin' twice the base, cause of the TK421 modification we got in this system here.
CUSTOMER: I don't know - do I need that much bass?
BUCK: If you want a system to handle what you want -- yes you do. See this system here. This is Hi-Fi. "High Fidelity." What that means is that it's the highest quality fidelity.
CUSTOMER: It's the price --
BUCK: I have this unit at home.
CUSTOMER: . . . really . . . ?
BUCK: Yes. But -- I've got it modified with the TK421, which is a bass unit that basically kicks in another two, maybe three quads when you really crank -- lemme put another eight track in so you can get a better idea what I'm talkin about --
BUCK: Hear that bass? It kicks and turns and curls up in your belly, makes you wanna freaky-deaky, right? If you get this unit as it is -- it won't sound like this without the modification -- and we do that for a small price.
CUSTOMER: Thank you for your time.
BUCK: No problem.
JERRY: . . . the fuck was that?
BUCK: Wha?
JERRY: Have I told you? Huh? Have I?
BUCK: What? I don't --
JERRY: Alright: A.) You play that country western-crap and no one's gonna buy a stereo. You throw on some KC and the Sunshine Band, a guy looks a particular way -- and you've seen the profile sheet -- you throw on some Led Zeppelin. No. Instead, you play this twingy-twangy, yappy-dappy music. What kinda brother are you anyway, listening to that shit?
BUCK: Hey, Jerry, look --
JERRY: No, you look. I gave you a job here because I thought your film work might bring some nice pussy in the place -- and it has -- but I can't have anymore fuck ups -- you dig?
BUCK: Yeah.
JERRY: Alright. Go unload the new 484's from the back room.
DIRK: I have to get back.
SHERYL LYNN: Once more.
DIRK: I have to get back to work.
SHERYL LYNN: Give it to me, Eddie.
DIRK: Don't make me pounce you, Sheryl Lynn.
SHERYL LYNN: Ohhhh-baby, baby, baby.
DIRK: I'll do it --
SHERYL LYNN: Promise?
DIRK: That's it.
DICK (OC): What?
SHERYL LYNN: You're so beautiful.
DICK (OC): Yeah . . .
SHERYL LYNN: Do you know how good you are at doing this, Eddie? Having sex . . . fucking me . . . making love to me?
DIRK: Everyone has one thing, y'think? I mean: Everyone is given one special thing . . . . right?
SHERYL LYNN: That's right.
DIRK: Everyone is blessed with One Special Thing.
DIRK: I want you to know: I plan on being a star. A big, bright shining star. That's what I want and it's what I'm gonna get.
SHERYL LYNN: I know.
DIRK: And once I get it: I'm never gonna stop and I'll never, ever make a mistake.
JACK: Hey. Eddie.
DIRK: Hello. Jack?
JACK: Yeah. You wanna ride?
DIRK: I'm goin' pretty far.
ROLLERGIRL: You remember me? Couple hours ago?
DIRK: Yeah . . . I remember you.
AMBER: Come with us, sweetie.
DIRK: Okay.
JACK: This thing here, I mean, you understand one thing and that's this: It costs. I mean, this stuff costs good ol' American Green. You got film, you got lights, you got sound, lab fees, developing, synching, editing -- next thing you know you're spending thirty/forty thousand a picture.
DIRK: That's a lot of money.
JACK: Hell yes it's a lot of money, but lemme tell you something else: You make a good film and there's practically no end to the amount of money you can make, Eddie.
AMBER: Have you seen Jack's house?
DIRK (OC): No.
JACK (OC): He'll see it.
ROLLERGIRL (OC): He'll see it.
JACK (OC): Eddie: You got ten, fifteen people around and that's just to make sure the lighting is right . . . shit, this is not an operation for the weak, and lemme tell you something else: When all is said and done, you gotta have the juice, you understand? I mean . . . you can work on your arms, your legs, workout morning, day, noon, night, the whole deal, but when it comes right down to it . . . what we need is Mr. Torpedo Area, y'understand? Mr. Fun Zone? Okay, let's say you got that: right? And You Do Got, Yeah?
JACK: I can go out -- tonight -- the reputation I got: I can find myself 15/20 guys, cocks the size of Willie Mays Baseball Bat: Do I want that? No. Do I need that? No. I need actors.
AMBER: Uhhh-ohhh . . . here we go --
JACK: -- Alright, yeah, I need the big dick, and the big tits -- that GETS them in the theater. What keeps them in their seats even after they've come? Huh? The beauty and the acting. If you're able to give it up and show the world: No, not just your cock. Fuck that. What I'm talking about is showing your insides, from your heart . . . you understand? Hey, Sure: GET THEM IN THE THEATER. That's one thing. I don't want 'em showing up, sitting down, jacking off and splitting on the story. I don't want to make that film. I wanna make the thing that keeps 'em around even after they've come . . . what happens when you come? You're done, you wanna split. My idea, my goal: Suck 'em in with the Just To See How The Story Ends. Sometimes we make these films, we wanna make people laugh a little, then get into it and fuck heavy: That's good and that's fine. But I got a dream of making a film that's true . . . true and right and dramatic.
DIRK: . . . Right . . . right . . . I understand.
AMBER: Don't listen too hard to all this, honey . . . it's just nice in theory.
JACK: It's a dream to be able to find a cock and an actor.
ROLLERGIRL: Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream.
DIRK: If you don't have dreams you have nightmares.
JACK (OC): Did you want a Fresca, Eddie?
DIRK: No thanks.
JACK: You're sure . . . ?
ROLLERGIRL (OC): . . . you're out of limes, Jack.
JACK (OC): Check in the studio fridge . . .
AMBER (OC): I'm going to bed.
JACK (OC): Good night, honey.
AMBER (OC): Good night, Jackie. Don't stay up too late. Good night, Eddie. I'm glad you came by.
AMBER: You're great.
DIRK: Thank you.
JACK: She's the best, Eddie. A mother. A real and wonderful mother to all those who need love.
DIRK (OC): She's really nice.
JACK: So what do you think . . . I think we ought to be in business together.
DIRK (OC): . . . yeah . . . ?
JACK: What do you think of Rollergirl?
DIRK (OC): She's . . . she's really great . . .
JACK: Would you like to get it on with her?
DIRK (OC): Have sex?
JACK: Yeah.
DIRK (OC): Yeah, I'd love to. I mean, yes. She's . . . she's really foxy.
JACK: Bet your ass she is --
ROLLERGIRL: You're officially out of limes, Jack.
JACK: I'll get you some more tomorrow. Come over here a minute. Sit next to Eddie on the couch there.
ROLLERGIRL: Here We Go! Are We Gonna Fuck?
JACK: Yes you are.
ROLLERGIRL: Oh, wait, wait, wait, then.
ROLLERGIRL: You ready?
DIRK: Are you?
ROLLERGIRL: Ohhh-yeah.
DIRK: Are you gonna take your skates off?
ROLLERGIRL: I don't take my skates off.
DIRK: Okay.
ROLLERGIRL: Don't fucking come in me.
JACK: Don't come in her, Eddie. I want you to pull it out and jack off, make sure you aim it towards her face.
ROLLERGIRL: Fuck you, Jack.
JACK: Towards her tits, then.
DIRK: Hi.
MOTHER: Where were you?
DIRK: Nowhere.
MOTHER: Shut up. Shut up. Where were you?
MOTHER: You see that little slut girl you see? Sheryl? Sheryl Lynn?
DIRK: Don't say that.
MOTHER: Does it make you feel like a stud to see trash like that? Huh? What is she? Your girl-friend?
DIRK: She's not my girlfriend.
MOTHER: She's a little whore and a little piece of trash . . . I know you're not the only one that she sees.
DIRK: What . . . what're you . . . you don't know.
MOTHER: I've heard things about her. That girl. Don't think I don't know what goes on when I'm not here . . . I wash your sheets, kid. I know she's been here. Or are you doing some other thing in there? With your music and your posters on the wall?
MOTHER (OC): Why don't you go to your little whore, Sheryl Lynn. Your little GIRLFRIEND.
DIRK (OC): Maybe I will.
MOTHER (OC): Oh yeah? Yeah, what are you gonna do?
DIRK (OC): I dunno, I'll do something.
MOTHER: You can't do anything. You're a loser. You'll always be a loser -- you couldn't even finish high school because you were too stupid -- so what are you gonna do?
DIRK: I'll do something . . . I'll do it. I'll go somewhere and do something, maybe I'll run away where you can never find me.
MOTHER: Go ahead. Go ahead and fuck that little GIRL.
MOTHER: What do you think you're doing?
DIRK: I'm getting my stuff --
MOTHER: -- you think that's your stuff? That's not your stuff . . . you didn't pay for that -- it's not yours because you didn't pay for it, stupid.
MOTHER: None of this stuff is yours. This:
MOTHER (OC): If you're gonna leave, you leave with what you've got: Nothing. Y'see . . . you treat me like this and this is what you get. That's fair. Huh? You wanna live that way? Fuck that little whore. I've taken care of you all your miserable fucking life . . . .
MOTHER (OC): . . . you pay for it . . . you owe me for all the shit I've done for you in your life . . . . you little fucker . . . you understand? Think you're gonna be this? Huh? These god damn posters -- you're not gonna be this -- you're gonna be shit . . . because you're stupid.
DIRK: I'm not stupid.
MOTHER: Yes you are.
DIRK: Why are you so mean to me? You're my mother . . .
MOTHER: Not by choice.
DIRK: Don't. Don't be mean to me.
MOTHER: You little fucker, I'm not being mean to you, you're just too stupid to see.
DIRK: You don't know what I can do. You don't know what I can do or what I'm gonna do or what I'm gonna be. You don't know. I'm good. I have good things that you don't know and I'm gonna be something -- you -- You Don't Know And You'll See.
MOTHER: You can't do anything. You'll never do anything --
DIRK: Don't be mean to me.

LITTLE BILL: I work with these people, alright? These are my coworkers, so just --
LITTLE BILL'S WIFE: Bite it.
LITTLE BILL: Don't make me do something.
LITTLE BILL'S WIFE: Ohhh . . . I'm so scared.
ROLLERGIRL: What's wrong, Little Bill?
LITTLE BILL: Nothing. How are you, Rollergirl?
ROLLERGIRL: I'm fine.
LITTLE BILL: Is Jack around?
ROLLERGIRL: He's in the house.
JACK: The idea is this: Amber is a director of porno films and she's down on her luck. She hasn't had a hit in a year. She's desperate. Her landlord is threatening to kick her out, so she's desperate for a big dick hit, right?
COLONEL: Yes. Good dilemma.
JACK: Yes. So she calls up all the agencies in town and says: "Send over your best actors, I'm casting a porno picture." Well, the story goes and develops with Amber auditioning various men and women . . . the whole thing wraps up with the Landlord, I'd like to get Jeremy if he's still in town to play the part -- he comes in -- the landlord says: You better pay rent or you're through. Well, Amber does one helluva suck job, ass fuck, come in the face, sort of thing and fade out - the end.
COLONEL: That's great.
JACK: There's a kid, a young man, I met him last night: His name is Eddie Adams. He's here, he's at the party. He's something special and I want to cast him.
COLONEL: What films has he done?
JACK: This would be his first.
COLONEL: Casting is up to you, Jack. You wanna do it? Then do it. If it has big tits, tight pussy and focus: I'm happy. You tell the stories you wanna tell, make yourself happy.
REED: Do a cannonball.
DIRK: No, no. Watch this Jacknife.
DIRK: How did it look?
REED: Great. Check this out. (gets on the board) This is gonna be a full-flip.
REED: Ouch.
DIRK: You gotta try and bring your legs all the way around . . . .
REED: Yeah.
LITTLE BILL: How you doin', Rocky?
ROCKY: Good, good, what's wrong?
LITTLE BILL: Nothin'. Nothin' at all.
ROCKY: Do you have the schedule for the shoot, or . . . ?
LITTLE BILL: Yeah. You're on.
ROCKY: Is it here?
LITTLE BILL: Yeah, it's gonna be here, but it's a simple one . . .
MAURICE: Hey, hey, hey, my point is this:
BUCK: What?
MAURICE: You know what I say?
BUCK: What-What?
MAURICE: Wear What You Dig.
MAURICE: Hello? (beat) I'm sorry . . . I can't hear you that well . . . say again . . . ? Maggie? (to Buck) Is there a Maggie here?
BUCK: I don't know a Maggie.
MAURICE: (into phone) I think you might have the wrong number . . . .
MAURICE: Watch that a minute . . . .
MAURICE: (calls out) Is there a Maggie here?
MAURICE: (into phone) I'm sorry . . . there's no Maggie here. Okay . . . okay . . . no problem . . . Bye.
BUCK: What was it?
MAURICE: Some kid lookin' for his mother.
LITTLE BILL: . . . the fuck are you doing?

LITTLE BILL'S WIFE: Shut up, Bill.
WATCHER #2: Yeah, shut up, Bill.
KURT LONGJOHN: Little Bill.
LITTLE BILL: Hey. Kurt. What's up?
KURT LONGJOHN: What's wrong with you?
LITTLE BILL: Ah . . . my fuckin' wife, man, she's over there . . . she's got some idiot's dick in her, people standing around watching -- it's a fuckin' embarrassment.
KURT LONGJOHN: Yeah. Yeah. I know. Anyway, listen:
LITTLE BILL: -- yeah.
KURT LONGJOHN: For the shoot -- I wanna talk about the look. I wanted to see about getting this new zoom lens . . .
LITTLE BILL: Right.
KURT LONGJOHN: I wondered if we'd be able to look into getting some more lights, too, y'know --
LITTLE BILL: Jack wants a minimal-thing --
KURT LONGJOHN: Right, well, very often, minimal means a lot more photographically than I think, well . . . then I think most people understand . . .
LITTLE BILL: I understand.
KURT LONGJOHN: No, no. Hey. I know you understand, I was talking about some other people.
LITTLE BILL: Well, I think what Jack is talking about is minimal, not really "natural," but minimal . . .
KURT LONGJOHN: OK . . . fine . . . I was just saying . . .
LITTLE BILL: I understand --
KURT LONGJOHN: -- 'cause I'm just trying to give each picture it's own look --
LITTLE BILL: Can we talk about this later?
KURT LONGJOHN: Oh, yeah . . . you have to go somewhere . . . or . . . ?
LITTLE BILL: Well, no, yeah . . . I mean . . .
KURT LONGJOHN: 'Cause I was hoping to, y'know, for the shoot tomorrow, we could send Rocky down and he could pick it up --
LITTLE BILL: Kurt.
KURT LONGJOHN: No. Hey. Gotcha. You've gotta go somewhere so -- hey -- what the fuck? It's only the photography of the movie we're talkin' about --
LITTLE BILL: Are you givin' me shit, Kurt?
KURT LONGJOHN: NO, NO, HEY. No way, Little Bill.
LITTLE BILL: My fucking wife has a cock in her ass over in the driveway, alright? I'm sorry if my thoughts aren't with the photography of the film we're shooting tomorrow, Kurt, OK?
KURT LONGJOHN: OK. No big deal. Sorry.
LITTLE BILL: Alright?
KURT LONGJOHN: Gotcha.
YOUNG STUD: I think she's sick.
COLONEL: What the fuck is this?
YOUNG STUD: I didn't do anything.
JACK: Is she breathing?
YOUNG STUD: I don't know. I think she did too much coke?
COLONEL: Duh. Do you think so, smarty?
LIMO DRIVER: She's definitely overdosing.
COLONEL: Oh . . . what the fuck . . . .
COLONEL: Alright: Johnny. You're gonna take care of this for me. You listening here?
LIMO DRIVER: Yeah.
COLONEL: I want you to pick her up, get her in the car, take her down to St. Joe's.
LIMO DRIVER: Okay.
COLONEL: Listen, though: You drop her off in the front, I don't want this . . . y'understand? I don't need this, here.
LIMO DRIVER: Gotcha.
COLONEL: Make sure no one sees the limo.
LIMO DRIVER: Got it.
COLONEL: Young Stud, I want you to help my driver Johnny here get her in the car.
COLONEL: (to Jack) What the fuck is this? (to Young Stud) Hey . . . hey . . . pal . . . get a grip, man.
YOUNG STUD: I'm sorry . . . it's just . . . it's just . . . .

DIRK: Nice to meet you.
REED (OC): You wanna take a seat, Scotty?
SCOTTY J.: Uh . . . I dunno . . . is it alright?
REED (OC): Yeah.
SCOTTY J.: Thank you. It gets a little hard mingling around . . . y'know . . . talking to people and stuff . . . it's sort of -- That kid Eddie is really good looking, huh?
JACK: This young man is interested in the business.
COLONEL: Well, you're in good hands if you get involved with Jack, here.
DIRK: Oh yeah?
COLONEL: I can't give you much advice that Jack probably doesn't know, but I can advise, maybe you think about your name . . . ?
DIRK: My name . . . yeah . . . ?
COLONEL: Think about something that makes you happy, something that also gives some pizzaz . . . y'know?
DIRK: Right.
JACK: The Colonel pays for all our films, Eddie. He's an important parts of the process.
DIRK: Well, great. Great.
COLONEL: I look forward to seeing you in action. Jack says you've got a great big cock.
DIRK: . . . um . . . yeah, I dunno, I guess?
COLONEL: Can I see it?
DIRK: Really?
COLONEL: Please.
COLONEL: Thank you, Eddie.
DIRK: No problem.
COLONEL: Jesus Christ. Jesus Lord in Heaven.
LITTLE BILL: Thanks for fucking up this party for me. I appreciate it.
LITTLE BILL'S WIFE: Oh Fuck Off. Will You?
LITTLE BILL: You Fuck Off.
LITTLE BILL'S WIFE: Yeah, right.
LIMO DRIVER: Hey, hey, hey. I mean: How were you supposed to know?
YOUNG STUD: I wasn't.
LIMO DRIVER: That's right. So what did you do wrong?
YOUNG STUD: Nothing?
LIMO DRIVER: Nothing is absolutely right, Young Stud.
YOUNG STUD: Thank you for your help.
LIMO DRIVER: No problem.
COLONEL: You ready, Johnny?
LIMO DRIVER: Yes, sir.
COLONEL: How you doin', pal?
YOUNG STUD: I'm okay, sir.
COLONEL: Don't worry about it. She'll be fine.
YOUNG STUD: She died in the limo on the way to the hospital.
COLONEL: I didn't hear that.
YOUNG STUD: What?
COLONEL: You never told me that and what happened, never happened. You got me?
YOUNG STUD: I get you.
COLONEL: Now go home. Sleep it off.
JACK: Thanks for coming, Colonel.
COLONEL: Great party, Jack.
REED: . . . you wanna hear a poem I wrote?
DIRK: Yeah.
REED: Okay. Um . . . "I love you. You love me. Going down the Sugar Tree. We'll go down the Sugar Tree. And See Lots of Bees. Playing. Playing. The bees won't sting. 'Cause you love me."
DIRK: That's fucking great, man.
JACK: Howdy-boys.
DIRK/REED: Hey, Jack.
JACK: Good party?
DIRK: It was great.
JACK: Good. You had a good time then?
DIRK: Excellent time. Thank you.
JACK: What this place is for, right?
REED: Right.
JACK: Ahhhh . . . this feels good. Bubbles. Turn those bubbles higher, Reed.
JACK: Yeah?
DIRK: I was wondering if you had any ideas.
JACK: I've got a few . . . but you tell me . . .
DIRK: Well . . . my idea was . . . y'know . . . I want a name . . . I want it so it can cut glass . . . y'know . . . razor sharp.
JACK: Tell me.
DIRK: When I close my eyes . . . I see this thing, a sign . . . I see this name in bright blue neon lights with a purple outline. And this name is so bright and so sharp that the sign -- it just blows up because the name is so powerful . . . .
DIRK (OC): It says, "Dirk Diggler."
JACK: Heaven sent you here to this place, Dirk Diggler. You've been blessed.
JACK: How close?
KURT LONGJOHN: Give me twenty to thirty. I've got a couple tough shadows to deal with --
JACK: Okay, but not too long, Kurt, right? Remember, there are shadows in real life.
LITTLE BILL: You wanna go over this?
JACK: Yeah. Let's . . . .
LITTLE BILL: (reading from script) Okay. Set up is . . . here we go: 1.) Amber talking to Becky about auditions. They make the phone call to the agency to send over some actors. 2.) Enter Reed to audition for Amber. They go at it. Becky just watches. C.) Becky goes to the bathroom to jack-off and is interrupted by Amber. They get into it. E.) Enter Dirk -- (looks up) Who's Dirk Diggler?
JACK: The kid, Eddie, from the club.
LITTLE BILL: Good name. Anyway: 4.) Dirk enters. Meets with Becky. They go at it --
JACK: I wanna change that -- that should be Amber. Dirk should be auditioning with Amber.
JACK: Becky, honey --
BECKY: What?
JACK: What're you doing? We're shooting in twenty minutes.
BECKY: I'm shaving my bush --
JACK: Now?
BECKY: It only takes two seconds, Jack.
JACK: Fine, fine.
JACK: Alright everyone, let's go, let's go, we need to shoot this first scene -- we need to get one off --
SCOTTY J.: Hey. Hi. Dirk. Dirk Diggler.
DIRK: Hi.
SCOTTY J.: I'm supposed to come get you. Tell you they're ready, now.
DIRK: Okay.
SCOTTY J.: You look really good.
DIRK: Thank you.
SCOTTY J.: You look really sexy.
DIRK: Thanks.
SCOTTY J.: I like your name.
DIRK: You do.
SCOTTY J.: It's really cool.
DIRK: Thanks.
SCOTTY J.: OK . . . well . . . whenever you're ready . . . I'll see you out there.
JACK: Ready, champ?
DIRK: Let's do this.
JACK: So we know the scene, we know the thing. You're gonna start outside the set, through that door, I'll call your name and action, that'll be your cue . . . come through the door, straight to the desk, right here, boom, you and Amber do the scene --
DIRK: Do we go straight into having sex?
JACK: Is that alright?
DIRK: It would be better I think, y'know, so we don't break up the momentum or something --
JACK: Amber?
AMBER: Good.
JACK: So we'll just go straight through.
DIRK: Okay.
KURT LONGJOHN: Are we doing a rehearsal?
JACK: Eddie, you want a rehearsal?
DIRK: It's okay . . . I can do it . . .
JACK: Great.
DIRK: Jack?
JACK: Yeah?
DIRK: . . . can you . . . um . . . will you call me Dirk Diggler from now on?
JACK: Yes. I'm sorry, yeah, yes.
AMBER: Do you want to practice your lines with me?
DIRK: I know it.
AMBER: You look great, honey.
DIRK: Does he want me to keep going until I come?
AMBER: Yeah. You just come when you're ready . . .
DIRK: Where should I come?
AMBER: Where do you want?
DIRK: Wherever you tell me.
AMBER: Come on my tits if you can, okay? Just pull it out and do it on my stomach and tits if you can.
DIRK: Yeah.
AMBER: Are you alright, honey?
DIRK: This is great. I'm ready. I wanna do good. I wanna do this good . . . let's try and do it really sexy . . . you want to?
AMBER: Okay.
JACK (OC): and . . . action, Dirk.
AMBER: Hello. Are you John?
DIRK: Yes, ma'am.
AMBER: Your agency recommends you very highly.
DIRK: I'm a really hard worker. You give me a job and I won't disappoint you.
AMBER: What special skills do you have?
DIRK: Well, I spent three years in the Marines. I just got back from a tour of duty.
AMBER: You're kidding?
DIRK: No I'm not. It got really hard being surrounded by guys all day.
AMBER: When was the last time you had a woman?
DIRK: A long time.
AMBER: That's terrible.
DIRK: But I'm back now and I'm ready to pursue my acting career.
AMBER: Well as you may or may not know, this is an important film for me. If it's not a hit, I'm gonna get kicked out of my apartment. My landlord is a real jerk.
DIRK: Really?
AMBER: Why don't you take your pants off? It's important that I get an idea of your size.
DIRK: No problem.
AMBER: I think that you have the part, but why don't I make sure of something . . .
AMBER: This is a giant cock.
JACK: Guys . . .
DIRK: Is everything cool?
JACK: Hang in there, everything's cool, I just wanna change the angle -- You're doin' great.
AMBER: You're doin' so good, Dirk.
DIRK: Does it feel good?
JACK: Okay -- we're back, we're ready -- action --
AMBER: You're amazing.
DIRK: You feel good, Amber.
AMBER: Are you ready to come?
DIRK: Yes.
AMBER: Come in me.
DIRK: What?
AMBER: Don't worry, I'm fixed. I want to come in me --
JACK: That was great.
LITTLE BILL: Yes it was. What do you want to do about the come shot? We could go to the stock footage -- get a close up --
JACK: It's not gonna match, we don't have a cock that big on film --
DIRK: Jack?
JACK: Yes, Dirk?
DIRK: I can do it again if you need a close-up.
JACK: What we can do is make it all one thing, right? You can go from being on top -- below and then move and shift to the side -- pump away there for a while, then --
DIRK: If she . . . Rollergirl . . . if you wrap your leg up around my neck. And over. Good. We can go right into Doggy Style.
KURT LONGJOHN: Is the movement of the waterbed a problem?
DIRK: Not at all, Kurt. Matter of fact, I dig it.
JACK: Jack Horner has found something special in newcomer Dirk Diggler. It's another stellar, sexual standout from Horner and Company. Diggler delivers a performance worth a thousand hard-ons. His presence when dressed is powerful and demanding . . .
JACK (VO): . . . when stripped to the bone, Diggler's more eruptive than a volcano on a bad day. Amber Waves ripe-cherry lips do a wonderful job of handling Diggler's wide load and Reed Rothchild's stiff biceps do a slapping good job with Becky Barnett's supple ass . . .
JACK (VO): . . . but it's Diggler that remains the standout in this film. It's easy to predict, after only two films, that's Diggler's suck-cess can only grow and grow and grow --
AMBER: Please let me talk to him, Tom. Please. I just want to say hello and that's all -- I'm not. I'm completely sober. I'm not -- Tom -- Tom -- Tom --
AMBER: I don't know what to do now.
MAURICE (VO): Dear brothers: I'm sending you a picture --
MAURICE (VO): -- this is my girlfriend. I had sex with her last night. Isn't she hot? I get chicks like this every night.
BUCK: If you were to open a business specializing in, like, Super-Super Hi-Fi Stereo Equipment -- forget it, you're in the money. I mean, there's no limit to the technology that's comin' out now --
AMBER: Really?
BUCK: That's a fact.
AMBER: So what's wrong with this radio?
BUCK: I think it's . . . uh . . . it's a wattage problem . . . yeah . . . we've got too many watts per channel going into the front two speaker . . . yeah . . .
JACK: -- what else?
DIRK: That's it for now. I mean: I look at this character Holmes has come up with -- and -- look -- I just --
JACK: Tell me.
DIRK: I don't like to see women treated that way. This guy he plays, "Johnny Wad," it's always about slapping some girl around or whatever. It's not right, it's not cool and it just . . . isn't sexy. It isn't sexy like it should be.
REED: We could make it more of a James Bond character. This guy that's world traveled.
JACK: I like that.
DIRK: Reed could play my partner.
JACK: I like this a lot.
DIRK: We could make it really good, Jack. Honestly. If you direct it . . . we could make a whole series, with a whole story. This is exactly what we've always talked about.
JACK: I know it. I know it.
REED: We should do this.
JACK: Alright. When we get back. We'll set up the typewriter and we'll see what we can come up with. I'll talk to the Colonel when we get to Vegas. But Dirk, you gotta work on him too, okay?
DIRK: Right, right.
JACK: -- if we don't put every element into this, it's just not gonna work --
DIRK: Exactly.
JACK: Now: What's this guy's name? This character? Do you know?
DIRK: His name is Brock Landers.
REED: His partner's name is Chest Rockwell.
JACK: . . . those are great names.
AMBER: And the award for "Best Newcomer" goes to . . . Yes! My baby-boy . . . DIRK DIGGLER!
COLONEL JAMES: . . . the award for "Best Cock" goes to . . . Here We Go Again . . . DIRK DIGGLER.
JESSIE: And The Award . . . for Best Actor Goes To . . . I've seen his movies and I can't wait to work with him, I can't wait to get that big cock in my mouth, my ass, my pussy or any which way he'll give it to me . . . Mr. Dirk Diggler!
DIRK: Wow. I dunno what to say . . . I guess. Wow. I guess the only thing I can say, is that I promise to keep rocking and rolling and to keep making better films. It seems we make filthy or something by some people . . . but I don't think that's true. These films we make can be We can always do better -- and I'll keep trying if you keep trying so let's keep ROCKING AND ROLLING.
JESSIE: You're hot.
JESSIE: Shot of Tequila, straight up.
MAURICE: Yes, ma'am.
JESSIE: (to Dirk) I've been in this place twenty minutes, just to get a seat.
DIRK: You alone?
JESSIE: Yeah. Just visiting L.A. Some people told me the food in here was really good.
DIRK: Good. No, it's not good. It's probably the BEST place to eat in Los Angeles. It's excellent.
JESSIE: I certainly hope so. I could die of starvation before I get something in my mouth --
DIRK: You said you were hungry --
JESSIE: Starving.
DIRK: Well, go ahead and feast.
JESSIE: Ohhh. It's true --
DIRK: What?
JESSIE: You're Brock Landers --
JACK: Good, good, it's close. Let's head trim Dirk's spin, lose Reed with the revolver and switch the main title card -- it should really fly towards camera --
ROLLERGIRL: Fuck it, fine, let's go.
DIRK: And around this corner is the big surprise. The main thing I wanna show you --
DIRK: Isn't it beautiful?
AMBER: You deserve this, baby.
DIRK: This is it -- this is the thing. This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life --
DIRK: So we solved the case and the women are safe --
REED: Just another day.
DIRK: That's right.
REED: C'mon, Brock. Let's go out and get some of that Saturday Night Beaver --
JACK: This is the best work I've ever done.
KURT LONGJOHN: It's a real film, Jack.
JACK: It feels good.
KURT LONGJOHN: You made it fly.
JACK: This is the one they'll remember me by, baby.
DIRK: Thank you.
BECKY: . . . right, right . . .
JEROME: Yeah . . . y'know . . . as far as I'm concerned, it's about love. Y'know? You love someone and how hard can the world be? I mean, people will come and go and so will problems, and ultimately, if you have love on your side and in your soul, whatsa problem gonna be that takes your attention away? Y'understand?
BECKY: I do . . . I do. That's really sweet.
JEROME: My name's Jerome.
BECKY: I'm Becky.
JEROME: Nice to meet 'ya, Becky.
BECKY: What do you do?
JEROME: I'm in the auto industry.
BECKY: Really?
JEROME: Yeah. I'm regional manager for "Pep Boys."
BECKY: That's great.
JEROME: You've got a nice smile, Becky.
BECKY: Thank you.
JESSIE: Because sometimes I feel like an outsider to the whole thing. Y'know . . . I see you and Amber and your relationship and I dunno --
DIRK: No, no, Jessie. You shouldn't feel like an outsider.
JESSIE: I know my tits aren't as big and I know my pussy isn't as tight as all the other girls in this industry but I still feel like I've got something that works -- I can paint, too.
DIRK: Yes. Yes. Yes.
JESSIE: I dunno. I was just never really secure. When I was a kid, I was never really secure with myself that much -- I guess that's why I try and act like I'm all care-free and everything.
DIRK: I know what you mean, sometimes I'm like, "What am I doing?" "What the hell is wrong with me?" Y'know?
JESSIE: I know, I know.
DIRK: But then . . . I think . . .
JESSIE: -- it's just fun. It's great.
DIRK: It is. It's the best. I mean, look: I couldn't be happier than where I am today, right now, at this moment.
JESSIE: You are so fucking awesome, Dirk.
DIRK: Who says you don't have a tight pussy?
JESSIE: I don't know. No one, I guess.
SCOTTY J.: So I was all, "What's your problem?" And he was all, "Nothing." So I was like . . . really . . . y'know . . . I was fuckin' pissed, Amber. So then I was all, like, "What are you gonna do?" Y'know? And he was all, like acting tough, y'know, with his friends around and stuff. So I was just all . . . like . . . "Forget it." And I walked away.
AMBER: Excuse me, Scotty.
FLOYD: The Colonel!
COLONEL: Floyd Gondolli, great you could make it . . . great . . . great . . . great.
FLOYD: How are you? You look happy.
COLONEL: I'm fine.
FLOYD: Meet Boys: Tommy and Pete. Meet Girls: Angie and Cyndi.
TOMMY/PETE/ANGIE/CYNDI: Hi.
COLONEL: Hello. Happy New Year.
FLOYD: These are the next stars . . . the real people in the world.
COLONEL: I think we should do that talk with Jack now, whadda 'ya say? Maybe iron this thing out before we start the new year . . .
FLOYD: Let's do it.
FLOYD: Tommy-Pete-Angie-Cyndi. Uncle Floyd is gonna split for a minute to do a little business talk.
DIRK: Hey, Amber.
AMBER: What are you talking about out here?
DIRK: Nothin'.
AMBER: Do you wanna come with me for a little while?
DIRK: Where?
AMBER: A surprise, surprise, surprise.
DIRK: Let's go.
JESSIE: Hey, Buck.
BUCK: Hey, Jessie, how ya doin'?
JESSIE: You sitting alone?
REED: Todd Parker.
TODD: Rockin' Reed Rothchild.
REED: You made it --
TODD: Yeah . . . yeah. This is an amazing party. Fuckin' chicks everywhere.
REED: You bet.
TODD: I wouldn't mind havin' some of that action over there --
REED: Want me to introduce you?
TODD: Sure. Introduce her to my lap.
REED: You got off work?
TODD: I don't dance Sunday nights. Who's Corvette is that out in the driveway?
REED: It's Dirk's.
TODD: That car is jammin' -- Nosed, Racked, Dual Camms, Ten Coats of Hand Gloss, Candy Apple Red Laquer -- WHOA.
BUCK: I'm pretty happy with it . . .
JESSIE: . . . It's a great look for you, I think.
BUCK: It's sort of original, I think.
JESSIE: Right.
BUCK: What were we talking about before?
JESSIE: Um . . . oil painting . . . ?
BUCK: No . . . yes, I mean . . . but we were talkin' about . . .
JESSIE: Oh! Oh! "Sunsets."
JESSIE: Sunrises are better.
BUCK: Exactly.
JESSIE: I thought I was the only one who thought that.
BUCK: I think that.
JESSIE: I never thought we'd have so much in common, Buck.
BUCK: Yeah, yeah . . . hey, have you ever heard of my stereo system?
JESSIE: No.
BUCK: Y'know I'm thinking of opening my own business --
JESSIE: Really?
BUCK: It's my dream. Hi-Fi Stereo Equipment at a discount price -- it's called "Buck's Super Stereo World."
JESSIE: That's a fucking great idea.
FLOYD: . . . so let's talk about the future. So let's talk about what video means to this industry -- and let's talk about how all of us -- not one of us -- but all of us will profit. I've been doing theater work in San Francisco and San Diego for as long as you've been doing stag and hardcore, Jack.
JACK: I know you're history, Floyd.
COLONEL: No one's doubting your history or your credentials, Floyd.
FLOYD: Then why the resistance? I mean: This industry is going to be turned upside down soon enough --
JACK: Then why help it?
FLOYD: Why not be prepared? The money comes from the Colonel, the talent comes from you, Jack. I've got a connection to the equipment and the mail order distribution, not to mention those kids I got out there who are hot-fuck-action to the max. This is the future. Video tape tells the truth.
JACK: I have a stable of actors and actresses. They're professionals. They're not a bunch of fucking amateurs. They're proven box office and they get people in theaters (where films should be seen) and they know how to fuck well --
FLOYD: That's right, Jack and by that same token, you're the one with the power here. The video revolution is upon us -- and our role is critical. We have an obligation to use our resources and talent to help make it fly --
JACK: You come in here, at my party, tell me about this and that -- tell me about the future, tell me about -- video and amateurs and all that -- well lemme tell you something now: I will not shoot films on video and no I will not loan out my actors who are under contract to me. Period.
FLOYD: Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man. I like cinema. In particular, I like to see fucking on film. I don't want to win an Oscar and I don't want to re-invent the wheel -- I enjoy simple pleasures like butter in my ass and lollipops in my mouth. That's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert, but this is something I enjoy. One other small thing I want to do in this life is make a dollar and a cent in this business -- I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you stay one step ahead of the game --
JACK: We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd.
COLONEL: Jack, I think this is about cost and future --
JACK: The future is as bright as we make it -- it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars that can be saved shooting on video tape -- if it looks like shit and sounds like shit, it probably is shit --
FLOYD: I think you're one gin past this conversation --
JACK: No . . . no. I'm crystal clear here.
COLONEL: Jack, please understand that this is not an argument . . . this is a fact of --
JACK: . . . What . . . ?
COLONEL: This is not an argument, but a --
JACK: What are you saying?
COLONEL: What do you mean, Jack, c'mon --
JACK: Are you telling me that you're working with this shit?
COLONEL: I think that there is a serious case to be made for the price and the gamble on the whole idea of a home video market -- Jack: Two, three years from now, everyone's gonna be able to walk into their local supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --
JACK: True film fans won't watch that shit. It doesn't look good and more importantly it doesn't make sex look sexy.
COLONEL: It doesn't have to look good, Jack. Film is just too damn expensive. The theaters are already planning converting to video projectors.
JACK: I haven't heard that.
FLOYD: It's true.
JACK: We've got ten minutes until the New Year and I don't want it to start like this so I'm leaving now. We will or we won't continue this conversation some other time.
AMBER: I wanted you . . . to just . . . to come in and give me a minute so I could tell you how much I love you. It's gonna be a new year and we're gonna start things and do things and I want you to know how much I really care for you, honey. I care for you so much . . . you're my little baby . . .
DIRK: Thank you, Amber.
AMBER: You're the best thing in the world that's happened to me since my son went off . . . and I just . . . I love you, honey.
DIRK: I love you too, Amber.
AMBER: Fucking 1980 . . . y'know? Can you believe it?
DIRK: I can't . . . it's like . . . next thing we know . . . it's gonna be 1990, then 2000 . . . can you imagine?
AMBER: Goodbye to 1979 . . . hello to 1980 . . . (handing him a straw) Make sure you snort it back quick and hard . . .
DIRK: . . . wh . . . ?
AMBER: Really fast, like this . . .
DIRK: It burns.
AMBER: It's good, though, right?
DIRK: It's in my throat . . . uch . . .
AMBER: It's the drip . . . the drip's the best part.
DIRK: Tastes like aspirin.
AMBER: Do one more in the other nostril.
DIRK: . . . I need a glass of water, I think . . .
AMBER: One more, then the water.
DIRK: Do I look cool when I do it?
SCOTTY J.: Hey, Dirk.
DIRK: Scotty. Hey. What's up, man?
SCOTTY J.: . . . fuckin' New Year's, y'know, right?
SCOTTY J.: Right. Did you see my new car?
DIRK: You got a new car?
SCOTTY J.: Yeah. Wanna see?
DIRK: Sure.
REED: Hey, Dirk, c'mere and meet someone. This is Todd, my pal from the thing --
DIRK: How are ya?
TODD: We finally meet.
REED: Remember I told you about Todd? He works over at the Party Boys Strip Club --
DIRK: Oh, cool, cool. You're a dancer?
TODD: Yeah, I got some moves.
SCOTTY J.: -- Dirk? Are you coming -- ?
DIRK: Yeah, okay, Scotty. (to Todd) I'll see you around. We can talk later.
SCOTTY J.: This is it.
DIRK: Cool.
SCOTTY J.: Wanna get inside?
DIRK: When did you get this?
SCOTTY J.: Yesterday.
DIRK: It's great. It's really great.
SCOTTY J.: Yeah, you wanna take a ride, or --
DIRK: Wait a minute, wait a minute, waitaminute . . . fuckin' hell . . . how much time left?
SCOTTY J.: Six minutes . . .
DIRK: Oh, shit! Let's get back inside, come on --
SCOTTY J.: I'm sorry, Dirk. Please. I'm sorry.
DIRK: . . . why'd you do that?
SCOTTY J.: You look at me sometimes --
DIRK: -- What?
SCOTTY J.: I wanna know if you like me.
DIRK: . . . yeah . . . Scotty.
SCOTTY J.: Can I kiss you?
DIRK: . . . Scott . . . I don't --
SCOTTY J.: -- Can I kiss your mouth? Please. Please let me.
DIRK: No.
SCOTTY J.: I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to grab you . . . I didn't --
DIRK: It's alright.
SCOTTY J.: . . . I'm sorry . . .
DIRK: . . . it's alright.
SCOTTY J.: Do you wanna kiss me?
DIRK: Scotty.
SCOTTY J.: No, no. Forget it. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, I'm just drunk. I'm outta my head, okay?
DIRK: . . . yeah --
SCOTTY J.: I'm just crazy, you know? Crazy. Right? I'm so wasted, drunk, drunk --
DIRK: You wanna go back inside?
SCOTTY J.: Do you like my car, Dirk?
DIRK: What . . . ? Yeah. Yeah.
SCOTTY J.: I wanted to make sure you thought it was cool or else I was gonna take it back.
DIRK: Oh.
SCOTTY J.: (to himself) I love you, Dirk.
LITTLE BILL'S WIFE: You should be taking notes, Little Bill.
ANOTHER YOUNG STUD: This is a fresh cunt, pal.
AMBER (OC): . . . what about your character, "Brock Landers," and what some people might consider violent attitudes towards women?
DIRK: violence . . . ? No, what? I mean, if there's something in this series of movies that's like action or violence or whatever -- that's the movie. Y'know? Look: I'm not saying that these movies are for the whole family, but they've gotalotta action and sometimes the characters are women who are -- say -- spies or drug smugglers or working for some organization that my character is trying to . . . defeat. We've made twenty of these films in the past of talk has only come up in the past year or so . . . I mean: What's the problem? So -- y'know.
AMBER (VO): If Brock Landers is slick with a gun, he does so only in the vein of good and right. Brock protects the values of the American ideal and fights for causes that instill pride in a society where morals are hard to come by --

Jack will put the final touches on what the camera needs for editing -- but, uh -- He allows me to block my own sex scenes. . . . and . . . he gives me flexibility to work with the character and develop, y'know . . . I don't know of any other directors that would let an actor -- uh -- do that.
JACK: I don't let you block your own sex scenes.
AMBER (OC): For Dirk Diggler, the future is something to look forward to, not to fear . . . He is a creative man of many interests . . . film, poetry, karate, music and dance . . . he is a man of passion and mystery . . . He Is A Man Of Lust.
AMBER: It's my poem to you.
DIRK: It's great. It's so great, Amber. You're a director now. Shit. Have you showed Jack?
AMBER: Just you. I wanted to show you first.
DIRK: It's so fuckin' good. Really. (beat) Maybe you might want to think about cutting that part when Jack says that thing about -- y'know --
AMBER: Blocking the sex --
DIRK: -- yeah.
JACK: How was it?
JACK: Hello? Colonel? Wait, wait, wait. Yes. Calm down. Calm down. Okay. Right Now -- Yes -- Right Now.
COLONEL: . . . she was fifteen . . . fifteen . . . I didn't know . . . Jack, you gotta believe me.
JACK: I believe you.
COLONEL: I told her not to do so much coke, but she wouldn't listen, she just kept doing it and doing it like she was a vacuum. Like she had a vacuum in her nose or something . . . . . . . next thing I know . . . she's got blood coming from her nose and . . . jesus . . . her, jesus --

JACK: Alright, okay. Don't worry.
COLONEL: I can't have this happen to me. I'm a good man, right?
JACK: Yes you are.
COLONEL: I didn't know -- I didn't know she was gonna die right there with me or I wouldn't have picked her up.
JACK: Right. You know; you've done nothing wrong. I mean, look; You were just there, right? You didn't . . . I mean . . . you didn't do anything.
COLONEL: They found something in my house, Jack.
JACK: What?
COLONEL: . . . something . . .
JACK: . . . what are you saying? What did they find?
COLONEL: . . . it's my fuckin' weakness, Jack. They're . . . so small and cute I can't help myself, Jack. I can't help it when they're so small and cute. I just want to watch, I don't do anything, Jack. I've never touched one of them . . .
JACK: Jesus Christ, Colonel.
COLONEL: You look at me like I'm an asshole, now.
JACK: . . . I . . . I don't . . . ?
COLONEL: I'm going to jail for a long time.
JACK: -- it's okay, Colonel. It's gonna be fine in the end . . . . I promise . . .
COLONEL: Are you promising me?
COLONEL: Take it back, Jack. Don't promise me anything. You can't help me. I'm done. I'm going to jail.
COLONEL: Listen to me, Jack: And I'm gonna tell you this for you. Am I your friend?
JACK: What?
COLONEL: Answer me, am I your friend?
JACK: Yes.
COLONEL: So remember that I'm your friend and listen to what I tell you now: Give in, Jack. You've gotta give. For you, for your business and your livelihood -- accept the future. Don't fight it, because you can't win. Look for the new blood, go to Floyd Gondolli, go to video, give up your battle -- the filmmaking is over, Jack.
JACK: Well there we go.
KURT LONGJOHN: Yeah.
ROCKY: Lot of stuff on there to learn.
JACK: That's it.
KURT LONGJOHN: No turning back now.
JACK: The future.
KURT LONGJOHN: That's right.
ROCKY: The quality is, uh --
JACK: It's not what we're used to.
KURT LONGJOHN: We can make it work, I think.
ROCKY: It's . . . potential . . .
KURT LONGJOHN: Yes.
JACK: You can't beat the price.
KURT LONGJOHN: No you can't.
JACK: This is the future and we can't deny it anymore because the past is too expensive.
KURT LONGJOHN: I'm scared.
ROCKY: Me too.
JACK: It's gonna make us rich.
KURT LONGJOHN: Yep.
ROCKY: It's a rather pretty thing, isn't it?
KURT LONGJOHN: We can still tell good stories, Jack.
JACK: No. It's about jacking off now, Kurt. No more stories . . . that's over.
BECKY: I do.
JEROME: I do too.
BECKY: They made Jerome regional manager of the new "Pep Boys," they're building in Bakersfield. We're gonna move there. Buy a house.
REED: That's great, guys. That's so great.
JEROME: It's gonna be a great opportunity to run the store my way. Y'know. Get those guys off my back and run the store my way.
JACK: . . . and it's tough is what I'm saying.
JOHNNY DOE: Right.
JACK: Hey, Dirk -- here you are. You havin' a good time?
DIRK: Uh-huh. (re: Johnny Doe) Who's this?
JOHNNY DOE: Hi . . . I'm Johnny Doe. You're Dirk Diggler -- it's great to meet you.

ENGINEER: Okay . . . Dirk Diggler Demo Tape, "You Got The Touch," take seven . . .
DIRK: Is the bass taking away from the vocals?
ENGINEER: Well . . . a little . . . but not really too much.
DIRK: Let's take down the bass and let's take up the vocals.
ENGINEER: So . . . what do you think?
DIRK: Well I think that . . . maybe we could speed it up a little -- it's --
ENGINEER: It's a ballad. I thought that --
DIRK: We'll just speed it up a couple octaves. . . . cause that might make it cooler, people like it when slow songs . . . y'know . . . when they're a little fast . . . it's cooler.
AMATEUR: Is he gonna fuck me in the ass?
JACK: Is that what you want?
AMATEUR: It would be nice.
JACK: Johnny: Fuck her in the ass.
JOHNNY DOE: Lock and Load, Jack.
JACK: Alright, friends; let's get it over with.
BECKY: Please, Jerome, don't --
JEROME: You probably liked those big cocks, huh?
BECKY: Don't --
JEROME: I'll tell you about a big cock -- yeah, you want my cock to be bigger, don't you?
BECKY: No, baby, please, please --
BANK WORKER: Mr. Swope?
BUCK: Yeah, that's me. Hello.
BANK WORKER: You have a copy of your loan application?
BUCK: Yes I do.
BANK WORKER: Good. You wanna follow me?
AMBER: I was gonna take a poetry class at Everywoman's Village --
ROLLERGIRL: Oh, oh. I wanna do that.
AMBER: We'll do it then. It's Monday, Wednesday, Friday at three.
ROLLERGIRL: Do you think I should -- I was thinking something?
AMBER: What?
ROLLERGIRL: I was gonna see about taking the GED. Do you know what that is?
AMBER: For High School, to graduate?
ROLLERGIRL: Yeah. It's like -- so I can get my diploma -- 'cause I feel bad that I never did it. I think you were right. I think you're right --
AMBER: You should do it. That would be great for you -- you know -- cause if you wanted, Rollergirl, you could do anything.
TODD: I'm back.
DIRK: Perfect timing.
MAURICE (VO): Dear brothers: Here's an example of me with women in Los Angeles. I sleep with women here all the time . . .
BROTHER #1: (in Spanish, sub-titled) Oh my God --
BROTHER #2: (in Spanish, sub-titled) -- it's so . . . so . . . it looks like a peanut.
BUCK: That's what Buck's Super Stereo World is all about -- the customer. People wanna know what they're getting into technically and I have the specific technical hi-fi background to answer any technical question that someone might have -- I've been into sound equipment for long enough to know what a guy wants when he walks right in the door -- and that's the personal touch that Buck's Super Stereo World is gonna have --
AMBER: I miss my two sons -- my little Andrew and my Dirk -- I miss them both so much. I always felt like Dirk was my baby, my new baby. Don't you miss Dirk?
ROLLERGIRL: Yeah.
AMBER: He's so fucking talented. The bastard. I love him, Rollergirl, I mean; I really love the little jerk.
ROLLERGIRL: I love you, Mom. I want you to be my mother, Amber. Are you my Mom? I'll ask you if you're my mother and you say, "yes." OK? -- Are you my mother -- ?
AMBER: Yes, honey. Yes.
DIRK: C'mon, man, c'mon, c'mon, alright --
MANAGER: I can't let you take the tapes until the bill is paid in full.
DIRK: That makes a lot of sense.
REED: Wait, wait, wait. How can he pay the price of the demo if he can't take the demo tapes to a record company?
MANAGER: That's not my problem. My job is to collect payment before we hand over the tapes.
REED: You can't get a record contract if the record company can't hear what you've got.
DIRK: OK: Wait a minute -- have you heard my tape? Huh? Have you heard it? I'm guaranteed to get a record deal because my stuff is so good. Once that happens, I'll pay you --
MANAGER: It's not gonna happen. This is a Catch-22, I understand. You're saying this thing and I get it but I just won't let it happen.
DIRK: A catch-what?
AMBER: I don't wanna do this anymore, honey. I can't. I just can't.
ROLLERGIRL: What?
AMBER: Have fun now, let's keep going and going and going tonight -- because it's over. There's too many things --
ROLLERGIRL: Okay. Okay.
AMBER: Let's go walk.
ROLLERGIRL: I don't wanna leave the room.
AMBER: Me either. OHHHHHHH. I love you, honey.
ROLLERGIRL: I love you, Mom.
BANK WORKER: Mr. Swope . . . we can't help you.
BUCK: . . . I have all the papers, all the things in order, yes? I mean, it's all --
BANK WORKER: Yes. But we can't give you a loan. I'm sorry.
BUCK: . . . why . . . ?
BANK WORKER: . . . Mr. Swope: You're a pornographer. And this bank is not in business to support pornography --
BUCK: I'm not a pornographer, I'm an actor.
BANK WORKER: I'm sorry.
BUCK: No, no, no, please. This is . . . this is a new business for me, a real thing that I want to do and a real thing that I can do, please, I mean -- this is not a joke --
BANK WORKER: I'm sorry.
BUCK: Please, now, please, just wait one minute here -- because there's gotta be some way --
BANK WORKER: . . . I'm sorry . . .
BUCK: Well this is not fair --
BANK WORKER: This financial institution can't endorse pornography, you've got to understand --
BUCK: I'm an actor.
BANK WORKER: Please. Now I'm sorry.
OFFICER: Jack Horner?
JACK: Yeah, what is it?

BECKY: I need you to save me, Dirk -- if he catches me on the phone, I'm dead.
DIRK: Tell me where you are.
BECKY: . . . okay . . . okay . . . OH SHIT. He's coming in -- okay -- okay -- meet me at Denny's in Bakersfield -- on Colfax Blvd. Please hurry.
DIRK: Okay. I'm comin' right now, right now. I'm comin' right now to kick some ass, Becky.
BECKY: Please don't do anything to me, Jerome. Please. Please. I ask.
JEROME: Think you're Miss Fuckin' Movie Star with a dick in your mouth? Huh? You're gonna tell me -- tell it to me or I'm gonna break your fuckin' jaw.
BECKY: I don't know what you want me --
JEROME: -- I want you to tell me that you liked getting fucked by those men in those movies. I want you to tell me that you loved getting shit in your face -- YOU FUCKIN' SAY IT, CUNT.
BECKY: . . . I liked it . . .

BECKY: What?
MR. BROWN: Are you going to be alright? You seem . . . you've been sitting there. A while now. And I want to know if you're going to be alright.
MR. BROWN: Do you want to order something? A bowl of soup?
BECKY: My friend was supposed to come here and get me, but he hasn't come.
MR. BROWN: Yes. Well, why don't you let me buy you some soup while you wait for your friend?
BECKY: No. No. I'm not hungry.
MR. BROWN: Please. Please. I want to help you. This is not . . . this is something . . . you see, an act of kindness, I'm trying to do something good . . . to help you . . . for no other reason . . . other than . . . just to help.
MR. BROWN: Why don't you try calling you friend?
MR. BROWN (OC): Use the quarter, young lady.
REED: How fast were you going?
DIRK: Fuck, I dunno. Ninety.
SCOTTY J.: Ninety miles an hour?
DIRK: Shit, yeah. I'm lucky I'm not dead.
TODD: This is a lot of damage.
REED: At least it's driveable.
DIRK: It's nove driveable, look at it.
DIRK: Just let it ring, we gotta deal with this --
REED: At least it still works, Dirk.
DIRK: You can't just drive a Corvette down the street looking like that, Reed. C'mon, man. Be reasonable.
REED: How you gonna pay for it?
DIRK: -- I'll find a way to pay for it. This is top priority, Reed: My car has got to get fixed.
TODD: It could be like two/three thousand dollars worth of damage, Dirk.
DIRK: So?
TODD: I dunno.
DIRK: We gotta get those fuckin' demo tapes, too. I mean it . . . let's go kick that guy's ass or something . . . if we could get those demo tapes, then we get the record deal, then the Vette gets fixed. You cannot drive a Corvette down the street looking like this, you just can't.
BECKY: I don't know where to go. I don't have anywhere to go, I can't get anywhere.
MR. BROWN: It's alright. It's alright, young lady.
BECKY: I'm so sorry to make you hear this.
MR. BROWN: I want to help you.
BECKY: No, I can't.
MR. BROWN: You need help. You need someplace to sleep and to wash. I want to help you.
BECKY: You're a nice man.
JUDGE: Hello. You must be Maggie?
AMBER: Yes.
JUDGE: I'm Kathleen O'Malley. The judge.
AMBER: Yes.
JUDGE: You have a lawyer with you?
AMBER: No. I don't. I do not.
LAWYER: Hello, Judge.
JUDGE: You've been divorced for six years.
AMBER: Yes. Since 1977.
JUDGE: (to lawyer) And the agreement on the money settlement was taken care of?
LAWYER: Yes.
JUDGE: So. What we're talking about then is coming to an agreement on custody of Andrew?
AMBER: Yes.
JUDGE: What was decided during the divorce?
LAWYER: Initially, Andrew went with his father, and visitation was given to his mother on -- (looks at a paper) from Saturday Noon to Sunday at seven. With his mother entitled to bring Andrew to her home or any reasonable place.
JUDGE: (to Amber) Was that the understanding?
AMBER: Yes.
JUDGE: And why wasn't that visiting privilege honored?
THOMAS: Well, it was for a time --
AMBER: I only saw him twice.
THOMAS: It said, "reasonable place," and I didn't think a house of drugs and prostitution and pornography was that.
JUDGE: I'm sorry, what is it that you --
THOMAS: My ex-wife is involved in the pornography business -- I didn't think that environment was a safe place for my son.
AMBER: This is not right. My son was never exposed to pornographic material or drugs or any of these things, my husband just assumed --
THOMAS: I saw it with my own eye.
JUDGE: Did you register this as a complaint?
LAWYER: My client didn't officially register, but I think the circumstance called for something immediate -- for the safety of the child.
JUDGE: How old is the boy now?
THOMAS: He's twelve.
AMBER: He'll be thirteen next month.
JUDGE: Where do you live now?
THOMAS: We live in Long Beach. I have a job there and my new wife is home with him. (pause) You see, the problem is, Judge, is that my ex-wife is a sick . . . she is a very sick person and she needs help. She deals in drugs and sex for a living --
AMBER: I don't do drugs.
LAWYER: Your honor, she has been in and out of trouble with the law on quite a few occasions regarding this sort of thing.
AMBER: No. No. Not anymore
JUDGE (OC): Have you ever been arrested?
AMBER: Yes.
JUDGE (OC): When was the last time you were arrested . . . what was the charge . . . ?
ROLLERGIRL: Hello, hello, howdy.
JACK: Are you ready to do what we're gonna do?
ROLLERGIRL: Ready, ready. Ready like Freddy.
JACK: We are On The Lookout. That's what we'll call this -- On The Lookout. We're just gonna drive on down Ventura, heading west, like I said -- and see what we find. Maybe we find some new, young stud who wants to take a shot and get hot and heavy with Rollergirl back here in the limo -- and we'll capture it on video. This is a first, ladies and gentleman. A first in porn history. Who knows what could happen . . . ? Maybe we come across some guy, maybe some girl? See if they'd like to get soft and sticky?
DIRK: Where the fuck is Todd?
REED: C'mon, Dirk, seriously --
DIRK: What? I dunno, okay? Okay. I don't know.
REED: We have to sell your car.
DIRK: I will not do it, Reed.
REED: What else is there to do, Dirk? Huh? We have nothing left.
DIRK: I worked way too fucking hard for that car . . . what am I supposed to do . . . ?
REED: It solves all our problems.
DIRK: I will not sell my Corvette: Simple as that. Where the fuck is Todd? Where are my jeans?
SCOTTY J.: What are you looking for?
DIRK: My jeans --
SCOTTY J.: The cool ones with the thing?
DIRK: All my jeans are cool, Scotty.
SCOTTY: Sorry.

DIRK: Where the fuck have you been?
TODD: Getting some shit . . .
DIRK: What the fuck is that?
TODD: What?
DIRK: Those are my jeans, Todd. I've been looking for those.
TODD: You said I could borrow them.
DIRK: I never said that.
TODD: I thought you did.
SCOTTY J.: Can I come with you, Dirk?
DIRK: Give me my fuckin' jeans back, Todd. Seriously.
TODD: Sorry.
REED: Dirk, please -- we gotta deal with this money situation.
DIRK: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SCOTTY J.: Where are you goin', Dirk?
DIRK: Goin' out.
SCOTTY J.: Can I go with you?
JACK: What do you say?

JACK (OC): Yeah, that's all. Sorry for the inconvenience.
COLLEGE KID: You got me hard -- you could at least jack me off or something, lady.

PUERTO RICAN KID: Empty the safe. Behind the soda machine.
BUCK: Jesus Christ.
PUERTO RICAN KID: Don't talk . . . shut the fuck up . . . (aims back at Donut Boy) Okay . . . empty the safe . . .
TODD: Alright. I think this could be the thing. Something to help us score a little extra cash. I think if we decide to do this, we gotta be one hundred percent.
REED: I agree.
TODD: This guy's name is Rahad Jackson. He's got more money than God and twice as much coke, crack and smack. He'll buy just about anything anybody wants to sell him. He just likes people hanging out at his house and partying.
DIRK: How do you know him?
TODD: He used to come into Party Boys once in a while. Mutrix introduced me --
DIRK: And how would we do it, exactly? I mean, how would it all go down?
TODD: It's like this: I call him up, tell him I got half a key of quality stuff.
REED: Do you have his phone number?
TODD: Yeah. So we call him up, give him the price.
DIRK: How much?
TODD: Half a key for like . . . five thousand bucks. Split it three ways --
DIRK: That's enough to get my Vette fixed.
TODD: That's right. So we set up the deal, dump half a kilo of baking soda in a bag and walk over to his house -- BOOM. Right there -- this could be a nifty bit o' hustle-bustle.
REED: Do you have his address?
TODD: Fuckin', Reed, yeah I have his address, c'mon.
DIRK: What if he tests it out?
TODD: He won't.
DIRK: How do you know?
TODD: I know he won't. I'm positive. Believe me.
REED: It's a pretty good idea.
DIRK: I think we should go for it.
SCOTTY J.: You guys should be careful with this.
DIRK: Scotty?
SCOTTY J.: What?
DIRK: Just . . . y'know . . . mind yer own business.
SCOTTY J.: Sorry.
DIRK: Okay.
TODD: You guys ready for this?
REED: I am.
TODD: Dirk?
DIRK: Me? Yeah . . . yeah, I'm ready. I was born ready.
TODD: Alright.
DIRK: What the fuck is that?
TODD: It's a big gun.
DIRK: I know, but why?
TODD: Just in case, just in case. Let's go.
REED: I'm nervous.
TODD: It'll be okay.
REED: Let's get in and out, in and out.
TODD: Not too quick -- that looks suspicious. Lemme do the talking --
BODYGUARD: Hello. Come on in.
RAHAD: Hello, friends. Which one is Todd?
TODD: That's me. We met before at the club --
RAHAD: Oh, yeah. Come on in here.
TODD: These are my friends Dirk and Reed.
RAHAD: Great to meet you. You guys want something to drink -- or a pill -- or some coke -- or some dope?
DIRK/REED/TODD: No thank you, thanks, no.
RAHAD: So what do we have, we have, something, yeah?
TODD: Here it is . . . half a key . . . it's really good, if you wanna test it out --
RAHAD: Oh, wait a minute, I love this part: (sings along)
YOUR TIME IS DUE . . . IT'S TRUE!": (to Dirk) This song is so amazing. Anyway: What's the price?
TODD: We were thinking five thousand.
RAHAD: That's good. No problem, cool, cool.
RAHAD: You wanna play baseball?
DIRK/REED/TODD: No thank you.
RAHAD (OC): Check this out --
RAHAD: I put a mix tape together of all my favorite songs . . . This is song number three . . . I love putting mix tapes together, you know . . . if you buy an album or tape or something, those guys put the songs in their order and they try and say how you should listen to the songs, but I don't like that. I don't like to be told what to listen to, when to listen to or anything . . .
RAHAD: (to Dirk/Reed/Todd) He's Chinese . . . he loves to set off firecrackers . . .
DIRK: Well . . . I think maybe . . . we better get going --
RAHAD: No, stay. Hang out. We'll party.
DIRK: No, we really gotta split. We have to be somewhere and we --
TODD: We're Not Leaving Yet.
TODD: We're here now and we want something else. Hey -- Hey. We Want Something Else From You.
RAHAD: What?
DIRK: Todd -- what the hell are you doing?
TODD: In the master bedroom, under the bed, in a floor safe . . . You understand?
DIRK: Todd . . . what the fuck, man, c'mon --
TODD: Shut up, Dirk. I told you I got a plan. I got a good plan.
RAHAD: Are you kiddin' me kittie?
TODD: No I'm not. I'm not kidding. We want what's in the safe. We want what's in the safe in the floor under the bed in the master bedroom.
DIRK: Todd -- don't be crazy. (to Rahad) Sir -- we don't know anything about this. This is not the thing that we wanted.
TODD: Don't reach for your gun.
RAHAD: You don't wanna do this, friendly.
TODD: You've only got one bullet.
TODD: He went in the bedroom.
TODD: He's got cash and coke in the safe under the bed -- if we leave here without it we're fools.
REED: Let's just split, let's just split right now, Todd. Don't be stupid. This wasn't part of the deal.
TODD: I'm goin' in that bedroom and get what's in that safe. Are you coming?
DIRK: Fuck no. Todd. Don't. Don't do it.
RAHAD: C'mon out, little puppies. You want to come and see, come and see, to get what is coming down. Coming down.
DIRK: Fuck -- Fuck -- Fuck.
RAHAD: What the fuck . . . what the fuck . . . what the fuck.
RAHAD: It's coming down, coming down.

SHERYL LYNN: Eddie, it was out of the blue and there was a man and he was speeding and he was drunk and they didn't --
SHERYL LYNN: It was just some drunk kid, Eddie.
