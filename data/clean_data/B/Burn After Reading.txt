OSBOURNE: Bow tie loosened, he stands at a kitchen counter. His shoulders twist as he does something below frame: we hear the crackle of ice cubes wrenching loose from a tray. Behind him we see the apartment door opening. Katie, an attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne.
KATIE: You're home.
OSBOURNE: Hang on to your hat, honey. I have some news. I
KATIE: Did you pick up the cheeses?
OSBOURNE: Were they ready? I didn't know you were coming home this early.
KATIE: Were they ready? I didn't know you were coming home this early.
OSBOURNE: ( blank ) The cheeses.

VOICE: Is this a, uh, goat cheese?
HARRY: Because I have lactose reflux. But I You're lactose intolerant?
OSBOURNE: You're lactose intolerant?

HARRY: Very amusing. The gun is actually no big deal. Twenty years in the marshall's service and I've never discharged my weapon.
OSBOURNE: Sounds like something you should be telling your psychiatrist.
HARRY: What? I don't have a psychiatrist.
DOUG MAGRUDER: Boy, I guess my job is pretty undramatic. I'm on the legislative side. What do you do Mrs. Pfarrer? Do you also carry a gun?

HARRY: What is that, forbo?
HARRY: What a horse's ass.
SANDY: I don't know why we see them.
HARRY: Well, she's all right.
SANDY: She is a cold, stuck-up bitch.
KATIE: She is staring, in front of a mirror, face covered in cold cream, one hand arrested on the way up to daub on more.

THE BRIDGE: A small yacht. Osbourne stands at the wheel, a light wind in his face, as the boat sails under motor power. After a beat he moves to the front of the boat. An old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the wind. He has snowy hair and a stern Yankee face. He wears a tweed cap. He doesn't much react to Osbourne's approach.
OSBOURNE: You okay there, Dad?
THE MAN: White hair, bushy eyebrows, a florid face. He is in a law- book lined conference room. He wears an expensive suit, suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs. He is Bogus Terikhian.
TERIKHIAN: . I know this kind of man. We've seen this.
KATIE: Yes. This is my fear. He's trying he sayshe's trying to pull himself together, but.
TERIKHIAN: Look, sure, II'm obliged to tell you you should try to salvage things. And you should. People turn themselves around. Not unheard-of. But. You you haven't broached the possibility of divorce yet?
KATIE: Well that's good. Because first you should get all his financials. Before he's forewarned. Because here's a man, here's a man, practiced in deceit, this is almost, you could say it's his job, practiced at hiding things, and there is no reason, it is not improper, there is no reason for you not to get a picture of the household finances. Paper files, computer files, whateverthis is your prerogative. You can be a spy too, madam. Do this before you put him on alert. Before the turtle can draw in his head and his, uh.

KATIE: Of course it's the right time. Why wouldn't it be the right time. Does it threaten you?
HARRY: No no. No, you and me are rock solid. That's why I, uh, I think we can afford to be big. We can think about Ozzie, whether maybe we should let him get himself together a little before you hammer him with, um

HARRY: Of course not, but
KATIE: Weren't those your words?

HARRY JOGGING: He spins, jogs backward. His point-of-view: a car, traveling slowly. Following? Harry cuts across a park lawn.
HARRY: Emerging from the park onto another street. He looks around and, satisfied that he has lost the tail, jogs on.
HARRY: Jogging, entering a residential area.
CHAD: Harry jerks up the gun which he's pulled from the shoulder holster in his other hand andBAMshoots Chad in the face. The gun bucks. Unused to the recoil and still screaming, Harry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and drops the weapon. He crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles off on all fours. In the hallway he rises and tramples down the stairs.

HARRY: . Hello?
HARRY: He plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops it, dropping the knife. He stands and spins, panting. His point-of-view: the closet. Its door ajar. Legs protrude into the room as if Chad, hidden within, is sitting with his back against the closet wall contemplating his next move.

Sorry to call out of the blue but I have a, well, a publishing question and I thought you might be the person to ask, I have this manuscript, something to do with my professional experiences, not to go into too much detail but I think it's pretty explosive stuff and I think that it could merit a fairly wide readership handled properly and it isn't quite finished yet but there's a situation where I'm worried about it leaking now and maybe excerpts being published or on the internet, whatever, without my permission, and a lot of the impact being, um, blunted, so I'm actually anxious to bring it to market sooner than I'd plannedI mean, like now, in factso I was thinking, I know you, and you seem to do well, so I was wondering if you were happy with your publisher. The people you use.
SANDY: You've written a children's book?
OSBOURNE: No! No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but doesn't your company have an adult arm? Or isn't it, uh, the children's arm? Of a regular publisher?
