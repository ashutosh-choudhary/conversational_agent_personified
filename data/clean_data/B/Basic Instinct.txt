JOE ESZTERHAS: INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT It is dark; we don't see clearly. a man and woman make love on a brass bed. There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling. On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine. A tape deck PLAYS the Stones "Sympathy for the Devil." Atop him. she straddles his chest. her breasts in his face. He cups her breasts. She leans down, kisses him. JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking. We don't see the woman's face. She has long blonde hair. The CAMERA STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them. She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth. she kisses him. she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms above his head. She moves higher atop him. she reaches to the side of the bed. a white silk scarf is in her hand. her hips above his face now, moving. slightly, oh-so slightly. his face strains towards her. The scarf in her hand. she ties his hands with it. gently. to the brass bed. his eyes are closed. tighter. lowering hips into his face. lower. over his chest. his navel. The SONG plays. He is inside her. his head arches back. his throat white. She arches her back. her hips grind. her breasts are high. Her back arches back. back. her head tilts back. she extends her arms. the right arm comes down suddenly. the steel flashes. his throat is white. He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses. It flashes up. it flashes down. and up. and down. and up. and.

ANDREWS: The powder was cocaine, high- quality, high-content. He inhaled it; there were minute quantities on his lips and penis. Mr. Boz leaves five million dollars, no insurance, no direct survivors. He liked his coke, he liked his girls, and he liked rock and roll.
NICK: He liked the mayor, too, right?
GUS: What about his girlfriend?
TALCOTT: Is she relevant here? I didn't know she was a suspect.
LT. WALKER: She's a suspect.
TALCOTT: On what basis?
LT. WALKER: ( looks a notes ) Catherine Tramell. Age 30. No priors, no convictions. Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980. Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir. Estimated assets $110 million.
NICK: Are you kidding me?
LT. WALKER: ( continues ) Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, Bobby Vasquez?
ANDREWS: Bobby Vasquez?
LT. WALKER: Bobby Vasquez, former middleweight contender, killed in the ring Atlantic City, 1984.
NICK: ( smiles ) I love it. She's got a hundred million bucks. She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars. And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
LT. WALKER: You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer. She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
LT. WALKER: It's about a retired rock and roll star who is murdered by his
NICK: Page 67, pop. Do you know how she does the boyfriend? With an icepick, in bed, his hands tied with a white silk scarf.
LT. WALKER: Dr. Gardner?
BETH: I've asked Dr. Lamott to consult with us. This isn't really my turf. Dr. Lamott teaches the psycho- pathology of psychopathic behavior at Stanford and is also a member of the Justice Department's Psychological Profile team. Dr. There are two possibilities. One. The person who wrote this book is your murderer and acted out the killing described in ritualistic, literal detail. Two. Someone who wants to do the person who wrote this book harm read the book and enacted the killing described to incriminate the writer.
DR. LAMOTT: There are two possibilities. One. The person who wrote this book is your murderer and acted out the killing described in ritualistic, literal detail. Two. Someone who wants to do the person who wrote this book harm read the book and enacted the killing described to incriminate the writer.
NICK: ( after a long beat ) What if the writer did it? What are we dealing with?
DR. LAMOTT: You're dealing with a devious, diabolical mind. This book must have been written at least six months, maybe years before it was published. That means the writer planned the crime, at least in the subconscious, back then. The fact that the writer carried it out indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior in terms not only of the killing itself but in terms of applied advance defense mechanism.
GUS: Most times I can't tell shit from shinola, Doc. What was all that you just said?
BETH: She anticipates the book to be her best alibi.
DR. LAMOTT: She's going to say Do you think I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone in the exact way I've described in my book? I wouldn't do that because I'd know I'd be a suspect.
BETH: She's going to say Do you think I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone in the exact way I've described in my book? I wouldn't do that because I'd know I'd be a suspect.
NICK: What if it's not the writer? What if it's someone who read the book?
DR. LAMOTT: You're dealing then with someone so obsessed that he or she is willing to kill an irrelevant and innocent victim to place the blame on the person who wrote this book. We are talking about deep-seated, obsessional hatred; an utter lack of sense of proportion or We've got a top-of-the-line, once- in-a-lifetime loony-tune either way you cut it that's what you're saying, right, Doc?
GUS: We've got a top-of-the-line, once- in-a-lifetime loony-tune either way you cut it that's what you're saying, right, Doc?
DR. LAMOTT: You're dealing with someone very dangerous and very ill.
CORRIGAN: Come on, you know there's no case here. There's no physical evidence okay, she doesn't have an alibi but there's no motive. Her defense would just beat us to death with the copycat thing. Anybody who read the book could have done it.
NICK: So what do we do nothing?
LT. WALKER: ( after a beat ) We bring her in for questioning.
TALCOTT: She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
LT. WALKER: She was the last person seen with the guy I'll take the It's yours.
TALCOTT: It's yours.
CORRIGAN: It won't do any good. She'll come in with Lee Bailey and Mel Belli trailing behind her on a solid gold chain from Tiffanys.
TALCOTT: Yes she will.
NICK: ( after a beat ) No she won't.
NICK: ( smiles ) I don't think she's going to hide behind anybody. I don't think she's going to hide at all.
TALCOTT: ( after a beat ) I think you're as crazy as she probably is, Curran.
GUS: You know what they say: It takes one to know one.
NICK: Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
CATHERINE: Are you arresting me?
NICK: If that's the way you want to play
CATHERINE: ( smiles ) Can I change into something more appropriate? It'll just take a
CATHERINE: Come in.
CATHERINE: How long will this take?
NICK: ( looks up ) I don't know.
NICK: Do you always keep old newspapers Only when they make interesting
CATHERINE: Only when they make interesting
CATHERINE: ( finally ) I'm ready.
GUS: You have the right to an attorney.
CATHERINE: Why would I need an attorney?
CATHERINE: Do you have a cigarette?
NICK: I don't smoke.
CATHERINE: Yes, you do.
NICK: I quit.
NICK: I thought you were out of I found some in my purse; would you like one?
CATHERINE: I found some in my purse; would you like one?
NICK: I told you I quit.
CATHERINE: It won't last.
GUS: You workin' on another book?
CATHERINE: Yes I am.
GUS: It must really be somehtin' makin' stuff up all the time.
CATHERINE: It teaches you to lie.
GUS: How's that?
CATHERINE: You make it up, but it has to be believable. They call it suspension of disbelief.
GUS: I like that. "Suspension of
NICK: What's your new book about?
CATHERINE: A detective. He falls for the wrong woman.
NICK: What happens to him?
CATHERINE: She kills him.
CORRIGAN: I'm John Corrigan. I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms. Tramell. Can we get you anything? Would you like some coffee?
CATHERINE: No thank you.
TALCOTT: Are your attorneys
NICK: ( hiding a smile ) Ms. Tramell waived her right to an
CATHERINE: ( smiles ) Did I miss something?
NICK: I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
LT. WALKER: Why have you waived your right to an attorney, Ms. Tramell?
CATHERINE: ( to Nick ) Why did you think I wouldn't want I told them you wouldn't want to I have nothing to hide.
NICK: I told them you wouldn't want to I have nothing to hide.
CATHERINE: I have nothing to hide.
CORRIGAN: There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
CATHERINE: What are you going to do? Charge me with smoking?
CORRIGAN: Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
CATHERINE: I had sex with him for about a year and a half. I liked having sex with him.
CATHERINE: He wasn't afraid of experimenting. I like men like that. I like men who give me pleasure. He gave me a lot of pleasure.
CORRIGAN: Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
CATHERINE: ( smiles ) Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
CORRIGAN: ( after a beat, little flustered ) Did you ever tie him up?
CATHERINE: You never tied him up.
ANDREWS: You never tied him up.
CATHERINE: No. Johnny liked to use his hands too much. I like hands and fingers.
LT. WALKER: You describe a white silk scarf in your book.
CATHERINE: I've always had a fondness for white silk scarves. I have a very vivid imagination.
NICK: But you said you liked men to use their hands.
CATHERINE: No. I said I liked Johnny to use his hands. I don't give any rules, Nick. I go with the flow.
CORRIGAN: Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
CATHERINE: I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer. I'm not stupid.
TALCOTT: We know you're not stupid, Ms. Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
LT. WALKER: Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
NICK: Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
CATHERINE: Yes it does, doesn't it?
CATHERINE: The answer is no. I didn't kill Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
GUS: Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
CATHERINE: Did you ever do drugs with Mr. What kind of drugs?
HARRIGAN: Did you ever do drugs with Mr. What kind of drugs?
CATHERINE: What kind of drugs?
GUS: What kind of drugs?
CATHERINE: She looks directly at Nick.
CATHERINE: Have you ever fucked on cocaine? It's nice.
NICK: You like playing games, don't you?
CATHERINE: ( smiles ) I've got a degree in psych. It goes with the turf. Games are
NICK: How about boxing? That's a game. Was that fun for you?
TALCOTT: I think that's irrelevant to this Yes it was. Bobby died.
CATHERINE: ( to Nick ) Yes it was. Bobby died.
NICK: How did you feel when he died?
CATHERINE: I loved him. I hurt.
NICK: How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died that day at the beach.
CATHERINE: I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
NICK: But you didn't hurt
CATHERINE: Because you didn't love him
NICK: Because you didn't love him
CATHERINE: That's right.
NICK: Even though you were fucking him.
CATHERINE: ( after a beat ) You still get the pleasure. Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
LT. WALKER: How did you know he was married?
CATHERINE: ( watching Nick ) Maybe I was guessing. What difference does it make?
CATHERINE: Would you like a cigarette, Nick?
CORRIGAN: Do you two know each other?
NICK: INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
CATHERINE: INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
ANDREWS: How did you meet Mr. Boz?
CATHERINE: I wanted to write a book about the murder of a retired rock star. I went down to his club and picked him up. Then I had sex with him.
LT. WALKER: You didn't feel anything for him. You just had sex with him for your
CATHERINE: In the beginning. Then I got to like what he did for me.
GUS: That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
CATHERINE: I'm a writer, I use people for what I write. You write what you know. Let the world beware.
CATHERINE: ( to Corrigan, smiles ) Would you like me to take a lie detector test?
THE EXAMINER: No blips, no blood pressure variations, no pulse variance. Either she's telling the truth or I've never met anyone like her.
LT. WALKER: Well, I guess that's it.
NICK: How does somebody beat this machine?
THE EXAMINER: Ninety-nine point nine percent of the cases, they don't. You'd have to be able to mask the truth from your own central nervous system, your circulatory system, your adrenal glands. In my opinion, this woman is telling the truth.
CATHERINE: Can I go now?
LT. WALKER: ( after a beat ) Yes. Thanks for coming in, Ms. Tramell. I'm sorry to inconvenience
CATHERINE: Can I ask one of you for a ride?
NICK: ( smiles )
CATHERINE: ( smiles )
CATHERINE: ( smiles ) I'm tired.
NICK: It's got to be tiring to beat that
CATHERINE: If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring. It wouldn't be tiring at all.
NICK: Why not?
CATHERINE: Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies. For my writing.
CATHERINE: ( smiles ) I love the rain, don't you?
CATHERINE: You took a polygraph after you shot those two people, didn't you?
NICK: I passed.
CATHERINE: You see? We're both innocent,
NICK: How do you know all this stuff about me?
CATHERINE: You know all about me.
NICK: I don't know anything that isn't police business.
CATHERINE: ( after a beat ) You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
CATHERINE: ( smiles ) Thanks for the ride.
LT. WALKER: What is all this "Nick" stuff Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
NICK: She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
LT. WALKER: And you volunteered.
THE BARTENDER: Perrier, Nick?
NICK: Double Black Jack rocks, Harry.
GUS: ( with concern ) What you doin', son?
NICK: It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop? She doesn't know me. I never saw her before Gus and I talked to Here you go, Nick.
THE BARTENDER: Here you go, Nick.
NICK: Thanks, Harry.
LT. WALKER: You sure?
NICK: I'm sure.
NICK: Now what?
LT. WALKER: What now what? Now nothing. She passed the polygraph. That's it.
NICK: She knew she could beat it. That's why she asked to take it.
LT. WALKER: How the fuck do you know? What is it with you and this broad anyway?
NICK: Come on, Phil. You're not gonna let this slide. What about her parents? What about what else she's published? At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
LT. WALKER: Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written. What are you a book How did they die? Was there an How you're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
NICK: How did they die? Was there an How you're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
LT. WALKER: How you're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
GUS: Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face. Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
LT. WALKER: Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face. Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
NICK: ( casually ) Fuck you, Phil.
LT. WALKER: Fuck you, too Nick.
NICK: ( calls to the Bartender ) Can you get me another double Black Jack, Harry.
NILSEN: ( to Nick ) Hey, shooter You back on the Black Jack, Shooter?
LT. WALKER: We're discussing a case, Marty.
NILSEN: I know that. I had no doubt of Here you go, Nick.
THE BARTENDER: Here you go, Nick.
NILSEN: ( grins ) Double, huh, Shooter? I'm off-duty, Nilsen. You hear me? I'm off-duty discussing a case. Internal Affairs shouldn't have any trouble with that. Maybe I should put in for overtime.
NICK: I'm off-duty, Nilsen. You hear me? I'm off-duty discussing a case. Internal Affairs shouldn't have any trouble with that. Maybe I should put in for overtime.
NILSEN: ( grins ) You do that, Shooter. Why don't you send it to me? I'll give it special attention.
NICK: I'm gonna tell you once more, Nilsen
BETH: What's the problem?
NILSEN: ( grins ) No problem, Doctor. Here comes the Doctor just in time to save her patient. Take care, Shooter.
BETH: You okay?
NICK: ( after a beat ) ( smiles ) You don't look so okay.
BETH: ( smiles ) You don't look so okay.
NICK: ( smiles ) What are you doing here?
BETH: ( smiles ) ( she shrugs ) Rookie cop.
NICK: ( smiles ) What else is new?
NICK: You want to get out of here?
BETH: ( smiles )
GUS: Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
LT. WALKER: ( watches them go out ) Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
GUS: ( after a beat, smiles ) He ain't that way. He's got heart.
LT. WALKER: ( smiles ) Yeah. I know.
BETH: Don't please, Nick
BETH: Please don't don't
BETH: What was she like?
NICK: Catherine Tramell.
BETH: Catherine Tramell.
NICK: ( after a beat ) She said what you said she'd say.
BETH: I met her at Berkeley.

BETH: I'm telling you.
BETH: ( with difficulty ) You've never been. like that.
BETH: He doesn't look at her a long beat, says nothing.
NICK: You're the shrink.
BETH: You weren't making love to me.
NICK: Who was I making love to?
BETH: You weren't making love.
NICK: ( finally ) I need a cigarette.
BETH: ( after a beat ) I thought you quit.
BETH: Top drawer in the foyer. Get it on your way out.
LT. WALKER: You look like dogshit.
GUS: ( grins ) He looks a little shrunk, that's ( after a beat ) We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing. A professor. Icepick. In his bed. Multiple stab wounds. 1977.

NICK: ( quietly )
GUS: ( behind him ) Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?

GUS: ( grins ) I came in here to jack off the damn machine. ( a beat ) One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein. Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what? He was her
NICK: Was she ever suspect?
GUS: No, sir. They never even got a statement from her.
NICK: ( slowly ) Do you remember a case 1956 Hazel Dobkins?
GUS: ( grins ) Hell yes! Couldn't get it outta my head for years. Still can't. Nice little kids nice husband, wasn't porkin' around no financial problems. One day outta the clear blue sky she does 'em. All of 'em. Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it. Sweet as honey. Said she didn't know why she done it.

NICK: She wiped out her whole family.
CATHERINE: Yes. She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
NICK: Didn't you study it in school?
CATHERINE: Only in theory. You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter? Not in theory in practice.
