ANDY WARHOL: CUT TO:
JANE: Good luck.
BOSS: We don't get many ladies in here. So your husband approves of you working?
MARGARET: ( quiet; a soft Southern lilt ) My husband and I are separated.
BOSS: ( SHOCKED )
MARGARET: Sir, I realize I have no employment experience. but I sure need this job. I have a daughter to support.
MARGARET: I studied at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville, then took Illustration classes in New York. Here's a pastel I did. here's some fashion design. a portrait in charcoal. though I enjoy mixing mediums, preferably oil and ink. She's alive, enthused. The guy shakes his head.
BOSS: You do understand this is a furniture CLOSEUP - MARGARET A strained smile.
MARGARET: Deirdre, look at you!
MARGARET: Yeah, I know. But I hit this scene. and "Deirdre" just sounded like something my mother would call me. Margaret giggles.
MARGARET: Jane is swell. She's started in a sweet little school.
MARGARET: ( SHOCKED )
MARGARET: Do they only show Modern?
MARGARET: What's espresso?
TOURIST GUY: Your stuff is cute. How much?
MARGARET: Today's a special: Two dollars.
TOURIST GUY: I'll give you one. Beat then she nods, agreeing. She gestures. The little BOY sits. Margaret clips a fresh sheet of paper, sharpens her charcoal. and. goes motionless. Studying the boy's face. He gazes back. Then inspired, she begins sketching his EYES. Large and exaggerated. Then she fills in the shape of his head. His ears. His jaw. In a rush, his likeness appears. The parents come over to peek then gasp. Margaret is good. She sketches faster. Focused. Until a LOUD, PLUMMY VOICE drifts in.
MAN'S VOICE: Monet? "Monet"?! Whew that's a hell of a compliment. Though, if I may respectfully disagree, I'm more in the tradition of Pissarro. Margaret looks up, distracted. She resumes her work.
MAN'S VOICE: C'mon, get closer. Closer! Look at that sunlight coming through the mottled leaves. That's a bold yellow! Curious, Margaret casually peers over.
HER POV: Holding court in another booth is WALTER KEANE, 40. Walter is astonishing: Hugely confident. Charming. Waggishly handsome. And dressed like an "Artist" striped turtleneck, with hands full of brushes. Walter's stall is filled with oils of Paris street scenes. He casually flirts with TWO YOUNG COEDS. They admire a painting.
WALTER: You wanna touch it? Do it! I lay it on thick you're not gonna break it!
WALTER: Excuse me, Ladies.
WIDE: Walter strides up to Margaret. She peers nervously. trying to ignore him. She sketches faster. Shading. Walter watches. Admiring. and discreetly smelling her hair. Margaret pays no attention. Done, she blows into a can of Fix- It. Poosh! A fine mist sprays, setting the portrait. Without fanfare, she humbly turns the picture.
MARGARET: All finished. Her customers gape, impressed. She smiles. The guy counts out four quarters, then happily leaves.
WALTER: You're better than spare change. You shouldn't sell yourself so cheap.
MARGARET: I'm just glad they liked it.
WALTER: Ahhh! You're past that point! Your heart is in your work. He leans in, too close. Margaret shivers. Breathing faster.
WALTER: What's your name?
MARGARET: Mmm. He grins, checking her out. her loose sexy blouse and tight black capris. She flushes.
MARGARET: Wouldn't you rather flirt with those dolls over there?
WALTER: Mm, no.
WALTER: ( IMPASSIONED )
WALTER: Little Girl! How would you like your portrait sketched by the World- Renowned Margaret Ulbrich?! Queen of the Bay! In mere minutes, she will capture your soul! Hm. Jane shrugs, unimpressed.
JANE: ( he grabs a PAINTING ) Don't you wish this were you in this beautiful painting??
WALTER: ( he grabs a PAINTING ) Don't you wish this were you in this beautiful painting??
JANE: But that IS me! And that's me. ( she POINTS all over ) And that one started as me, but then Mother turned it into a Chinese boy. Huh? Walter peers at Jane. then at Margaret. And then it hits him. He grimaces, embarrassed.
WALTER: Oh, you're Mommy! My apologies, Honey. I misconstrued the situation.
ON MARGARET: A gut decision. She stares at Walter, then smiles slyly.
MARGARET: Mr. Ulbrich is out of the picture.!
ON WALTER: His face slowly lights up. Ah! Sun breaking through clouds.
WALTER: Bonsoir, gang! Henri! Sorry I didn't call first. Est-ce que tout va bien?
MAITRE'D: Je vais bien, merci! Comment allez- Je vais bien! I'm with a beautiful woman! Could life be any grander?? They get led in. Margaret is dazzled. Walter whispers.
WALTER: Je vais bien! I'm with a beautiful woman! Could life be any grander?? They get led in. Margaret is dazzled. Walter whispers.
WALTER: And I don't even have to pay! I'm set because I gave the chef a painting. You know what he said? "Nobody paints Montmartre like Walter Keane!"
LATER: Margaret and Walter enjoy an intimate dinner. The wine flows.
MARGARET: I can't believe you lived in Paris.
WALTER: Best time of my life.
MARGARET: I've never even been on an airplane.
WALTER: Well you have to experience these things! Grab 'em!!
MARGARET: You're a romantic.
WALTER: Damn right! A wistful shrug. He chugs his glass.
WALTER: Of course, walkin' away from the bourgeois scene wasn't a snap. I had to quit my job. Leave my wife. These choices aren't easy. She stares at her wine.
MARGARET: I've never acted freely. I was the daughter. The wife. The mother.
WALTER: You shouldn't knock your work. I'd give an eyetooth to have your talent. Margaret is taken aback. He's absolutely sincere.
WALTER: You can look into someone and capture them on canvas! You paint people! ( he gestures sadly ) I can only paint things. My street scenes are charming. but at the end of the day, it's just a collection of sidewalks and buildings. Walter goes silent. He has revealed his fears.
MARGARET: Walter, I'd bet you could paint Whew. Baby, when you look at me like that, I could fall hard. Margaret gulps. Afraid to talk.
WALTER: ( INTENSE )
MARGARET: This is moving fast. You're my first date in a long time. Neither of them speaks. The tension builds There is a spark between them.
MARGARET: Sweetie, could you stop fidgeting?
JANE: Mother, after all this time, you MUST know what my face looks like. Margaret winces. Walter laughs. She gets busy, penciling in LARGE OVAL EYES. Then quick marks for the mouth and nose. Impatient, Jane spies on Walter's canvas.
JANE: Hey! Your canvas is blank!
WALTER: Er, you can't rush inspiration
MARGARET: Jane! Don't bother Mr. Keane. You know creativity has to well up from the inside.
WALTER: Don't worry. She's not bothering Walter leaves Jane. He points at Margaret's canvas.
WALTER: There's something I gotta ask you. What's with the big crazy eyes.?
MARGARET: I believe things can be seen in eyes. They're the windows of the soul
WALTER: Yeah, but, c'mon! You draw 'em like pancakes! I mean, they're WAY out of He's having fun, but she remains serious.
MARGARET: Eyes are how I express my emotions. That's how I've always drawn them.
VOICE: Walter? Hey Walt! Walter spins, startled. A FRIENDLY GUY in a suit strolls up.
FRIENDLY GUY: I thought that was you!
WALTER: ( EMBARRASSED )
FRIENDLY GUY: Boy, I'm glad to see you! Have we heard back from the city, on that setback? My guys really need the variance, for the first floor retail. Walter is mortified. He turns away from Margaret.
WALTER: Um. we should hear from Permits by Yeah? Well that's terrif'! I'll tell the architects! Pleased, the guy cheerily strides away.
FRIENDLY GUY: Yeah? Well that's terrif'! I'll tell the architects! Pleased, the guy cheerily strides away.
MARGARET: What was that??
WALTER: ( ASHAMED )
WALTER: I'm in commercial real estate. A stunned beat.
MARGARET: You're a Realtor?
WALTER: ( CONTRITE )
MARGARET: And you're. ashamed?
WALTER: Of course! Any blockhead can arrange a sublet!
JANE: ON MARGARET
ON MARGARET: She turns, startled. Feeling guilty, Margaret rushes from Walter. Busying herself, she skims through the MAIL. Jane shakes her head and marches out. Margaret flips through envelopes until one stops her. On edge, she slowly removes an official DOCUMENT. She scans it. and her face drops. Crushed. Something terrible. Walter is worried.
WALTER: What's wrong.?
MARGARET: ( SOFT )
WALTER: You're a perfect mother.
MARGARET: He told the court Jane doesn't have a proper home. It's beyond my abilities as a single woman. Margaret trails off, shaken. Walter gulps unsurely. Then, he takes her in his arms. We
WALTER: Marry me.
MARGARET: ( SHE GASPS )
WALTER: ( he puts a finger to her lips ) Shh. Don't think of a reason to say no. 'Cause I've got a million reasons to say yes. ( he gives a winning smile ) I know it makes no sense!
WALTER: Margaret, I'm on my knee! C'mon, whatdya say? Let's get married! We can be in Hawaii by the weekend.
MARGARET: "Hawaii"? M-marriage?
WALTER: ( BEGUILING )
MARGARET: You're right. this is paradise. Only God could make those colors.
WALTER: I knew you'd love it.
MARGARET: Oh, can't we stay here forever??
WALTER: Well, I don't know about forever. But maybe. I can arrange another week.
MARGARET: This is a waterfall. the air was so fresh you could taste it. Here's an ancient altar. that statue is Kane, the god of creation. I said a prayer to him. Oh! Here's Walter and Janie, building a sandcastle Dee-Ann raises an eyebrow.
MARGARET: ( SHE GIGGLES )
MARGARET: You're talking about my husband!
MARGARET: I'm not naive. ( beat; she laughs ) Well, I am naive. But I know the man I'm marrying. Walter can act rash. but he's a good provider. And he's wonderful with Jane.
MARGARET: "You are on the threshold of untold INT. ART GALLERY - DAY A Modish, happening gallery. The white walls are hung with ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: Slashing angles of color, painted over rags and glued bolts. On the floor is SCULPTURE made from wood and wire. In charge is RUBEN, a fussy man in a goatee. He's schmoozing a FANCY LADY. They look at a spattered, distorted painting.
RUBEN: What's brilliant about the composition is its spontaneity. The image has no visual center of attention.
FANCY LADY: It's quite gestural.
RUBEN: Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by the tachistes.
FANCY LADY: I heard Tab Hunter was in here, looking at one.
RUBEN: Well. I'm not allowed to say. He NODS HIS HEAD up-and-down: Yes, you're right.
OUTSIDE: A car backfires. Ruben turns and winces.
RUBEN: Oh Christ, don't come in here. Please don't come in here. The door SLAMS. Walter loudly barges in.
WALTER: Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute?
RUBEN: Walter. In polite society, the word is "appointment."
FANCY LADY: ( glancing back and forth ) Uh, I could come back later. She anxiously hurries for the door. Ruben fumes. Walter ignores it all and starts laying out his wares. First, the Parisian street scenes, one after another.
WALTER: You're gonna love my stuff today.
RUBEN: Haven't I seen that one before?
WALTER: Nah! That was painted in the Fifth Arrondissement. This is the Sixth I don't understand. You lived in Paris for a week. How can you still be cranking out paintings? Walter laughs. He points to his head.
RUBEN: ( SKEPTICAL )
WALTER: It's all up here. ( beat; a sentimental
FLOURISH ): And here. He points to his heart. Ruben frowns and points to the wall.
RUBEN: Well, it's not going up here.
WALTER: ( HURT )
RUBEN: Yes it IS!
WALTER: Would they want. this?
RUBEN: ( HE SHUDDERS )
WALTER: No. they're my wife's. Fascinated, Ruben glances through Margaret's oils. Canvas after canvas of sad kiddies against gray, bleak backgrounds.
RUBEN: Why are their eyes so big?! They're like big stale jellybeans.
WALTER: ( SNIDE )
RUBEN: ( LONG BEAT )
WALTER: So. what do you say? Ruben looks up, amazed. Walter seems oblivious.
RUBEN: I say, NO! It's not art.
WALTER: ( HORRIFIED )
RUBEN: It's like the back of a magazine! "Draw the turtle! Send in a nickel and win the Big Contest!"
WALTER: How dare you! Lots of people would like this.
RUBEN: Well, nobody who's walking through the door of this gallery!
WALTER: We'll never break in.! Because there's a CABAL. A secret society of gallery owners and critics, who get together for Sunday brunch in Sausalito, deciding what's "cool."
MARGARET: I think people buy art because it touches them
WALTER: Heh! You're livin' in fairy land! People don't get to discover a thing. They buy art, because it's in the right place at the right time. O.s., MUSIC BUILDS. Muddled, Walter turns. He looks and then his eyes light up. He is getting an idea.
ONSTAGE: The band speeds to a climax, the percussion throbbing. Then, a final, crazed note. BAM!! The crowd APPLAUDS. The club's owner, ENRICO BANDUCCI, bounds on stage. Banducci is a theatrical, natty Italian guy with a skinny moustache and loud personality. He grabs a mike.
BANDUCCI: Give it up for Cal Tjader! That set was HUMMIN'! Al-aright, be sure to stick around for the one a.m. show! The house lights come up. Banducci hops down, greeting guests, making his way out when Walter glides up.
WALTER: Hey, Banducci. I love the music tonight. It's a gas.
BANDUCCI: Oh. Thanks, thanks.
WALTER: I'm Walter Keane. I'm a painter.
BANDUCCI: Really? Hm.! Maybe you're right. What color were you thinking? Huh? Walter holds his composure.
WALTER: No I'm an artist. I used to be based on the Left Bank. But now I've relocated to the "States," and I'm looking for an. exhibition venue. Beat. Banducci frowns.
BANDUCCI: I like my club the way it is. Your stuff's so hot, go put it in a museum.
WALTER: Okay! I respect that. You're a businessman, not a charity! So how 'bout if I, uh. rented your walls? Hm?! Banducci raises an eyebrow.
WALTER: Yes! The paintings are available for public viewing daily, from 7 to 3! ( an awkward beat ) Er, no. 3 a.m. It's in a nightclub. ( he hangs up ) Maggie! It's promotion time! We gotta lay the racket! Margaret puts on a smock, a bit dumbfounded. Walter spatters some paint on his shirt. He grins, then holds up his brush and SIGNS the painting: "W. KEANE" Margaret forces a "cheese" smile, with her Waif. FLASH! The camera pops.
WALTER: Ah, beautiful! An art lover! Yes sir, how may I help you?
MAN: ( UNCLEAR )
TIPSY LADY: Look at that child. She's so sad.
TIPSY MAN: Is she poor..?
TIPSY LADY: She's forgotten! It just makes me want to cry. ( she peers at the signature, then turns ) Are you "Keane"? Walter lifts his head from the table.
WALTER: TIPSY LADY
TIPSY LADY: Well you're a hell of a painter. Walter squints, confused, then beams. Joy! Happiness bursting like a little child.
WALTER: Why, thank you.! Thank you so much!
TIPSY LADY: Your work is very powerful. There's so much emotion in those eyes. OUCH! Walter's smile collapses.
TIPSY LADY: Is something wrong?
WALTER: ( REELING )
TIPSY MAN: ( beat; he CHUCKLES ) Oh, I get it.! The artist doesn't wanna part with his favorite piece. The man winks, then pulls out a WAD OF BILLS. Walter stares morosely.
BANDUCCI: Hello, Picasso! Nice crowd, eh?
WALTER: ( SOUR )
BANDUCCI: Hey, it's prime thoroughfare! People drink, they gotta relieve themselves.
WALTER: ( MUTTERING )
WALTER: It's INSULTING! When people see art, they shouldn't think of SHIT!
BANDUCCI: ( SHOCKED )
MARGARET: I've never posted bail before. Silence. He has no idea what to say. His aplomb crumbles.
WALTER: I'm I'm sorry. Banducci. laughed at our work. .So I socked him.
MARGARET: Since when are you thin-skinned? Artists have to handle criticism.
WALTER: You're right! I know. But. I was already in a bad place. I'd had a couple. and earlier.
MARGARET: I don't understand. Why would you do such a thing?!
WALTER: It was a misunderstanding. And then, I didn't want to jinx the sale.
MARGARET: Don't ever do it again.
WALTER: Don't give me a hard time. I'm just grabbing my stuff. Across the packed room, he spots Banducci with a black eye. Walter halts, uncertain. A bristling tension. Until Banducci suddenly rushes and GRABS him! Walter flails, freaked. Banducci DRAGS him into a back kitchen
BANDUCCI: Can you believe this? We're sold out, and I don't even have a headliner!!
BANDUCCI: Dope, we made the front page!! People are here, cause they wanna see the sappy paintings that made grown men A moment of discombobulation. until Walter slowly grins.
WALTER: I'll see you in COURT, you son of a bitch! I'm suing you for assault! Slander! False arrest!! Banducci storms away. Walter shudders, "upset." CUSTOMERS peer at him. then at the paintings. Curious, they migrate that way.
DICK: Yes sir! Whew. That was quite a load of horseshit you gents were layin' out Dick Nolan. The Examiner. Walter freezes up. Until Dick grins conspiratorially.
DICK: Hey pal, don't lose any sleep. I eat this stuff with a spoon! It gives me something to type about, in my column.
WALTER: ( he laughs, relieved ) I thought you only did celebrities.
DICK: Well, Banducci's famous and you hit him! So you're a celebrity, once- Buy me a drink?
WALTER: Huh? Uh, sure Dick smoothly drags him to the bar. Dick waves the bartender.
DICK: Gary! I'll have a Ward Eight, in a frosted high boy. My friend'll have the same. ( he beams, then turns ) So! Walter, tell me about your work
WALTER: Well, when I was in Paris.
DICK: Jesus, not those! I mean the little hobo kids. What?! Walter frowns, peeved. He considers this indignity. then decides to stomach it. He smiles fakely, effusively.
WALTER: What do you wanna know.?!
WALTER: Ding-a-ling! Wake up, we're a HIT! Margaret rolls over, groggy. Walter jumps on the bed, grinning. He tosses her a HANDFUL OF MONEY.
WALTER: What a night! I sold out all your Big She rubs her eyes, amazed.
MARGARET: There must be two-hundred dollars.
WALTER: They adore you! Cause of that article, the joint was PACKED. And then, a famous journalist showed up, and I need more paintings! Now! He hungrily KISSES her. She laughs.
MARGARET: Walter, they take at least a week. There's layering, shading
WALTER: Of course! But, this is opportunity! Ah, we're gonna make a crackerjack team: Me schmoozing up the club, while you're back here, doing what you love! She stares at him then smiles. MUSIC.
MARGARET: Mrs. Cava, I'm sorry to bother you so late. but would you mind watching INT. TAXI - NIGHT Margaret rides in the back seat, smiling, her gaze faraway. She proudly hugs the bundled paintings to her chest.
WALTER: .yeah, eyes are powerful. A poet said they're the windows of the soul. Margaret smiles, touched. She comes closer..
GROUPIE: They hold so much feeling.
WALTER: You got it! That's why I paint 'em so I've always done it that way.
HER POV: If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. I've got a little blonde girl in a blue dress that'll tear your heart out.
WALTER: If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. I've got a little blonde girl in a blue dress that'll tear your heart out.
MARGARET: He spins shocked at her presence.
WALTER: ( DISCOMBOBULATED )
UM: Why are you lying? For once, Walter has no answer. She bores in, emotions racing. Confused. Hurt.
MARGARET: Why are you lying? For once, Walter has no answer. She bores in, emotions racing. Confused. Hurt.
MARGARET: You're taking credit for something that isn't yours. He looks ill. Wheels spinning, looking for an out
WALTER: I was. trying to close the deal
MARGARET: Those children are part of my being!
WALTER: I'm just a salesman! You know, buyers pay more if they meet the painter
MARGARET: They couldn't meet me, because you told me to stay home!!
WALTER: Shh, QUIET! He grabs her, pulling her behind a curtain. He's desperate.
WALTER: Don't blow this! Look, we're makin' money! Your pocket, my pocket? What's the difference?!
MARGARET: ( TREMBLING )
WALTER: Not all all! But it's not about ego! You wanna say you did the street scenes? Fine! I don't care! Say a monkey painted it! She breaks into tears, sobbing.
MARGARET: I'm glad you can dash off your pieces without any emotional connection.!
WALTER: Ah, honey! I just wanna share them with the world!
WALTER: Hey. Who is that remarkably handsome and confident man?
BANDUCCI: That's Dino Olivetti as in Olivetti Don't even try, Walter. He doesn't speak a lick of English. Walter stares hungrily.
EUROPEAN BLONDE: Mr. Olivetti is enchanted with the painting. He would like to know. who is the artist?
WALTER: I am! Walter swoops over and grabs Olivetti in a hearty clasp.
WALTER: It's a delight to meet you, Signore! Buon giorno! Have you been an art lover for long..? We move in tight on MARGARET, as the SOUND DIALS DOWN.
WALTER'S VOICE: I call that piece "The Waif." Isn't it striking? With its juxtaposition of girl, cat, and stairs. and its almost Flemish use of underpigment. The SOUND dims. then goes SILENT. Margaret stares in shock, unmoving. Time seems to stop. She is frozen in grief. Until
WALTER'S VOICE: Baby! Baby! Can you believe it?!!
MINUTES LATER: Time has passed. Walter happily clutches Margaret.
WALTER: We made five grand!! Five THOUSAND And that wasn't even one of your good Margaret blinks, lost. In the b.g., Olivetti holds the painting, now wrapped-up in newspaper and twine. A pleased customer. Margaret's face darkens.
MARGARET: Don't you mean. one of your good No. No no! One of OUR good ones. ( the spirit of generosity, he hands her a CHECK ) Look at those zeroes! We've hit the big time! We are now hanging in the collection of Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti! With his patronage comes credibility! And with credibility comes RESPECT! Margaret stares at the check in her hands. At all the zeroes.
WALTER: No. No no! One of OUR good ones. ( the spirit of generosity, he hands her a CHECK ) Look at those zeroes! We've hit the big time! We are now hanging in the collection of Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti! With his patronage comes credibility! And with credibility comes RESPECT! Margaret stares at the check in her hands. At all the zeroes.
MARGARET: What about. honesty?
WALTER: Aw c'mon! The paintings say "Keane"! I'm Keane, you're Keane. From now on, we are one and the same. Walter pulls her tight. She doesn't resist.
WALTER: On behalf of the children of the world, we present this painting to Mayor Christopher!
WALTER: In the interest of peace through culture, we donate this painting to the people of Russia!
DICK: The Purple Onion. 9:30. Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation.
WALTER: Miss Crawford! In recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting, "The Lion and the Child"!
WALTER: Joan said "Marvelous"! MARVELOUS! That's worth more than 1000 critics! ( he CLAPS his hands ) Hey, maybe she'll come to our opening.
MARGARET: But. isn't it strange? Artists get shown. They don't build their own Says who?! Like John Q. Public cares? He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism! She responds but he sexily puts his finger to her mouth.
WALTER: Says who?! Like John Q. Public cares? He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism! She responds but he sexily puts his finger to her mouth.
WALTER: He digs real art. Your art! It's beautiful. You're beautiful. Walter starts rubbing against her, dancing sensually. She laughs, embarrassed, her wet paint brushes smearing his chest. She relents and relaxes. They dance around.
WALTER: Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this! Little Jane tiredly glues another poster. She yawns.
JANE: I remember when Momma painted that. Suddenly, Margaret freezes. She hadn't anticipated this. Margaret looks to Walter. He stares back, waiting.
MARGARET: Are you sure? That was a long time Sure I'm sure! It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on a stool in the kitchen
JANE: Sure I'm sure! It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on a stool in the kitchen
WALTER: ( CUTTING IN )
JANE: No, Mother did! Look! I'm wearing my blue dress.
MARGARET: L-lots of girls have that dress. Margaret trails off, sickened. Not knowing how to lie. Walter takes charge. He kneels, then smiles gently at Jane.
WALTER: You have a good eye, sweetie. I painted it, but I was trying to mimic your mother's style. You know, the style she USED to paint in.
JANE: Well you did a really good job.
MARGARET: Hello. I've never really done this before. I'm not sure how you.
PRIEST'S VOICE: No, no! Please. We don't chase people away.
THEN: I lied to my child. Why would you do that?
MARGARET: I lied to my child. Why would you do that?
PRIEST'S VOICE: Why would you do that?
MARGARET: My husband. he pressured me into doing it.
PRIEST'S VOICE: Is your husband that kind of person?
MARGARET: Ummm, no. I don't think of him that way. I mean, he likes to tell stories. maybe he exaggerates a little. but he's a good man.
PRIEST'S VOICE: But what of the child? Will this lie bring harm to her?
MARGARET: "Harm"?? Oh! Not at all.
PRIEST'S VOICE: Well, the modern world is a complicated place.
MARGARET: N-no. That's not what
PRIEST'S VOICE: It sounds like your husband is trying to make the best of an imperfect You were raised Christian, so you know what we are taught: The man is head of the household.
HIPSTER LADY: I think it's creepy, maudlin and Exactly. I love it. We move in tight on the painting. Underneath is a tag: "BEDTIME, by WALTER KEANE. Oil on canvas." We drift along, to another painting: "CALICO CAT, by WALTER KEANE." Then, another: "IN THE GARDEN, by WALTER KEANE." Every painting is now by Walter Keane. We move along. finding the Tipsy Man chatting up Dick.
HIPSTER MAN: Exactly. I love it. We move in tight on the painting. Underneath is a tag: "BEDTIME, by WALTER KEANE. Oil on canvas." We drift along, to another painting: "CALICO CAT, by WALTER KEANE." Then, another: "IN THE GARDEN, by WALTER KEANE." Every painting is now by Walter Keane. We move along. finding the Tipsy Man chatting up Dick.
TIPSY MAN: We got in early. We own three.
MARGARET: ( NERVOUS )
MARGARET: Well. he's more established.
MARGARET: Thanks for coming. Margaret grabs a drink and hurries away. Dee-Ann stands there, irked. Margaret cuts over to Walter. We MOVE IN TIGHT ON THE COUPLE. He grins and grabs her.
WALTER: Ah, my sweet! Are you enjoying the ( he gives her a kiss )
EVERYONE!: ( MORE ) WALTER ( CONT'D )
TIPSY MAN: Your husband's quite a talent.
MARGARET: I don't. know.
AT WALTER: A NOSY GUY corners him in front of a painted child.
NOSY GUY: I'm curious about your technique. How long did that piece take to execute?
WALTER: That? Oh, wow. Probably. months. First the thinking, the sketching, and then time with just me and the oils.
NOSY GUY: "Oils"? But isn't that acrylic.? Huh? Walter glances at the painting, startled.
WALTER: Oh ! You mean that painting! Uhh, sorry! It's like a jumble of ideas, rattling around in my brain! So where do you get your ideas?
NOSY GUY: So where do you get your ideas?
WALTER: What do you mean?
NOSY GUY: I mean ( confused at this confusion ) Why are they. images of children? Yikes. Walter starts to sweat. He didn't think this through.
WALTER: Well, er, I've just always loved kids. Though mostly I was influenced by my darling daughter. An odd beat.
WALTER: I remember when she was a baby. Walter gets a far-off look.
WALTER: Yeah. Cute little thing. I'd stare into those big orbs. Sometimes I'd get out my Brownie and snap a photo. but. that's not subjective. You know? It doesn't capture your feelings. So that's when I started painting her. We hold on Walter, unsure where reality begins and ends.
JANE: Mom! I wanna come in.
JANE: ( she BANGS again ) Let me in! What are you doing in there? Why's the door always locked?
WALTER: Janie, sweetie, you need to respect your mother's privacy. Sometimes grownups need alone time.
WALTER: Whew! Out of this world.!
MARGARET: ( BOTHERED )
WALTER: Ah, Jane's grand! She's eating ice cream! She has new shoes. She has a college fund. Maybe I'm lightheaded from the turpentine. I've been in here all day.
MARGARET: Maybe I'm lightheaded from the turpentine. I've been in here all day.
WALTER: Well I don't want you feeling like a prisoner. Take a break! Walter glances at one PAINTING then does a take.
WALTER: Is that a tear.? You've gone deep! Margaret bites her fingers, worried.
MARGARET: Do you like it?
WALTER: I love it! .How'd you get the eyes so lifelike? Is it the highlights?
MARGARET: ( PROUD )
WALTER: I owe you an apology. I was initially dismissive of your kids, those emotion- wrenching blobs of humanity. but they have a real strength.
MARGARET: ( SHE LAUGHS )
WALTER: I'm trying! Ah, you know me. See this is why I need your help! I want to go on tv, to defend our art.
MARGARET: You're going to be on television?!
WALTER: Yes! But. what will I say??
MARGARET: Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession with little girls.
WALTER: ( SHE SNICKERS )
MARGARET: ( SHE SNICKERS )
WALTER: Funny! Keep 'em coming! You're a regular Steve Allen. You want heat this winter? Help me out!
MARGARET: Walter. art is personal. Walter picks up a picture of TWO LITTLE GIRLS IN TUTUS. He stares, perplexed.
WALTER: What would make a grown man paint a picture like this?! No answer. He thinks of stories, wheels spinning.
WALTER: I grew up, surrounded by six sisters.
MARGARET: What about your Paris street scenes? Why do you paint those?
WALTER: Well, because. I lived it! I experienced it!
MARGARET: ( calling his bluff ) And was it really all sun-dappled streets and flower vendors? Huh? Walter stares off at the Waifs. They peer out from broken windows. chain-link fences. And then he gets it.
WALTER: Well NO! Of course not. It was after the War. There was destruction I traveled the Continent. The ravages were horrifying.
WALTER: Good afternoon! Delighted! ( he reaches the SEXY BLONDE CLERK and pinches her ass ) How many sales today?
BLONDE CLERK: "Sales?" None with this crowd. Walter's smile drops, surprised.
BLONDE CLERK: These people are looky-loos! They can't afford the paintings. But we gave away a heap of posters! Huh? Walter peers, baffled. Suddenly a loud FRWWIPPPP! Walter whirls, startled. Outside, two GIRLS tear a big poster off the front window. Walter's eyes widen. Slowly, he turns back. At the counter, FOLKS and KIDS are grabbing free posters from a box. Walter stares. Processing this. And then. being struck by an idea of absolute genius.
ANIMATION: WALTER'S VOICE
WALTER'S VOICE: And then. we could sell it anywhere!! EVERYWHERE! 60's-style MADISON AVENUE GRAPHICS: A still of a HARDWARE STORE. Mops, light bulbs, then BING! framed KEANES. A PHARMACY. Aspirin, candy bars BING! framed KEANES. A GAS STATION. Tires, motor oil, and BING! KEANES.
LATER: Margaret rabidly paints. Spurting globs of color. The woman is blonde, almond eyes cool, lips curled with mystery. Margaret glances in a mirror. It's a self-portrait. It's Margaret, aloof. Alone at a table. Suddenly the door opens. Margaret GASPS, startled, and spins the canvas away. Walter barges in, dressed like a million. He HALTS making a sour face.
WALTER: Whew! Something smells in here. You should open a window. Margaret blinks, a bit dazed.
MARGARET: What time is it?
WALTER: I dunno. 6:30, 7? .Didn't Janie get dinner? Margaret shrugs. Walter leans in.
WALTER: When's the last time you washed your I've been. busy.
MARGARET: I've been. busy.
WALTER: ( he notices the turned canvas; he's intrigued ) What do you got back there? Lemme No ! It's just. something I'm working on. It's not for the world. Walter gives her a funny look.
MARGARET: No ! It's just. something I'm working on. It's not for the world. Walter gives her a funny look.
WALTER: "The world"? Baby, it's me! ( stepping forward, a bit
MALEVOLENT ): I'm your number one fan.
MARGARET: No, please! Walter, it's personal.
WALTER: ( GETTING CLOSER )
WALTER: It's a completely different style.
MARGARET: Yes it is.
WALTER: ( BEAT )
MARGARET: It's a self-portrait. How am I gonna explain that? She shifts about.
WALTER: How am I gonna explain that? She shifts about.
MARGARET: I thought. maybe. I could sign it Hmm. Walter's eyes narrow.
WALTER: That seems a bit confusing. "Keane" means me.
MARGARET: Yes, I know. but. when people ask me if I paint, I don't know what to answer! I just want the pride of being able to say that's mine. Walter's wheels are ratcheting.
WALTER: Who'd you tell about the Big Eyes?
MARGARET: ( PARANOID )
WALTER: ( PARANOID )
MARGARET: No! NOBODY saw it!
WALTER: You tell anybody, the empire COLLAPSES! Do you wanna give back the money? We've committed FRAUD!
MARGARET: I KNOW! My God! I live with this every minute of my life!
WALTER: Janie thinks I'm in here, painting.
MARGARET: C'mon! You haven't picked up a brush in months! ( starting to sob ) We used to paint together! Easels next to each other, side-by-side
WALTER: That was the honeymoon period! Margaret breaks into tears. Walter tenses.
WALTER: Jesus, you're so fragile.
MARGARET: I've kept my end of the bargain! I've never told! ( she SOBS harder ) Please! Just let me have this! Walter recoils, unable to take this. He relents.
DICK: So you're now called "The Painting Yep! Walter and his girls! With galleries in three cities!
WALTER: Yep! Walter and his girls! With galleries in three cities!
DICK: I had no idea Margaret painted.
WALTER: Yeah, we don't talk about it. Sadly, people don't buy lady art.
MARGARET: ( INTERJECTING )
WALTER: The bar's over there. Dick goes to get a refill. Walter shoots Margaret a look.
WALTER: Yeah, Margaret's a superb artist, in her own way. I even steal a few tips from her, now and then!
DICK: True true. So Margaret, where do you get your ideas?
MARGARET: ( a bit tentative ) Oh. from the world around me. And I love Modigliani's use of line.
DICK: ModiWHAT? The Italian joint?
WALTER: Oh, for Christ's sake, Margaret! Dick writes a gossip column
WALTER: What a talent! Look at these Keanes! If you cut open our veins, we bleed oil! Er turpentine.
JANE: Who's that?
WALTER: Ah! A little treat! The fourth member of the Painting Keanes! Margaret and Jane turn, confused. Walter whips open
WALTER: Lily, honey, how are you?! He gives her a giant hug. She responds stiffly a girl who doesn't see her father too often.
LILY: I'm fine, Dad. I lost a tooth.
WALTER: Really? Did you get in a fight?
LILY: ( SHE LAUGHS )
WALTER: Well is the tooth fairy somethin' I gotta deal with, or did your mother already handle it?
LILY: ( DRY )
WALTER: Good! Good good! Well, just go throw your stuff in the kids' room, then you can come join the fun! Lily toddles out.
DICK: Walter. you never told me you had another daughter.
WALTER: Didn't I? Sure. Lil's from my first Margaret struggles to hold her rage. Disoriented.
MARGARET: ( URGENT )
MARGARET: What is going on here??!
WALTER: That's Lily. I'm sure I mentioned her
MARGARET: No you didn't.
MARGARET: Did she just move in??
WALTER: No! Her mom's just going to Vegas for the weekend.
MARGARET: How can you keep something so big a TIGHT - WALTER He starts to answer. then gives her a look: You are kidding? Walter squirms defensively.
WALTER: She's a sweet girl.
MARGARET: ( HISSING )
WALTER: I put up with your daughter. I never said a peep. Margaret's jaw drops.
MARGARET: I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
WALTER: I'm sorry. Sorry! Please. let's just try to get through this.
LILY: Dad told me you had a bunk bed.
JANE: Take the bed. I can sleep on the
FLOOR: No, that's not fair! The floor's fine for me. Jane smiles nervously. She stares at this new girl.
LILY: No, that's not fair! The floor's fine for me. Jane smiles nervously. She stares at this new girl.
JANE: Do you live far away?
LILY: I guess. about a twenty minute drive.
JANE: ( STARTLED )
JANE: But you never see Walter?
LILY: No, I see him all the time! He comes up and visits every week. Jane is taken aback. Lily sees this.
LILY: Doesn't he talk about me?
JANE: ( LYING )
JANE: Does he talk about me?
LILY: ( LYING )
JANE: ( PLEASED )
LILY: She's pretty. She drives a Buick. She cries a lot.
JANE: Yeah, mine's the same.
JANE: I have some peanut butter hidden in my sock drawer. Do you wanna eat it? Lily smiles: Sure. Jane opens a drawer and removes a jar of Skippy. The two girls sit on the floor, happily eating the peanut butter with their fingers.
WALTER: Yeah, Walter Keane and Gauguin have a lot in common. They both walked away from successful careers to travel the globe, live on a boat. We move. finding Margaret alone in a small ANNEX. It displays a few of her sad blondes, alongside Jane and Lily's paintings of flowers and Mr. Potato-Head. Margaret sits, seeming like an adult at the children's table. An urbane RICH MAN glides by. and is taken with one of Margaret's nubile blondes. He gazes at the lounging figure. Margaret sits up. Alert, pleased with his interest. She tingles. Then, happily excited, unable to hold it in:
MARGARET: I painted it!
RICH MAN: ( IMPRESSED )
RICH MAN: "MDH"? You're so. mysterioso.
MARGARET: Yes, we don't use my name, since people don't take women's art "MDH" are my initials. And more! I'm interested in numerology. and as you know, seven is a very good number.
RICH MAN: ( PUZZLED )
MARGARET: Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret Doris Hawkins! "M" is the 13th letter of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals 16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven! The man's head is spinning. He's lost all interest. Across the room, Walter sees this debacle. He marches over.
WALTER: Psst! Maggie! Can I have a second? ( he PULLS HER ASIDE ) Good grief! What the hell are you babbling about?! Long division?? Could you please help the world and shut your mouth? You want just one number in his head: The sales price! Her face drops, hurt. Acquiescing.
WATCHING THIS: Two SNOBBY ARTISTS smirk and GROAN at this scene.
RUBEN: Christ. It's a movement.
MARGARET: Rembrandt, shush! In the foyer, Margaret opens the front door. And standing there is Dee-Ann. Dazzled. She laughs with surprise.
MARGARET: Yeah. That driveway is long. ( she giggles, embarrassed ) Honestly, I can't believe I live here. Dee-Ann glides in then freezes, agape.
MARGARET: I know! Two acres, a pool, five
BEDROOMS: ( PAUSE )
MARGARET: ( CONFUSED; BEAT )
MARGARET: I know. North Beach is 30 miles, but it might as well be 300.
MARGARET: Oh, please! She's Walter's friend. ( a quiet shrug ) He brings people by. the Beach Boys were here. But, it's pretty isolated. Dee-Ann goes silent. Margaret seems dwarfed by the house.
MARGARET: Jane has nice friends. Sometimes I pick them up at the junior high, and we all get pizza.
MARGARET: Good! I'll whip us up two gin fizzes. Margaret forces a smile and scurries behind a giant curved wet bar. She pulls out ingredients: Gin, lemon juice, soda.
MARGARET: When we moved in, I thought a wet bar was extravagant. but it's surprising how much use you can get out of it. Dee-Ann watches the drinkmaking.
MARGARET: He couldn't be happier. He has everything he ever dreamed of.
MARGARET: No ! You can't go in
MARGARET: Dee-Ann, please! STOP Margaret rushes to block her but Dee-Ann pushes open the door, revealing.
MARGARET: W-Walter paints in here too. Dee-Ann walks about, examining the canvases. Then, her gaze settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on. Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint. Margaret sucks in her breath. Dee-Ann sees this.
WIDE: Both women startle. FOOTSTEPS. Then. Walter strides in! Margaret's eyes pop. Walter's pop even bigger. He glares at the ladies.
WALTER: What the hell's going on here?!!
MARGARET: ( TIMID )
WALTER: You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done! Walter rushes to the Waif, then for show grabs up the wet brush and quickly starts to "finish" the painting. Suddenly an odd expression crosses his face. He eyeballs the canvas, realizing he doesn't know what to do. A furtive glance. Then, unbowed, he hastily dips the brush and slaps a little black onto the shaded background. Walter spins, victorious.
WALTER: CUT TO:
WALTER: You and your whole non-representational crowd are FRAUDS!!
WALTER: Get outta my house! My big house!
OUTSIDE: Dee-Ann GUNS the engine and squeals away. The car peels down the very long driveway. Margaret and Walter watch the car disappear into the distance. Without looking over, Walter speaks.
WALTER: I don't want her ever invited here Margaret nods, terribly sad.
MARGARET: I won't.
JANE: Go, Rembrandt! Get the ball! She tumbles, and Rembrandt licks her ear. She giggles.
MARGARET: Okay, honey. I have to go work.
JANE: Can I come? ( an awkward silence ) No. I can never come. No! I shouldn't even ask. Jane glares glumly. Margaret peers hopelessly at her daughter. then goes inside.
MARGARET: Where did you appear from? Didn't you hear? No visitors! Rembrandt wags his tail, his little eyes bright. Margaret Is this what it's come to? You're the only living soul I can tell my secret? ( she lowers her voice ) Well I painted them all! ( she shudders with release ) It's TRUE! I did every single one She gestures, then catches sight of a Walter street scene.
MARGARET: Is this what it's come to? You're the only living soul I can tell my secret? ( she lowers her voice ) Well I painted them all! ( she shudders with release ) It's TRUE! I did every single one She gestures, then catches sight of a Walter street scene.
MARGARET: Well, every one except that street But I did the rest. Every Big Eye! And nobody will ever know. But YOU. Rembrandt pants and BARKS. Margaret chuckles, then goes to work. She pulls a CURTAIN across the sliding glass door. At her easel, she squirts a tube into a well and starts mixing colors. Rembrandt jumps on the couch.
MARGARET: No you don't! It's nice to have company, but that sofa is new. ( she pushes him off ) Let's find you some carpet to lay on.
MARGARET: I think there's a scrap back here. She rummages, sliding the junk aside. In back is a TATTERED
MARGARET: Well what's this? Margaret swings the bulb closer. The crate is covered with SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS and international markings. Margaret's interest is piqued. She tugs at the lid, pulling it off. Revealing inside a STACK OF STREET SCENE PAINTINGS. Ten or fifteen of Walter's canvases. Or so it seems.
LATER: 2:30 a.m. Margaret still stares at the clock. She's stewing. Suddenly, keys in the door. Walter swings in, tanked and full of life. He skids across the marble, humming to himself when he's startled by his wife. He jerks.
WALTER: M-Maggie! What're you doin' up? Margaret glares. Not speaking. He shrugs.
WALTER: I had a helluva night. Worked three or four clubs. ( he winks, loosey-goosey ) Stumbled onto some hot gossip: Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming to town! Straight from Taipei! I think we should present her with a painting get Dick to flack it.
MARGARET: Maybe you should give her one of your street scenes.
WALTER: ( HAZY )
MARGARET: No, Walter. She's a dignitary. Doesn't she deserve a piece that comes straight from you?
WALTER: Yeah? Maybe you're right. She probably doesn't have a Parisian street scene hanging in her palace. Margaret nods, as if they've settled something. She turns to walk away then suddenly SPINS.
MARGARET: Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already has a Cenic.
ON WALTER: He freezes up. Suddenly sober, smacked to reality.
WALTER: "Cenic".? Uh, what's that? Margaret stares, eyes sharp.
MARGARET: Cenic is the name of the artist who did all your early paintings.
WALTER: ( spinning his lie ) Urgh. oh! CENIC! ( he laughs crazily ) Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All my art school pals loved my scenic views, so they called me "Scenic"! But since those Frogs can't pronounce a hard "e," I became "Cenic." He looks up at her hopefully. But she shakes her head.
MARGARET: The more you lie, the smaller you seem.
WALTER: ( unyielding, scrambling ) How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm proud of my early Cenics!
MARGARET: Then why do you paint over the name? Walter gasps, floored. Margaret bores in.
MARGARET: A bit of advice: Don't use a water- base over an oil. It flecks off. Walter cowers.
WALTER: You sound crazy! For God's sake. You've. you've SEEN me paint!!!!
MARGARET: No, I haven't.
WALTER: I studied art in Paris. I went to school at the Beaux-Arts. The Grand Chaumiere. I spent hours in the Louvre, gazing at the greatness of the He turns. She winces, pained.
MARGARET: He turns. She winces, pained.
MARGARET: Have you even been to Paris? Walter blanches. He shakes, broken up. He looks away, then staggers to a chair. He falls into it. Trembling. Not able to look her in the eye.
WALTER: I wanted. I so wanted to be an artist. But it just never turned out good. Margaret stares, seething. Then, without comment, she storms away. She SLAMS the door shut. BANG! Walter doesn't move.
MARGARET: I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. I I can't keep living these lies.
WALTER: What are you working on?
MARGARET: A new MDH. Something for me. It's about a woman trapped in an uncaring world. I call it, "Escape." Walter bites his lip, afraid to talk.
WALTER: I figured out a solution to our Teach me.
MARGARET: Teach me.
WALTER: Teach me.
MARGARET: And then YOU'LL paint them?
WALTER: Sure! Why not?
MARGARET: ( OFFENDED )
WALTER: Y-you're right!
MARGARET: If you knew the basics, you wouldn't be at the easel. You have to sketch it first! Walter tightens, feeling stupid. He lets go of the canvas. Margaret stares, deciding. Then, she tosses him a PAD. Walter catches it. Slowly, he crosses over.
WALTER: So.? What's first?
MARGARET: I dunno. You tell me. You're the He frowns.
WALTER: It's a Keane.
MARGARET: Oh, a Keane! How witty.
WALTER: YEAH YEAH! Point taken. I'm standing here naked and humiliated in front of you. Look. can we just do a crying She gazes at him. Fingering her pencil. Trying to jump-start things, he starts to draw a circle
MARGARET: How old is the subject?
WALTER: Huh? C'mon, it's a head
MARGARET: It matters! A young child's head is round. An older child's head is oval! He feels pressured. Hand shaking, he draws a crooked circle.
WALTER: The child is this old!
MARGARET: NO I'M NOT! Every line is a decision!
LATER: Walter finally paints. We can't see the canvas, but he's very meticulous. His expression quite earnest. He adds a final flourish. and then. a flicker of pride crosses his face. He smiles.
MARGARET: Then he SCREAMS and smashes her CANVAS. BAM!!! The painting RIPS apart. Walter KICKS his foot through the remains, then spins and charges from the room.
WALTER: How's SALES?
REDHEAD CLERK: Oh, you know. Mondays Walter MUTTERS strangely. He snatches some paper and starts scribbling. Then he runs into the
STORAGE ROOM: Walter agitatedly paces, circling the stacks of PRINTS.
WALTER: How many posters are back here?
REDHEAD CLERK: Exactly? I dunno, 3,000 or
WALTER: Does the printer owe us more? Do we owe him??
REDHEAD CLERK: Uh, let me
WALTER: What about the OILS?! Are there more at the warehouse?
REDHEAD CLERK: Mr. Keane, I'd have to make a
WALTER: For the LOVE OF MUD! What am I PAYING you for? The girl freezes, rattled. Walter spins, flipping out.
WALTER: Hypothetical question: If you were a man, would you marry Kim Novak or my Okay! Different question! If I got crippled and had to stop painting, how long before the gallery ran out of inventory and went belly up??
WALTER: Okay! Different question! If I got crippled and had to stop painting, how long before the gallery ran out of inventory and went belly up??
REDHEAD CLERK: ( RATTLED )
WALTER: What's it all mean? Why are we put on this earth? A 100 years from now, will people even know we existed.?
REDHEAD CLERK: ( UNCOMFORTABLE )
WALTER: It's not even mine! It's one of hers. Aching, he staggers off. Sweating, woozy, he sits at a table. Distracted, he glances down at a newspaper.
MAITRE'D: Ah! Monsieur and Madame Keane! Delighted! Always such an honor! ANGLE on the Keanes. They are sullen. At wit's end.
WALTER: This doesn't change anything.
MARGARET: ( trying to hold her ground ) I know the truth.
WALTER: Who cares?! This is all your fault! Maybe it's time to shake things up. Start puttin' my name on the MDH's. Margaret is astonished. A fury crosses her face.
MARGARET: NO! Absolutely NOT!! I still hate myself for giving you the Waifs!
WALTER: Quiet! Lower your voice
MARGARET: Oh, I'll talk as LOUD AS I WANT
WALTER: NO YOU WON'T! Or
MARGARET: If you tell ANYONE, if you squeal, I'll take you out! I I know people. Remember Banducci's cousin? The liquor wholesaler? Pause. Margaret breaks into tears.
WALTER: If you tell ANYONE, if you squeal, I'll take you out! I I know people. Remember Banducci's cousin? The liquor wholesaler? Pause. Margaret breaks into tears.
MARGARET: You're threatening me.?! Fine, kill me! My God, I've kept our secret for years! I've never once
WALTER: Christ, wipe your face! You look a It's life imitating art! A crying He hands her his handkerchief. She dabs at her eyes. A looming quiet.
MARGARET: What do you want, Walter? Everything with you is calculated. We're back where we had our first date. Walter's eyes widen. We MOVE IN TIGHT on them. He drops his voice. Dead serious.
WALTER: Look, I don't deny I need you. You're the one with the gift.
MARGARET: What masterpiece?
WALTER: Exactly! What have I been missing all this time?! Da Vinci has his Mona Lisa. Renoir has his Boatmen's Lunch. but where's my defining You sound insane. Artists don't announce a masterpiece
MARGARET: You sound insane. Artists don't announce a masterpiece
WALTER: Why not?! Didn't Michelangelo know he was hittin' a homer, when he was on his back painting the Sistine Chapel?
MARGARET: He worked on that for FOUR YEARS!
WALTER: Posterity, baby.!! She empties her drink.
WALTER: And here's the best part. It's for Unicef! Unicef is sponsoring the Hall of Education. Aw, we can finally give back to the children of the world!! Margaret stares, wavering.
MARGARET: It's too big. Why'd you promise them Cinerama size?
WALTER: Because it has to encompass all children. All races! One hundred stricken faces! Marching to infinity! The ultimate Walter Keane!
WALTER: Oh, a publisher says it's good timing to put out a coffee table book. You know, classy: "Tomorrow's Masters."
MARGARET: You're right! Where are your preliminary sketches?? All that time in art school, and somehow we waylaid your youthful experiments! The half- finished charcoals, the struggles.
WALTER: ( a bit off-balance ) I know you're being sarcastic, but these are all good ideas. Berlin war orphans. early self-portraits.
MARGARET: Get out of here. I'm trying to work. She brusquely spins away, back to the canvas. He shoots her an uncertain, dirty look. What just happened?
JANE: Mom, what's for dinner?
MARGARET: W-what are you doing in here ?
JANE: Mom. I know.
MARGARET: Jane, you don't know anything!! Jane's face tightens. Insulted.
JANE: I'm not a child anymore.
CANADAY: Four. five. SIX pages! Is there something here I'm missing?
CANADAY: "Will be unveiled in the Grand Pavilion of the Hall of Education. internationally celebrated artist has been selected. will represent the aspirations of children worldwide "
CANADAY: And WHO was on the selection committee?
CIVIC LEADER: Oh! Well there wasn't a "committee," per se. We just had a luncheon with me, Ed, Jerome, Jerome's wife.
WALTER: Stop. Let us appreciate this moment. This is what we've worked toward our whole lives: Rarified air. Inside this house are the movers and shakers. Kennedys. Rockefellers.
MARGARET: I was happier selling paintings in the He gapes, appalled.
WALTER: You are one crazy bitch. Walter spins and grandly enters. He grabs two CHAMPAGNES from a server.
WALTER: So maybe you have problems with the choices we made. but c'mon! Wednesday, the World's Fair opens. Thursday, our book goes on sale!
MARGARET: Friday, I file for divorce.
WALTER: Aw, why are you always so miserable?
WALTER: Mrs. Teasdale! Walter Keane. I just want to thank you for hosting this absolutely enchanting soiree. Walter takes the woman's hand. She smiles stiffly, silently horrified. She glances around for help. She catches a SOCIETY MAN's eye, and he hurries over.
SOCIETY MAN: Hey, Keane. Have you seen the Times?
WALTER: Er, no. Honestly, I've been so busy all day preparing for this lovely
SOCIETY MAN: I think you should read the Times. The Man gestures. Perplexed, the Keanes follow him into a
THE KEANES: stare, then turn pale.
"GROTESQUE" "APPALLING": "Lowest common denominator"
"TASTELESS": "Lowest common denominator"
MARGARET: How could anyone. say something so ( a seething fury ) What do YOU care?! That's MY name being dragged through the mud! Walter CRUSHES the newspaper. He spins on the guy.
WALTER: ( a seething fury ) What do YOU care?! That's MY name being dragged through the mud! Walter CRUSHES the newspaper. He spins on the guy.
WALTER: Is he here?
SOCIETY MAN: Er. yes. Which is perhaps why it would be best for everybody if you Walter STORMS out. The guy futilely chases
WALTER: WHO WROTE THIS SHIT? People cower. Walter scans the crowd. and spots a cluster. Ah-hah! There is Canaday. Possessed, Walter strides over. Canaday stares, defiant. It's tense until he clears his throat.
CANADAY: Mr. Keane, this is not the venue. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to the editor. Walter's throat tightens. He steps right into the guy's face. Women GASP. Tension bristles like a fight's about to erupt.
WALTER: What are you afraid of??
CANADAY: No. But that doesn't make it art Walter shudders. Canaday asserts himself.
CANADAY: Art should elevate not pander! Particularly in a Hall of Education!
WALTER: ( OFFENDED )
CANADAY: Ugh! That moldy chestnut
WALTER: Don't interrupt! You don't know what it's like! To put your emotions out there, naked, for the world to see.
CANADAY: What emotions?! It's synthetic hack ( he loses it ) Your "masterpiece" has an infinity of Keanes which just makes it an infinity of kitsch! Crazed, Walter grabs a FORK off the buffet. He lunges, like he's about to STAB Canaday!
WIDE: Women SCREAM. A few MUSCULAR MEN start to break through, to help.
WALTER: looks around then quivers, realizing he's out of control. Shamed, he slowly drops the fork. People breathe a sigh of relief.
MARGARET: is mortified. This is all too awful. Silent, she watches Walter back out of the party.
WALTER: What's wrong with lowest common denominators?! That's what this country was built on!! He KNOCKS over a lamp. Crash!
WALTER: I'm gonna sue EVERYBODY! I'll sue that pansy critic! And the World's Fair! And Unicef!
WALTER: But I can't sue you, can I? ( in Margaret's face ) You were the ultimate betrayal! You FAILED me with that painting! Suddenly, he pulls out a BOOK OF MATCHES. He lights a MATCH and waves it sinisterly
WALTER: You crossed over from sentimentality to KITSCH! He THROWS the match at them.
JANE: STOP IT! He lights ANOTHER MATCH.
MARGARET: STOP IT! He lights ANOTHER MATCH.
STOP IT!: He lights ANOTHER MATCH.
WALTER: You like making me look bad?? You enjoy people laughing at me??! He PUNCHES the wall, then tosses the match. Fwoosh!
MARGARET: He throws ANOTHER MATCH.
WIDE: Margaret grabs Jane and starts running. They rush into the blackness. Walter squints woozily, then starts to CHASE
WALTER: LET ME IN! INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret LOCKS the door. She backs away.
WALTER: Lemme in, you BITCHES!!
WALTER: INSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret hugs Jane.
JANE: Mom, what are we gonna do??! Margaret thinks.
WALTER: You got all that paint and turpentine in there? Well I'm gonna burn you up! He pushes the lit match through the KEYHOLE.
WALTER: You're gonna blow like an atom bomb!
MARGARET: We're leaving. Determined, Margaret runs to the curtained wall. She whips it aside revealing the sliding glass doors.
MARGARET: I'm sorry I wasn't the mother I could have been. I I should have done this years ago.
JANE: But where are we going?
MARGARET: Where we're going, we won't need much.
JANE: Margaret smiles softly. We slowly PUSH IN to her.
MARGARET: Yes, Hawaii. Because it's paradise. There's flowers, and birds, and beautiful colors.
MARGARET: WALTER ( O.S. ) Maggie ? She freezes.
WALTER: Boy, you were sure hard to track down. Thought I might never find you. ( a menacing chuckle ) I'm a little agitated. I got the strangest papers in the mail today. Margaret tries to stay cool.
MARGARET: It's a decree of legal separation. I would appreciate if you signed it.
WALTER: Aren't you acting too rash?
MARGARET: Walter, our marriage is over.
WALTER: Granted, our romance may have seen its better days. The bloom is off the But I'm looking out for both of us. What about Keane Incorporated?! We're a professional couple. Like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
MARGARET: Walter, I want a divorce.
WALTER: Whew. It hurts to hear you say those Silence. He is feigning "hurt feelings." Struggling for a response. Finally, his thoughts sharpen up, smart and shrewd.
WALTER: I sure hate that it's come to this.
MARGARET: If that's the price.
WALTER: Walter is surprised. Greedy, calculating, he wonders if he can push her further.
WALTER: Uh okay. And. then, we have to consider future revenue stream.
MARGARET: My God, Walter! How much more money do you need?
WALTER: It's the marketplace! I gotta stay fresh. Surely you understand?
MARGARET: Would you like to go into town? I'm stopping by the post office.
JANE: No, I'm gonna surf with the gang. Margaret tightens up.
MARGARET: Your friends are a bit. wild.
JANE: ( SHE SNAPS )
MARGARET: Y-you know I can't have people over to the house.
JANE: That's right! Or they'd see the precious paintings!!
MARGARET: I'm not interested. She starts to close the door. but they continue.
MARGARET: I'm not interested in whatever you're The lady glances at Margaret's glass. She smiles gently.
MARGARET: ( DOUR )
MARGARET: Sounds like my ex-husband. Margaret laughs. Surprised, the women laugh, too. Margaret peers at them. At their Bible.
MARGARET: Would you like to come in?
LATER: The three women sit. Margaret gazes.
MARGARET: It's been so long since I've been happy. But, I don't even know why I'm telling you. two complete strangers.
MARGARET: So you're Jehovah's Witnesses?
MARGARET: I've explored so many religions. But they all had their flaws.
MARGARET: And how do you know.?
MARGARET: What does that mean, exactly?
MARGARET: It says here a worshiper of Jehovah must be honest in all things. Jane snorts.
JANE: I just can't believe you let people in the house.
MARGARET: I have nothing to hide!
HIPPIE CHICK: Shit, this is crazy! All these copies. you're like Warhol!
WALTER: Nah, Warhol's like me. That fruitfly stole my act! "The Factory"? I had a factory before he had a soup can! The girls scrunch their faces, lost. Then DING-DONG! Walter peeks out the window, then grins.
WALTER: Ah! It's my art supplies.
WALTER: CUT TO:
AAAGGGGHH!: CUT TO:
JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES: "Tremble not before your foe, Let all lovers of truth know! That my reigning Son, Christ Jesus, From the heav'ns has cast the foe. Soon will bind the Devil, Satan, Letting all his victims go!" Margaret and Jane are singing happily.
MARGARET: No. Big Lolo. Everything you just said is false. Margaret takes a deep breath. Working up her courage.
MARGARET: One: Walter is no longer my husband. ( a long pause ) And Two: He's not. a painter. Margaret exhales. The D.J. is confused. He checks his notes.
MARGARET: No. Though he's been taking credit for ten years.
CANADAY: You have got to be kidding!
RUBEN: Who would WANT credit?!
WALTER: Holy mother of GOD! Walter JERKS UP feral like an animal sensing danger. He whirls and looks around. Paranoia ratcheting. Is everybody staring at him? Walter starts shaking in horror. Then he jumps and BOLTS OUT.
WALTER: Margaret's gone berserk! You gotta help me! I need a story, a wire story national! to calm things down. Dick peers shrewdly.
DICK: I don't know. Walter. What she has said is pretty inflammatory.
WALTER: But it's nuts! It doesn't even make sense. When I was studying art at the Beaux Arts in Paris, she was still a kid in Tennessee! Dick reacts. Walter whips out the "Tomorrow's Master's" BOOK.
WALTER: Look! These are my early sketches. ( he flips pages, like a
MAGICIAN ): See?! Berlin orphans, 1946!
DICK: ( PIQUED )
WALTER: Exactly! It's impossible! We didn't meet for another nine years! After she busted her first marriage.
DICK: I-I, but. why would Maggie do this?
WALTER: She's unhinged! She left me and moved into the jungle. She fell in with a bunch of religious zealots:
DICK: I really don't know much about them.
WALTER: Oh! These people are gone! Solid gone! They don't celebrate Christmas, they can't salute the flag. they won't even let Janie go to the prom! Dick is startled.
MARGARET: He made me sound crazy!!
MARGARET: But how can I?! He claims I copied HIM! That he taught ME how to paint! ( reading the NEWSPAPER ) "She used a slide projector to trace my work and fill in the colors."
MARGARET: ALL OF IT! When I finally told the truth, I felt good about myself for the first time in years!! I'm not going to let him take that away. Nobody is sure what to say. Until Jane pipes up:
JANE: Hey. Is Jehovah okay with suing??
REPORTER #1: Seventeen million dollars!
REPORTER #2: Or is Mrs. Keane simply a bitter ex- wife, trying to steal her husband's fame and fortune?
REPORTER #1: Mr. Keane! Are you at all concerned about the charges?
WALTER: I'm angry as hell! But I'm lucky to have the mighty Gannett News Company watching my back. I expect to have this whole trial dismissed by noon.
GANNETT LAWYER: Margaret Keane is a public figure. And as such, she has to prove that our newspapers published statements, aware of probable falsity.
JUDGE: How many years back do these go?
GANNETT LAWYER: Mrs. Keane has been making these statements since 1958. This is a very strange case. These paintings hang in museums all over the world, attributed to Mr. Keane. And regardless of the truth, Mrs. Keane has contributed immeasurably to the The Judge stares off. then makes a decision.
JUDGE: This is a very strange case. These paintings hang in museums all over the world, attributed to Mr. Keane. And regardless of the truth, Mrs. Keane has contributed immeasurably to the The Judge stares off. then makes a decision.
JUDGE: It seems impossible that Gannett's actions would ever meet the legal standard for libel. So the charge against them is dismissed.
WIDE: The Lawyer smiles, relieved.
GANNETT LAWYER: Thank you, Your Honor!
GANNETT LAWYER: Good luck, Keane.
WALTER: "Good luck"? W-where the hell are you We were charged with libel. You're charged with slander.
GANNETT LAWYER: We were charged with libel. You're charged with slander.
JUDGE: Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order? Walter glances over at Margaret. She stifles a laugh. He glares daggers. Then, cocksure, foolhardy, he jumps to his I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name!
WALTER: I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name!
TURN": INSERT - ANOTHER WIRE SERVICE MACHINE More words type out: "UPI - HONOLULU - HE'S A PAINTER. AND A
LAWYER?": INT. DICK NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY Dick frantically types at his typewriter.
WALTER: I'm the sole creator of my art. This is my total life. My contribution to the world
JUDGE: Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time.
WALTER: Oh. Right! Ah, sorry, Your Honor.
WALTER: Mrs. Keane. It seems impossible that you'd expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story
JUDGE: MR. KEANE!! Walter grimaces. He tries again, choosing his words.
MR. KEANE!!: Walter grimaces. He tries again, choosing his words.
WALTER: Mrs. Keane. You seem like a lucid woman. Reasonably intelligent. So how could you possibly have gone along with such a far-out scheme?
MARGARET: I was forced into it. You had She stops, bothered by this awkwardness. She looks away from Walter, to the Jury instead.
MARGARET: He had me dominated. He would rant and rave if I didn't do what he wanted. I was afraid. I didn't see any option, so I went along. I felt very bad.
WALTER: ( like a TV lawyer ) I want to remind you you are under The Judge SLAMS his fists down, enraged. Walter jumps.
WALTER: Margaret turns back to the Jury.
MARGARET: I just gave in. I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. They reflected all my feelings. and. it was like losing a child.
WALTER: Hm! It sounds like you've described two different men. One a sadistic ogre. and the other a delightful bon Margaret stares him in the eyes.
MARGARET: That's you, Walter. Jekyll and Hyde.
WALTER: What an outrageous statement! I demand we strike that from the record!
JUDGE: ( he SLAMS his fist ) ( she loses her temper ) No! You're outrageous! Constantly criticizing! Wearing me down! Saying I'd be "knocked off" if I ever told the truth!! The Jury GASPS. Walter throws out his hands.
MARGARET: ( she loses her temper ) No! You're outrageous! Constantly criticizing! Wearing me down! Saying I'd be "knocked off" if I ever told the truth!! The Jury GASPS. Walter throws out his hands.
WALTER: Your HONOR! I ask for a mistrial! Both Keanes starts QUARRELING. The Judge STANDS.
JUDGE: HEY! This is not a domestic squabble! Or maybe it is. But the rest of us have no interest in watching you two go at it. Walter calms himself, contrite.
WALTER: I'm sorry for the emotions. I'm an The Judge stares harshly.
JUDGE: IN THE BACK OF THE COURTROOM Two SKETCH ARTISTS are busy, drawing the trial. One guy pokes the other one, to show off his work. His SKETCH is a typical courtroom drawing, except everyone is drawn with big ridiculous Keane eyes. The second guy GIGGLES. His buddy grins, then quickly erases the silly eyes before anyone sees it.
WALTER: I call as my witness. Mr. Walter Stanley Keane! A strange beat. The Jurors glance at each other. Walter reacts, like he just heard his name. He strides jauntily over to the witness stand. The BAILIFF gives the Judge a weird look. Then, he pulls out a Bible. Walter slaps down his hand.
BAILIFF: Do you swear to the tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
WALTER: Walter bounces out, a bit manic. He runs back to his lawyer table, then spins to address the empty witness stand.
YESSS!: Walter bounces out, a bit manic. He runs back to his lawyer table, then spins to address the empty witness stand.
WALTER: Mr. Keane. There has been a lot of innuendo and contradictory testimony about the genesis of the "big-eyed waifs." Would you mind clarifying to this court, once and for all, who spawned these paintings? Walter sprints back into the witness stand. He sits, then reacts coyly, as if he's surprised.
WALTER: Why I created the children. Walter starts to stand again but the Judge SLAMS his bench.
JUDGE: The choreography is not necessary. Just sit down and testify. Oh. Walter sits, then gathers his thoughts. We slowly PUSH IN. He smiles, wistfully.
WALTER: I've had a wonderful life. I've been an artist, a world traveler, a friend of untold celebrities. ( he gets misty-eyed ) But when I look back at it all, when I peer into my heart and define what it is that I was dedicated to the hungry children of the world.
LATER: .the orphans were clutching the barbed wire. Their bodies lacerated, their fingers scrawny, their eyes big and helpless. Imploring me, begging me. "Do something!"
WALTER: .the orphans were clutching the barbed wire. Their bodies lacerated, their fingers scrawny, their eyes big and helpless. Imploring me, begging me. "Do something!"
LATER: .and then Miss Joan Crawford walked up to me.
WALTER: .and then Miss Joan Crawford walked up to me.
LATER: .Kim Novak.
WALTER: .Kim Novak.
LATER: .Wayne Newton.
WALTER: .Wayne Newton.
LATER: .Wayne Newton.
WALTER: .Wayne Newton.
LATER: Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said, "That is the greatest single painting I have ever seen in my entire life." The Judge is bored out of his mind.
WALTER: Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said, "That is the greatest single painting I have ever seen in my entire life." The Judge is bored out of his mind.
LATER: I was born in a small town. My father made upholstery for the automobile
WALTER: I was born in a small town. My father made upholstery for the automobile
INDUSTRY: You're done. Walter stops, surprised.
JUDGE: You're done. Walter stops, surprised.
WALTER: B-but, I'm not finished
JUDGE: Actually, you are! ( he blows his stack ) I cannot stomach one more wild tangent or shaggy dog tale. You're not testifying you're filibustering! The Federal Courts are overburdened enough, without your docket-clogging We can stay here until we grow old and die. but it's obvious that this case boils down to your word versus Mrs. Keane's word.
WALTER: ( HOPEFUL )
JUDGE: NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my opinion, there's only one way to clear up this thicket. You are both going to paint. Walter gasps, stunned. All color drains from his face.
BAILIFF: Awright, bring those easels down. Careful, don't bump anything. watch it with those paint cans, I got some newspaper on the floor down front. The Jury is fascinated. Margaret watches, quite eager. In the gallery, Jane grins. But Walter is horrified. Trying not to tremble.
DOWN FRONT: The Bailiff directs the deputies, setting up TWO EASELS, back to back. On each easel is placed a small square canvas. The Judge addresses the room.
JUDGE: Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. I don't know much about these things I'm a jurist, not an art critic but, is one hour enough? Margaret nods: Sure. Shaking, Walter barely moves his head.
JUDGE: Okay then. You've both been provided with identical supplies. so without any further business. Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours.
WIDE: Margaret glances at Walter. What will he do? Walter's face is grimly blank. Margaret proceeds. Slowly, she pushes her chair from the table and rises. Walter doesn't move. Margaret walks over to the closest EASEL, then sits. She ties on a smock over her checkered dress.
THE JURORS: crane their necks, intently curious.
MARGARET: takes a pencil. She peeks over at Walter who's still glued to his seat. His face tight, his expression queasy. Staring off to some faraway place. Margaret looks up at the CLOCK. 3:20. Okay then. Totally calm, in a motion she's done so many times, she focuses on the canvas and starts outlining a Waif. Everybody watches. Effortlessly, she pencils the EYES. They are enormous. The largest orbs she has ever done.
WALTER: looks ill. Wracked with uncertainty. The Judge turns to him.
JUDGE: Mr. Keane?
WALTER: ( FAINT )
JUDGE: ( BEAT )
MARGARET: fills in more detail. Ears. nose. then, little fingers clutching a fence. The child is peeking over it, staring right at us.
WALTER: is melting down. In total crisis.
THE CLOCK'S: second hand sweeps around. It's 3:34.
THE JURORS: look from Margaret to Walter. Why isn't he moving??
MARGARET: finishes penciling. She leans back, satisfied with the composition. Then, she reaches for. the PAINT. She unscrews a tube and squirts it on the palette. She rests it on her lap and starts mixing a flesh tone.
THE JUDGE: gapes at Walter, befuddled.
WALTER: feels all eyes on him. He has to do something. Hesitantly, visibly shaking, he rises from the table. Margaret notices this.
WALTER: Walter contorts his face in AGONY. He grabs his shoulder.
OW!: Walter contorts his face in AGONY. He grabs his shoulder.
JUDGE: Mr. Keane! Are you all right?
WALTER: No it's
WALTER: I I don't think I'll be able to paint today.
THE JUDGE: is astonished.
WIDE: The courtroom reacts.
MARGARET: peers at Walter, knowingly. She's not surprised. This was his only way out. A look between them and then she cocks a half-smile and turns back to the canvas. She squirts out some white oil paint, then begins painting the eyes.
WALTER: sinks down in his chair, beaten. All life gone. He stares at the emerging canvas, eyes wide, and we PUSH INTO WALTER'S FACE. He is witnessing the end of his empire. the destruction of everything that makes him who he is. We push in TIGHTER. TIGHTER. until the screen fills with his two eyes.
MARGARET: Thank you! Thank you so much.
REPORTER #2: What are you going to call the She smiles, clutching the finished Waif.
MARGARET: "Exhibit 224." They all ROAR with laughter. A Reporter does a stand-up:
REPORTER #1: The jury found in favor of Margaret Keane on all points. She won on charges of defamation, emotional distress, damaged reputation
WALTER: What a group of idiots. a quagmire of incompetence.
REPORTER #2: Margaret! Do you feel vindicated by the high award?
MARGARET: Oh. it was never about the money. And honestly I doubt Walter will even pay.
MARGARET: I just wanted credit for what I had done. The justice is. I got my art My prayers have been answered. Margaret takes Jane's hand and starts to walk away. Among the eager fans, a PORTLY LADY steps out, holding a BOOK. She smiles nervously.
PORTLY LADY: Margaret! Could I possibly have your Margaret looks down and realizes the book is Walter's volume of "TOMORROW'S MASTERS" Margaret stares at it in wonder, then quickly signs the cover.
THE END: Writers : Scott Alexander Larry Karaszewski
