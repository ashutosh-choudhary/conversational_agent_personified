CASS: I'm working, Stewart.
STEWART: Come on, take a break. ( enticing ) I've got Kahlua.
CASS: Cassidy Daley. Talk to me.

CASS: I love you! So, when? Where?
STEWART: Where ya going?
CASS: Hooters. I go there for the hot Please. Nobody goes there for the hot wings. You got a tip.
STEWART: Please. Nobody goes there for the hot wings. You got a tip.
CASS: You got a hundred bucks on you?
STEWART: Now are you gonna let me in on it?
CASS: Sorry. No can do. I have to protect my source.
STEWART: You know what? We need to talk about our relationship.
CASS: We don't have a relationship. We made out 3 years ago in the copy room. I was drunk. I was broken- hearted. I would have made out with the xerox machine.
STEWART: Yes, but you made out with me.
CASS: I have to go.
STEWART: I want in on that story!
CASS: Hey, Jimmy, I.
CASS: SCREECHING TIRES behind her. Cass glances up and sees JIMMY'S BASEBALL HAT IN THE BACK WINDOW OF A GREY CHEVY. The Chevy is racing out into traffic. Cass throws her car into reverse.
CASS: Let go of me, I'm a reporter, I'm warning you.
VOICE: PULL BACK TO REVEAL: INT CRYSTAL'S BAR/JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON Holding the flaming photo, MEET MILO: rumpled shirt, messy hair, looks like he slept on the floor. The bartender ( CRYSTAL, 50's, Eastern European ) scowls at him:
CRYSTAL: What did I say about the fires?
MILO: You said "please set fires in my bar". Wait, no, that's not right. "Please don't set fires in my bar". ( off her look ) Ok, jeez, you try to get in the holiday spirit.
CRYSTAL: Shouldn't you be working?
MILO: That's the beauty of my job, Crystal. Tracking down idiots is something you can do pretty much anywhere. See, there's one.
MILO: And there's another one.
MILO: And there's.
MILO: I don't believe it. That idiot. ( to Crystal ) Save my seat.
DWIGHT: There you are, you dipshit.
MILO: Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you fucking ding-dong.
DWIGHT: We have to stop meeting this way.
MILO: Not now, Dwight.
DWIGHT: You owe my boss money.
MILO: ( LAUGHING ) Hey, I owe everybody money.
MILO: ( BEAMING ) I am so happy you did that.
BOY: That man is killing Rudolph!
GELMAN: Release the reindeer!
GELMAN: Hands behind your head, asshole!
MILO: Take it easy, skippy, I'm just doing my job.
GELMAN: Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don't you get a real job?
MILO: So I can be like you patrol boys and sit around all day with my thumb up my ass?
GELMAN: What did you just say?
BOBBY: Milo Boyd. I shoulda known.
GELMAN: Sarg, you know this asshole?
BOBBY: Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used to be one of us.
BOBBY: Look, Milo, I know this is a tough time of year for you.
MILO: This isn't a tough time of year for me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't love Christmas?
BOBBY: .and I try to be sensitive to your situation.
MILO: What situation? Being a man who works his own hours and has his freedom and lives the high life?
BOBBY: .because I realize you're Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob? Look at me: I'm the happiest man
MILO: Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob? Look at me: I'm the happiest man
BOBBY: That sign is pretty hard to see.
MILO: He rips the sign off the pole. Stomps on it. Kicks it. Tries to shred it with his teeth. Hmm. He doesn't really seem like the happiest man alive. Rudolph, to Bobby:
AAAHHH!: He rips the sign off the pole. Stomps on it. Kicks it. Tries to shred it with his teeth. Hmm. He doesn't really seem like the happiest man alive. Rudolph, to Bobby:
RUDOLPH: Take me to jail. Please?
BOBBY: Ok, I got one for ya: why doesn't Santa have any children? Cause he only comes once a year and when he does, it's down a chimney.
BOBBY: So. Have you talked to her lately?
MILO: Talked to who?
BOBBY: Katie Couric, motherfucker, who do you think?
MILO: I haven't talked to her in three years, why would I talk to her now?
BOBBY: Well, for one thing, so you can stop taking out your rage on innocent bystanders.
RUDOLPH: ( piping up from the back ) Talk to her, man. For real.
BOBBY: Do what you want. But this kind of shit will eat a hole in your intestines, you don't deal with it.
BOBBY: Hey, why don't you come by the precinct tomorrow for our Xmas I'm not invited. I'm not a cop anymore, remember?
MILO: I'm not invited. I'm not a cop anymore, remember?
BOBBY: Fuck that, I'm inviting you.
MILO: I don't know, Bob. I'm sorta busy.
BOBBY: That's what I'm worried about. ( sighing ) Just.take it easy, Ok?
RUDOLPH: You should go to that party, man. Seriously. You need it.
MILO: Do I look like I need advice from a grown man in antlers?
VOICE: Milo. Hey. Princess.
SID: You're drooling on my sofa.
SID: You do have an apartment, don't you? With a bed of some kind?
SID: Heard you shut down 5th Street yesterday. Gave every kid in the county the gift of nightmares.
MILO: Hey, I'm a giving kind of guy. Anyway, what do you care? I brought your guy in, right?
SID: You gonna give me a hand, or just stand there killing your liver?
MILO: Is that a trick question?
SID: So I told her, fine, I'd handle Xmas this year. I mean, what's to handle? You buy a tree, some gifts, cook a ham, hang some lights. An idiot could do it.
MILO: Well, we'll soon find out.
SID: You have plans for the holiday?
MILO: The usual.
SID: Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and put your fist through a wall?
MILO: The tree is definitely not going to fit. They let it go, and Sid pulls out a small hand saw.
SID: Then forget it.
MILO: Forget what?
SID: I've got an open bond, but your thing sounds like more fun. I'll give it to Doug instead.
MILO: Whoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the fuck. I want the job, I'm in the You're always in the hole.
SID: You're always in the hole.
MILO: What's your point?
SID: ( SIGHING ) The truth is, I'm not sure you're the right person for this job. It could be a total disaster. On the other hand, when one friend sees another friend stagnating in his own filth, he has to do something, Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna
MILO: Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna
SID: Ok. But remember: you asked for it.
MILO: Are we done yet?
SID: Are we done yet?
MILO: Are we done yet?
SID: Are we done yet?
MILO: Are we done yet?
SID: Are we done yet?
MILO: Is this a joke? Because if it is, I'm gonna have to kill you.
SID: It's not a joke.
MILO: She got arrested? And then she jumped bail?
SID: Apparently the whole thing started with some reckless driving, and ended with her assaulting a police
SID: ( EXPLAINING ) She bit him.
MILO: Yeah. That sounds like her. But here's my question: why the hell did you post her bail?
SID: Hey, I know she dumped you.
MILO: Whoa. She did not "dump me".
SID: ( QUICKLY ) Ok, whatever, I.
MILO: No, not "whatever". I dumped her.
SID: The point is, I'm aware you guys have issues, but I'm running a business here. A person needs bail, I don't have time to check with you Well, had you checked with me first, you wouldn't be out of a bond right now.
MILO: Well, had you checked with me first, you wouldn't be out of a bond right now.
SID: I'm not out of a bond if you go pick her up. It's five grand to bring her back by 9am, Xmas day.
MILO: ( SLOWLY ) You're telling me it's five grand to go pick up my ex-wife and bring her to jail. ( beat ) On Xmas.
SID: You're a good listener.
SID: I take it you're interested.
MILO: I love you! You're the best friend a guy could ever have!
SID: Ok, take it easy.
TERESA: Sid, you got a DUI on line one. ( off their looks ) What's going on?
TERESA: Ok. ( beat ) Can I have my gum back?
MILO: Right. Sorry.
MILO: You know what this is, don't you? Karma! Payback! You know how they say "What goes around comes around"? Turns out it's true!
SID: I can't believe you guys broke up over a stupid article.
MILO: We didn't break up over a stupid article. We broke up because she is a cheating, manipulative liar.
SID: Are you sure you can handle this?
MILO: Why wouldn't I be able to handle Let's face it: you're not exactly rational around her. I mean, if I was a cop working a case and some reporter came snooping around, I'd say "no comment". Not "no comment, but care for a cocktail"? And then a month later, running off to some love shack called "Caveman's Cabin" and tying the knot? Who does that?
SID: Let's face it: you're not exactly rational around her. I mean, if I was a cop working a case and some reporter came snooping around, I'd say "no comment". Not "no comment, but care for a cocktail"? And then a month later, running off to some love shack called "Caveman's Cabin" and tying the knot? Who does that?
MILO: That's not even close to what happened. For one thing, it was called "Cupid's Cabin". And for another, that was before I knew how conniving she was. Now I know. So all I have to do is track her down, cuff her up, and bring her in. ( checking his watch ) And I've got, what, two days? Shit, man. Easy as
LORRAINE: ( into phone ) You tell him I know where he lives. I know where his bimbo wife takes her yoga classes, I know where his idiot son shoplifts after school, so he can pay me my money or.
LORRAINE: What the hell happened to you?
DWIGHT: Milo Boyd. Fucker head-butted me.
LORRAINE: ( not interested ) Yeah? Did you get the money?
MILO: Luck be a lady.
MILO: He stares at his collection and smiles:
MILO: ( to his weapons ) I told you this day would come.
CASS: Nope, NOT JIMMY. Milo doesn't speak. Cass listens for a moment. She can hear breathing. What the fuck? An evil grin crosses Milo's face. Cass goes pale.
MILO: You better run, you crazy bitch.
SID: Yeah. He took the job. But if this thing goes bad, I'm blaming you.
MILO: Nice dog. Very compact.
MILO: No answer. Milo glances around, then works the lock.
MILO: EXT APARTMENT/BACK DOOR- DAY Cass enters frame. Nervous looks all around as she tries the knob. Surprise: THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. She hesitates.
MILO: `Allo, love.
CASS: THE PAN CONNECTS SOLIDLY WITH A CAT. Cat goes flying, bounces off wall, lands on the coffee table, fangs bared.
CASS: So, if we didn't know already: CASS AND MILO ARE IN DIFFERENT
STEWART: ( poor liar ) .so, I heard a noise in here and became concerned.
MILO: Wrong. Try again.
STEWART: Ok, the truth is she asked me to pick up her dry-cleaning.
STEWART: ( CRACKING ) Ok, Ok, look, she's working a big story that was supposed to be mine, and I want it back.
MILO: You sleeping with her, Stu?
STEWART: ( turning red ) You mean, like, at this moment?
MILO: Yeah, that's what I mean. Are you sleeping with her at this very We have a history, yes.
STEWART: We have a history, yes.
MILO: A "history", huh? ( snorting ) Good luck with that.
CASS: Here, kitty kitty.
CASS: You're not Jimmy.
LANDLADY: You're not Jimmy.
CASS: ( recovering quickly ) Oh. No. I'm looking for him.
LANDLADY: Under the sofa?
CASS: Maybe you can help. I'm his You're LaKeesha?
LANDLADY: ( SKEPTICAL ) You're LaKeesha?
CASS: Yes. That's my name. LaKeesha.
LANDLADY: Maybe I should call the cops.
CASS: Wait! Ok, look: Jimmy's in trouble.
LANDLADY: What kind of trouble? Money trouble? Drug trouble? ( lower ) Sex- change trouble?
CASS: Something like that. All I know is, he's missing.
LANDLADY: I've had a lousy week, too. My cousin Linda fell off a cruise Oh. I'm sorry.
CASS: Oh. I'm sorry.
LANDLADY: Hey. A grown woman outta know how to swim.
CASS: I hear ya. Anyway. Mind if I take a quick look around?
LANDLADY: Jimmy's behind on his rent. I bet his girlfriend would want to take care of that.
CASS: I bet she would.
MILO: The thing is, Stu, she'll make you think she's interested in you, when really all she's interested in is the case you're working on, because she wants to launch her big hot- shot career.
STEWART: Wait a second: you're Milo. She talks about you all the time.
MILO: ( immediately interested ) Oh yeah, dude. She hates you.
STEWART: Oh yeah, dude. She hates you.
MILO: Oh, she hates me?
STEWART: Yeah. She says you're the most selfish, immature, stubborn.
MILO: ( INTERRUPTING ) I'm selfish? I'm immature? You know what? Forget it. I'm not even gonna dignify this with.whatever.
STEWART: Hey, man, I'm on your team.
MILO: No you're not, Geraldo. I don't allow reporters on my team.
MILO: And for the record: I'm the one who hates her. Just so that's clear.
MILO: ( to himself ) That figures. Run home to mommy.
MILO: Well, nice meeting ya, Stu.
STEWART: Wait, where are you going?
MILO: I'm going to pick up your girlfriend. But don't worry, if she ever gets out of jail, I'm sure you'll be very happy together.
LANDLADY: Time's up. Find anything?
CASS: Nope. Not a thing.
LANDLADY: Oh, well. Don't worry, hon. He probably just went away for the
JIMMY: ( PANICKING ) Ok, ok, I told one person about the Xmas Eve job, but she doesn't even have all the details, I swear!
MAHLER: Gimme a name.
MILO: .and this loser she's dating looks like he buys his clothes from
SID: Why do you care?
MILO: I don't. I just think it's funny.
SID: Hilarious. Listen to me: you guys made a terrible couple.
MILO: I know that. You don't have to tell me that.
SID: Relationships aren't about competition, they're about You mean like when your wife wants to do one thing, and you want to do another, and you compromise by doing what she wants?
MILO: You mean like when your wife wants to do one thing, and you want to do another, and you compromise by doing what she wants?
SID: Exactly. Now just get her here. Cause I can't afford to lose this No worries. In fact, I already know where she is and I'm gonna go pick her up right now.
MILO: No worries. In fact, I already know where she is and I'm gonna go pick her up right now.

STEWART: That's my space, you asshole!
MILO: Happy to see you, too.
LOIS: How dare you.after what you did to my baby.
MILO: Ok. What say we do this inside?
MILO: What happened to the pirate show?
LOIS: I got sick of it. Now I'm a female But.you are female.
MILO: But.you are female.
LOIS: That's why I'm so good at it. Help me with this.
MILO: Where is she, Lois? I need to talk to her.
LOIS: Oh, Milo, where did it all go wrong? Do you have any idea what it means to waste a woman's child- bearing years? It's criminal. Every month her eggs are jumping out of her ovaries like sailors abandoning a sinking ship. I mean, I know you were mad about that article.
MILO: I wasn't mad about that article. In fact: what article?
LOIS: Listen to me, Milo: Cassidy may be a strong independent woman on the outside, but on the inside she's just a girl who wants to be protected and loved by her man. What happened between the two of you devastated her.
MILO: Devastated her right to the top.
LOIS: ( BEAMING ) She has done well, hasn't she?
MILO: She got to tour the White House?
MILO: Tell me where she is, Lois.
LOIS: Oh, who knows. She was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, said she was on the biggest story of her career. Said she was going somewhere to think.
STEWART: Stewart hurries back into his car.
CASS: ( into phone ) No one with that name? What about a casino? Nothing? Thanks.
CASS: STEWART, at the mobbed track entrance, lost and frustrated:
STEWART: No, who's Jimmy?
CASS: Look, Stewart, I'm busy.
STEWART: Ok. ( casually ) Where are you, by the way? I mean, exactly.
CASS: I'm in Miami, if you must know. I'm on the beach building a sand castle and drinking from a coconut.
MILO: Hello, Cass.
CASS: Hello, Milo.
MILO: Fancy meeting you here.
CASS: Yeah. Fancy that.
MILO: How are you?
CASS: Fine. You?
MILO: Swell. Nice day.
CASS: ( can't hold out anymore ) What are you doing here?
MILO: ( can't hold out anymore ) What are you doing here?
CASS: ( can't hold out anymore ) What are you doing here?
MILO: ( can't hold out anymore ) What are you doing here?
CASS: ( can't hold out anymore ) What are you doing here?
MILO: "Building a sand castle, drinking from a coconut". Man, once a liar, always a liar.
CASS: You know what? I don't have time for this, I'm working.
MILO: Working? Hey, me too.
CASS: Congratulations. Move your leg.
MILO: What I do is, I track down criminals. People who jumped bail. Idiots who decided to go on the run after biting police officers. I find them, and I take them to jail.
CASS: Now, hold on just a second, Milo.
MILO: Tell you what: I'll give you more than a second. I'll give you 10. For old times sake.
MILO: Cass stares at him, her jaw working, trying to decide what to do. Then, all of a sudden, she BOLTS. Milo smiles. THE
MILO: Strike one.
MILO: Strike two.
MILO: Strike three. Get in.
CASS: I'm not going to jail, Milo.
MILO: I beg to differ.
CASS: Oh please. Like you're gonna shoot Nope. ( loudly ) I'm gonna shoot a cab driver.
MILO: Nope. ( loudly ) I'm gonna shoot a cab driver.
CASS: Chicken shits.
CASS: Ok, look: let's talk about this.
MILO: With that, Milo sweeps her up into his arms. AND THEY FIND
CASS: ( UNCOMFORTABLE ) Listen, Milo, I'm not sure we
CASS: Hey, wait a minute!
CASS: Cassidy Daley.
JIMMY: It's me. Jimmy.
CASS: ( exhaling with relief ) Shit, Jimmy, I thought you were Don't be silly. ( hurrying on ) Listen: you didn't happen to go to my place and find that envelope I left, did you?
JIMMY: Don't be silly. ( hurrying on ) Listen: you didn't happen to go to my place and find that envelope I left, did you?
CASS: I did, but I don't really get it, what's "Sparrow"?
JIMMY: It doesn't matter. Did you tell anyone else about this story?
CASS: Are you kidding? You think I want to share a story like this?
JIMMY: Ok. Good. Cause the truth is, there is no story. I made the whole thing up. So you should just drop it.
CASS: Uh-uh, no way are you backing out on me now, Jimmy. This story is way too good.
JIMMY: ( QUICKLY ) Where are you?
CASS: I'm at the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Actually, I'm in the trunk of my ex- husband's car. Long story. More importantly, where are you?
JIMMY: CLICK. MAHLER DISCONNECTS THE PHONE. ON CASS- she stares at her phone. Uh-oh:
CASS: Jimmy? Hello?
TERESA: Sid's Bail Bonds.
MILO: Guess who's in my trunk?
TERESA: Is that some sort of perverted innuendo? Who is this?
MILO: Aw, come on, Teresa, you know it's me. Put Sid on.
TERESA: Sid's busy shopping. ( snorts ) He thinks he can handle Xmas.
MILO: Ok, just tell him I got her and I'll be back in 2 hours. I want a bonus for bringing her in so quick.
TERESA: Yeah? I want a bonus for getting through the holidays without stabbing anyone with a fork.
MILO: Don't be such a pessimist. You still have time.
MILO: Gotta go. I got another call.
MILO: Tina's Thai massage! Where every ending is a happy one!
CASS: You're disgusting. Let me out of the trunk.
MILO: Hmm. Nope. By the way, your boyfriend Stewart's been following me. Unfortunately, I had to ditch him at the track.
CASS: Why is Stewart..? ( realizing ) And wait: who said he's my boyfriend?
MILO: Aw, don't be embarrassed. These things happen. You were drunk when you guys hooked up, right?
CASS: You know what, Milo? I shouldn't have run from you like that. I was.I don't know. You caught me off-guard. The truth is, I'm kind of in some trouble and I could really use your help.
MILO: Bad news for you, then. I wouldn't help you if you were the very last baby sea turtle in the world, dragging its tiny weak body across the burning hot sand while sea gulls circled overhead. I'd just pull up a chair, sip a pina colada, and let nature take its course.
MILO: Hey, I used to be a sucker, but no more. You can cry til the cows come home, for all I care.
MILO: Holy shit! ( calling out ) Hey, um, Cass? ( no response ) Cassidy?
MILO: It's Ok, hang on, I'm coming.
CASS: You know something, Milo? You're one of the most gullible.
MILO: He pulls her arm behind her back.

MILO: Me? I'm the dirty fighter?
CASS: Should we.I don't know.hug, or Sure. What the hell.
MILO: Sure. What the hell.
CASS: Hey. I had to try, right?
MILO: Get in the car.
CASS: Your windshield's cracked.
MILO: Thanks, Captain Obvious.
CASS: And you look like shit, Milo. What have you been doing, sleeping on the floor?
MILO: I enjoy sleeping on the floor. Matter of fact, I love sleeping on the floor. I love everything about my life. Great job, good friends, hot girlfriend.
CASS: You have a girlfriend?
MILO: ( he does not ) Yes I do.
CASS: Really? What's her name?
MILO: ( the first name that pops Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to cook pasta for me and perform strip- Wow. Is she missing a chromosome?
CASS: Wow. Is she missing a chromosome?
MILO: Oh, she has all her chromosomes, believe you me.
CASS: Well, my life is great, too.
MILO: I can tell. You and Stewart make a great couple, by the way. You and me made a terrible couple. But you two? Like peas in a pod.
CASS: You know what I like about Stewart?
MILO: I can't imagine.
CASS: He's not you.
MILO: Not even on his best day.
CASS: Or his worst.
MILO: I'll bet he has a lot of those.
CASS: Still betting, huh?
MILO: You can't win if you don't play.
CASS: Or, in your case, even if you do.
MILO: I win all the time.
CASS: Really? I hadn't noticed.
MILO: You know what? Seeing as how I'm about to come into five grand.
MILO: I think I'll do a little betting right now.
CASS: Don't you have to take me back?
MILO: Please. I have two days. A monkey could get you back in two days.
CASS: Aren't you afraid I'll get away?
MILO: He uncuffs her from the door, CUFFS HER TO HIS OWN WRIST.
STEWART: Damn, I'm good!
CLERK: Merry Xmas, Mr Boyd!
CLERK: What a nice surprise! Let's hope your luck is better today.
MILO: ( QUICKLY ) Sure, if there's such a thing as better than great, which is how my luck has been lately. Great.
CLERK: ( AWKWARD ) Oh. Yes sir. Of course. My mistake.
LORRAINE: The idiot just showed up at I'm on it.
DWIGHT: ( QUICKLY ) I'm on it.
LORRAINE: Uh-uh. Not you. ( calling out ) RAY.
LORRAINE: Go get this asshole.
MILO: Prepare to observe the master.
CASS: Ok, how about this:
CASS: If I give you all the cash in my wallet, will you let me go?
MILO: Hmm. Lemme see.
MILO: Nope. Guess not.
MILO: ( to the dealer ) Hit me.
CASS: I'd really like to.
DEALER: Dealer wins.
CASS: Nice going, master.
WAITRESS: And for the couple over here?
MILO: ( QUICKLY ) We're not a couple.
CASS: ( just as quick ) Why would you think we were a We used to be together. Back when I was young and foolish.
MILO: We used to be together. Back when I was young and foolish.
CASS: And I was confused.
MILO: And I was slumming.
CASS: And I was drunk.
WAITRESS: ( BORED ) Great story. I have to get back to work now.
MILO: Wait. Champagne! I'm celebrating.
MILO: ( under his breath ) Son of a bitch.
CASS: Look, Milo, the truth is.my Mom is in the hospital.
MILO: Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par?
CASS: She might be really sick. That's why I had to jump bail.
MILO: ( overly sincere ) Taking care of her, huh? Putting aside your career for a loved one? Golly, that's so you.
CASS: You've already been to see her.
MILO: Impressive. No wonder you got all those awards. So lemme guess: the real reason you jumped bail is cause you're on a story.
CASS: Stewart. Stewart told you.
MILO: ( CAUGHT ) I would have figured it out on my own, trust me.
CASS: I wouldn't trust you if you were the last man alive.
MILO: You think about that much? Me being the last man alive? Am I naked in this fantasy?
CASS: Ok, you're right. I'm on a story. A very important story. It just so happens that I'm possibly about to uncover a whole ring of dirty cops.
CASS: Please. Isn't the whole "dirty cop" thing kind of old? Maybe you should do a story about something people are interested in. Like internet porn. Or lesbians.
MILO: Please. Isn't the whole "dirty cop" thing kind of old? Maybe you should do a story about something people are interested in. Like internet porn. Or lesbians.
CASS: I'm serious, Milo. This is gonna be big. And here's what I'm willing to do ( magnanimous ): I'm willing to credit you in the article.
MILO: Oh, sure, like you credited me in the 13th Street Article?
CASS: Why on earth would I have credited you? I worked my ass off for that That's one way of putting it.
MILO: That's one way of putting it.
CASS: What's that supposed to mean?
MILO: Forget it. I don't want to be in your article. In fact, I would rather eat a bowl of broken glass than have my name in any way associated with one of your lousy Fine. Forget I mentioned it.
CASS: Fine. Forget I mentioned it.
MILO: I already have.
CASS: I mean, you're not a cop anymore, right? What do you care if people were murdered?
MILO: Please. Nobody was murdered.
CASS: Just my source.
MILO: ( SUSPICIOUS ) Oh yeah? How? Bullet to the back of the head?
CASS: Dumped in a reservoir?
MILO: Dumped in a reservoir?
CASS: ( FLUSTERED ) I don't know.
MILO: Car accident?
CASS: Ok, ok, maybe he wasn't murdered yet. But I wouldn't be surprised
CASS: Maybe this whole thing sounds like no big deal to you.
MILO: You know what it sounds like? It sounds like you're going to jail.
CASS: Milo, listen, you have to believe me, come on, you know me.
MILO: ( getting red ) Exactly! I do know you. Which means I know you are a deceptive, cold- hearted bitch who is going to jail where she belongs.
WAITRESS: Champagne. So. What are we I have to use the bathroom.
CASS: ( GRIMLY ) I have to use the bathroom.
WAITRESS: Alrightee, then. Cheers.
CASS: Can I have some privacy, please?

It'll only cost you a couple hundred bucks, and I'll tip you onto some criminal activity, it's your chance to expose some bad guys and write the story of your life.

MILO: Only, you don't know what Sparrow is. ( thinking ) Could be a nickname. Or the place where the evidence is stashed. Or a code word of some kind. But the guy who knows has gone missing, and you think the dirty cops got a hold of him.

CASS: I said you're doing a great job.
CASS: Ok, here's what I think we should do: I'll go up first, Jimmy knows me, so if anything's wrong I'm sure he'll give me a sign.
