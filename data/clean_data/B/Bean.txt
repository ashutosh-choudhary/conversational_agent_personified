GARETH: I suppose we could just sack him.
GARETH: Look, I don't hate the man but .
LORD WALTON: I know, Gareth. It's the mental strain he inflicts on us all. How is Professor Bradbury Heels got the feeling back in his fingers - but his hands are still stapled together.
LORD WALTON: Mmmm, and how far are we with the computer, Hubert?
HUBERT: Timothy is loading the final catalogue data as we speak, Milord. An awful thing to say, but when the program's up and running our, Mr. Bean will become a little less than ..
GUARD: ( not looking up from his book ) Morning, Bean.
GALLERY GUIDE: ( hushed )
GARETH: Maybe it would be simpler to pack all our paintings onto trucks and move the entire National Gallery somewhere else. And not tell Seconded. We could all move to France.
HUBERT: Seconded. We could all move to France.
GEORGE: All those in favour.
LORD WALTON: Come on - settle down everyone.
VINCENT: I'm sorry I'm late.
GARETH: Why can't we just give him the boot for crying out loud?!
VINCENT: Steady on, old man. I only .
GARETH: Not you, you idiot.
SUIT MAN: Ah Bean, I'm looking for a painting by Van Hocht. Still Life. Circa 1670. Can do?
SUIT MAN: What would we do without you! The entire inventory of British Art stored in that one, curious brain of yours.
GARETH: Then we are agreed, gentlemen. He goes.
VINCENT: Only if we're positive that the new catalogue database will render Mr. Bean's hitherto 'talents' obsolete.
HUBERT: There's no question.
LORD WALTON: Very well. Mr Bean is.. art history. We can all stop taking the pills.
LORD WALTON: Miss Hutchinson, would you send Mr. Bean up to the boardroom, Yes sir. oh, and Lord Walton, the Grierson Gallery called again.
MISS HUTCHINSON: ( V/O )
LORD WALTON: Thank you. ( To the room ) One final thing. Once again we have been invited by the Grierson Gallery of Southern California to second one of our staff for a short visit. The Grierson has a fairly modest collection - but it does include the most famous American painting of all, 'Whistler's Mother'. Any thoughts?
LORD WALTON: Yes. Sir Rupert. And may I say sir, how honoured we are that you still grace us with all your time, wisdom, and infinite knowledge. Your invaluable thoughts, sir?
SIR RUPERT: Could you speak up please. I didn't catch the question.
SUIT MAN: Thank you, Bean. You're a genius.
MISS HUTCHINSON: Mr. Bean. Lord Walton would like to see you in the boardroom.
PROGRAMMER: What's happening here?
BEAN: With a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with puzzlement at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random guess. And a disastrous one. There is a ugly electrical fizzle. The screens come on white, then pop out completely.
BEAN: Ah.. Ahm.. You have your voting slips, gentlemen. Please remember the
LORD WALTON: You have your voting slips, gentlemen. Please remember the
LORD WALTON: ( gravely )
LORD WALTON: ( into phone )
LORD WALTON: As I was saying, gentlemen. The Grierson Gallery. South California. Great opportunity. Thousands-of miles-away though it is. Doctorate or ( IMPISHLY ) no doctorate, perhaps
LORD WALTON: Mr. Bean. Wonderful news. You are going to America.
MR. BEAN: ( overwhelmed )
LORD WALTON: ( beaming )
GRIERSON: Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world. Has a couple of doctorates no less.
BERNIE: Great news.
DAVID: Sounds like a real coup, sir. getting this Doctor of .
GRIERSON: Various things. Thank you. However, as you know, this is not an inexpensive venture, and, financially speaking, we're in very serious crap right now.
GRIERSON: So . I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
BERNIE: Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room. Period.
GRIERSON: Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing. I mean, I'd really like to, but. things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er .
DAVID: Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing. I mean, I'd really like to, but. things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er .
GRIERSON: I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year. the MASSIVE financial
DAVID: on the other hand . maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs . Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due?
GRIERSON: Tomorrow. You have a problem with that?
PAUSE: No. Perfect. Looking forward to it.
DAVID: No. Perfect. Looking forward to it.
DAVID: Hi, Jennifer. How was school? ( she doesn't break the kiss with Brad ) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some
CHARLES: Hello, David.
DAVID: Hi, Charles. ( To Alison ) Wow - late!
ALISON: ( brightly )
CHARLES: My fault. We've got a heavy load on at present. How about you, gallery going well?
DAVID: Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ..
ALISON: Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
ALISON: Kevin! You stop that right now!
CHARLES: Great kids. Good looking too.
DAVID: You think so? Well I 'spose they're pretty, you know. okay, Take after their mother, huh?
CHARLES: Take after their mother, huh?
DAVID: Ah . absolutely.
ALISON: Let's take a break, David. This weekend, why don't we just get into the car and drive to the coast. Find a motel. Like before the kids were born. Go to a fairground. Win me another Bambi. Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
ALISON: Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
DAVID: Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm. there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England.
ALISON: ( SUSPICIOUSLY )
DAVID: And they asked me if we'd like to . you know. put him up for a There aren't hotels?
ALISON: There aren't hotels?
DAVID: Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
ALISON: ( POINTEDLY )
DAVID: I said I'd check with you.
DAVID: Then I said 'yes'.
ALISON: Do we know anything about him?
DAVID: Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er . at least 2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time. I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
ALISON: David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
DAVID: Yes. Yes. ( pause ) Sometime.
ALISON: It's the last thing we need.
DAVID: That's exactly what I said . before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea." Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about .. ( checks watch ) oh, 20 minutes.
KEVIN: Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about .. ( checks watch ) oh, 20 minutes.
DAVID: Great, good.
DAVID: Didn't kids do their own homework, like way back? Years ago? No. Course not. Just imagining it.
OLD LADY: Be careful. It's for my Grand-daughter.
DAVID: For all you know, he may be a very attractive young man.
JENNIFER: Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep. All Englishmen are All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.

JENNIFER: All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
DAVID: Richard Burton was very good-looking.
JENNIFER: Sean Connery.
DAVID: Sean Connery.
ALISON: Tom Jones?
DAVID: Tom Jones?
JENNIFER: Welsh again.
DAVID: Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside. No-one's asking you to go to bed with him. Bed sounds good though. Bed sounds great.
ALISON: Bed sounds good though. Bed sounds great.
KEVIN: ( bored )
DAVID: Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
KEVIN: I vote for Bart.
JENNIFER: Shut up, Kevin.
KEVIN: NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird. What do you think it is, Dad? Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
JENNIFER: You know the thing I hate most about children?
KEVIN: CUT TO:
JENNIFER: CUT TO:
COP 1: Police! Stop or we shoot!
COP 1: Carefully take out your weapon, holding the butt with two fingers only. Slowly place it on the floor and take three paces back!
BRUTUS: Mr. Bean. Are you presently on any kind of medication at all?
BRUTUS: You could certainly use some.
ALISON: What did they say?
DAVID: Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like .
ALISON: Did you really ask?
DAVID: I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy .
ALISON: What's wrong with you, David? All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
DAVID: No, no. I'11 try again .
ALISON: I said, I'11 go.
JENNIFER: So. where do your parents live?
STINGO: My parents are dead.
JENNIFER: Yeah, so are mine.
COP 1: Just get him the hell out of here, will ya?
CAB DRIVER: Thanks man, I can't tell you how much I appreciate talking to ya. In this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya, with their stupid problems . But you, you're a great listener, ya know that?
ALISON: It isn't working any more, David.
DAVID: I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it. Stupid thing.
ALISON: No, US. It's not working any longer -you and me. I need some time, David. A little time. It's not just you. It's partly me.
DAVID: I need some time, David. A little time. It's not just you. It's partly me.
ALISON: I need some time, David. A little time. It's not just you. It's partly me.
DAVID: But in general . it's . mostly me, right?
JENNIFER: Thanks a lot, Kevin!
DAVID: The lights blown in the kitchen. I'll fix it tomorrow.
DAVID: That poor guy, Bean . He's probably still sitting at London
DAVID: Alison, please.
DAVID: I need to make a confession. I know you're awake. Please, it's
ALISON: ( without stirring )
DAVID: I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
ALISON: There were three strawberries.
DAVID: 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
ALISON: 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
DAVID: 0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
DAVID: Ali? What's wrong?
ALISON: Your face smells like a foot.
ALISON: What is it? Jennifer!
JENNIFER: ( 0.O.V. )
DAVID: Honey, calm down now. it's okay.
JENNIFER: ( p.o.v. )
KEVIN: It wouldn't be the first time.
ALISON: Shut up, Kevin. ( to Jennifer ) Honey, you-re not making sense .
DAVID: It's okay. There's no one out here. Just open the door. Trust
KEVIN: He makes Prince Charles look kind of handsome.
ALISON: He can't stay here, David.
DAVID: Okay. It's not a problem. Let's just sit . I'11 talk to the gallery .
ALISON: David, I'm serious!
DAVID: I know you are. Very serious . most of the time these days.
ALISON: Now what does that mean? My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing? ( looks at his tie ) That tie's God-awful. Why do you wear it?
DAVID: Ah, Mr Bean .
BEAN: Excuse me.
BEAN: Now - can I help?
ANNIE: Two dollars please.
DAVID: Annie, it's me.
ANNIE: Oh, right, yeah. ( to Bean ) two dollars please.
DAVID: No, Annie, no. This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with
ANNIE: Oh, great. Usually we charge people two dollars to come in- but for people who work here, that would be 730 dollars a year, which is like, a lot of money, so we kinda like let them off. Hi.
ANNIE: He doesn't like to say much does he?
DAVID: Right first time.
ANNIE: I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
DAVID: You'll notice, our clientele is not totally young. I sometimes worry they're not really getting to grips with the art on a deep aesthetic level.
DAVID: Beautiful. 'HIS MISTRESS' by John Everett Millais, 1829 to 96. Know it?
ANNIE: Excuse me. Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you Thanks, Annie. Better go. Grierson hates people being late.
DAVID: Thanks, Annie. Better go. Grierson hates people being late.
DAVID: Better go. Grierson hates people being late.
BEAN: Yes. Ahm. think I'11 .
DAVID: Why me?
DAVID: Come on! Let's go!
GRIERSON: Ah, David. Finally. ( CHECKS HIS WATCH DELIBERATELY ) And this must be our professor from across the sea.
DAVID: Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
BEAN: Actually I'm not .. er .
GRIERSON: This is Bernard Schimmel. Bernie the Doctor.
THOMAS GRIERSON: Ah ~ the Tribune - mind if I just .. Take a seat, gentlemen... although before we settle - feast your eyes on these.
GRIERSON: Take a seat, gentlemen... although before we settle - feast your eyes on these.
GRIERSON: Arthur Rackham. Originals of course. Got four of them. Check this out . Venus and the Cat, Aesop's Fables. Isn't that
GRIERSON: Maybe. Hell of a price, I'11 tell you. Anyway - down to
GRIERSON: Bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross-gallery computer system. Dr Bean - would you like to look at this? Very exciting stuff ..
BEAN: Ahm . NO.
BERNIE: What I'm doing, Dave, is developing the ultimate user-friendly,' interactive public guide to the gallery.
DAVID: It's very good Bernie.
BERNIE: But the particular glory of the system. is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
GRIERSON: Not bad, eh? What do you think, Doctor? Ah.. Doctor Bean?
GRIERSON: Well, thanks for dropping by. Enjoy your stay with our Vice President and his family. They're simple people.-.but warm, yes, Doctor?
BEAN: I'm not actually. um.
GRIERSON: . Settled in yet. I know. Plenty of time. Bernie, perhaps you'd like to take Dr. Bean on a tour of the gallery.
BERNIE: Absolutely. This way, sir.
GRIERSON: He's a genius, right?
DAVID: Ah. He certainly has something, sir.
GRIERSON: Very pleased you've taken him in, David. At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
DAVID: Yes, although, I really... thank you. Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
GRIERSON: Glad to hear it. Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
DAVID: You're not going to ..
GRIERSON: Sack him? David, what else can I do? This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David . notice anything this
DAVID: You've tinted your hair? It takes years off you, sir.
DAVID: Goodnight Annie.
ANNIE: BEAN does not even notice her. As DAVID heads for the exit, BEAN suddenly He reaches for ANNIE's love message and blows his nose on it. He drops the tissue in a bin as he exits. ANNIE sighs her disappointment.
DAVID: Okay. I'll get some steaks. Alison loves steak . Wine - good. Candy? No candy. Alison hates candy. We gotta do this right, Bean, or . ( looks at Bean ) Just stay out of trouble, okay?
ROBBER: Gimme the keys!
ROBBER: I said, give me the keys!
ROBBER: OKAY, OKAY - TAKE IT EASY!!!
BEAN: 1,2,3,4, 5, 6,7,8, 9,10
ROBBER: But I haven't got a f...
BEAN: He points out a small child, watching from behind a trash can.
ROBBER: I haven't got a gun.
ROBBER: Okay, okay, I'11 do it!
COP 1: Excuse me. Mr. er . Cabbage?
BRUTUS: It's Eddie Guardino. Go pick him up. Guardino fled the scene with 160 K, in a white plastic bag. We got the car. We got the bag. And we got 20 pairs of stinking pantyhose. ( drags on his cigarette ) Anything you wanna tell me?
BRUTUS: Guardino fled the scene with 160 K, in a white plastic bag. We got the car. We got the bag. And we got 20 pairs of stinking pantyhose. ( drags on his cigarette ) Anything you wanna tell me?
BRUTUS: 'Fraid I'm gonna have to keep this.
BRUTUS: Mr. Bean. You lookin' to stay long in California?
MR. BEAN: Oh, yes.
DAVID: He was incredible. This guy is fearless. He has no fear.
KEVIN: That's one - way of looking at it. You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
DAVID: Well, there is that .
KEVIN: ( TO BEAN )
BEAN: CUT TO:
KEVIN: It's so embarrassing. All the guys I know are on Goblins 3 and I'm still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2.
KEVIN: Come on, winkle.
KEVIN: It's gotta be here. Something to get the key away from the stupid cuckoo.
BEAN: Click, click, click, click, click .
KEVIN: How'd you do that!? That was so obvious!!!
KEVIN: Beanie, you are waaaaay Cool!
DAVID: Hi... ( PAUSE ) Roses.
ALISON: Hi... ( PAUSE ) Roses.
DAVID: Yes. And I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
ALISON: Great. ( SHE SETTLES A LITTLE ) You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else. Did you?
DAVID: Sort of half...
ALISON: I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
DAVID: I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
ALISON: Honestly David, you're so spineless. Roses. Wine.
DAVID: Roses. Wine.
ALISON: But no real change.
ALISON: I really do need some time on my own. Away from here.
DAVID: Look, Bean's history. I swear to you, he's packing as we speak. And you can't leave. ( HE PICKS UP THE BAMBI ) I've got Bambi. You never go anywhere without him. Please let's just talk.
ALISON: Okay. ( GHOST OF A SMILE ) Put Bambi down, and we'll talk.
DAVID: Look, you guys, could you just give us a moment to . Jennifer - could you turn that damn thing down.
ALISON: No, that's not for the TV. That's for the .
KEVIN: I wish I could use that at school. "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings . It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know? So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
JENNIFER: It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
DAVID: Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
JENNIFER: It's you and Mom that need to talk.
DAVID: Sure. You're right.
KEVIN: You know, Mr. Bean's okay. You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
JENNIFER: ( FROM HER DOOR )
KEVIN: Are you?
DAVID: Yes, I am. I must.
BEAN: ( o. o. v )
DAVID: Hi, am I disturbing you?
DAVID: May I?
DAVID: None of your folks here - Family?
DAVID: Look. the reason I came in here was to . well. since you've been here twelve all.
DAVID: Well, that's er.great. Look, I just came in . ( no, he cant do it ) . to say good night. Okay?
DAVID: CUT TO:
DAVID: Bean can I ask you something?
DAVID: Do you think you can ever really know someone? Even if you've known them, well, almost all your life? What do you think?
DAVID: Well, they say there's only one way to get over this sort of thing. Take it day by day. Keep working. Keep to your normal patterns. That's the only hope. So let's just . take today shall we?
DAVID: I think the time has come from you to meet the grand Madame. She's all around you . how do you fancy meeting her in the
DAVID: I usually only let her out for the big summer exhibition - but' let's see whether what they say about the healing power of great works of art is true, huh?
DAVID: As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section. Nobody gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right?
ELMER: Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler as kind of . like my own dear mother. I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.
DAVID: You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo". I'11 be back in 15.
ELMER: Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo". I'11 be back in 15.
DAVID: You think he's tough you should see the size of the hunk that works the night shift.
DAVID: Stay there. Keep your eyes closed. One final lock, one final key.
DAVID: Right. Open now.
BEAN: Mmmmm. Nice.
DAVID: I'11 leave you with her for a few minutes. I'm sure you'll want to give her a proper inspection. But whatever you do, don't leave the room. Megasecurity, okay? Catch you.
BEAN: ( silently mouths )
ELEVATOR VOICE: Second floor.
THIN WOMAN: I guess I'll see you up there, guys.
ELEVATOR VOICE: Third floor.
BERNIE: I was hoping DU. Bean might take a look at my computer project
DAVID: Yes. I'11 mention it to him. But . he's kind of his own guy, you know?
BERNIE: Howls he getting on with the family?
DAVID: Ah. Fine. It's good. It's great.
BERNIE: And howls Alison?
DAVID: She's . well, she's good.
BERNIE: Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers. Nice guy. Good looking.
DAVID: Yes, isn't he.
BERNIE: It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
DAVID: Isn't it?
BERNIE: I like to think that's what's happened with you and me . even though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that way, huh? Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
DAVID: Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
BERNIE: Thanks, David. Always a pleasure.
BERNIE: By the way. Don't know what you think, Mr Vice President, but I've been hinting to the old man that someone's got to have the balls to take some sort of emergency measures around here - or we're all in the crap house. What do you think?
DAVID: 'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
BERNIE: Not necessarily. That's where this . ( POINTS TO HIS BRAIN ) comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll hear soon enough.
ANNIE: True love can be very hard.
DAVID: Seems to be a problem with the door.( PAUSE ) Where's the picture What? What?
BEAN: What? What?
DAVID: What? What?
DAVID: Oh Jesus. Oh God. Oh Jesus God. Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
BEAN: oh dear.
DAVID: What happened?!!!
BEAN: Ahm.. ( setting himself up for an interesting, comprehensive answer ).
DAVID: Don't bother ( panicking ) Oh my god... Wait a minute - why am I worrying about this? I did it. I just go out and tell them what happened - you're a madman from England and you did this terrible thing and it's not my fault. That's right, isn't it? Perfect - and then they say - who left him alone with the picture?" And I say - "me". And they say "you're fired". And I say ' right'. And so I get fired and you go to jail and no one's any happier. And then they say, "firing David isn't enough - let's prosecute him for negligence. And they prosecute me and it turns out I was negligent and I go to jail, and my wife leaves me and my daughter becomes a prostitute and I end up on Death Row sharing a cell with Butch McDick, the infamous gay rapist - or worse, I end up in the same cell as you!
DAVID: Brilliant. Brilliant. Problem solved! Apart from the tiny drawback that the first person who opens the cupboard will say -"Look, someone's totally destroyed Whistler's Mother- let's kill them".
GRIERSON: Ah, David. Showing Dr. Bean our good lady?
BEAN: Actually I'm not a.
DAVID: That's right - Whistler's Mother. Looking at his mother - not his father - not interested in his father, Couldn't give a flying doughnut for his sisters or brothers - just his mother. Yes.
GRIERSON: Well, good - think I may go and look at her myself.
DAVID: Er . pray tell me why?
GRIERSON: Er . pray tell me why?
ELMER: Because they've just cut her into tiny pieces, sir. That's why.
ELMER: I better continue my rounds, sir..
DAVID: The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
GRIERSON: Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
DAVID: Exactly. She's in a surprisingly terrible state. Isn't she, Oh yes.
BEAN: Oh yes.
DAVID: Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints .. Thank you David. However, flattery will get you nowhere. Truth
GRIERSON: Thank you David. However, flattery will get you nowhere. Truth
DAVID: . you have to sack me. I understand, sir. I'll go quietly. In fact I'll go right now.
GRIERSON: No. no, no, hold on . We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
GRIERSON: Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the news. I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
DAVID: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Congratulations. Marvellous thing. Bravo.
DAVID: Bean. Do you drink?
DAVID: Neither do I.
DAVID: It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it . lose your job - lose you wife . C'est la vie. You ever been married, Bean?
DAVID: I guess not.
DAVID: He's English, okay? You wanna make something of it?
DAVID: . To hell with the figures. I'm not a damn accountant. I'm an artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut quite a figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then, I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the problems of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels.
DAVID: Truth is, I disappointed her. I turned out to have no spine. Spineless. A kind of medical miracle. Mr Flippy-Floppy. I just don't seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for myself. Too nice. I mean, I should never have let you come stay and I should be handing you over to the police right now. Shall I tell you something, Beanie . Do you want to know what the reality of the situation is? This is it. Because you moved into my house, my wife has left me. She might have done it anyway - but you were the ten ton weight that broke the camel's spinal column. That's point one. And point two - is that you've destroyed Whistler's Mother, which was' the last hope for the place where I work. So within a week, I'm going to lose my job as well.

DAVID: So, you've totally and utterly destroyed my life. Do you understand? You've put me in a position where it would have been better if I'd never been born.

BEAN: It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
DAVID: It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
BEAN: Well, Ahm..
DAVID: CUT TO:
GRIERSON: I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
DAVID: Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we? Don't want anything to go wrong.
GRIERSON: Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we? Don't want anything to go wrong.
DAVID: Quite right, sir.

STINGO: ( to DAVID )
JENNIFER: Don't worry, Dad. I'll be home. Monday, after school.
KEVIN: Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
DAVID: ( angry now )
JENNIFER: Great, Dad. You promised you'd get rid of him! ( points at Bean ) And as for: "how we do things in this family. We don't have a family till you get Mom back.
JENNIFER: Come on Sting!
KEVIN: Sting?! Sounds like something you put on a rash.
DAVID: Don't just stand there, Bean - do something.
DAVID: To BEAN ) Right! Right! You get inside and look after Kevin! ( not such a good idea ) Uh - Right! Kevin. You get inside and look after . uh. ( that would be a worse idea ) Right! Get in the car! Both of you. Jesus!

KEVIN: Badly. You wanna adopt me?
ANNIE: Big day today, huh?
DAVID: Uh . yes .
BERNIE: Great day. At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
DAVID: Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this. I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
BERNIE: You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. ( he hugs him and laughs ). Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
DAVID: Annie . would you look after Kevin? And Kevin - you look after
KEVIN: My Dad told me all about you.
ANNIE: Did he now?
KEVIN: He says you've got a babe count of ten out of ten, and a brain cell count of about two and a half.
ANNIE: Yeah, I'll go with that. I'm kinda, like, dumb, intellectually. ( to Bean ) But I'm great in bed.
KEVIN: Catch you later, babe.( goes after Bean ) Come on, Beanie - there must be a computer here somewhere. I hate paintings. They don't do anything.
GRIERSON: Well, congratulations. Isn't that great, David?
DAVID: Certainly is.
BERNIE: We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
GRIERSON: Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
KEVIN: This is way cool, Beanie.
BERNIE: Jesus! Hurry up you guys. Am I the only person round here who actually gets things done.
DAVID: You arrange those flowers yourself?
ELMER: Sure did.
DAVID: They're pretty. Learn it in the army?
ELMER: No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
GRIERSON: What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. ( checks a prompt card ).
BERNIE: And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
GRIERSON: Right. Got it.
ANNIE: Good day, Governor Reynolds. I'm Annie .
BERNIE: Curtsy? Are you kidding? This is 1990s America. Women don't curtsy, they run the damn country!
ANNIE: Curtsy? Are you kidding? This is 1990s America. Women don't curtsy, they run the damn country!
GRIERSON: Alex, please!
ANNIE: That's Annie, sir.
GRIERSON: This is Elmer, our longest serving.
BERNIE: Hey. Let's junk the medals, Elmer. This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home. Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
DAVID: David Leary. I'd like to echo my colleagues welcome to you and thank you for your patronage .
BERNIE: Okay, that'll do. The Governor's here in half an hour. We have to be totally ready then. No excuses. Period!
GRIERSON: Thank you Bernie. Well done. Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
KEVIN: I'm just gonna go see if Annie needs me for anything. Truth is, she smells kinda nice. okay? ( grins ).
MR. BEAN: Click! click! click! click! click!
BERNIE: How goes it, Bean? Ready for the Governor? BEAN smiles and nods nervously. He knows he's probably up to something he shouldn't be.
BERNIE: We need you downstairs in ten minutes and not a second more. Period. Oh, And put this on.
BERNIE: David? Lift off!
GRIERSON: what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome.
REYNOLDS: Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint. Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
GRIERSON: Not at all, Governor. Very striking.
REYNOLDS: Interesting suit.
GRIERSON: ( Beaming )
REYNOLDS: off the peg?
GRIERSON: ( crestfallen )
REYNOLDS: ( To Bernie )
BERNIE: Bean - go park the Governor's car, will you.
ANNIE: Good day, Governor. I'm Annie. You know, you're a lot taller than you were half an hour ago.
REYNOLDS: Well, that's great to hear at my age, Annie. Thank you very much.
ANNIE: Governor Reynolds, does your wife, like, have to curtsy? Or does she 0 have a decent job?
REYNOLDS: Er . Mrs. Reynolds is doing just fine. Just fine.
REYNOLDS: Nice set of medals there Elmer. Which beach they drop you on? Utah? Omaha?
ELMER: Couldn't tell you sir. I was so drugged up with the killing I didn't know where I was.
REYNOLDS: Well, congratulations soldier.
REYNOLDS: Nice tie, fella.
CUT TO: INT. THE GRIERSON GALLERY. GROUND FLOOR - DAY REYNOLDS stops to admire a small painting - a twelfth century 'Crucifixion of
GRIERSON: Ah, one of my favourites. It expresses a universal agony that the established Church so rarely acknowledges, don't you think?
REYNOLDS: Jesus . no one's got feet like for crying out loud. Have you got feet like that? Dammed if I have. Let's move it, shall we?
BERNIE: Everything okay, David?
DAVID: Yes. Ahm. I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
BERNIE: He's just parking the Governor's car.
DAVID: Great - keep him out of trouble.
REYNOLDS: Can we go and see Mrs. Whistler now? My eyes are making my feet sore, as my wife would say.
DAVID: Sure, Governor. Please. This way.
DAVID: Ladies and gentlemen - most of you have seen Whistler's Mother before, can I ask you just to step back. Thank you.
DAVID: I'd like the Governor to have, as it were, a private audience with his new friend.
REYNOLDS: Well, hello Ma'am! Yes - she certainly looks a million dollars to me - or should I say ten million dollars!
GRIERSON: Bravo - what do you say to a final glass of, though I say it
DAVID: Governor, I don't believe you've met Dr Bean, our expert from
BEAN: Ah, hello, sorry, I . Ahm. sorry .
REYNOLDS: You were going to sell the State of California a poster - for ten million dollars! Who the hell do you think you are, Shorty!?
GRIERSON: Look, Governor - just wait - it's may not be as bad as it looks
DAVID: Nice try, kiddo.
ANNIE: David. There's a call for you. It's your wife.
DAVID: Great. Classic timing. Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce? I'll check my diary later.
ANNIE: She's calling from the hospital .
ANNIE: She's on line three!
ANNIE: Such. great buns.
REYNOLDS: I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two. Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen! I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you I am sorry you feel that way.
GRIERSON: I am sorry you feel that way.
REYNOLDS: And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass. That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
BERNIE: Certainly, sir.
BRUTUS: Come on man! Move it!
ELMER: Hey, Cop, wanna ride? Jeese, where do they get you guys?
BERNIE: There is one other tiny problem, sir.
KEVIN: Is Jenny gonna be okay?
DAVID: She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.
KEVIN: But is she gonna be okay?
DAVID: ( snapping )
DAVID: Damn! She's a good kid. Sometimes good people get a break once in a while. ( manages a smile )
BRUTUS: It's okay! I'll tail 'em!
ELMER: It's okay! I'll tail 'em!
BRUTUS: You got it.
DAVID: Just stay away from me! D'you hear?
REYNOLDS: Don't even think of saying one word to me, or I'11 find a way of fitting all three of those cars right up your ass.
ALISON: They're not calling it a coma. The doctor says she's . just kind of taking time out. ( to Kevin ) Hi, tough guy. ( to David ) It's a busy night. The doctor will be back in a while.
DAVID: Excuse me.
DOCTOR 1: I'll be back in a minute.
DAVID: Okay, great.
ALISON: At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
DAVID: Ah, well ..
NURSE: Doctor Jacobson?
DOCTOR JACOBSON: We need you urgently in C Theatre.
NURSE: We need you urgently in C Theatre.
DOCTOR JACOBSON: Damn. I was just going to Number 4 ..
NURSE: It is urgent, sir.
DOCTOR JACOBSON: The doctor rushes away and drops his stethoscope as he .goes. BEAN sees it, picks it up and follows him he's trying to be useful.
ELMER: No, no, I didn't realise the situation. I won't disturb them now.
ELMER: BUCK looks up, painfully, goes to say something, then dashes into a men's room close-by. ELMER shakes his head and leaves.
NURSE 2: Doctor . Bean?
BEAN: Actually . ( huge sigh ) . Yes, yes, yes.
NURSE 2: Just in time, sir. Allow me.
ALISON: When the Police told me what had happened I . it's stupid I know . but I remembered all that stuff people do to get through to coma victims .
KEVIN: Like playing them recordings of their dish washers and coffee That right. So I went home and picked it up.
ALISON: That right. So I went home and picked it up.
DAVID: Good thinking. ( pause ) You still call it 'home'.
ASSISTANT: Good evening Doctor.. What we have here is a bullet wound in the lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's severe inner bleeding along the abdomen.
NURSE 2: He's coming round.
ASSISTANT: Give him a T 70, straight away.
ASSISTANT: Shall I do the cut, sir?
ASSISTANT: I'm sorry. it's only MY first week.
NURSE: I'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the X-rays, Doctor, or we'll never find the bullet. Come on everyone sort out the support
ASSISTANT: Here we go, doctor. ( STUDYING THE X-RAY ) the bullet is here - so we'll probably have to extend the cut to here. Think we all better be prepared for a long one here. This is tricky.
ASSISTANT: There certainly is. Dr Bean here just saved his life.
ALISON: 0 my god.
DAVID: Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
ALISON: Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
DAVID: Excuse me.
DOCTOR 2: Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute. We have a lot to deal with here, sir.
ALISON: Excuse me, doctor.
DOCTOR: Really Ma'am, we'll get to you in due course.
ALISON: DAVID looks at the poster opposite again. Spine, ribcage, skull. Looks back at Bean gesturing to it. This time the penny drops! Spine spineless!
DAVID: Say that again, son.
DOCTOR: I beg your pardon?
DAVID: I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
DOCTOR: I'm er . sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
DAVID: We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
DAVID: So, why not haul your . ( checks ) nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
DOCTOR: Okay, sir. Certainly. Good.
DAVID: Yes, and Bean, for God's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will
ALISON: Smiling Well, well.
ALISON: Let's get a coffee.
DAVID: Yes. Great. Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
KEVIN: Help me with this. It's a scientific experiment. We're gonna wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured screams of Vampire
ALISON: She looks up at DAVID, who's looking at her. Slowly she gets close and puts her arms around him. She's a bit tearful.
DAVID: Everything's gonna be fine.
ALISON: ( pause )
DAVID: It was nothing. We're not . He just makes me laugh. When was the last time we laughed? Any of us?
ALISON: It was nothing. We're not . He just makes me laugh. When was the last time we laughed? Any of us?
DAVID: I know. I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
KEVIN: They look down to see KEVIN has arrived.
KEVIN: These guys just hijacked the T.V. Me and Bean were trying to .
HOSPITAL PORTER: Sorry, folks. We're short on these and there's another kid down the hall that could use .
DAVID: Wait a minute .. ( about to get tough again )
ALISON: Please. It's okay. Really. ( to David ) Wow - who put the fire in you, my' man?
ALISON: Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
DAVID: Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
DAVID: I thought you said..
DAVID: Now, Bean . just put down that thing . nice and slow . you hear me? Come on now.
JENNIFER: Dad! Get off!? What's happening here?! Mom?
KEVIN: I don't care what anyone says. Mr. Bean brought my sister back from the dead. He did it under laboratory conditions. My eyes do not lie!
DAVID: Here, let me do that.
ALISON: No, I'm fine. okay - you grind the beans, and . put them in the .. ( but she can't concentrate I don't believe this. I'm being seduced by my own husband.
BEAN: Ahm - excuse me . ( POINTING TO HIS WATCH ) You know..
ALISON: Oh yes. Sorry. Though I think these are ready.
ALISON: There. Is that how you like them?
ALISON: He's not too bad. I can live with him.
DAVID: I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down. I have a tale to tell. And not a happy one.
GRIERSON: Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents such as occurred yesterday teach a man important lessons. On reflection, I realise it would have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame myself for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had realise our the staff - twelve got today, I've Schimmel as to sell her. I suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice-
GRIERSON: He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
BERNIE: Thank you, sir. Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can .
GRIERSON: Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset? Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius. Insurance? Not a chance. Those bastards never pay. So, surely we're bankrupt? Surely your jobs are forfeit? Surely you're back on the unemployment lines, scraping a living as waiters and boys? Yes. Yes indeed. Except for one little thing. one little thing done by one little man. Dare I say, one helluva little man. Watch this.
GRIERSON: Ladies and gentlemen. The REAL Whistler's Mother!
GRIERSON: The best security in the world is no match for a master criminal. But no master criminal is a match for me. Thank you all. Now if you would please return to your posts, my new Vice President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were so rudely interrupted by events.
GRIERSON: David, David, David .
DAVID: I'm fired? Because I let a. copy of a painting the get stolen?
GRIERSON: Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse. But ..
GRIERSON: I will of course invite you an excellent reference - or Bernie
GRIERSON: Of course, Dr. Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite
GRIERSON: How are you making out there?
BERNIE: All fixed up, sir. Stick around, Davey boy. This is going to be quite a show. Hi everyone - this is your new Vice President, Bernie Shistler. Would you please watch your video screens. You're in for a treat,
BERNIE: ( V/0 )
BERNIE: Perhaps you'd like to bring up Whistler's Mother.
BERNIE: ( V/0 )
BERNIE: Just click on the corner.
BERNIE: Right let me take over now.
BERNIE: You've had long enough on it now. A joke's a joke. That's it.
BERNIE: You can stop right there, Mr! Those are confidential .
BEAN: Daaa! Daaa!
BERNIE: Excuse me, If I may just .
GRIERSON: ( calmly )
DAVID: Look at all this - publicity expenditure . catering . all completely fictional . back as far as June 93 .
BERNIE: I don't think you really understand what you're looking at .
GRIERSON: Horse shit. You're dead, grease-ball. Period. My friends, good news. Mr Schimmel is not only no longer Vice- President. He actually no longer works here.
BERNIE: But wait a minute - you can't let some moron from England turn you against me. I deny any knowledge of this. He probably typed in all this stuff himself. Don't you find it all a bit suspicious that it's here at his fingertips. ( pointing at Bean ) There's your criminal, gentlemen. There's the Limey that set me Dr. Bean. Have you got anything to say to that?
GRIERSON: Dr. Bean. Have you got anything to say to that?
BEAN: Yes- ( PAUSE ) It's exceedingly rude to point.
GRIERSON: ( to uniformed cop )
SIDE~KICK: Oh, yeah - I forgot.
GRIERSON: I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that you do not.
DAVID: VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure . Let me think about that, Thomas. We'd have to talk quite a salary Of course.
GRIERSON: Of course.
DAVID: And a car.
GRIERSON: Maybe two cars.
DAVID: Maybe two cars.
GRIERSON: A car sounds sensible.
DAVID: And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family. Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .. I've got a lot of time to make up.
ALISON: well, it's been. unusual. But thank you.
JENNIFER: Good-bye Mr Bean. Sorry I screamed that first time.
DAVID: Come on hurry or we'll be late.
DAVID: . Oh, and Grierson phoned Lord Walton at the National. Said good things about you. So expect a great reception back home,
KEVIN: Good-bye Beanie. It's Bean .. surreal. And don't forget you're welcome to come back anytime .
KEVIN: . in the distant future.
DAVID: Bye, Bean. Thanks for everything. And take care, huh? I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
CLEANER: They've moved, guy.
LORD WALTON: Is he gone?
MISS HUTCHINSON: Yes, my lord.
LORD WALTON: Tell the others.
MISS HUTCHINSON: Very well, my lord.
MISS HUTCHINSON: He's gone.
