TED: And honestly, ( sits up ) I don't even know how I feel about the whole monogamy thing, is one person really enough for anyone? I mean, I like to be with a lot of different people.

And I wouldn't even care whatever you do or I do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like no strings attached at all. I'm just different from other girls.

ANNIE: No, I love it! The gate starts to open. Annie exits.
ANNIE: Oh, shit. The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away.
LILLIAN: It's summer?! What the hell does that mean? He can't date anyone in the summer?
ANNIE: I guess? I don't know. I feel so stupid No he's stupid Ann, not you.
LILLIAN: No he's stupid Ann, not you.
ANNIE: I think I might be a little bit stupid.
LILLIAN: Ew. Did you have sex with him?
ANNIE: No! But I gave him a blow job.
LILLIAN: Well, he kept putting it in my face. Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a Luna Bar in his sweats. He's stretching and flexing his muscles trying to make her laugh.
ANNIE: Well, he kept putting it in my face. Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a Luna Bar in his sweats. He's stretching and flexing his muscles trying to make her laugh.
LILLIAN: Well, at least he was honest with you so you don't waste your time with him.
DOUGIE: Baby, look how hard I worked out. Look at all this sweat.
LILLIAN: Can you see that I'm on the phone? I'm talking to Annie.
DOUGIE: Hey Annie.
LILLIAN: Are you eating my Luna Bar? Those are for women you know?
DOUGIE: Shit. Really?!
LILLIAN: It's not gonna do anything to you.
DOUGIE: Oh my God. My breasts are getting bigger. He tries to rub up against Lillian.
LILLIAN: Ew, go take a shower. Dougie leaves.
LILLIAN: I swear I cannot handle him right now. He has been driving me crazy. Sometimes it feels like I'm kissing my brother. I don't know what do. Annie pulls into an alleyway behind HARRINGTO'S JEWELRY STORE and starts changing into her work uniform in the car. A white blouse and navy skirt.
ANNIE: At least you have someone. God, wha's wrong with me?
LILLIAN: There's nothing wrong with you. But I think maybe, and don't get mad at me, I've said this to you before, you need to stop trying so hard.
ANNIE: I still don't think I do that.
LILLIAN: OK, so you had a first date last night. Did you bring him a present? Annie is silent.
ANNIE: I brought him lemon-bars because I was making them anyway, as a friend. Yo're right, that's weird.
LILLIAN: DOUGIE ( O.S ) I just chipped a nail!
LILLIAN: Ok, I don't know if it's because I'm tired or what, but I wanna kill him.
ANNIE: Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the mirror and remember when I was getting my braces off and farted at the Lillian laughs.
LILLIAN: Oh my God. We need to hang out. 'm coming to Milwaukee this weekend.
ANNIE: Are you serious?
LILLIAN: We'll go to Joni's and pig out and I'll bring some shitty magazines, and I'm gonna spend the night.
ANNIE: God, I haven't seen you in months!
LILLIAN: I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. They hang up. Dougie is in the doorway wearing her nightie stretched over his body.
DOUGIE: Baby, I'm going through some changes.
LILLIAN: ( laughing ) You're an idiot. We see she gets a kick out of him.
ANNIE: Hi. Sorry, sorry! I'm here. I'm here.
DONNA: ( quickly ) Annie! Thank God. OK people! Gather around me please, in a tight Annie and six other employees gather around DONNA.
SANDY: Ooh, my horoscope said I would be presented with an opportunity at work today. That is eerie. That is eerie.
DONNA: Annie, that means you'll be alone in keepsakes. You think you can handle it?
ANNIE: Sometimes there is, so..there have been. At times, there has been.
DONNA: Alright everybody, let's get to work! Saneel?!.OPEN SESAME! SANEEL, the security guard, rolls his eyes and unlocks the doors. Everyone goes to work. Donna gathers her things and starts walking towards the exit with Annie tailing behind her.
ANNIE: Donna, can I talk to you for a second? I feel like if you gave me a shot at engagement rings sometime, I could really-
DONNA: Annie, what is the calibration of a 2 carat diamond in a standard English I just made all of that up. None of that was real. I just put words together. You're not ready for the big leagues. It's so hard to make commission over Sweetheart.did I ever tell you the story of the little paralyzed Chinese girl who wanted to be dancer?

ANNIE: Many times.
DONNA: She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling in her legs, and then one day after years of believing in herself, she stood up out of that chair and tap-danced for the king. On his birthday! My point is, Sandy makes a real effort around here. He connects with the customer. And when he wants to make a sale, he goes for it.
ANNIE: Okay. ( beat ) I do want it.
DONNA: ( smiling ) Good. Showing up on time is a wonderful place to start. Donna talks to herself and gathers her things.
ANNIE: Hello, can I interest you in a sterling silver money clip that will create memories for you and your family? No? We cut to a HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOW on T.V.
T.V. HOST: When Dave and Rhonda bought this house, it was a medical clinic. I've never seen so many cupboards!
STEVE: Noooo. That's, that's sooo smart. Annie enters the apartment, tired. She throws her keys down and sifts through her mail. Steve presses mute.
ANNIE: Yes. I'm beat.
STEVE: Your ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did what you said and just threw it away.
ANNIE: Thanks. Goodnight Steve! She shuts the door behind her.
STEVE: That credit lady called! She wants to talk to you, Annie! She's gonna find you. Steve sits back on the couch, un-mutes the T.V..
STEVE: INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM. She sits on her bed grabs a âSounds to Relaxâ CD with a post-it that reads, âLove, Momâ. She plays it and lies down. We hear a loud Tibetan woma's voice wailing. NOT relaxing. She turns it off and curls up on top of her INT. JONI'S RESTAURANT. THAT FRIDAY NIGHT. Annie and Lillian read magazines.
ANNIE: You're right. God, she's getting really ( quietly ) Your boyfriend just walked in. REVEAL: An orange-skinned BODY BUILDER with HUGE arms and legs in a tiny muscle tank and shorts.

LILLIAN: Oh you want to get into who's done what down at the lake?

LILLIAN: Well then, who better to be my Maid of Oh my God! I don't know what to say!
ANNIE: Oh my God! I don't know what to say!
LILLIAN: Annie, you're my best friend. Honestly I didn't even have to think about it.

LILLIAN: It's no big deal, and I don't want to make it one. It's not gonna be a big crazy thing. I wanna keep it simple. ( beat ) What dessert are you gonna get?
ANNIE: I know what you're doing. Don't downplay this. I'm happy for you. And someday when hell freezes over and I get married, you can be my Maid of Honor. But for right now, this is about you. OK? This is you're day, and it is a big deal.
LILLIAN: Ok, but I still don't want this to be a huge production. I just want to have all my friends meet each other, have fun, dance, drink, whatever.
ANNIE: Then that's what it'll be. Did you guys set a date?
LILLIAN: Oh God, not yet. I don't want a super long engagement, but there's a lot to do.
ANNIE: Well you are very fortunate because you happen have the best maid of honor in the whole wide world, and Lillian's cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles.
LILLIAN: ( mocking ) Can you hold that thought. I's my fiancee calling. Lillian gets up laughing. Annie laughs along with her.
ANNIE: Ooo, haha. Annie continues laughing alone. She looks around the room as her smile disappears. She remembers.
YOUNG ANNIE: Lillian Marie Donovan. Do you take your husband, forever, to be your husband? Lillian stands by a poster of Eric Estrada in his C.H.I.P.s uniform that is taped to a tree.
YOUNG LILLIAN: I do. Do you Annie Lucille Walker, take your husband, forever? Reveal Annie standing next to a poster of John Baker from I do.

LILLIAN: You are?
ANNIE: Yeah, so I'm pretty excited about it. It's gonna be.pretty big. So, if you ever need a discount
HELEN: You're funny. Listen Annie,I know you said you've never been in a wedding before so I just want you to know that we all have, especially me, so if you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.
ANNIE: Thank you.
DEAN: So cheers to you two, our last single friends finally crossing over into the world of marital bliss, welcome to the other side! Dana snaps a photo, crying. Helen approaches the podium.
HELEN: Hello everyone. My name is Helen Harris the Third, an honored member of the bridal party. In honor of Lillian and Dougie, I'd like to take this opportunity to read a poem that I penned last summer while I was sitting on a swing at an exclusive resort in Santorini. Annie whispers to the person next to her.
ANNIE: Am I supposed to give a speech? As Helen reads, Annie looks around the room and sees everyone in awe. Dana starts to cry. She reads from a fancy sheet of stationary.
HELEN: With every blink of an eye, every kiss of a lip, every stroke of a lovers hand, every.scent of a woman, every breath you take, every move you make. Love conquers all. Annie sees that Lillian is touched. Helen gets emotional.
ANNIE: Um, hello everybody. Hi everyone. 'm Annie. Wow, it really smells like vanilla in here.
MEGAN: It's the candles Annie.
ANNIE: Thanks Megan. Lillian this is gonna be awesome. Um, uh, God, oh, oh, oh, what's that saying?
ANNIE: Oh my God, tell me I didn't sing.
LILLIAN: No, you sang. They both laugh.
ANNIE: God, I don't know, I was just maybe a little out of my element, and after Helen's speech
LILLIAN: Ann, stop.
ANNIE: I'm so embarrassed. What did you think of your engagement party?
LILLIAN: Besides the impromptu concert from Bette Midler, it was perfect. They laugh and hug.
HELEN: Annie! Great job tonight..
ANNIE: I'm feeling slightly mortified.
HELEN: No, nononono. Not at all. Everyone gets a little nervous and carried away during those kind of things. So listen, 've been brainstorming some theme ideas for Lillian's shower. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of Alice in Wonderland meets.are you ready? Hollywood. And for the bachelorette? Aren't I supposed to be planning some of these things?
ANNIE: Aren't I supposed to be planning some of these things?
HELEN: Oh, well, I hadn't heard from you and
ANNIE: She just got engaged two weeks ago.
HELEN: Well, I figured since you don't have any experience that you might get overwhelmed by events of this caliber.
ANNIE: Helen, I'm pretty capable. I think I can handle it. A guest walks by and taps Helen.
GUEST: Excuse me, you left your poem inside. You have beautiful cursive.
HELEN: Thank you. The guest says nothing to Annie and walks away.
WOMAN: You're very pretty.
NAIL TECHNICIAN: Your nail too short for french manicure.
ANNIE: ( disappointed ) Oh well.
NAIL TECHNICIAN: That's Ok. I fix for you. Make you sexy.
ANNIE: Oh, great!
DONNA: And then they put a solution in my eyes to dilate them, which caused temporary blindness and with the loss of my sight, my hearing became bionic. Do you need some help dear? Annie struggles to open a bag of chips but her new ULTRA LONG, french-manicured nail-tips are making it very hard.
ANNIE: No, I got it.
ANNIE: Sorry. Well, it's official. Lillian set a date. October tenth. Why did I just get a stomach ache.
DONNA: Don't be nervous. It's not all on your shoulders. Doesnt she have other Yeah and they've all done this before so I'm feeling a little pressure. I have to make this really nice for Lillian.
ANNIE: Yeah and they've all done this before so I'm feeling a little pressure. I have to make this really nice for Lillian.
DONNA: I wish I could help. Weddings are a lot different now then they were in my day. They look at Donna's wedding picture on her desk.
ANNIE: That dress is beautiful.
DONNA: I still have it. I was hoping my daughter Elizabeth would wear it but when she and Alice had their âceremonyâ they both wanted to wear suits. ( beat ) Ok, we need two Shannisburg tennis bracelets. Annie struggles to write with her nails.
ANNIE: Oops. Hold on a sec, hard to write.
DONNA: They're very long.
ANNIE: Hi. I need to make these shorter.
NAIL TECHNICIAN: No, not sexy!
ANNIE: I know, it's. I can't work with them so Okay. 7 dollar for file. No more sexy Short nail is ugly.
NAIL TECHNICIAN: Okay. 7 dollar for file. No more sexy Short nail is ugly.
ANNIE: NAIL TECHNICIAN
NAIL TECHNICIAN: Short nail is ugly.
ANNIE: INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM. Annie looks up different bridesmaid dress shops
ANNIE: Here it is!
HELEN: Ooh, Occasionz. I'm impressed.
ANNIE: Everyone this is Occasionz, supposedly it's you know, one of the best bridal shops in town, so, that's cool. Oh and also, there's a restaurant inside, so um, I figured, we could maybe have lunch after. So, let's go! She goes to the door. It is locked. She sees a buzzer.
ANNIE: Hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids VOICE FROM INSIDE What's your name?
ANNIE: Oh, Annie.
ANNIE: ( to the girls ) Oh, she must be talking about the restaurant. ( back into the intercom ) No, we're here to look at VOICE FROM INSIDE I heard you the first time. So I take it you don't have a reservation for the dress shop?
BECCA: ( whispers ) You didn't make a reservation?
ANNIE: Um, no, I'm sorry, I didn't know I had to make a reservation for that. Sorry! Anyway, we're all out here now and
ANNIE: Seven weeks?!
ANNIE: ( whispers ) You didn't make an VOICE FROM INSIDE No, I can hear you. Would it be possible for you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here and I didn't know about the reservation/ appointment thing so.
DANA: ( whispers ) You didn't make an VOICE FROM INSIDE No, I can hear you. Would it be possible for you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here and I didn't know about the reservation/ appointment thing so.
I SAID: No, I can hear you. Would it be possible for you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here and I didn't know about the reservation/ appointment thing so.
ANNIE: No, I can hear you. Would it be possible for you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here and I didn't know about the reservation/ appointment thing so.
LILLIAN: Annie, we can go somewhere else.
ANNIE: No, no. I'll work it out. Don't worry.
BECCA: This really is the best place though, that's the thing.
HELEN: Listen, I know the
WHITNEY: ( intercom] Hello, this is the manager?

HELEN: Whit, it's Helen.
WHITNEY: Helen?! Hiiii!
HELEN: Hi! Listen, I'm out here with a whole bunch of girls and we had a little miscommunication and our reservation- appointment wasn't made. Is there any way to fit us in?

WHITNEY: Say no more. Buzzzzzzzz. The girls happily enter.
LILLIAN: ( sotto} Wow, thanks Helen.
LILLIAN: Ann, don't worry about it. We got in. Annie sees racks of wedding dresses.
ANNIE: Hey, you want to sneak off and look at the wedding dresses?
LILLIAN: Oh my God. Annie, I didn't tell you? Guess who Helen is friends with? Lady Lavonia Jean St. Petsois JuJu.
ANNIE: Wow. That's amazing.
LILLIAN: ( GIDDY )
LILLIAN: Surprise, surprise. It's my Mom. Mom? Can you hold on a second? She covers the phone and talks to the girls.
HELEN: Ok ladies, start your ( french ) engines! Shots of dresses being pulled off of the racks. Fighting for the same dress, shirts coming off, dresses zipped up the back and dresses not fitting, etc.
ANNIE: Hi I'm Annie. Can I get a martini? What you mean you need to see I.D.? ( giggling )
BARTENDER: Well, with that dress on you look about. .eleven.
ANNIE: Thank you. Annie laughs. And turns away right into, a GORGEOUS male model in a tuxedo.
UNDERWEAR MODEL: I'll get it for her.
ANNIE: CHRISTIAN BALE
CHRISTIAN BALE: Hi. I'm Christian Bale. I'm just chopping some wood, I like to do that between Hello Christian. They hear the voices of the men from the party screaming for her.
ANNIE: Hello Christian. They hear the voices of the men from the party screaming for her.
CHRISTIAN BALE: Quick, get inside my muscles. They embrace.
HELEN: Hi Annie!
HELEN: Look at your cute little boobies. Ooh, is that the dress you like?
ANNIE: Yeah. I think it will look good on everybody, it has a sash
HELEN: A sash? Annie, this isn't the Sound of Music tryouts.
ANNIE: DANA ( O.S. ) I told you Becca I can't wear strapless!
DANA: Because, I
LESLIE: Why don't you two shut your traps? No one's going to be looking at us. Le's just get the one with the shawl, 'm always freezing at these things anyway.
MEGAN: I gotta say I'm still leaning towards the one that I found. It is a very ugly.
LESLIE: Absolutely not.
ANNIE: Well, what about this one? Everybody stops and looks at Annie.
HELEN: Everyone! We can't all have the dress that we want. I've been in a lot of weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid dress, you must ask yourself, âIf invited, would I wear this a dress to.The ACADEMY AWARDS!â
DANA: Ooo, I never thought of it that way. All the girls agree.
HELEN: With that in mind, I say we wear this Helen holds up a dress. The girls like it.
ANNIE: Or this one! People wear sashes to the Academy Awards all the time.
HELEN: Only if they're nominated for the Sound of Music.
ANNIE: I think Lillian would like this one.
HELEN: Well, I think Lillian would like THIS Lillian walks in.
LILLIAN: Hey! I'm hearing lots of excitement in She touches Helen's dress.
HELEN: I love it. Right guys? The girls all agree. Except Annie.
LILLIAN: Cool. Let's eat! Helen dumps the dress in Annie's arms and follows I think it might look best in cream.
HELEN: I think it might look best in cream.
LILLIAN: Ooh, good idea. They exit.
LESLIE: Well, that was easy. The girls head back to change.
ANNIE: This dress is almost $500!
ANNIE: No, that's what I'm saying. That's a great price.
LILLIAN: This place is kind of amazing. I did't even know it existed.
BECCA: The southwestern cobb is really good. I come here and eat sometimes.
MEGAN: Great, there's a fly that really likes They only have salads.
ANNIE: They only have salads.
DANA: So Annie, what's your deal? Are you dating anyone?
ANNIE: No, no. Not right now. I had a boyfriend for three years but we broke up like six months ago.
BECCA: Oh, I hate to hear stuff like that! What It just didn't work out.
ANNIE: It just didn't work out.
HELEN: Is that the guy who stole a bunch of money from you and gave you an STD? Everyone freezes.
LILLIAN: I'm sorry, I was just talking about you cause I was worried about you and
ANNIE: No it's fine. But he didn't steal the money, I loaned it to him. And HPV is really common right now. Everyone looks around.
LESLIE: About 6.2 million new cases of HPV affect Americans each year.
ANNIE: About 6.2 million new cases of HPV affect Americans each year.
MEGAN: Ew, it's on the butter you guys. The fly's on the butter.
HELEN: Well, I don't have it.
ANNIE: Very few HPV infections show any signs or symptoms. Therefore a lot of infected people don't even know they have it, yet they transmit the virus to their sexual Silent. Everyone is a little grossed out..
HELEN: Do you have anyone in mind to bring to the wedding?
ANNIE: Oh, I didn't even think about that.
LESLIE: Who needs a date? Just go stag and make out with someone there.
DANA: If you wanna meet a nice man, Annie, you should come to karaoke night at my church. We sing hymns to rock beats!
BECCA: Wait. I have the perfect guy for you Annie. Mike Donahue. He went to school with Kevin.
LILLIAN: Mike from the fourth of July last year? Ooh, I've seen him Ann. He's hot.
ANNIE: And Kevin said he just sold his company for an embarrassing amount of money. But he's totally down to earth. You guys have to meet. I'm texting Kevin right now.
BECCA: And Kevin said he just sold his company for an embarrassing amount of money. But he's totally down to earth. You guys have to meet. I'm texting Kevin right now.
HELEN: I know Mike too. Megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter.
MEGAN: The fly just committed suicide. Death by Oh my gosh, if you guys got married you could live out here and see us all the Yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit around and talk about nothing while your vagina flaps in the wind like a wet paper ( sotto ) Oooh, I didn't know we were going to hear that word at lunch today.

LILLIAN: Yeah Annie, you never know.
ANNIE: EXT. HIGHWAY. ANNIE DRIVING BACK Annie is lost in thought. She hears. Sirens.
ANNIE: What?! Come on! She pulls over. Officer Rhodes approaches.
RHODES: Well, look who it is.
ANNIE: Oh hi.
RHODES: I see your still driving around with busted tail lights.
ANNIE: I'm sorry, money's been tight and.I forgot( laughing ). You're not gonna give me another ticket for that are you?
RHODES: Nah. The reason I pulled you over today, is that( searching ) you were driving too slow. Backing up traffic.
ANNIE: I was?
RHODES: Yep. You were going ten miles under the speed limit. That's a moving violation. It's.underdriving. It's in the books. But, I'm just going to give you a warning this time, but I do have to um.write some stuff down on a piece of paper. He begins to write. Beat.
ANNIE: Cayenne pepper water for three days now. It's supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter. It's working. The only problem is I get so hungry. I just want a big slab of ribs. You ever crave that kind of stuff?
RHODES: Cayenne pepper water for three days now. It's supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter. It's working. The only problem is I get so hungry. I just want a big slab of ribs. You ever crave that kind of stuff?
ANNIE: Don't talk about cravings right now. I am PMS'ing like crazy. It's taking everything in me not to stop and the store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine. I'm so irritable right They stare at each other out of awkwardness.
RHODES: No, it's OK, I've got three sisters. We had tampons in the pencil drawer. Sometimes my friends and I would say they were cigars and smoke'em. ( beat ) Okay. I have finished writing down the things I need to write, on this paper. OH! He hands her a business card.

ANNIE: Thanks. Annie. I'll get those fixed. I get paid next week. Bye! She drives off. Rhodes wishes he had been more suave.
ANNIE: Trust me, I've been in the jewelry business for a long time. Nothing says âI'm sorry for your loss' like a sterling silver money clip. An OLD WOMAN CUSTOMER looks at her stone-faced.
SANDY: Paychecks. Here you go Annie. She and Sandy open their checks.
ANNIE: I'm gonna pay for a cream-colored gown that I'll never wear again.
ANNIE: Help me! I can't find anything to wear for my date with Mike tonight.
LILLIAN: I don't know. Shoot, I can't talk now. I'm with Helen and we have a conference call with Lady Lavonia Jean St. Petsois JuJu about my dress. Ugh. I'm so sorry. She's calling! I gotta go. Have fun! Lillian hangs up. Steve walks in.
STEVE: That credit lady called you again. I told her you were at the tailors.
ANNIE: Listen, I'm going on a date. This? ( holds up a dress ) or this? ( what she's wearing )
STEVE: I don't like those pants.
ANNIE: What's wrong with'em?
STEVE: They give you four corners. Annie's not following.
ANNIE: Shit. These are my only clean pants.
STEVE: Do you have a tube skirt?
ANNIE: Thanks Steve.
STEVE: Wait. If you stand like you are right now facing that angle, it looks good. She looks in the mirror again, grabs her bag and leaves.
ANNIE: I'm not an expert in corporate real- estate but I've always been interested in it. So, yeah I totally agree. Mike smiles, he is cute!
MIKE: I have to admit, I told Becca 'm not really keen on set-ups. I know i's early, but so far so good.

WAITER: Here ya go. I'll be back to take your order in two secs. I'm swamped!
ANNIE: No problem.
MIKE: Whoa, get a load of our waiter. 'm surprised he didn't put pink umbrellas in our drinks. Annie laughs, but is a little uncomfortable.
ANNIE: ( singing ) Neither do I. He raises his eyebrows up and down at her.
MIKE: ( singing ) Neither do I. He raises his eyebrows up and down at her.
MIKE: ( LAUGHING )
ANNIE: Hey, it's me, I just had to tell you about my night. Oh my God. Call me.
RHODES: Annie Walker. I thought I heard your car out there.
ANNIE: Very funny, Officer.Jones?
RHODES: Jones? Oh boy. Guess somebody thought he was a little more memorable than he was.
ANNIE: No. Sorry. I'm a little out of it. I'm not drunk.
RHODES: That's ok. Call me Rhodes. ( notices her drink ) Trying to get âcalmâ?
ANNIE: Yeah. Recovering from a date.
RHODES: Finish your cleanse?
ANNIE: Finish your cleanse?
RHODES: Yeah, trying to wean myself back to the really bad foods I like eating.
ANNIE: Thanks for the drink. ( beat ) So are you one of those cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people?
RHODES: A lot of people get up to high speeds on this road. I tell people its better to pay for a ticket than have your family pay for a funeral.
ANNIE: That's a very good point.
OFFICER RHODES: Want a carrot?
ANNIE: Yes. I'm starving.
RHODES: Oh, you got the ugly carrot.
ANNIE: The what?
RHODES: There's one in every bag. You should eat No. I think you should eat it. The're your carrots. He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands.
ANNIE: No. I think you should eat it. The're your carrots. He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands.
RHODES: Don't litter. He picks it up.
ANNIE: I don't think I've ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life.
RHODES: Yeah, I don't go on blind dates. It seems I have no idea what am I going to tell my friends who set us up.
ANNIE: I have no idea what am I going to tell my friends who set us up.
RHODES: Just tell her the truth.
ANNIE: Yeah. You're probably right. Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car.
RHODES: You know my dad used to say that life is like a hallway of doors. You can stand at the same door forever if you want. Or you can open a different door. And that one may not be the right door, but i'll open up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway, it worked for me. I was kinda lost and I opened a door and the next thing I knew I was a cop. And I love my job.
ANNIE: Hmm. I think I get it?
RHODES: Or you can always sell moon-pies by the side of the road.
ANNIE: Moonpies. What?
RHODES: It's a joke. You had moon-pies in your car the first time I pulled you over.
ANNIE: Oh yeah.
OFFICER RHODES: When I get married I don't want the kind of wedding people have these days. I want it to be like a carnival. You know dunk tanks? People win prizes.
ANNIE: Yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze artists and a big scale to guess the bride's weight.
OFFICER RHODES: Ok, first of all that's a circus wedding and I'm talking about a carnival wedding.
ANNIE: Sorry. ( to clerk ) Yeah I'll have the number four, and can you make that Super They are sitting in the restaurant, mouths full of
BURGERS: OFFICER RHODES
OFFICER RHODES: And then she moved to Hawaii and now lives with a guy who sells shaved ice. And supposedly she has really long armpit hair now. That's pretty much the last girlfriend I had.
ANNIE: Well, lets just say my last boyfriend that I lived with broke up with me over the phone. Then come to find out, he had borrowed $30,000 in my name without telling me, putting me in horrible debt that I'm still paying off. Because I can't find him.
OFFICER RHODES: Wow. You win.
ANNIE: Oh my gosh. It's twelve thirty! I should Oh, before you go. There is something I want to give you. I was gonna wait but, I think you'll want this now. He jokingly gives her the ugly carrot.
RHODES: Oh, before you go. There is something I want to give you. I was gonna wait but, I think you'll want this now. He jokingly gives her the ugly carrot.
ANNIE: For me?!
OFFICER RHODES: Well I know you've had a terrible night. He gives it to her. Her phone rings.
ANNIE: Sorry, one sec. Hello? Ted!? Hey! Oh my gosh! No,no. Can you hold on a sec? She waves at Rhodes and mouths.
RHODES: Yeah. Don't forget about those taillights. They're really starting to bug me.
ANNIE: K. Bye.( to Ted ) So, you're in town?
TED: Next time I won't call so late.
ANNIE: No, it was fine. Like I said, I mean I was just driving.
TED: Awesome. It's cool that we can just hookup and whatever. No strings.
ANNIE: Me too. I love it. I feel good right now.
TED: Cool. Bye.
ANNIE: Shit!! No! No! I left my fucking credit card at the restaurant! Shit! She picks up her phone and dials.
HELEN: Annie, hi! I almost left, but they said that you were coming and that you were Helen is standing there looking gorgeous.
ANNIE: And as the leader of the bridesmaids, I thought it'd be fun to pick up some little gifts for all the girls.
HELEN: And as the leader of the bridesmaids, I thought it'd be fun to pick up some little gifts for all the girls.
ANNIE: Leader of the bridesmaids? Um, wouldn't that technically be me? Honor?
HELEN: Well, no, sweetie, you're the Maid of Honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out of all of us, I'm the leader. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Um, I wanted to get something that we could wear to the rehearsal dinner or something. That would be fun. Where are the diamonds?
ANNIE: Oh, well, what about a nice pen..or a tortoise-shell handled sterling silver letter opener? No? Ok, let me get Sandy.
HELEN: Oh! And Annie we really need to start planning the bachelorette.
ANNIE: Yes. Yes. I'm on it. Got some ideas. So I'll let you know.
HELEN: Can't wait.
TV HOST: Wow, well I have never seen a transformation like this. This old tour bus is stunning.
STEVE: Unbelievable. ( to Annie ) You got another package from your mom.
ANNIE: Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like I said I'll pay you back as soon as I She opens the package. And pulls out a red blazer.
STEVE: No problem. But you should always put gas in when it gets to a quarter tank. Especially cause you have such a shitty Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do you think of Vegas?
ANNIE: Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do you think of Vegas?
STEVE: Ooo. Let me turn this off. Vegas is a black hole but I must have it in my life. Does that make sense?
ANNIE: I'm just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for Lillia's bachelorette party and I've never been.
STEVE: Oh no. Now I don't know about weddings. When you go on a bachelorette, does the bride pay?
ANNIE: No, everyone pays for themselves. And you pay for the bride.
STEVE: Ok, I'm gonna say no. You cannot afford that. Vegas is not cheap. Airfare, hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show tickets. Remember this morning? You cannot afford Vegas.
ANNIE: Well, I could save up for it.
STEVE: No, you need to win a contest to go to Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday. Ooh, âNight Moves.â Can I have this? A lightbulb goes off in Annie's head. Steve holds the blazer out and reads the tag.
ANNIE: Told you I'd pay you back! Annie runs into her room. She sits down at the computer and begins typing feverishly. We see these words: âDear bridal partyâ, âgreat ideaâ, âbachelorette partyâ, âFloridaâ, âSea World!â, âFree place to stay!â. She presses send, and is very pleased. The phone immediately rings.
HELEN: Hi Helen. Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket. All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles. There are too many flames.
ANNIE: Hi Helen. Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket. All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles. There are too many flames.
HELEN: Hi Helen. Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket. All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles. There are too many flames.
ANNIE: Hi Helen. Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket. All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles. There are too many flames.
HELEN: I just got your e-mail. Um.Sea World?
ANNIE: Well it's not just Sea World. It's a weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and I were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really mean a lot to her. We could stay at my Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then Sea World on one of the But a bachelorette at Sea World?
HELEN: But a bachelorette at Sea World?
ANNIE: Like I said, Sea World would just be a part of it.
HELEN: Well, I have been talking to the other girls, and I was thinking we should go to Las Vegas! Annie's other line rings.
ANNIE: Oh, can you hold on? That's my other She clicks over.
BECCA: Hi, Annie. It's Becca. Becca, in her shabby-chic home office paints a front porch sign that says âThe Whitman'sâ
ANNIE: Oh well, Turkey's really far away.
BECCA: It's super old though! They have awesome restaurants. It's very exotic. Have you ever seen Aladdin? It totally looks like Hang on. Annie clicks back over to Helen.

ANNIE: Just a few minutes. I'll call you back. Annie clicks over.
BECCA: Hi. You know, if you wanna go some place closer than Turkey. Helen JUST e-mailed me about going to Vegas.
ANNIE: Oh, I don't know. Everybody always goes to Vegas. It seems just cliche to me.
BECCA: I never get sick of it. I love blackjack. I have a system. Annie's other line.
ANNIE: Oh, my other line's ringing. Can I call you back?
BECCA: Annie clicks over.
ANNIE: Annie clicks over.
DANA: Annie, it's Dana!
ANNIE: Of course it is.. Dana is on her porch swing drinking lemonade.

ANNIE: Do I have to? An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies. She The front door is swung open by two attendants. As she enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her.
SHOWER GIRLS: This is the most amazing shower 've ever been to/Can you believe this?/What a lucky bride/What a good friend. Helen's house is ALL cream and white with gold. Couches are puffy, etc. Annie walks to the backyard. We hear French standards. Beautiful tables are set. Swans and bunnies milling about. Attendants ready to serve. In the middle of everything stands an eight foot tall round âsignâ that says âLillian and Dougieâ in puffy pink cursive. A waiter offers Annie champagne. She takes it.
LESLIE: Do you believe this shit? Annie is still staring at the sign.
BECCA: That's a big cookie huh.

HELEN: OK, not me, NOT ME! The GUESTS. Hip hop dance with the GUESTS!

GIRL 1: ( very emotional ) I'm putting a blue bead on this âadvice necklaceâ to represent the ocean. It may not always be smooth sailing but you can ride the waves Dana cries and takes a picture. Everyone applauds,

WINDOWS ): Did you honestly think 30 women were gonna finish this?! You know what!? 'll help you out! She tries to take down the cookie and struggles with it. We watch her from the house. Fall over with the cookie, she runs over to the chocolate fountain and tries to tip it over, it's obviously too heavy. She tries to empty it with her hands onto the ground.
LILLIAN: Annie stop! I don't know what's going on.
ANNIE: Well let me fill you in. Ever since you got engaged, my life has turned to shit.
LILLIAN: I'm sorry the the happiest time in my life has brought you so much misery. Do you know how selfish that sounds?
ANNIE: I'm selfish? You're the one that's been so wrapped up in all this. Designer dressed, extravagant hotels, this shower, this is not you!
LILLIAN: This is my wedding and you've made it all about you.
ANNIE: Well at least my friendship's not for This hangs in the air. Annie storms off. Lillian storms back inside.

RHODES: Well, I can't say I'm surprised.
ANNIE: Yes. Taillights. I know!
RHODES: You should've taken it to my friend-
ANNIE: I KNOW! Yes, you're friend! But I didn't ok?! I didn't get them fixed! I don't

ANNIE: HE hit ME!
RHODES: You had no taillights! You did't get them fixed! You don't get to blame anyoe else. It's your fault. Annie starts to walk away.
ANNIE: ( TURNING AROUND )
RHODES: I know that you not taking responsibility is why we're standing out here! YOU did not make an effort to fix that problem. This hits Annie. Rhodes is physically worked up.
ANNIE: Why are you yelling at me?!
RHODES: It's dangerous! You're putting your life, and others in danger!
ANNIE: I'm! Sorry! He calms down.
RHODES: Look, all I know, is that you're kinda crazy. You're always stressed out or late, complaining about something, and now you're yelling at me! And for some reason, all I've ever wanted to do is ask you on a date.
ANNIE: Well save yourself the trouble, and Yeah, I'm not much of a hickey guy Annie remembers her hickey. He saw it?!
RHODES: Yeah, I'm not much of a hickey guy Annie remembers her hickey. He saw it?!

STEVE: Yeah. Ok, don't get mad at me, but it seems like you have a lot of those.
ANNIE: Yes I do! Right? Thank you.
STEVE: Have you considered the idea that maybe, possibly, perhaps, it's you that makes them shitty? Annie stares at him.
ANNIE: This is not about attitude. It's just the facts! My life hasn't turned it out the way I expected. I don't have any of those things that gives a person points in the world.
STEVE: I think that might be your problem. I think you read too many of those magazines. You don't need things to be someone. Tyra said that. Tyra Banks.
'S: Lillian. She doesn't even know what to say, so she doesn't answer.
WOMAN: Is anyone sitting here?
ANNIE: The lady sits next to Annie and smiles at her.
TED: Hey Annie.

TIM: Well, I can't think of anything else to tell you. Did you have any questions?

STEVE: What about the Science of Jazz?
DANA: Maybe she's at the park.
HELEN: The park? Don't be stupid Dana.
LESLIE: Jeez, take it easy.
HELEN: Well, it's closed is all I'm just saying.
MEGAN: Maybe she flew somewhere. Everyone always hides in Mexico.
BECCA: I don't think she'd leave the country. Maybe she went to the reservoir.
HELEN: Why would she go to the reservoir? Its just a big tank of water.
DANA: Ernie and I sometimes go for our morning walk there. It's the next best thing to a Oh my God! I think I know where she is.
ANNIE: Oh my God! I think I know where she is.

LESLIE: Yeah, its getting really old.
HELEN: I was being funny!
DANA: Well it came out a little mean Helen.
HELEN: Dana who's side are you on? All the girls start yelling. Helen loses control of the car for a split second and drives off the road hitting something. BOOM! The girls scream!!! She pulls over. All the girls are wide eyed and speechless.
BECCA: What was that?
DANA: Did we hit something!?
HELEN: Was it a person?
ANNIE: Guys it's just a flat. I've gotten tons of them. Annie goes to get out of the car.
HELEN: Everybody calm down. I'm calling 911.
LESLIE: You don't call 911 for a flat tire! A huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit. The girls SCREAM!
ANNIE: Guys! We're fine. Helen, put the hazards Helen puts them on.
LESLIE: I'm calling AAA.
BECCA: I'm calling Kevin!
ANNIE: Helen, do you have a jack?
HELEN: What if we get hit just sitting here? Or kidnapped or chased by an animal?
DANA: What if we get hit just sitting here? Or kidnapped or chased by an animal?
ANNIE: Dana calm down.
LESLIE: Shit! I don't have any service.
BECCA: Me neither!
DANA: Oh my God! We're gonna die. Annie has had enough and gets out. The tire is definitely flat. She opens Hele's trunk, lifts the bottom ( wherever the jack is in an Escalade] She goes up to the window.
ANNIE: Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me to fix this. They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do. Annie puts the jack under car.
LESLIE: So, how can I help?
ANNIE: Hold the flashlight. Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack. She really does know what she's doing! The car is raising.
DANA: That's pretty cool she knows how to do change a tire.
BECCA: I know. I can't believe she's doing it. Dana and Becca move over to Annie. Helen waits alone.
HELEN: Just don't scratch anything. The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe.
DANA: So what are you doing now?
ANNIE: I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off.
BECCA: How does that little thing lift the whole It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to three tons.
MEGAN: It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to three tons.
LESLIE: How do you know this stuff?
MEGAN: I like cars. There's a real artistry to Are you guys working or talking? We do't have all night.
HELEN: Are you guys working or talking? We do't have all night.
DANA: ( quickly ) Annie is doing the best she can Helen. So why don't you just stand over there and be quiet and wait.
HELEN: Excuse me?! Dana stands. She has had it with Helen.
DANA: I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck Dana approaches Helen. The other girls are standing now.
HELEN: You're so- bossy! You've been acting like you're in charge this whole time! Do't you realize how much pressure sh's under? You know, Lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn carriage?! She said âThat's not me.â And you ordered it anyway! You've been pushing her this whole time! Annie was Helen glares at Megan.
DANA: You're so- bossy! You've been acting like you're in charge this whole time! Do't you realize how much pressure sh's under? You know, Lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn carriage?! She said âThat's not me.â And you ordered it anyway! You've been pushing her this whole time! Annie was Helen glares at Megan.
MEGAN: Helen glares at Megan.
HELEN: What are you talking about? The only reason you're even in this wedding is because you're the groom's sister. I'd rather be the groom's sister than have cameltoe from my $600 pants. We see that Helen has cameltoe. Megan has surprised them.
MEGAN: I'd rather be the groom's sister than have cameltoe from my $600 pants. We see that Helen has cameltoe. Megan has surprised them.
HELEN: Why is everyone attacking me? I wasn't the one who caused a huge scene at Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry.
LESLIE: I hate to interrupt this riveting discussion but a really creepy guy in a Trans Am just pulled over. The guy gets out of the car. He is thirty-ish, wears at- shirt with a cat on it and camouflage shorts.
ANNIE: Just changing the tire.
ANNIE: Nope I think we got it. But thank you. He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other.
MEGAN: Hey! Are those snowflake rims? The guy looks at Megan.
MEGAN: I bet you got a formula 4OO under there?
MEGAN: I'm in the Firebird club.
MEGAN: You ever make it up to the Trans Am Nationals in Dayton? Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together. They talk in a loud whisper.
BECCA: What's happening? What's happening?
DANA: I can hear animals.
BECCA: Be quiet! The guy is moving closer to Megan.
MEGAN: Remember Smokey and the Bandit?
MEGAN: Why don't you show me what's under the Back at Helen's car. Leslie sneaks over to Annie.
LESLIE: How's it comin'?
ANNIE: Almost there. The guy has lifted up his hood and Mega's looking. He puts his hands on her ass.
MEGAN: He is really getting aggressive, pushing against her.
DANA: Oh my God!! Annie is frantically releasing the jack.
ANNIE: OK, everybody in the car! Get in! Megan, Helen let's go! All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it. Annie is finishing.
HELEN: Annie get in!
ANNIE: Back away! Or I will shove this Jack so far down your throat you will shit out.your fucking..face!
ANNIE: Get out!
CONTINUOUS: The girls still driving. Megan's eating chips.
LESLIE: Megan I was freaked out when he leaned up against you. That was a pretty gutsy Annie's the one who tried to make him eat a car jack.
MEGAN: Annie's the one who tried to make him eat a car jack.
ANNIE: Helen hit him over the head with a tree. They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile.
LESLIE: God I haven't been here in forever.
ANNIE: The house is right up here. They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car.
HELEN: Her car's not here.
DANA: Doesn't look like any lights are on.
BECCA: She's not here. Annie is sitting on the front step, defeated.
ANNIE: I thought she'd be here. I really thought she'd be here. I'm sorry.
DANA: Annie, it's ok.
ANNIE: No, it's not. I don't know what happened. I messed everything up. Lillia's not even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid to see what's really happening. Lillian's moving on to this great life and I feel left behind. And know matter how hard I try, I don't fit in to her life now. Everyone is silent.
HELEN: Annie, Lillian loves you. ( beat] I know I haven't made things easy for you.. I don't have a life and I am bored. Perry is always away and I'm constantly alone and she's been there. And I've been a bridesmaid nine times and although I may have implied it, I..I've never been a Maid of Honor. I wanted to make everything special for Lillian because. I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted her to like me better and to impress her, and everyone else. And I'm just good at throwing parties. I always have been. In fact sometimes I think people only ask me to be in their wedding's because of that.
ANNIE: Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked you to be in her wedding it's because you are her friend. Trust me. Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled by the flash.
HELEN: I'm sorry about the Sea World tickets.
ANNIE: I'm sorry that when I left the shower I told your neighbors you were shooting a Oh, I didn't know that you did that.
HELEN: Oh, I didn't know that you did that.
ANNIE: Oh, well, sorry.
HELEN: I deserved it.
ANNIE: I must say you do put on some pretty spectacular events.
HELEN: Well, I'm really rich. They smile.
ANNIE: It is getting pretty late.
DANA: What should we do about Lillian?
ANNIE: She'll come home when she's ready.
ANNIE: You okay?
LILLIAN: Yeah. Didn't mean to make anyone worry.
ANNIE: It's okay. I really am sorry.
LILLIAN: I'm sorry too. I didnt want things to turn out like this. I got so caught up in the frenzy of everything, wanting this one day to be perfect.
ANNIE: Well its easy to get caught up.
LILLIAN: And it doesnt help that all my friends hate eachother.
ANNIE: I'm sorry. But it's all good now. We all talked and everythings cool.
HELEN: Yup, Helen and I are best friends now. We're going shopping for cream sweaters She's really not so bad.
ANNIE: Yup, Helen and I are best friends now. We're going shopping for cream sweaters She's really not so bad.
LILLIAN: She's really not so bad.
ANNIE: I know.
LILLIAN: I just wish the wedding hadnt become about everything and everyone else but me and Dougie. And now, it's become this thing I never wanted. I did want simple. I wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights and food everywhere. I wanted a DJ to play all those stupid wedding songs.
ANNIE: It's not too late to have those things.
LILLIAN: I'm sorry I didn't know all the stuff you were going through too. Annie is clearly sad.
ANNIE: It's fine. I just feel really lost right
NOW AND: Lillian hugs her.
LILLIAN: Nothing's going to change.
ANNIE: Oh God dont say that.
LILLIAN: I mean between you and me.
ANNIE: You want to come in? Steve's home. This could be your last chance as a single EXT HIGHWAY. VERY EARLY NEXT MORNING The small paper bag sits on the side of the road. Cop car pulls up. This is Rhodes' spot, we've seen before. He gets out and walks over to it, confused. He picks it up and it says, âOfficer Rhodesâ. He's a little weary but opens it and pulls out a note. âI hear you like moonpies.â He looks in the bag and smiles.

STEVE: Thanks a lot for bringing me.
ANNIE: Thanks for coming with me. Megan appears on her other side.
MEGAN: Yeah, thanks for bringing him.
LILLIAN: So when does school start?
ANNIE: A week. I'm scared. I'm gonna be the oldest one there.
LILLIAN: So what? Now you can have an affair with your teacher and it won't be gross. They walk down the steps.
ANNIE: ( kidding ) MMM. No. That's not true at all. You were pretty terrible. Today you were good. Annie sees the hotel shuttle.
LILLIAN: ( kidding ) MMM. No. That's not true at all. You were pretty terrible. Today you were good. Annie sees the hotel shuttle.
ANNIE: Oh, I want to catch this shuttle back to the hotel.
LILLIAN: You're always gonna be my best friend. They hug goodbye. She runs down the stairs.
ANNIE: I will see YOU in a couple weeks Mrs. Lillian waves goodbye and turns to go back inside. Annie runs towards the shuttle. She's too late. The shuttle drives away without her. She JUST missed it.
ANNIE: How did you know I was here?
RHODES: It was really complicated. I remembered the name of this place, I called them up, told them I was a cop calling on official police business, doing a very big investigation and uh, made them tell me all the weddings they had planned for the next two months with a bride named Lillian. [ALT: I'm a cop] Annie smiles.
ANNIE: They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
RHODES: Yes I did.
ANNIE: Did you like' em?
RHODES: Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were completely covered in ants.
ANNIE: Ooo, I didn't think about that.
RHODES: You probably should have put it in a plastic wrap or maybe a foil or something. Tupperware would've worked but then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm gonna kiss you right now so. He walks to her and takes her in his arms. They are about to kiss. Rhodes stops.
ANNIE: ( SMILING )
ALT ENDING: Annie is walking back to her hotel. A cop car pulls up next to her.
ANNIE: How did you know I was here?
RHODES: I'm a cop. They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
ANNIE: So, did you get the moonpies?
RHODES: Yes I did.
ANNIE: Did you like' em?
RHODES: Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were completely covered in ants.
ANNIE: Ooo, I didn't think about that.
RHODES: The real reason I came here today is that I have something that belongs to you. He opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot. She smiles. He stops the car and unlocks the passenger door. She gets in. They drive off into the sunset.
