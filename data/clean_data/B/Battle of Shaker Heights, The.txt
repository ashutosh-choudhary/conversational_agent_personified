KELLY: Where the hell are those Krauts?
KELLY: Determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on foot through the forest.
KELLY: AGAINST THE TREE Kelly focuses himself. Then he shoulders his carbine. Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly.
KELLY: "And so they buried Hector, breaker of horses."
GERMAN OFFICER: ( O.S. ) Eine maus findet den kase.
KELLY: Kill me Adolf.
GERMAN OFFICER: Mien Prisoner!
KELLY: Hey, Siegfreid and Roy. What are you waiting for? Kill me.
KELLY: Come on you pussies. Let's get this over with. You will write your mother. Tell her how you will die now.
GERMAN OFFICER: ( German accent ) You will write your mother. Tell her how you will die now.
KELLY: Genuine Third Reich issue, no less. Nice work.
GERMAN OFFICER: You will write. How you die alone.
KELLY: My mother and I don't have that kind of relationship.
GERMAN OFFICER: ( hisses ) Enough. Now you will beg for your What don't you understand?
GERMAN OFFICER: Enough. Now you will beg for your What don't you understand?
KELLY: What don't you understand?
INFANTRYMAN: ( interrupts sheepishly in German accent ) The protocol says we should -
GERMAN OFFICER: I am the fucking protocol.
GERMAN OFFICER: Beg - for - your - life!
KELLY: You got to be kidding me.
GERMAN OFFICER: Silence. Now I have a little fun.
KELLY: Now that's against the rules.
GERMAN OFFICER: ( sneers ) There are no rules in war.
KELLY: ( to Officer ) You've never killed anyone before, have you?
GERMAN OFFICER: I shower in the blood of my victims
GI: No wonder you smell so bad.
GERMAN OFFICER: Don't shoot, please.
GI: Will you look at the manners on this Remember to thank me when I kill No, really, not in the neck -
GERMAN OFFICER: No, really, not in the neck -
GI: ( to Kelly ) You all right?
KELLY: Yeah. My elaborate death scene wasn't going anywhere anyway.
GI: You want me to give you a minute?
KELLY: That's okay. They'll get me eventually. If you can't get killed in a war, when can you?
GI: That's right. Look on the bright
GI: Bart. Bart Bowland.
KELLY: Kelly. Kelly Ernswiler.
BART: ( mimics ) I mean - that's Irish, right?
KELLY: ( mimics ) I mean - that's Irish, right?
BART: I mean - that's Irish, right?
GERMAN OFFICER: ( from the floor, now with a decidedly American accent ) Wow man, this is a really beautiful scene and all, but I have to ( to Bart ) Why the fuck did you have to shoot that cap so close to my neck? You gave me a powder burn.
KELLY: Listen you wienerschnitzel. You should talk. You slapped me. I'm not your
GERMAN OFFICER: Well, what was that whole creepy death wish thing about?
KELLY: Well it didn't work, now did it?
GERMAN OFFICER: ( shrugs ) Sometimes I get so caught up in the And what was that ridiculous shit about making me write to my mother?
KELLY: And what was that ridiculous shit about making me write to my mother?
GERMAN OFFICER: Inspired, wasn't it?
BART: Dude, you made him write to his mother? Who are you, Dr. Phil?
INFANTRYMAN: ( also with American accent ) Can we get up now?
BART: Might as well. There's only an hour left anyway.
GERMAN OFFICER: ( to Kelly ) Admit it. You were scared.
KELLY: ( snorts )
BART: That Willys yours?
KELLY: Yup. Just got her. Three summers packing out at Shop Rite.
KELLY: My bad. Thanks though.
KELLY: See you.
KELLY: Well, come on.
KELLY: I couldn't resist.
BART: Real funny, Ernswiler. You might still get your chance to die today.
BART: Character building? Those crazy guys from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock.
KELLY: ( shrugs ) That's what you get for invading D-Day at Kenosha was nothing. At Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a guy who actually injected himself with malaria.
BART: D-Day at Kenosha was nothing. At Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a guy who actually injected himself with malaria.
KELLY: That's crazy.
BART: Where do you live, anyway?
KELLY: Shaker Heights.
BART: That explains the death wish. Me too. What street?
KELLY: Penn Place.
BART: ( chewing ) Hmm, don't know it.
KELLY: It's not technically in Shaker Heights - but I go to Shaker Heights High.
BART: Langely Prep.
KELLY: Sorry to hear that.
BART: Well, I got kicked out of Shaker Heights High because my birdhouse came unglued in honors woodshop.
KELLY: Of course. I would have gone to Langely myself only my polo pony had the fits.
BART: No matter. We're all soldiers here.
CROWD: That's right./Here, here./ Whooping, cheers, etc.
BART: You should come over some time. Service our lawnmower.
KELLY: I would, but then I might soil my croquet whites. You understand.
BART: How bourgeois. Cheerio then.
KELLY: Sleep tight Hot Lips.
ABE: Sergeant Keller! How was the war? Did we win?
KELLY: Let me guess. Happy Meals for the wavy gravy wellness center?
ABE: As usual, your cynicism is refreshing.
KELLY: As usual, your cheerful optimism makes me ill.
ABE: ( lightly ) You should get that checked.
KELLY: ( O.S. ) Sure thing, doc. Say hello to Leif Garrett for me.
MAO: ( to Kelly ) Son of Eve. You are very dirty.
KELLY: ( awkward ) A rough charge. You know.
EVE: ( to Kelly ) Don't touch anything. We have to get ready for the Starving Artist show. ( to Xiou-Xiou ) Now Nana, the gold has to be feathery, not gloppy - see?
EVE: Now you try.
EVE: ( to Kelly ) She loves the gold. Always overuses it. And usually her touch is so light.
KELLY: You know why we never have anything to eat in this house?
EVE: Mao, what did we say about the eyes?
MAO: More - empathy?
EVE: That's right. And didn't I tell you to put in more cacti?
MAO: ( shakes head ) No, no more cacti. Too busy. Simplicity is best.
EVE: Oh boy. I'm not having this battle with you again.
KELLY: Because your husband takes food from his own family to feed every loser druggie in Cleveland.
EVE: Well, you can always chip in here. We're ordering pizza later.
KELLY: No. Some people have to work later. Will you drop something off at the dry cleaners for me tomorrow? Sweetie, you know what we said about paying for the war things. Nothing's It's the only thing I ever ask you Don't be dramatic.
EVE: Sweetie, you know what we said about paying for the war things. Nothing's It's the only thing I ever ask you Don't be dramatic.
KELLY: It's the only thing I ever ask you Don't be dramatic.
EVE: Don't be dramatic.
KELLY: But it's important to me.
EVE: You're just going to have to find a way to pay for it yourself then, I No - not that way - the sky should be stormier. Angry clouds.
KELLY: Why do I bother?
EVE: More brown, less blue.
ABE: Now Keller, who needs that sandwich more - you or the daughter of a crack addict trying to make a new life?
KELLY: How about the son of a heroin addict trying to get ready for work? That went well.
ABE: That went well.
SARAH: So how'd your battle go today? I still don't understand how you could reenact the Battle of the Bulge in seventy-two degree weather. Didn't all those guys freeze to death?
KELLY: Well, a Port-a-John fell over on a couple of guys.
SARAH: That's gross.
KELLY: War is hell.
SARAH: Then why do you do it?
KELLY: You're never more alive then when facing simulated death.
SARAH: Really? Maybe I should try it.
KELLY: You are William J. Stone of the 1st Airborne, pinned down in Noville. The Germans have the high ground and they're shelling your position You're holed up in a stone barn. Sustaining heavy casualties. Running low on ammo. The cries of wounded men fill the air like the cries of hungry babies.
KELLY: Your commanding officer gets hit in the face, dies. At 1 p.m. you lose radio contact with headquarters. If you withdraw, the Germans will flank the entire Allied forces arrayed along Bastogne and break the front. What do you do? What do you do?
SARAH: Stop it!
KELLY: Battle of Bulge, the Southern Shoulder, December '44.
SARAH: Sorry I asked.
KELLY: Hey. Want a snack? We got a whole shipment in of busted Oreo's. I'll accidentally drop a couple pints of milk and meet you over there.
SARAH: I'll accidentally drop a couple pints of milk and meet you over there.
SARAH: The frozen food woman came in with her kids. They must eat out of those little cardboard trays every night. One of the kids looked like cardboard.
KELLY: Do you know we stock more flavors of cat food than we do baby food?
SARAH: Sixteen flavors of baby food including the toddler meals-in-ajar, thirty- one flavors of cat food.
KELLY: Sixteen flavors of baby food including the toddler meals-in-ajar, thirty- one flavors of cat food.
KELLY: Next time you should tell that woman to buy her kid some cat food.
WOMAN: Is this store open? I've been waiting up front. If the store's closed, it shouldn't have a sign that says twenty- four hours. Sorry about that.
SARAH: Sorry about that.
WOMAN: I have a lot of coupons and I don't want to be here when they expire.
KELLY: ( to Sarah ) Charge her double for everything.
LANCE: What the fuck are you looking at, GI
LANCE: No really, what makes you think you can look at me?

BRIDGET: Stop it.
LANCE: What? What?
MR. NORMAN: He hurries through to the next slide. It doesn't matter anyway. Everyone is almost asleep. Except Kelly, who becomes increasingly irritated the more Mr. Norman talks.
MR. NORMAN: And here, at Gettysburg, the ranks of Union soldiers fought bravely on. They were willing to give their lives so that others might be free.
MR. NORMAN: Is there a problem Mr. Ernswiler?
KELLY: But Mr. Norman doesn't start talking again. He waits, looking at Kelly, smiling blandly. Until the silence becomes uncomfortable. And Kelly gets mad.
KELLY: Come on. Isn't this analysis a tad simplistic? I mean, maybe for a second grade history class, sure - but to insist on still characterizing the Civil War as some moral struggle? The soldiers were drafted - the only ones who had to fight were the ones who couldn't afford to pay their way Why don't you talk about the Draft Riots? Where are your slides for
HOLMSTEAD: What gives you the idea that you can or ought to question the curriculum?
HOLMSTEAD: Or question your teacher?
KELLY: I know. I mean, who ever heard of a classroom dialog? Not Socrates.

KELLY: Looking for a backpack.
BART: Is that all? Don't bother. I have a couple extras at home. I could give you one if you want.
KELLY: ( beat ) Sure, I guess.
KELLY: Very impressive.
BART: My dad's real into hoarding.
KELLY: What's this?
BART: Grant's field flask.
KELLY: Wow. Your dad should meet my history teacher. He sent me to the principal's office today for questioning his G- rated interpretation of the Civil Forget him.
BART: Forget him.
KELLY: I would, but now the principal's making me give a speech on the Civil War at an assembly.
BART: ( laughing in sympathy and amusement ) What is he, some kind of sadist?
KELLY: She thinks she's doing me a favor.
BART: Jesus, she must think you're really screwed up. Are you?
KELLY: Depends on who you ask. Everyone's got an opinion.
BART: ( grabs box ) Take this. That'll shut them up.
BART: Stonewall Jackson's.
KELLY: Yeah right.
BART: Can you imagine that? Losing your leg and getting back up on your horse? Unbelievable. What balls.
BART: He's got so much crap crammed in here he doesn't even notice when it's missing. I saw a backpack in here somewhere.
BART: I thought he had a couple.
KELLY: I'd feel weird taking one out of the tomb of Tutenkamen anyway.
BART: Trust me, you shouldn't. Where'd your old one go?
KELLY: I lost it.
BART: A pause. Kelly decides to tell him.
KELLY: Someone took it.
BART: You let someone take it?
KELLY: I didn't let him. I told off some Sounds like your mouth gets you into trouble a lot.

BART: Tabby, this is Kelly.
TABBY: ( to Kelly ) Don't give him any money, whatever you do.
BART: Shut up.
TABBY: All these little old ladies are looking for him in Arizona. He took their retirement money and bought defective bazookas with it.
BART: Very funny. We're paying attention to you, are you happy now?
TABBY: Finally, my life is complete. Fait Minnie's making sloppy joes. Want Sloppy joe? Sloppy no.

EVE: He was going to but he had to go lead a meeting at Care House.
KELLY: What a surprise.
EVE: I'll make it up to you.
KELLY: Where have I heard that before?
EVE: When are you going to give me a break?
KELLY: Let me think - maybe when I finally forget every single word of The Little Mermaid soundtrack I'd listen to in the car waiting for him to score. No, probably when I don't prepare myself before I go into the bathroom, expecting to find him passed out on the floor.
KELLY: Actually, you know what? I know I'll be able to put it all behind me when I go away to college. Only, I can't go because someone spent my college fund on Mexican Black Tar.

KELLY: ( shrugs ) Tennis injury.
TABBY: You paint?
KELLY: Well, you see. That's a difficult How so?
TABBY: How so?
KELLY: I don't really feel comfortable calling anything done since the Renaissance "painting." We might have a more experimental interaction with the picture plane, but our skills have suffered from it.
KELLY: You're working with acrylic. Why? Oil's much - richer.
TABBY: Oh you're not one of those oil snobs are you?
KELLY: Of course not.
KELLY: It's just - isn't acrylic a bit - Jejune? You're jejune. How old are you anyway?
TABBY: Jejune? You're jejune. How old are you anyway?
KELLY: Older than my years.
TABBY: And you paint?
KELLY: Well, you know, my mother's kind of an artist, so -
TABBY: That explains it.
KELLY: That explains nothing. Doesn't anyone believe in innate knowledge anymore? Michelangelo was fifteen when he painted the Infanta.
TABBY: Infantas are Spanish. Michelangelo was Italian.
KELLY: Exactly. One world, one people. Just like Jesse Jackson envisioned.
TABBY: Well - Kelly. Nice talking to you.
KELLY: What the hell did you just say?
MILITARY STALL: Bart sweeps his eye over everything. A SKINNY GUY wearing a wife beater has some not half-bad stuff. Kelly, bruise faded to yellow and green, examines a glass mason jar of what seems to be dirt.
SKINNY GUY: ( to Kelly ) That there's actual sand from Iwo Or your sister's sandbox.
BART: Or your sister's sandbox.
SKINNY GUY: Well, it don't come with no certificate of authenticity. I could write one up for you, I suppose. Get it notarized.
BART: No, that's quite all right. Actually, I'm in the market for medals.
SKINNY GUY: Sure. I got a couple purple hearts. A Silver Star. DSC. Can't sell them to you though. They were gramp's.
BART: Are you sure?
SKINNY: They have a lot of sentimental value
BART: Yeah. How much?
SKINNY GUY: A lot.
SKINNY GUY: What's this?
BART: General Ulysses S. Grant's field flask, my friend.
BART: Throw in one of those backpacks and we'll call it even.
KELLY: Buying and selling US service medals is illegal.
BART: Exactly. That's why the resale value is so high.
KELLY: Is that what they teach you at Don't be so naïve. We all have our skeletons. Some of them just pay more than others.
BART: Don't be so naïve. We all have our skeletons. Some of them just pay more than others.
KELLY: And I'm not even going to ask about the flask.
BART: Don't ask, don't tell. The army gets everything right, don't they?

BART: Not at Dartmouth. Where are you going to go to school?
KELLY: I'm not.
BART: Ah, you have that luxury.
KELLY: You don't?

TABBY: Hey. I have some stretcher bars out in the car. Can somebody help me bring them in?
BART: Of course we'll drop what we're doing because what you're doing must be more important.
KELLY: Sure. I mean, I'll help.
BART: I'll find those reports.
KELLY: Gold. The color of the sun.

TABBY: It is.
KELLY: What about Farmer?
TABBY: Tabby unrolls the canvas and measures lengths.
KELLY: The boyfriend.
TABBY: ( laughs ) Miner? What about him?
KELLY: Is he an artist, too?
TABBY: No. Definitely not. Thank god.
TABBY: You said your mom was a painter?
KELLY: She was, well - is I guess.
TABBY: What do you mean?
KELLY: She used to be. But then my dad - wasn't working anymore so she turned it into a business. She has a family of Chinese immigrants in the garage making them for her.
TABBY: Like Andy Warhol's Factory.
KELLY: More like Andy Warhol's tool shed. It was nice before, though. My playpen used to be in her studio.
TABBY: Wow. So you really grew up with it. What does, did, your dad do?
KELLY: He's a VH-1 documentary without the "Tragedy struck?"
TABBY: "Tragedy struck?"
KELLY: "And then, things took a turn for the worse."
TABBY: Well, just wait. Those burnout types always have a triumphant comeback I already changed the channel.
KELLY: I already changed the channel.

BART: Enough with the mind pollution, Hanoi I'm worried about you playing with diffusion unsupervised.
KELLY: I'm worried about you playing with diffusion unsupervised.
TABBY: Are you?
KELLY: Yes. I might have to come by and show you the proper safety procedures. Some time in the presence of an art prodigy would do you good.
TABBY: I don't think I have room for a playpen in here.
KELLY: Tabby smiles. Kelly leaves.
BART: So, you have a thing for my sister?
KELLY: What? No, no.
BART: Everybody does.
KELLY: We just have a few things in common.

ABE: He just needs a place to sleep for the night.
KELLY: You're right. Besides, having him here makes it feel like home.
ABE: I've been straight for four years, almost five. A third of your life.
KELLY: Big whoop. I've been straight the whole time.

LANCE: ( V.O. cont'd ) Baby will be waiting where Daddy least expects her. Love, Bridgie." Do you have everything?
BART: Do you have everything?
BART: We can't afford any errors.
KELLY: You don't need to tell me. It's my ass on the line.
BART: I wish I could be there to see it.
KELLY: You'll get the de-brief.
BART: It's a day that will live in infamy.
KELLY: You couldn't do any better than that?
BART: I don't hear you coming up with

LANCE: Nothing, you bad girl.
BRIDGET: Did you drink a bottle of Robitussin before school again?

LANCE: Ooh, push my buttons.
LANCE: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You little minx.
BART: ( serious grownup voice ) Yes, I need to get a message to Bridget Shumann. This is MENSA.
BRIDGET: But I just got this note last period.

STUDENT 1: Look, he's got a hard on.
STUDENT 2: Lance stumbles off stage to HOOTS and CATCALLS, but mostly hysterical LAUGHTER.
BART: You're kidding me.
KELLY: Yup. There it was. The whole school saw it. Wasn't too impressive either.
BART: To Operation Mincemeat.
KELLY: To the 193rd.
BART: How does it feel to give better than you get?
KELLY: Good. Real good.
BART: You want some more?
KELLY: ( croaking ) Don't mind if I do.
BART: That's my boy.
KELLY: You know what this is?
KELLY: Eighteen volts of pure freedom.
SARAH: Sounds dangerous.
KELLY: Oh, it is. Unless you know how to handle it.
KELLY: You ever seen the freshly waxed floor in the produce section glistening under full florescence? It's
KELLY: Hold on tight.
KELLY: Close call.
SARAH: Have you been drinking?
MINNIE: Kelly? Bart's not here, he -
KELLY: Oh, that's all right. Actually, I'm here to see Tabby. Just to do a little painting with her.
MINNIE: She's out back in her studio.
KELLY: INT. TABBY'S STUDIO Tabby stands barefoot in the sunlight, a palette knife in her hand. Music's playing. Jeff Buckley. She looks over as the door opens, surprised.
TABBY: Hey. I warned you I'd come.
KELLY: Hey. I warned you I'd come.
TABBY: You did.
KELLY: Maybe I should go
TABBY: Well you're here now. Go ahead. Set your canvas up. Use one of the ones in the corner.
TABBY: Brushes are in the jar. Paint's in the drawer.
KELLY: I brought my own.
TABBY: Well then.
KELLY: Does it mess up your concentration? Me being here?
TABBY: She turns back to her painting.
KELLY: Oh. That's good.
TABBY: Just don't talk.
KELLY: Why would I?
TABBY: ( pause ) I'm kidding.
KELLY: Right. Irony. I like that.
MINER: ( O.S. ) Hey! Hey babe.
MINER: Miner Webber.
KELLY: Webber Miner.
TABBY: Kelly. This is Kelly -
KELLY: Kelly Ernswiler. Sorry. I -
MINER: Quite all right. So, what do we have here, a little painting class?
TABBY: Kelly's a friend of Bart's. He paints.
MINER: Oh? What's your real job?
KELLY: That would be stock boy at the Shop Rite. But, as President Don Kaminsky says, every employee is part owner. So you could say I'm a captain-of- industry in training. Kind of capitalist larva.
MINER: That's quite an image.
KELLY: Only if you see the most magical part. Do you see?
MINER: Kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little.
KELLY: One day I'll be a beautiful butterfly. First I'll have to be a pupa though. I figure I won't be going out much then. Pupa: the awkward adolescence of the insect world.
MINER: Whatever it takes to get you through the day.
MINER: I have the afternoon off. Come away with me.
TABBY: I'm not at a good stopping point.
MINER: Oh, come on. They'll still be here. I know you'll still be here.
TABBY: I really shouldn't.
MINER: But everyone will be coming soon. And it will get all crazy, and we won't have any time to ourselves.
TABBY: We will. I promise.
MINER: Like tonight? We can practice honeymoon suite.
TABBY: Maybe. Probably.
KELLY: Is he always like that?
TABBY: Like what?
KELLY: Tabby stops and puts down her brush.
TABBY: Just because he didn't want to picture you as a pupa?
KELLY: Oh, he will - later. When he's alone. Whether he wants to or not.
KELLY: Not that though. How he wanted you to stop.
TABBY: He wants to be with me. What's so bad about that?
KELLY: Just because some one wants to be with you doesn't mean they're good for you.
KELLY: No one should ever ask you to stop. If you stop, you might not be able to start again. Or you might start again, only things will be different.
TABBY: Well, that's sweet -
KELLY: It's not sweet, actually. It's just the truth.
TABBY: Hey, I can take care of myself.
KELLY: When's the wedding?
TABBY: At the end of the month. But don't ask me about it. It makes me nervous.
KELLY: Why? Is something wrong?
TABBY: Awkward silence.
TABBY: What are you painting?
KELLY: Really, there are so many layers of - imagistic symbolism - that I really don't feel comfortable summing it up, but, well - it's a recurring dream image. A mermaid riding a rocket
TABBY: What do you mean, "how?" Sidesaddle. She's riding it sidesaddle. She's got a fish tail, for chrissake. I haven't decided yet if she's got scuba gear on or not.
KELLY: What do you mean, "how?" Sidesaddle. She's riding it sidesaddle. She's got a fish tail, for chrissake. I haven't decided yet if she's got scuba gear on or not.
TABBY: Do you have any idea what you're talking about? Does that matter?
KELLY: Does that matter?
TABBY: Well, some people actually say what they really think.
KELLY: What if they don't know what they really think?
TABBY: It doesn't matter. It's called being Sounds boring.
KELLY: Sounds boring.
TABBY: Not boring. Scary and wonderful and
KELLY: Hey. I'm trying to create here. Stop distracting me.
KELLY: Mom's got you working late?
KELLY: Wow. You're really good. Why do you make those stupid animals for mom?
KELLY: I'm making a lot of art these days. I guess that means a lot of lessons.
KELLY: Oh, that's all?
EVE: Hey you two. I'll try not to act surprised. It might spoil the moment.
KELLY: I can't do this. I have to go.
EVE: Keller, I think I'm missing some art supplies. Have you seen them around the house?
KELLY: No, I haven't.
EVE: I don't know what to do with him.
EVE: When are you going to let me give you your own show? We could do it for real.
BART: ( to Harrison ) But I told you I want to take German's a Cold War language. You can't get any kind of State Department position without more diverse linguistic training than that. You'll take Chinese.
HARRISON: German's a Cold War language. You can't get any kind of State Department position without more diverse linguistic training than that. You'll take Chinese.
HARRISON: Are we on the same page?
BART: ( mutters ) Same page.
MATHILDA: ( to Tabby ) So darling, when are you going to bite the bullet and do the seating
TABBY: I can't deal with that stuff, ma. I don't care who sits next to whom. I should have eloped.
KELLY: After all, Mrs. Bowland, sometimes when you bite the bullet, it explodes in your mouth.
MATHILDA: ( tentatively ) Why, I've never thought about it before but that is a rather strange expression, isn't it? You wouldn't say, "Sooner or later you've got to put the grenade in your pants," would But have you ever noticed how in movies they always bite the grenade before they throw it?
HARRISON: But have you ever noticed how in movies they always bite the grenade before they throw it?
KELLY: Yeah, but they never take a bite out of their pants.
MATHILDA: What an unusual conversation! Do you have similar discussions at the dinner table with your family, Kelly?
KELLY: Basically. I ask why all the furniture is missing and my Dad reminisces about dropping acid and watching Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.
TABBY: He talks about art.
KELLY: My mother's kind of an artist, so -
HARRISON: You come from a creative family, do
MATHILDA: I wish my boys would talk to me about my passions. I can't get them anywhere near the subject of my garden.
KELLY: I noticed your magnolias. Very fine They are fine, aren't they?
MATHILDA: They are fine, aren't they?
BART: ( ironic ) Is there nothing you can't discuss? Here, Kelly, try a bit of these leeks. Minnie has a way with the white sauce.
HARRISON: Here, Kelly, try a bit of these leeks. Minnie has a way with the white sauce.
BART: My dad has this friend who's a director. He's shooting a documentary for the History Channel.
KELLY: He needs some guys to do a reenactment of some European theater battles for
BART: He needs some guys to do a reenactment of some European theater battles for
KELLY: We're going to be on the History
BART: I haven't asked you yet.
KELLY: Oh, come on.
BART: Well, if you want to. Next weekend. But you have to take it seriously.
KELLY: What do you mean? Of course I will.
BART: From what I've seen, you play fast and loose with your characterizations. This has got to be straight up.
KELLY: I'm not "fast and loose." I play the emotional truth. I make it real.
BART: Like back in the dining room?
KELLY: What does that have to do with it?
BART: ( mimics ) "I noticed your magnolias. Very fine specimens." That was real?
KELLY: What is this about?
BART: ( shrugs ) You just seem to have your own agenda, that's all.
KELLY: My own agenda? What other reason is there to do anything?
BART: I'm just saying. I know the difference between fantasy and reality.
KELLY: Are you saying I don't?
BART: I don't know.
BART: Why didn't you tell me your dad was a burn-out?
KELLY: Why do you steal from yours?
PRINCIPAL: Kelly! I told some of your teachers about your presentation. We're all really looking forward to it.
SARAH: What presentation?
KELLY: I don't want to talk about it. As a matter of fact, do me a favor and pretend you never heard anything about it.
SARAH: Okay. Um.
KELLY: What, Sarah?
SARAH: It's nothing. I -
SARAH: I have an extra ticket to Aerosmith this weekend.
KELLY: Aw Sarah, that's really great, I mean. It's just that - I'm busy.
SARAH: Oh. Yeah, I figured. Okay. I'll see you in the dairy section, though.
KELLY: She stands there looking lost.
KELLY: What are you doing here?
BART: I tracked you down. There's someone I'd like you to meet.
CHARLIE: ( to Kelly ) Are you one too?
KELLY: And what do you see in that?
CHARLIE: And what do you see in that?
KELLY: Living, dying, camaraderie, bravery - the big stuff. Things we don't have anymore.
CHARLIE: I see.
CHARLIE: And do you think it's brave getting trench foot and syphilis, eating another ration of spoiled frank and beans out of a dented can?
KELLY: Well, no -
CHARLIE: Yeah, that wouldn't be much fun, would it?
KELLY: No, sir.
CHARLIE: Parts of it were kind of fun though. I got separated from my platoon and lived for two weeks in the forest of the Ardennes living off what I could I felt very close to the land.
BART: I met him when my mom made me go around caroling with the Youth Group.
KELLY: You don't really believe that stuff about Berlin? And Hitler's compound?
BART: Does it matter?
KELLY: Of course it matters. Doesn't the truth matter?
BART: I don't know. You tell me.
KELLY: I want a drink. Let me borrow a couple I told you not to play him for money.
BART: I told you not to play him for money.
KELLY: I was trying to be nice. He's your
BART: Exactly. You should know better. What do you want.
KELLY: Mountain Dew -
KELLY: Oh shit.
EVE: Kelly backtracks towards the car.
BART: That woman's calling you.
KELLY: ( low ) Bart. Meet my mom.
EVE: What a nice surprise. It's so nice to finally meet you.
BART: Likewise. So, doing a little business?
EVE: A little is right. But I work it as much as I can.
EVE: So, what have you boys been up to?
KELLY: Bart took me to meet his friend Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home.
EVE: Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home?
KELLY: You don't know him.
EVE: You boys should swing by Care House. There are some Vets there.
KELLY: We can't.
EVE: Oh. Well - okay.
EVE: I should go. But you boys should come over to our house some time. I know your family must get tired of
BART: Not at all. But I'd love to, anyway.
KELLY: There you go. Now you know everything.
BART: What's your problem? She's pretty
BART: Don't you want your soda?
KELLY: Forget it.
BART: So filming's on Saturday. Can you make it?
KELLY: Are you kidding?
BART: Good. It's gonna be really cool. He's got an explosives expert coming.
BART: What's up?
KELLY: Remember that stupid speech?
KELLY: I'm supposed to give it next week.
BART: Maybe you should talk to my dad about You think he'd go for that?
KELLY: You think he'd go for that?
BART: Of course. He loves you. He was talking the other day about helping you out. Want to go to Dartmouth?
KELLY: Are you serious?
BART: He was. If you applied for Spring Semester, he could "pull some I don't think that would work for me. Considering my background.
KELLY: ( shakes his head slowly ) I don't think that would work for me. Considering my background.
BART: Yeah, probably not.
KELLY: I'm not properly socialized. I wouldn't fit in.
BART: That's bullshit.
KELLY: No, it's not.
BART: Tell that to my family. They're like your fucking fan club.
BART: Even Tabby likes you.
KELLY: So much she ratted me out to you.
BART: Well, she's inviting you to the
KELLY: Bart watches Kelly's face.
BART: But you probably won't enjoy that much, will you?
KELLY: I don't know what you're talking about. Weddings? I love weddings. I always get drunk and make out with someone's cousin.
BART: Good, I'll call mom's nephew Fletcher and tell him to expect a little Fletcher, eh?
KELLY: Fletcher, eh?
BART: He's twelve. Let me give some advice. He's very into sharks at the moment.
KELLY: Why did you tell
KELLY: What? Oh, I'm sorry.
TABBY: Miner and I broke up. I'm sorry.
KELLY: I'm sorry.
TABBY: Honestly? I didn't think you two were right for each other.
KELLY: Honestly? I didn't think you two were right for each other.
TABBY: You did, huh?
KELLY: Like this painting. Stare at it too long and you can't see it anymore. But if someone else sees it for the first time, they can tell exactly what it is.
TABBY: I don't need any more bullshit right
KELLY: He could never understand you.
TABBY: I'm not as complicated as you think.
KELLY: I never said you were complicated.
TABBY: He just wasn't the right one.
KELLY: He just wasn't the right one.
TABBY: There's more to it than that.
KELLY: I'm really sorry. I really am.
TABBY: Kelly pats her knee awkwardly.
KELLY: Don't cry.
TABBY: You like me, don't you?
KELLY: Of course.
TABBY: No, I mean you like me. Yeah. I think you're amazing.
KELLY: Yeah. I think you're amazing.
TABBY: Well, do something.
BART: ( O.S. ) All right, all right. I'm going.
KELLY: Damn it. Damn it.
KELLY: INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - NIGHT Bart sits in his desk chair, frowning. Mathilda knocks and opens the door.

BART: Not tonight, ma.
MATHILDA: Okay, then.
DIRECTOR: Are you with the 101st or the 82nd?

CRAFT SERVICE: Kelly and a half dozen other SOLDIERS stand or sit in the grass around the table. They talk and rest on their backpacks. A MAKEUP ARTIST makes the rounds.

KELLY: Kelly Ernswiler, private first class.
MAKEUP ARTIST: All right, Kelly. Let's take a look at you.
MAKEUP ARTIST: That's it, handsome.

BART: No where.
KELLY: They put you over here with me? That's great. I think we'll get some close- ups. They want me to drive old Lippy. Isn't that awesome?
KELLY: What the hell's your problem?
BART: I ought to fucking kill you.
KELLY: You had to do it.
BART: You had to do it.
KELLY: What are you talking about?
BART: You just do whatever the fuck you want. And consequences don't matter, do they?
KELLY: Are you out of your mind? What the fuck do you think she's going to do, run off with you?
BART: What the fuck do you think she's going to do, run off with you?
BART: You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy. She's a Yale grad student. Talk about living in a fucking fantasy world.
KELLY: No. You'd rather have me be miserable like you are.
BART: ( biting sarcasm ) Once again, you've displayed your uncanny ability to nail the truth of a character.
KELLY: Stop talking out your dad's mouth and use your own for once.
KELLY: I don't want to talk about it.
EVE: Well, you're going to have to. Your father's at the hospital.
KELLY: Which one of his loser friends ended up there?
EVE: They think he has stomach cancer.
KELLY: Oh this is just perfect.
EVE: Why would you say something like Because it seems to fit.
KELLY: Because it seems to fit.
EVE: "Seems to fit." Do you understand what I just said? Why, do you want to say it again?
KELLY: Why, do you want to say it again?
EVE: Kelly -

KELLY: Listen, I'm busy.

SARAH: Fuck you.
KELLY: Hey, I hoped you were up -
TABBY: Kelly goes and takes his painting off the easel.

HOLMSTEAD: For those of you who haven't had the chance to get to know Kelly, you should know he has a very interesting hobby. He takes part in reenactments of World War II battles right here in Ohio.
AUDIENCE KID: I did that too. When I was seven.
HOLMSTEAD: He has an unusual first-hand knowledge of history. We recently discovered that this extends beyond World War II to the Civil War, which he is going to discuss with you today.
KELLY: I'm sorry.
HOLMSTEAD: ( to Mr. Norman ) Well, go after him.

KELLY: A few.
ABE: Busy, busy.
ABE: Answer me this: how come no one ever reenacts the Vietnam War?
KELLY: It'd be pretty depressing, wouldn't I guess it would.
ABE: I guess it would.
KELLY: Plus that, you'd have to have protesters and stuff.
ABE: Folks dressed up like your mom and me. People reenacting fleeing to Canada, burning draft cards. I guess that would ruin the spirit of the thing, now wouldn't it?
KELLY: I could make it work.
ABE: I bet you could.
EVE: Kelly, is that you?
KELLY: You were expecting some one else?

EVE: That's amazing. Art playing a part in war.
CHARLIE: You're damned right. We practically won the thing right there. Now this is more like it. Anyone care to place a wager on the table?
