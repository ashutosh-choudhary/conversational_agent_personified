SHOOTING DRAFT: INT. SUNNYVALE - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT - 2002 EVAN, 20, good-looking but with dark haunted eyes, frantically hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office. His face and chest are covered in blood. He holds his forehead in pain. FLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting for him. ALARMS SOUND. GUARDS are heard shouting to each other. Evan grabs a cardboard box and hides under a doctor's desk. He grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand.
EVAN: ( as he writes ) If anyone finds this, then I guess my plan didn't work and I'm already
EVAN: But if I can just go back to the beginning of all this, I still might be able to save her.
ANDREA: Okay, okay. what now?
EVAN: We're gonna be late again.
ANDREA: When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
EVAN: We're putting up pictures for Parent's
EVAN: Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
ANDREA: Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
ANDREA: ( re: carb ) Darn it!
EVAN: Um. can dad come this time?
ANDREA: ( getting impatient ) You know the answer to that.
EVAN: Can't he come out for one day?
ANDREA: We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
EVAN: But Lenny said that his dad's coming. and Tommy and Kayleigh's
ANDREA: Here, Ev. Finish this up for me.
EVAN: All the dads are gonna be there.
ANDREA: I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
EVAN: Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
ANDREA: Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
EVAN: ( beat ) Done. Try it.
ANDREA: You're amazing, kiddo.
ANDREA: Okay have a great day I love you I'll pick you up later gotta go.
MRS. BOSWELL: Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work
ANDREA: I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work
MRS. BOSWELL: I think you really need to see this.
MRS. BOSWELL: TOMMY! LEAVE LENNY ALONE! DON'T MAKE ME SEND YOU TO MR. VOYTEK'S OFFICE!
MRS. BOSWELL: I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
ANDREA: What is it?
MRS. BOSWELL: Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this.
ANDREA: I don't understand. Evan did this?
ANDREA: Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll. I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
MRS. BOSWELL: Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it.
ANDREA: MRS. BOSWELL
MRS. BOSWELL: When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
ANDREA: I have to go.
LENNY: You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
TOMMY: You're such a retard!
KAYLEIGH: Mommy lives far away but she comes and visits.
LENNY: ( to Tommy ) If I'm retarded, why didn't my mommy move away from me?
EVAN: Hey, what'd you do that for?
TOMMY: Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
EVAN: Come on, Lenny. It's not that bad. You can still see your mom a little.
LENNY: ( grateful ) Can. can. Can I have this?
EVAN: Sure. I was gonna make a new one,
DR. REDFIELD: And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
ANDREA: ( anxious ) Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
DR. REDFIELD: Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
DR. REDFIELD: Tell you what, bring Evan here tonight and we'll run a CAT-scan series.
EVAN: I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
ANDREA: ( lighthearted ) You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
DR. REDFIELD: Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet He's as handsome as his father.
EVAN: ( stunned ) You know my father?
ANDREA: That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
EVAN: My father has a bad memory, too?
DR. REDFIELD: ( off Andrea's look ) Uh, tell you what, Evan. If it's okay with your mother, I'd like to run some tests. Nothing scary.
DR. REDFIELD: Okay, it might be a little scary.
ANDREA: Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness.
DR. REDFIELD: Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
ANDREA: DR. REDFIELD
DR. REDFIELD: A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
ANDREA: Why? What for?
DR. REDFIELD: It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few
EVAN'S DIARY: "Today Mommy is taking me to play with Kayley and Tommy. I will mete there father and see what a real dad is like. Maybe one day I will mete my Dad." Andrea, meanwhile, speaks into the phone as she pours Lucky Charms into a cereal bowl for Evan.
ANDREA: Thanks, George. I really appreciate you watching him, he won't be any trouble at all.
EVAN: These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
ANDREA: ( into phone ) Great. I'll see you soon.
ANDREA: Evan sees her but remains expressionless.
ANDREA: Evan? What are you doing with that
EVAN: ( scared ) What happened?
ANDREA: Honey. What were you doing with that?
EVAN: ( tears welling ) I. I don't remember.
MR. MILLER: Hey, Andrea. Hello little man. Thanks a lot George. Here's my work number in case there are any problems.
ANDREA: Thanks a lot George. Here's my work number in case there are any problems.
MR. MILLER: ( lighthearted laughter ) Whaddaya kidding? We're going to have a great time today, right Evan?
MR. MILLER: You waiting for an invitation? The kids are inside.
KAYLEIGH: ( excited to see Evan ) Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a I don't think Evan gets to be in it
TOMMY: I don't think Evan gets to be in it
KAYLEIGH: Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
TOMMY: I thought I was the bad guy!
KAYLEIGH: You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
EVAN: We're really gonna be in a movie!?
MR. MILLER: That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
TOMMY: I thought I was the star.
MR. MILLER: Shut up, moron. Now get in your costume, Evan. And you have to promise, your bestest super-duper promise, that this will be our little secret. Think you can do that?
EVAN: Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
MR. MILLER: Calm down, kid. Stand still. I was just somewhere else how did I get here?
EVAN: I was just somewhere else how did I get here?
MR. MILLER: Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
EVAN: Kayleigh? What happened?
EVAN: What's wrong with me?
DR. REDFIELD: Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors.
ANDREA: And the bad news?
DR. REDFIELD: Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
ANDREA: But you must have something to go If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
DR. REDFIELD: If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
ANDREA: But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
DR. REDFIELD: Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
ANDREA: Come on, I doubt the answer's that You'd be surprised how often they Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.

ANDREA: How soon?.
EVAN'S DIARY: "April 15. Today I get to mete my father. His name is Jason and he is crazy. I hope he lets me call him dad."
EVAN: Dad lives here?
DR. REDFIELD: Not in this wing, actually. No.
ANDREA: Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
EVAN: They walk to the end of the corridor and come to a "Visitor's Dr.Redfield leads Evan inside. Andrea begins to follow, but the doctor gestures that she stay outside.
JASON: It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
EVAN: Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your
JASON: ( through clenched teeth ) I. love. you.
JASON: ( panicking ) He has to die! You don't understand! It's the only way to stop it!
ANDREA: I'm sorry, Evan. I'm sorry.
PRIEST: Ashes to ashes. dust to dust.
KAYLEIGH: You're better off anyway.
EVAN: Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
TOMMY: Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a
KAYLEIGH: ( to Tommy ) We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
EVAN: So let's go. This place creeps me
TOMMY: I knew it had something to do with the army.
TOMMY: Let's blow the shit out of something!
LENNY: Guys, slow up, would you?
KAYLEIGH: Evan, did I tell you? My mother said I might be able to visit her this summer in Orlando with her new family.
TOMMY: What did I say about mentioning that Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
KAYLEIGH: ( uncomfortable ) Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
TOMMY: Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
TOMMY: Here you go, buddy.
LENNY: ( recoiling ) What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
TOMMY: The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
LENNY: Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
EVAN: Not necessarily.
EVAN: That should buy you ten minutes at Gee, thanks friend.
LENNY: Gee, thanks friend.
TOMMY: Oh, for Christ's sake, just do it,
LENNY: ( taking puff )
EVAN: You got balls, man.
TOMMY: Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
EVAN: ( frantic ) What happened?? Where are we?!
KAYLEIGH: ( crying ) Oh God. what did we do?
EVAN: Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
ANDREA: What is it? What happened?
TOMMY: ( staring menacingly at the others ) We were just building a fort in the woods when Lenny freaked out. One minute he was fine, then he just froze up. Right guys?
ANDREA: What happened, Evan? The truth.
EVAN: I don't know. I don't remember.
ANDREA: Something must've happened! What set him off?
EVAN: I. I blacked out.
ANDREA: ( building frustration ) Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
ANDREA: You're not making this up, are you?
DR. REDFIELD: With every breath you exhale, you can feel all of the tension draining from your body like water through a faucet. Nine, ten, and you're completely asleep. Relaxed.
DR. REDFIELD: Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
EVAN: DR. REDFIELD
DR. REDFIELD: Where are you now?
EVAN: I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
DR. REDFIELD: Are you hurting her?
EVAN: No, protecting her.
DR. REDFIELD: Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
EVAN: I see a car.
DR. REDFIELD: Yes, tell me about the car.
DR. REDFIELD: Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
EVAN: ( moaning ) I can't. the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
DR. REDFIELD: The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
EVAN: It's coming. argh! I can't!
DR. REDFIELD: Fight it Evan. Hurry. It's coming!
DR. REDFIELD: Okay, Evan. Listen to my voice! On the count of ten, you're going to wake up. Feeling refreshed and remembering everything we talked
ANDREA: What's happening to him?? Make it
DR. REDFIELD: One. You're feeling more awake now. Two, your eyes no longer feel heavy.
DR. REDFIELD: Five. Six. Refreshed and awake! Seven, eight. Come on, Evan, wake up, dammit!
ANDREA: Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
DR. REDFIELD: Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
EVAN: What happened? Did it work?
TOMMY: ( to Kayleigh ) Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
KAYLEIGH: I'm sorry.
EVAN: Would someone just tell me already what the hell happened in the mailbox?
TOMMY: Don't ever bring that shit up again. Not ever. Not to me, not to Kayleigh, or even Lenny. The stupid fuck if he ever learns to talk again. Understand?
TOMMY: ( re: Kayleigh ) She don't want to talk about it, anyway. Do you Kayleigh?
EVAN: Are you okay?
TOMMY: There it is. Let's go.
ANCHOR: ( on TV ) .was the grizzly aftermath of what police officials of upstate New York are calling a horrible act of vandalism gone awry.
ANCHOR: The powerful explosion is believed to have been caused by a small quantity of dynamite.
ANCHOR: Police thus far have no leads as to the suspects.
TOMMY: Holy shit! Look at that fat fuck! You'd have to wipe his ass with a
TOMMY: Shut up, faggot. No one's talking to
EVAN: I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad You really don't remember anything that happened?
KAYLEIGH: You really don't remember anything that happened?
KAYLEIGH: You're so lucky.
EVAN: It's going to be okay. Lenny'll be fine. You'll see.
KAYLEIGH: I'm sorry.
EVAN: I'm sorry.
KAYLEIGH: It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
EVAN: Damn. Your dad did this?
KAYLEIGH: ( looking down ) I deserve a lot worse.
EVAN: What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
EVAN: You really have no clue how beautiful you are, do you?
CLOSE UP: Andrea's eyes. Tormented. REVEAL she's driving Evan and Kayleigh home. Evan's up front and Kayleigh sits behind them. Everyone silent. Andrea stares through the rearview mirror into Kayleigh's eyes. Probing. Searching.
ANDREA: So how was the movie?
KAYLEIGH: Andrea watches Kayleigh. A calculated beat.
ANDREA: Any exploding mailboxes? What do you mean?
KAYLEIGH: ( faking poorly ) What do you mean?
ANDREA: Andrea stares at Evan, who keeps his eyes facing dead ahead. She finally shifts the car into gear.
ANDREA: We're moving.
EVAN: I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes Duck, here they come.
KAYLEIGH: He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes Duck, here they come.
EVAN: Duck, here they come.
KAYLEIGH: Did your mom say if Lenny was. He must be. They're letting him go,
EVAN: He must be. They're letting him go,
EVAN: Welcome home, Lenny!
MRS. KAGAN: I think your little homecoming's in bad taste.
EVAN: MRS. KAGAN ( acidic )
MRS. KAGAN: ( acidic ) Lenny's been through a hell of an ordeal no thanks to you.
EVAN: ( quietly ) Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
KAYLEIGH: Hi, Lenny.
LENNY: Is Tommy with you guys?
EVAN: It's cool.
KAYLEIGH: ( to Lenny ) So what did you do in there?
LENNY: It was awful. You can't sleep 'cause everyone's screaming all night long. I never want to go back.
KAYLEIGH: Do you see that?
EVAN: Evan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog. Tommy is ready for them. He drops the lighter fluid, picks up a wooden plank and SWINGS! Evan ducks back at the last minute and Tommy accidentally connects with Kayleigh's head. Knocking her unconscious.
TOMMY: Look what you made me do!
EVAN: What's wrong with you?!
EVAN: Kayleigh! Wake up!
TOMMY: Why don't you fucking kiss her, Prince
EVAN: How long was I out?
EVAN: Kayleigh?! Are you okay? Where's
MRS. KAGAN: ( ice cold ) Do you know what you are? A monster.
EVAN'S DIARY: "I'll come back for you." Evan waves back to her, trying nonchalantly to wipe away his own tears as she fades into the distance. When Kayleigh disappears from sight, Andrea looks over to see what he's written.
ANDREA: I'm sorry.
PROFESSOR CARTER: Time! Please place your blue books on my desk before you leave.
PROFESSOR CARTER: How'd you do, Evan?
EVAN: I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
PROFESSOR CARTER: ( laughing ) Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory ( shrugging ) Hey, I got no choice.
EVAN: ( shrugging ) Hey, I got no choice.
EVAN: Whoa. Smells like patchouli and.
THUMPER: Cricket, meet my well-mannered roommate, Evan.
CRICKET: Yeah, you're the one who fucked up the bell-curve on my Anthropology final. Later, Thumper.
EVAN: Nice to meet you, too.
THUMPER: Here, bro. Found your T-shirt. Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
EVAN: Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
THUMPER: I thought you were a December baby.
EVAN: This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
THUMPER: Let's do this.
KRISTEN: So. which one of you has a pet
THUMPER: Worms, plural.
KRISTEN: That's so gross.
THUMPER: Talk to him about it, he's got the
EVAN: Actually, they're for a psych project. A study on memory.
HEIDI: ( stifling a yawn ) Shit, better explain before all the excitement gives me a heart attack.
EVAN: It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, Like Ozzy.
THUMPER: ( thoughtfully ) Like Ozzy.
SPENCER: Ten bucks says he eats it off the
EVAN: You chop up the smart flatworm and feed it to the dumb one and presto, the dumb one suddenly knows the maze inside and out.
EVAN: Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
THUMPER: ( thoughtfully ) That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
HEIDI: So what's the point?
EVAN: ( setting up the eight ) Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
HEIDI: ( intrigued ) So are you planning on becoming a doctor or something?
EVAN: No, I just don't want to lose my
EVAN: ( to Heidi ) I think that's your game.
HEIDI: Smells like sex in here.
EVAN: Thumper had a busy afternoon.
HEIDI: You're kidding. He's so. big. Charisma and eyeliner go a long way, I guess. Wanna beer?
EVAN: Charisma and eyeliner go a long way, I guess. Wanna beer?
HEIDI: Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are. comp books.
EVAN: Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
HEIDI: ( respectfully ) Wow. read something.
EVAN: No way, I'd be too embarrassed.
HEIDI: Then keep drinking, worm-boy. You're too uptight.
EVAN: Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, Deal. Now read me something.
HEIDI: ( laughing ) Deal. Now read me something.
EVAN: ( re: her beer ) For courage.
EVAN: It's like my mind refused to believe what it was seeing. Hearing Crockett make those awful screams. Just writing about it gives me the shivers.
HEIDI: Come on, go on.
EVAN: It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call
FLASH!: SMASH CUT TO:
EVAN: What the hell is going on?
LENNY: I can't undo the rope!
TOMMY: Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
EVAN: I got him, Lenny. Help Crockett! Listen to me good, Evan. There's a million other sisters in the world. You didn't have to fuck with mine.
TOMMY: Listen to me good, Evan. There's a million other sisters in the world. You didn't have to fuck with mine.
FLASH!: SMASH CUT TO:
EVAN: Oh my God! No! No!
HEIDI: Wake up, idiot. It was just a dream.
EVAN: ( freaked out ) It didn't feel like a dream.
HEIDI: Maybe because they never do. So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
MRS. KAGAN: I've got a surprise for you, Lenny. You'll never guess who's here.
EVAN: Hey, uh, it's me. Evan.
EVAN: What's that you're working on? A Well, you look busy, so maybe I should make this quick. I'd totally understand if you didn't want to get into this right now, but that day at the junkyard, could you help me remember what happened? Any details?
EVAN: Well, you look busy, so maybe I should make this quick. I'd totally understand if you didn't want to get into this right now, but that day at the junkyard, could you help me remember what happened? Any details?
LENNY: I couldn't cut the rope.
EVAN: ( containing excitement ) Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
LENNY: Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
EVAN: Jesus Christ. It really happened.
EVAN: What if I can get back all my lost memories with my journals. Make one peep and I swear it'll be your last, motherfucker.
LENNY: Make one peep and I swear it'll be your last, motherfucker.
EVAN: Well, thanks for seeing me, man. I shouldn't have waited so long.
THUMPER: You really think he wanted to kill All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed
EVAN: All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed
EVAN'S DIARY: "I will come back for you." Evan looks overcome by guilt. Later that evening:
EVAN: ( reading aloud ) The last thing I remember before the blackout was holding my hands over Kayleigh's ears. ( his voice slowly fades ) I think I was more focused on her hands on mine than the mailbox across the street.
FLASH!: SMASH CUT TO:
LENNY: Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
TOMMY: Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
TOMMY: Make one peep and I swear it'll be your last, motherfucker.
MRS. HALPERN: How's my sweet girl? Awww, you need a change, don't you honey?
MRS. HALPERN: You want to open the door, honey?
BOOM!!!: The blast is deafening. Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny watch the results in stunned horror.
TOMMY: C'mon! Run!!
TOMMY: Lenny? Come on!
KAYLEIGH: Oh my God oh my God.
FLASH!: SMASH CUT TO:
EVAN: What the hell?
THUMPER: Christ, man. You wanna clean that up before I lose my appetite here?
EVAN: Yes, hello, uh, Mrs. Kagan, this is Evan Treborn. I know. I'm sorry about that. But I really need to speak with him.
PROFESSOR CARTER: Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
EVAN: Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't.
PROFESSOR CARTER: I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
PROFESSOR CARTER: Just don't drop the ball, okay?
EVAN: I won't let you down, Professor
REVEAL ANDREA: Her hair now has gray streaks. As she signs for the bill, she leans over and kisses Evan on the cheek.
EVAN: Please, mom. People will talk.
ANDREA: I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
EVAN: Did Da Jason - get good grades?
ANDREA: ( smiling ) Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
EVAN: Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
ANDREA: Why do you ask?
EVAN: No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
ANDREA: When he was around your age. almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
ANDREA: I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them.
EVAN: And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could.
ANDREA: And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could.
EVAN: What? What could he do?
ANDREA: Forget it. It's nothing. He was far too sick by then.
EVAN: ( reading aloud ) I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off
THUMPER: What the fuck are you doing?
EVAN: Shhh! I need quiet for this.
THUMPER: Are you stupid or what?
EVAN: Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
THUMPER: Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
THUMPER: Yeah, man. I'd think twice about this. You could wake up a lot more fucked up than you are now.
BOSS: Can we get through one goddamned day without you breaking something?
KAYLEIGH: God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
EVAN: Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know.
KAYLEIGH: No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
EVAN: I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good.
EVAN: ( declining ) Not since we were kids.
KAYLEIGH: I've stopped a hundred times.
EVAN: So how's Tommy?
KAYLEIGH: ( takes a long drag ) They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
EVAN: You still live with your dad?
KAYLEIGH: No. I emancipated myself when I was Wow. That must've taken some courage.
EVAN: Wow. That must've taken some courage.
KAYLEIGH: Not if you remember my dad.
EVAN: Couldn't you have moved in with your She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But. whatever.
KAYLEIGH: ( shaking her head ) She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But. whatever.
EVAN: Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to Me? Are you kidding? Why?
KAYLEIGH: ( brightening ) Me? Are you kidding? Why?
EVAN: Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
KAYLEIGH: Of course.
EVAN: Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big Well, sure. I'll try to remember. When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
KAYLEIGH: Well, sure. I'll try to remember. When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
EVAN: When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
KAYLEIGH: ( cold ) What do you want to know, Evan?
EVAN: It's just. did he. what happened in the basement?
KAYLEIGH: It was a long time ago.
EVAN: I know, but.
KAYLEIGH: ( cold ) Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
EVAN: No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
KAYLEIGH: Is there a point to any of this?
EVAN: Whatever happened, it wasn't our fault. You know we couldn't have stopped it.
EVAN: Look, Kayleigh. This may sound like bullshit coming from a guy who hasn't spoken to you in seven years.
EVAN: But you were seven years old and there's nothing you could've done to
KAYLEIGH: ( defeated ) Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
EVAN: You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
KAYLEIGH: Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets
KAYLEIGH: If I was so wonderful, Evan, why didn't you ever call me? Why'd you leave me here to rot?!
THUMPER: Some dude left a message for you.
EVAN: You can smell it all the way in the
ANSWERING MACHINE: ( male voice ) Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter. Just wondered why you didn't hand in your essay this afternoon. I was a bit concerned. Call me to schedule a
ANSWERING MACHINE: ( male voice ) What did you say to my sister motherfucker?! Last night she cried on the phone for over an hour to me. ( enraged breathing ) She said you came and saw her last
ANSWERING MACHINE: ( Tommy; cont'd ) She. she fucking killed herself tonight. She's dead. ( beat ) And so are you.
THUMPER: Whoa, bad news, bro. I don't think this is gonna come out.
EVAN'S DIARY: "I'll come back for you."
FLASH!: SMASH CUT TO:
MR. MILLER: Shut up moron. Now get in your costume
MR. MILLER: I've got an idea. Let's go downstairs, it'll look more like a dungeon down
MR. MILLER: ( to Tommy ) What did I say about keeping that door closed, stupid?
TOMMY: But I wanna see!
MR. MILLER: You're gonna see my fist in about two seconds unless you do what I tell you.
MR. MILLER: Now in this part of the story, Robin Hood just married Maid Marian and they have to kiss and stuff like grown-ups do.
MR. MILLER: So take your clothes off Kayleigh.
MR. MILLER: Come on, like when you take a bath. Don't make a deal out of it. You too, Evan.
MR. MILLER: Let's go.
EVAN: What time is it?
MR. MILLER: It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
EVAN: Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
MR. MILLER: ( stunned disbelief ) What's happened to How are you doing that?
EVAN: ( voice rising ) It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
MR. MILLER: ( hoarse whisper ) Who who are you?
EVAN: Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like. oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
MR. MILLER: ( choking ) Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
EVAN: Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
EVAN: One last thing.
KAYLEIGH: Don't you ever touch me again.
MR. MILLER: I I won't.
KAYLEIGH: I'm cold. And I'm putting on my
EVAN: What you need to do is discipline your son Tommy, because the kid's one sadistic pup.
FLASH!: SMASH CUT TO:
KAYLEIGH: Oh my God, Evan. You're bleeding! Look at you!
EVAN: ( transfixed by her ) Jesus, Kayleigh, you're. ( looks around ) ( purring ) Mmmm. You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
KAYLEIGH: ( purring ) Mmmm. You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
EVAN: Where. where are my clothes?
KAYLEIGH: Those are your clothes, silly.
EVAN: This is too amazing! Un-fucking-real!
EVAN: Whoops. Sorry. My bad.
EVAN: Hey, you were with those assholes who threw popcorn at Thumper. And your name is. Gwen!
EVAN: And your name is. Gwen!
GWEN: Seriously, Evan. Lay off the blow.
EVAN: Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
KAYLEIGH: Well I remember he had one. but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
EVAN: I dunno. Just being weird.
KAYLEIGH: Such a goofus. See you tonight.
EVAN: ( to himself ) Come on, Mom, be there!
ANSWERING MACHINE: ( Andrea's voice ) ( Evan's voice ) ( a strange, older man's voice ) And Chuck, ( all three ) Aren't home right now. You know what to do.
EVAN: ( off-guard ) Hi, Mom and, uh, Chuck. Just calling to say hi and well, call me.
EVAN: Thumper! What time is it, man?
THUMPER: Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
EVAN: Fuck off, frat boy.
THUMPER: Fuck off, frat boy.
PROFESSOR CARTER: Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
EVAN: ( quietly ) I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
PROFESSOR CARTER: And you are.?
EVAN: ( disappointed ) Evan Treborn.
PROFESSOR CARTER: The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to
EVAN: Leave me alone, asshole. I didn't lay a hand on you, okay?
HUNTER: Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
EVAN: ( awkward ) We'll find out soon enough.
HUNTER: ( laughing ) Me neither.
EVAN: You're kidding. Are these the Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
HUNTER: Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
EVAN: ( holding it lower ) Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers.
HUNTER: I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
KAYLEIGH: Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
EVAN: So it didn't feel. weird?
KAYLEIGH: Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms
EVAN: Silence on the other end. More silence.
KAYLEIGH: Fuck 'em.
EVAN: What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
KAYLEIGH: ( laughs ) As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
EVAN: You think we'll always be together?
KAYLEIGH: That is the plan, right? Hell or high water?
EVAN: Just making sure.
EVAN: Order, order. So all you rushes know what you've got to do for me?
EVAN: Pledges, rushees, same difference. Now this is a one-time deal. You do all this for me and I'll never give you shit again. Promise.
KAYLEIGH: I don't understand, where are you taking me?
EVAN: You'll see.
KAYLEIGH: I don't know what to say. It's Go on. Sit down.
EVAN: Go on. Sit down.
KAYLEIGH: Why are you doing all this for me?
EVAN: Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile. I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
HUNTER: We been lookin' all over for you, Someone trashed your car.
SENIOR BROTHER: Someone trashed your car.
EVAN: ( panicked ) Did you see who did this? You see
HUNTER: Probably them Pika fuckers.
EVAN: How could he get away with this? Right in front of the goddamn frat
SENIOR BROTHER: Frat house? Hey man, would you call your "country" a "cunt"?
KAYLEIGH: Don't. He's probably watching.
KAYLEIGH: It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
EVAN: Might'a been nice. Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
KAYLEIGH: Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
EVAN: ( shaking the cannister ) Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
KAYLEIGH: ( quietly ) It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
EVAN: Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
KAYLEIGH: ( quietly ) My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
EVAN: Fine, then. We'll let campus security deal with him.
KAYLEIGH: Are you okay?
EVAN: What do you mean?
KAYLEIGH: It's just. you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
EVAN: Like how?
KAYLEIGH: I don't know. You seem. different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the I walk differently?
EVAN: I walk differently?
KAYLEIGH: I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that. I don't want anything to happen to us.
EVAN: I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that. I don't want anything to happen to us.
KAYLEIGH: Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
EVAN: The guy, wearing Evan's brown suede jacket, suddenly springs to his feet, revealing his face for the first time.
KAYLEIGH: Tommy has grown in the last seven years. He has long, greasy hair and some tattoos. He holds a TIRE THUMPER ( a short, steel bat for truckers ) menacingly in his right hand. Evan stands frozen in fear, his hands rooted in his coat
EVAN: Leave us alone you sick fuck!
TOMMY: Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
KAYLEIGH: Shut up, Tommy!
TOMMY: Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
EVAN: What the hell are you doing?
TOMMY: It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
EVAN: ( suppressing panic ) No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck." Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
TOMMY: Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck." Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
KAYLEIGH: Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
EVAN: He's a fucking maniac!
EVAN: He ruined Lenny's life
EVAN: He killed Crockett Murdered that woman and her baby! And he's trying to kill me, Kayleigh! He's trying to fucking kill me!
CRUNCH!: Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified. Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother. And stops cold when she sees the damage to Tommy. Evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a crablike fashion. SIRENS come racing to the quad. Evan looks away from Tommy's limp body. Collapses to the ground and begins to weep.
CARLOS: First time?
CARLOS: Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
EVAN: ( desperate ) Can you protect me?
CARLOS: Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
ANDREA: .I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're How long will I be in here?
EVAN: How long will I be in here?
ANDREA: I don't know. These things take time.
EVAN: How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
EVAN: What about my journals, Mom? Did you bring the ones I asked for?
ANDREA: I found these. The others are still in storage.
EVAN: Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
ANDREA: Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
EVAN: Sure, Mom. You're right. Just try to tell Kayleigh I'm sorry.
ANDREA: I'm not gonna lose you, kiddo. Promise me you'll hang on, Ev.
KARL: Shit on my dick or blood on my knife.
EVAN: Let go! They're mine!
EVAN: Evan swings at Rick and misses. INMATES CHEER! It's on! Rick lunges for Evan, a brief and painful scuffle ensues, the journals getting trampled. Suddenly The sounds of COCKED RIFLES echo through the air. The fight stops instantly as Rick and Evan look up to see
ANGLE ON: OFFICER STATION. Officers aim rifles at the pair. From an upper tier, even more officers with more rifles. Their barrels sight directly at Evan. Rick steps away, quick to maliciously scoop up Evan's torn journals.
KARL: We'll be comin' for you tonight,
KARL: ( from Evan's journal ) Today I found my grandfather's death certificate. He died in a nut house, just like my father. Mom denies it, but she thinks I'm gonna end up the same way.
EVAN: You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
CARLOS: Straight up.
EVAN: Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
CARLOS: Shit. I knew you were crazy.
EVAN: I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
EVAN: Pack of smokes says I can prove it to you.
EVAN: So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
CARLOS: You need to see the prison shrink,
EVAN: Anything today?
CONVICT: Yep. Just not for you. Just tell me if anything weird Weirder than this?
EVAN: Just tell me if anything weird Weirder than this?
CARLOS: Weirder than this?
EVAN: Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
JOURNAL ENTRY: "On Wednesday I got in trouble for a drawing that I didn't do. Mommy wont let me see it." Then as he starts reading it to himself, the bars behind him almost imperceptibly VIBRATE
MRS. BOSWELL: No monkey business, Evan. Sit still and finish your drawing.
MRS. BOSWELL: That's great everyone! Just imagine anything you want to be. There are no limits. Oh, Mrs. Boswelllllllll?
EVAN: ( musically ) Oh, Mrs. Boswelllllllll?
CARLOS: Oh sweet Jesus. It's true. It's a miracle! A miracle!
CARLOS: Your hands. The stigmata!
EVAN: What did you see? What did it look Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were So you believe me?
CARLOS: ( laughing ) Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were So you believe me?
EVAN: So you believe me?
EVAN: I want to make a deal.
EVAN: Look. I'm new to all this but I think I get how things work. You gotta join a gang or else end up dead meat.
EVAN: Well it sure ain't gonna fucking be with no niggers or spics. So how do we do this? You gotta work your way up, and I'm the new guy. So. should I. I mean, do I suck your dicks right now?
KARL: Is your blood pure?
EVAN: ( angry ) I ain't no fucking kike if that's what you mean.
RICK: Let's see what you got. And watch the fucking teeth or you'll be leaving without 'em.
EVAN: Carlos drops Karl's writhing body to the floor and presses his girth against the cell door. Evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as the other supremacists force the door open Evan focuses on the words. Chanting quickly.
EVAN: We took the woods behind the junkyard just to make sure we wouldn't bump into Tommy. We hadn't seen the smoke
EVAN: Rot in hell you fucking animals.
EVAN: Wait. Before we
EVAN: We need something to cut open the
EVAN: I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby
KAYLEIGH: Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
EVAN: ( frantic ) Now's the only time! ( to Lenny ) Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa
LENNY: What are you talking about?
KAYLEIGH: You're acting crazy!
EVAN: ( desperate; to Lenny ) Please. If you've ever trusted me before, trust me on this one.
EVAN: Cut the rope.
TOMMY: Listen to me good, Evan.
EVAN: I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
EVAN: Oh fuck, Lenny, no!
EVAN'S POV: Lenny, silhouetted by the sky, seems to vibrate violently as if operating a jack-hammer.
FLASH!: SMASH CUT TO:
EVAN: Christ. Help me.
THUMPER: Someone call 9-1-1!
EVAN: Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
ANDREA: Cute, Evan.
DR. REDFIELD: It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these Are you sure? Not even with my father?
EVAN: Are you sure? Not even with my father?
DR. REDFIELD: Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
ANDREA: So what did you find.
DR. REDFIELD: This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
EVAN: ( nonplussed ) Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
DR. REDFIELD: I've never seen anything like this. I've compared these to the ones taken last year, and there's evidence of severe hemorrhaging and massive neural
ANDREA: What does that mean for Evan?
EVAN: ( to Andrea ) He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it,
EVAN: ( to Andrea ) Mind if I wait in the car? The lighting here bugs my eyes.
EVAN: Well, it's nice seeing you again. But you know, people to see, things to read.
EVAN: Is there anything you need? Anything I can get you?
EVAN: What about the models, man? Bet I can get you a shitload of models up in here.
EVAN: Okay, Lenny. Just wanted to say "hi".
LENNY: You knew the whole time, didn't you? When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
EVAN: ( jaw dropped ) Y. yes. I guess I did.
LENNY: Then you should be where I am. You should be where I am.
JOURNAL ENTRY: "Today I get to mete my father. His name is Jason and he is crazy. I hope he lets me call him dad." Evan takes a calming breath and begins reading.
EVAN: ( as if reciting a mantra ) Today I get to meet my father. His name is Jason and he is crazy.
JASON: Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
EVAN: Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
JASON: I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
EVAN: But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
JASON: ( frustrated ) There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they Who's to say you can't make things
EVAN: Who's to say you can't make things
JASON: You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
EVAN: Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect
EVAN'S POV: As Jason looks down at us, frothing at the mouth, there's a trick of the light where Jason's head seems to VIBRATE against the ceiling.
FLASH!: SMASH CUT TO:
WAITRESS: Just get out, didja?
EVAN: ( re: his arm ) Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
WAITRESS: ( re: his arm ) Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
EVAN: ( defensively ) I come from a big family.
WAITRESS: Meant no offense.
EVAN: None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
WAITRESS: ( confused ) Sorry. Never heard of her.
MR. MILLER: Just shut the hell up already! Can't a man get a little goddman peace in his own home! Oh, for Christ's sake, now what?
MR. MILLER: Don't suppose you're here to sell
EVAN: Good guess, fuckbag. Remember me now? We had a great chat once when I was seven.
EVAN: One question, fuckbag. Where can I find your daughter?
KAYLEIGH: Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
EVAN: Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
KAYLEIGH: If I knew you were coming I'd have cleaned the stains off the sheets.
KAYLEIGH: What do you want?
EVAN: I just needed to see. a friendly
KAYLEIGH: Well, time is money, Evan. So you.
KAYLEIGH: Well, I guess I can spare ten minutes for an old friend, right?
KAYLEIGH: So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational I get it. You can drop it now.
EVAN: I get it. You can drop it now.
KAYLEIGH: ( angry again ) Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
EVAN: No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
KAYLEIGH: Ha! Where's that?
EVAN: The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
KAYLEIGH: What's happened to you?
EVAN: You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
KAYLEIGH: I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
EVAN: Why's that?
KAYLEIGH: Because you're. different.
EVAN: Different? How?
KAYLEIGH: Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
EVAN: On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
KAYLEIGH: On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
EVAN: Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
KAYLEIGH: You're right, Evan, I don't believe I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
EVAN: I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
KAYLEIGH: I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
EVAN: I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
KAYLEIGH: Oh? There's proof now?
EVAN: ( tired ) Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
KAYLEIGH: Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
EVAN: Then forget that. How about. you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
EVAN: Oh! And when you orgasm, your toes go numb. I'm sure your clientele aren't privy to that one.
EVAN: I just thought you should know.
KAYLEIGH: Know what?
EVAN: That I didn't leave you there to
KAYLEIGH: There's one major hole in your story.
EVAN: Which is?
KAYLEIGH: There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
KAYLEIGH: Sure you don't want your wallet?
EVAN: Don't think I'll need it where I'm Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
KAYLEIGH: Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
EVAN: I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
KAYLEIGH: Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
KAYLEIGH: Oh, here's one! Go back when I'm seven and fuck me in front of Daddy's handicam, you know, straighten me out a bit.
EVAN: Get out. Both of you.
THUMPER: Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
EVAN: I'm not saying it again.
EVAN: ( humble ) Lord give me the strength and guidance I need to set things right.
EVAN: Lady, stay back! Don't go near the
EVAN: I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!
LENNY: There's a bomb in the mailbox. Get
TOMMY: I'll save you lady!
BOOM!: The blast is deafening! Evan's body is hurled backwards INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002 Evan comes to back in his dorm, the same posters are on the wall, the sheets are the same. Even the familiar sounds of Thumper having sex under the covers.
FLASH!: SMASH CUT TO:
EVAN: I thought I told you two to beat it. What? Hey, sorry, man. We wake you
LENNY: What? Hey, sorry, man. We wake you
EVAN: No, it's cool. Really cool.
EVAN: Where are we going?
KAYLEIGH: We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous Stop! Take me back!
EVAN: Stop! Take me back!
LENNY: Sorry, tough guy, no can do. Your mother would kill me.
EVAN: Take me back, Lenny! You owe me that much.
KAYLEIGH: What are you geeks looking at? Must be nice to be so goddamned perfect, huh? Fucking losers.
LENNY: 'Sup, Sheila! We missed you at the party! Don't even think I'm giving you my lab notes either! Think I like getting up for "eight thirty's"?
LENNY: Hey, there's Tommy.
TOMMY: I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
EVAN: Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
LENNY: Uh, we should be getting to class Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
EVAN: Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
KAYLEIGH: Let's go for a stroll.
EVAN: So Tommy's really into this Jesus kick, huh?
KAYLEIGH: You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
EVAN: He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
KAYLEIGH: Is something the matter?
EVAN: ( re: prosthetic arms ) Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
EVAN: Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
KAYLEIGH: Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared I was?
EVAN: I was?
KAYLEIGH: That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
EVAN: I don't get it.
KAYLEIGH: ( feeding another bite ) When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
