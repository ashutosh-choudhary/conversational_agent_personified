PLATINUM BLONDE: Story by Harry E. Chandlee and Douglas W. Churchill
FADE IN: 1. INT. CITY ROOM OF NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY - FULL SHOT General atmosphere, typical of a busy newspaper office. Copy boys running about, shirtsleeved reporters and rewrite men pounding away on typewriters. Little wire baskets containing cylinders of copy whizzing back and forth, such as are used in some department stores, ( Morkrum machines,[1] typewriters, telephone bells and all other sounds relative to a newspaper office )
SOUND: ( Morkrum machines,[1] typewriters, telephone bells and all other sounds relative to a newspaper office )
CONROY: Yeah, that's all I ever get from you guys - a lot of hard luck stories. You come back here and I'll give you an assignment. It will be a last interview - with the cashier!
REPORTER: Oh Mr. Conroy, give me a crack at that Schuyler story, will you?
CONROY: You? If you ever got your foot into a drawing room, you'd step on a sliding rug! Stew is the only man that's got brains enough to handle this. Scram!
COPY BOY: Not yet.
CONROY: Well, did you look in the
COPY BOY: First place I looked.
CONROY: Not there, eh? For cryin' out loud, where is that? Go and dig him up! Stew! Stew Smith!
STEW: Here it is. Pray for me, Gallagher. Pray for me. Hold everything . . .
GALLAGHER: Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
STEW: Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
GALLAGHER: ( conspiratorially )
STEW: There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
CONROY: ( bellowing )
CONROY: What? The screen?
STEW: Gallagher! I made it!
CONROY: Come over here!
STEW: Look, I quit!
CONROY: You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
STEW: You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
CONROY: You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
STEW: You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
STEW: ( superior )
CONROY: Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
STEW: With me you can always do business.
CONROY: Do you know what to do in a drawing-room?
STEW: It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
CONROY: ( speaking on the phone )
STEW: Gloria Golden?
CONROY: Yeah, little Gloria.
STEW: The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
CONROY: Right - for the first time this year.
STEW: ( modestly )
CONROY: Come on, get going, get going!
STEW: ( loftily )
CONROY: Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
STEW: ( resigned )
CONROY: What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
STEW: I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
FADE IN: 13. EXT. THE SCHUYLER HOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM SHOT Someone pacing outside the mansion gates.
MEDIUM SHOT: Someone pacing outside the mansion gates.
CLOSE SHOT: A parrot on its perch, hopping from foot to foot.
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( viciously )
GRAYSON: But I keep telling you how difficult it is, Mrs. Schuyler. The last time I asked her for those letters, she made very uncouth noises with her mouth.
MICHAEL: I don't know why you're making all this fuss. I only sent her six of them.
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( sarcastic )
MICHAEL: Because I couldn't get her on the phone.
MRS. SCHUYLER: You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
ANNE: You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
MRS. SCHUYLER: I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
ANNE: Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
MRS. SCHUYLER: Oh, shut up!
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( stopping him )
SMYTHE: Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
MRS. SCHUYLER: Dexter, go out and tell those ruffians I have nothing to say.
GRAYSON: You can't do that. Leave it to me. I know how to handle reporters.
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( with a shudder )
GRAYSON: We've decided to see the reporters. Send in the man from the Tribune first.
SMYTHE: Very good, sir.
MRS. SCHUYLER: Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
SMYTHE: I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
SHOT: This room resembles the Grand Central Station. It is lined with bookcases filled with gorgeous first editions and special bindings, and is furnished in the extreme of magnificence and luxury.
STEW: Hey Bingy, you'll find the silverware in the dining room.
BINGY: Much obliged.
SMYTHE: ( frigidly )
SMYTHE: The gentleman from the Tribune, first.
STEW: There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
SMYTHE: I understand, sir.
BINGY: Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
STEW: Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
BINGY: Oh, is that so?
STEW: I'm afraid.
BINGY: Hey, make up your mind, will you?
BINGY: Hi, folks!
BINGY: What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
GRAYSON: You're the Tribune man?
BINGY: Yeah, hello. How are you?
GRAYSON: ( cordially )
BINGY: Thanks, I will.
GRAYSON: This way.
BINGY: Oh, man!
BINGY: Oh, boy!
GRAYSON: Fine newspaper the Tribune.
BINGY: Well, I should say!
GRAYSON: I knew your managing editor very well.
BINGY: Is that so?
GRAYSON: Yale '21, I believe.
BINGY: ( uncomprehending )
GRAYSON: We were classmates.
MRS. SCHUYLER: What's the matter? She got a cold?
BINGY: What's the matter? She got a cold?
GRAYSON: I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
BINGY: Is that so?
GRAYSON: As one Tribune man to another
BINGY: ( laughs )
GRAYSON: But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
BINGY: Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
GRAYSON: I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
BINGY: Oh yeah?
GRAYSON: ( speaking as they walk )
GRAYSON: So, you see how silly that rumor is?
BINGY: Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
GRAYSON: That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
GRAYSON: Thank you very much.
BINGY: All right, all right, don't mention Give my regards to your managing editor.
GRAYSON: Give my regards to your managing editor.
BINGY: I certainly will.
BINGY: Well, so long folks!
BINGY: He takes one last look at Mrs. Schuyler and is again gripped by a violent sneeze.
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( rising to the occasion )
ALL: Bless you!
BINGY: The butler appears in the doorway behind him. Bingy exits past him, beaming.
BINGY: ( waving to butler )
GRAYSON: Smythe, bring in the other reporter.
SMYTHE: Yes, sir.
FULL SHOT: The group awaiting the advent of the Post reporter. Stew is shown in by the butler, still carrying the Conrad book in his hand. They give him the once-over. Mrs. Schuyler raises her lorgnette with a magnificent gesture. Stew eyes them with animation, not in the slightest discouraged by this supercilious scrutiny. He starts toward them.
STEW: Schuyler's the name, I presume? Yes, thank you, thank you. My name's Smith - Stewart Smith. No relation to John, Joe, Trade or Mark. Of course you can't have everything.
STEW: Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.
GRAYSON: Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
STEW: Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
GRAYSON: No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
STEW: ( very cagey )
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( furiously to Grayson )
STEW: Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters .
STEW: Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
GRAYSON: We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
STEW: A statement? Good.
GRAYSON: I have it here.
STEW: Grayson takes an envelope out of his pocket and hands it to Stew. Stew puts the book under his arm, takes the envelope and extracts the contents. It is another ( with interest )
STEW: ( with interest )
STEW: Don't you know you should never offer a newspaper man more than two dollars? If you do, he'll think it's counterfeit. I don't need fifty dollars. As a matter of fact, I've got fifty dollars.
GRAYSON: The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
STEW: Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
STEW: So ten grand was the amount you gave the girl? Any other statement you folks would like to make?
GROUP: ( ad-lib talking at the same time )
STEW: Wait a minute. Don't get excited. I wouldn't worry about it. A little publicity never hurt anybody.
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( shrieking at him )
GRAYSON: I think you'd better go.
STEW: Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and
ANNE: Wait a minute
ANNE: Don't mind Mother.
STEW: ( cheerfully )
MRS. SCHUYLER: 39. CLOSE SHOT - ANNE AND STEW Anne stifles a smile at this cheerful I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
ANNE: I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
STEW: Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
ANNE: You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
STEW: ( noncomittally )
ANNE: Because my name's Schuyler too. And I haven't done a thing, but I'll suffer with Michael. And so will Mother.
STEW: Mother's suffering already!
ANNE: As a special favor to me, you won't print that story, will you?
ANNE: ( pleading )
STEW: You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
ANNE: Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
STEW: May I use your telephone?
ANNE: ( eagerly )
STEW: You're all right.
STEW: Hello, Beekman 1300?
STEW: ( into phone )
STEW: Say, I interviewed a swell guy the other day - Einstein. Swell guy, a little eccentric, but swell. Doesn't wear any garters. Neither do I as a matter of fact. What good are garters anyway?
STEW'S VOICE: Yes, it's easy to see where her beauty comes from. From her mother.
STEW: Now wait a minute. Just hold on. Keep your shirt on. I'm coming to that. The Schuylers admit the story is true. Right. They gave the gal ten thousand bucks. But she's got some letters - and she's holding out for more dough - and it looks to me like she's going to get 47. MEDIUM SHOT - SCHUYLER GROUP Horrified and shocked at this betrayal and double-crossing.
STEW: ( on the phonebreezily )
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( involuntary gasp )
ANNE: ( voice cold as ice )
STEW: ( with dignity )
JOE'S: LAP DISSOLVE TO: INSERT: Three column heading in newspaper:
STEW: and she walked up to me and put her hand on my shoulder and said,
GALLAGHER: You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
STEW: I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
GALLAGHER: You what?
STEW: Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
GALLAGHER: For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
STEW: Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
GALLAGHER: ( a drawn-out knowing utterance )
STEW: And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it
GALLAGHER: and that
STEW: ( enthusing )
GALLAGHER: Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
STEW: ( disparaging gesture )
GALLAGHER: Of course I haven't got a nose.
STEW: ( shaking his head )
GALLAGHER: ( deliberately misunderstanding )
STEW: Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
GALLAGHER: And the rest of us are truck horses?
STEW: ( reproachfully )
GALLAGHER: ( a trifle resentfully )
STEW: Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
STEW: Pay that check, will you Gallagher? I'll give it back to you some time. He flourishes the book of Conrad, which has been lying on the table in front of him, and makes a grand gesture.
STEW: I go now - I go with Conrad in quest of my youth! Fry those tomatoes, will you, Gallagher?
STEW: ( reproachfully )
SMYTHE: ( stiffly )
STEW: Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , ( wags his head )
SMYTHE: ( glacially )
STEW: I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
SMYTHE: ( hollowly )
STEW: Now Jeeves, what would you call this - 'no one'?
ANNE: What's wrong?
SMYTHE: Mrs. Schuyler left orders, Miss, that if this person came here again, I was to call the police.
STEW: That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
ANNE: You may go, Smythe.
SMYTHE: But I
STEW: Now the lady said you may go
ANNE: ( to Stewdirectly )
STEW: Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
ANNE: ( haughty )
STEW: Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
ANNE: ( stiffly )
STEW: Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance
STEW: Just listen to this
ANNE: ( interrupting coldly )
STEW: ( mysteriously )
ANNE: I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
STEW: ( brightly )
ANNE: Where did you get those letters?
STEW: I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
ANNE: I suppose you're going to print them?
STEW: No - give you another guess.
ANNE: ( scornfully )
STEW: So, it's obvious, huh?
ANNE: Will you step into the library?
STEW: ( with alacrity )
STEW: ( while walking with Anne single file )
ANNE: What are your initials - Mr. - er
STEW: Smith. Stewart Smith. My friends call me Stew. It's an injustice too because I hold my liquor all right.
ANNE: Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
STEW: For what?
ANNE: For the letters, of course.
STEW: Gee, you shouldn't do that, Miss Schuyler. That's all right for your lawyer friend, but you shouldn't go around thinking you can buy people.
ANNE: I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
STEW: Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.
ANNE: You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and 
STEW: ( patiently again )
ANNE: I won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you
STEW: Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.
STEW: ( engagingly )
ANNE: Oh, you fool!
STEW: After years of research, I finally discovered that I was the only guy in the world who hadn't written a play, so believe it or not, in my spare time I'm now writing a play.
ANNE: Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
STEW: Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
ANNE: You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
STEW: Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
ANNE: You don't wear garters!
STEW: Naw, that's just a symbol of my independence.
STEW: I'm color blind. That's what's wrong - I'm color blind. I've been sitting here for a half hour looking at you and I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
ANNE: I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
STEW: Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's ( leaning closer )
STEW: ( leaning closer )
ANNE: Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
ANNE: Now, how would you like themopen like She smiles radiantly.
STEW: Close them both.
MRS. SCHUYLER: That's an excellent idea.
ANNE: Oh, hello Mother!
STEW: ( easily )
MRS. SCHUYLER: What is this person doing here?
ANNE: Stew goes on.
STEW: As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( bursting )
ANNE: ( quickly )
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( bursting with wrath )
STEW: ( elaborate bow )
MRS. SCHUYLER: Get out of here.
ANNE: ( distressed )
STEW: ( with dignity )
ANNE: Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
STEW: The caviar was lovely, Madam.
STEW: You must come over and see us sometime.
FADE OUT: FADE IN INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT 73. MEDIUM SHOT Anne in a stunning evening dress is seated, a cocktail in one hand, cigarette in the other. Dexter Grayson, in evening clothes, is standing before her.

GRAYSON: Where were you yesterday?
ANNE: Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.
GRAYSON: ( witheringly )
ANNE: Just the same, he's going to be a different person when I get through with him.
GRAYSON: When you get through with him?
ANNE: Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
GRAYSON: ( sneering )
ANNE: Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
GRAYSON: Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
ANNE: You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
GRAYSON: ( fervently )
ANNE: You? Oh, don't go serious on me, Dexter.
ANNE: Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
STEW: ( ad-lib acknowledgements )
GROUP: ( ad-lib acknowledgements )
FIRST WOMAN: Say, who's Anne's new boyfriend?
SECOND WOMAN: Well, if these old ears don't deceive me, I believe his name is Smith.
FIRST WOMAN: Smith! Can't be one of the brothers - he hasn't a beard on.[6]
SECOND WOMAN: Well, he must have something if Anne has got her clutches on him.
STEW: Anne, pinch me, will you? Throw me out of here. Give me the air. Throw me out of this joint, will you?
ANNE: Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
STEW: Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
ANNE: ( passionately )
STEW: ( struggling )
ANNE: ( although he is very close to her )
FADE IN: INT. CITY ROOM OF MORNING POST - DAY 84. MEDIUM FULL SHOT Typical atmosphere, as before.
ACT 1: SCENE 1 A STREET IN ARABY 88. CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER As she talks on the phone to one of her girlfriends
SCENE 1: A STREET IN ARABY 88. CLOSE SHOT - GALLAGHER As she talks on the phone to one of her girlfriends
GALLAGHER: ( sotto voce )
CONROY: What? Oh, I'll be surprised, eh? Listen if there's any news in that sheet that I haven't thrown in the wastepaper basket, I'll eat it.
CONROY'S VOICE: Hey Stew! Stew Smith!
STEW: His general expression registers "Good god, there he goes again." With one finger he pounds out four letters:
NUTS: He yanks the sheet out of the typewriter.
CONROY: You double-crossing hound! Come over CONTINUATION SCENE 87 Stew gets up from his machine, crumples the sheet of paper into a wad and flings it at the sleeping reporter. The wad strikes him in the face; he wakes abruptly and automatically reaches for the phone. He picks up the receiver and in a voice fogged with sleep calls a number. Stew 90. MEDIUM SHOT At Conroy's desk. Conroy's expression is one of bitter reproach as he leans back in his swivel chair as Stew approaches and stands by the desk.
STEW: Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
CONROY: ( interrupting fiercely )
STEW: It has been alleged - yes
CONROY: You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
STEW: ( defensively )
CONROY: ( howling so that he can be heard all over the room )
CONROY: I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!
STEW: No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
CONROY: Why not?
STEW: Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
CONROY: What do I care about your mother-in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
STEW: Yes, sir.
CONROY: Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
STEW: Thanks for your congratulations.
GROUP: ( ad-lib congratulations )
STEW: What's the matter with you mugs? Can't a guy get married without all this?
STEW: Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away I didn't run away.
GALLAGHER: I didn't run away.
STEW: Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
GALLAGHER: ( with sincerity )
STEW: Thanks, thanks.
GALLAGHER: I hope you'll be very happy.
STEW: Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
GALLAGHER: It's the smoke.
STEW: ( calling to bartender )
GALLAGHER: Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
STEW: Ah! Thank you, Joe.
GALLAGHER: ( quietly )
STEW: ( waxing reminiscent )
GALLAGHER: Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
STEW: Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
GALLAGHER: Remember, she's a Schuyler.
STEW: Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
GALLAGHER: ( murmurs )
STEW: Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
GALLAGHER: ( shaking her head )
STEW: ( resentfully )
GALLAGHER: Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
STEW: Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
GALLAGHER: ( interrupting in a whisper )
CONROY: What's the Benedict[8] looking for in the newspaper - his lost freedom?
STEW: ( grinning sheepishly )
STEW: Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story
CONROY: ( disgustedly )
GALLAGHER: ( to Conroy )
CONROY: ( looking straight at her )
CONROY: Well, when are you quitting?
STEW: Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
CONROY: I take it you don't have to work for a living any more
CONROY: Mr. Schuyler .
STEW: ( in a flash of anger )
CONROY: Is that so?
STEW: That's so.
CONROY: Anne Schuyler's in the Blue Book - you're not even in the phone book. Think that one over, sucker.
GALLAGHER: ( quickly in Stew's defense )
CONROY: Blah! It's like a giraffe marrying a ( looking off at Stew )
GALLAGHER'S VOICE: But that's perfectly ridiculous.
STEW: ( defensively )
CONROY: ( as if he had not heard Stew )
STEW: A what?
CONROY: You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
STEW: Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like ( sarcasm )
CONROY: ( sarcasm )
STEW: Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
CONROY: ( snorts )
STEW: My play.
CONROY: The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
STEW: Siberian bloodhound? No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
CONROY: ? 43 ? Araby, my eye!
STEW: ? 43 ? Araby, my eye!
CONROY: Araby, my eye!
CONROY: Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey
STEW: I'm not quitting!
CONROY: ( singing )
STEW: ( singing )
CONROY: ( singing )
STEW: ( under his breath )
GALLAGHER: Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
STEW: Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that ( he swirls his drink, thinking )
GALLAGHER: Sure - I think so, Stew.
STEW: I knew you would, pal.
GALLAGHER: How is her family going to feel about Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.
STEW: Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.
MICHAEL: I don't know what you need me here for - it isn't my funeral.
MRS. SCHUYLER: You stay right here, Michael. Some day you'll be head of this family, but thank heaven I shan't be here when it happens. And I hope you never have a daughter who gives you gastritis as Anne has She pulls the bell rope for the butler.
ANNE: Now Mother, calm yourself. There's no use in getting so excited.
MRS. SCHUYLER: Oh, isn't there?
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( in a weak, agonized voice )
SMYTHE: Double strength!
ANNE: Mother, if you keep this up, you'll have a nervous breakdown before you go to Europe.
MRS. SCHUYLER: It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
ANNE: Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( as Anne starts to get up again )
STEW: ( airily )
MRS. SCHUYLER: Mrs. Schuyler pauses - glowering at Stew. Stew nods perfunctorily to each member of the jury, the total innocent.
STEW: Hello, Anne. Mr. Grayson.
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( in command )
STEW: Nobody seems to want to do anything
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( witheringly )
STEW: ( with a tone of dismissal )
MRS. SCHUYLER: Young man, I want you to know that I object violently to this whole affair!
ANNE: Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
STEW: ( to Mrs. Schuyler )
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( furiously )
STEW: ( easily )
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( glaring )
STEW: Got it too, huh?
MICHAEL: Who won that round?
STEW: ( ruefully )
MICHAEL: I don't feel the way they do. You're really not as bad as everybody thinks.
STEW: ( effusively - shaking his hand )
MICHAEL: Don't worry too much about Mother - she's enjoying this. Come on upstairs, I'll give you a little -
STEW: ( to Michael )
ANNE: I'm glad.
STEW: He can bend!
ANNE: Come here baby!
ANNE: I haven't seen you for three hours. You're neglecting me already
STEW: What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
ANNE: You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
STEW: I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is? It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
ANNE: Your place?
STEW: Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill ( elaborate )
ANNE: ( gently insistent )
STEW: When 'we' . . .? You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
ANNE: Sure. We can have the whole left wing and be all by ourselves all the time.
STEW: ( cynically )
ANNE: ( seriously - missing his sarcasm )
STEW: Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you? Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
ANNE: But we don't need it, I'm sure.
STEW: I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
STEW: ( dropping his kidding )
ANNE: Of course I am Stewart.
STEW: Now let's get this settled
ANNE: You have the cutest nose I've
STEW: Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough? What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
ANNE: What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
STEW: It isn't cheap. It's nice.
ANNE: ( cuddling closer )
STEW: Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
ANNE: ( cuddling closer - and stroking his nose )
STEW: Nevertheless, whether the nose is sweet or not, I'm not going to live in your house. You may as well get that straight.
STEW: You do want me to be happy, don't you? Then I'm not going to live in your house
DAWSON: Mr. Smith, sir
DAWSON: Mr. Smith, sir!
DAWSON: Mr. Smith, sir
DAWSON: How do you like your bath, sir?
STEW: I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
STEW: Who are you?
DAWSON: ( surprised )
STEW: You're my what?
DAWSON: Your valet, sir.
STEW: Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
DAWSON: Dawson, sir.
STEW: Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
DAWSON: Drunk, sir?
STEW: Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
DAWSON: Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
STEW: Who did engage you then, if I didn't engage you? What are you doing with my pants
STEW: Did you take anything out of those pants?
DAWSON: Oh no, sir!
STEW: What are you doing fooling around in Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
DAWSON: Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
STEW: Hmmm. So Mrs. Smith engaged me a valley, huh? That's very nice of Mrs. Smith - to engage me a valley.
STEW: ( putting on the bathrobe )
DAWSON: Thank you, sir.
STEW: But not for me! Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
DAWSON: Oh, but indeed you do, sir, if you don't mind my saying so. A gentleman's gentleman, as it were. Someone to draw your bath, lay out your clothes, help to dress you - it's really most essential, sir.
STEW: ( over-sweetly )
DAWSON: Quite so. Quite.
STEW: Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
DAWSON: Now Mr. Smith, now please
STEW: You've got a nice face, Dawson, you wouldn't want anything to happen to your face, would you?
DAWSON: Oh no, sir
STEW: All right, outside!
DAWSON: ( bewildered )
STEW: ( gesturing violently )
DAWSON: I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
STEW: ( smiling admiringly )
DAWSON: No, sir. No!
STEW: Wait a minute, what's this?
DAWSON: That's a canary, sir.
STEW: That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
DAWSON: ( frightened )
STEW: ( ranting )
DAWSON: Yes sir!
ANNE: Good morning, darling.
ANNE: Oh, Dawson, see that all Mr. Smith's clothes go to the cleaners this morning, please, will you?
DAWSON: Very good, madame.
STEW: Say, who is this mug?
ANNE: I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
STEW: ( eyes closed, feeling the package )
ANNE: Do you like them?
STEW: Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
ANNE: You wear them of course, silly.
STEW: Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
ANNE: I know that.
STEW: Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
ANNE: Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear His arms go about Anne. Under the force of his embrace Anne sinks back on the pillows. Stew leans forward looking down at her.

STEW: ( picking up her sing-song )
ANNE: Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!

GALLAGHER: Miss Gallagher of the Post.
SMYTHE: Yes, miss.
SMYTHE: Miss Gallagher of the Post.
MISS WILSON: Oh yes - of course. Miss Gallagher?
GALLAGHER: MISS WILSON I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
MISS WILSON: I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
GALLAGHER: I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
MISS WILSON: Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
GALLAGHER: Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
MISS WILSON: Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
GALLAGHER: Yes, thank you.
MISS WILSON: That's a lovely dress.
GALLAGHER: Thank you.

GALLAGHER: I bet.
MISS WILSON: You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
MISS WILSON: There's the Spanish Ambassador.
GALLAGHER: You know, he looks like one.
BUTLER: Miss Wilson
MISS WILSON: Mrs. Smith would like to see you.
BUTLER: Mrs. Smith would like to see you.
MISS WILSON: ( to Gallagher )
GALLAGHER: ? 61 ? Miss Wilson follows butler out of scene. Gallagher is left alone. She wanders about the huge ballroom, peering here and there, searching for Stew. Finally she comes to a large open French door and steps out.
BALLROOM: Several groups of men and women are seated at tables. Gallagher enters from ballroom, glances quickly at all the men. Disappointed at not finding Stew, she crosses terrace and descends broad stone steps and advances into garden.
GALLAGHER: Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
STEW: Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at There you are!
GALLAGHER: There you are!
STEW: Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
GALLAGHER: I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
STEW: Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
GALLAGHER: Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
STEW: No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
GALLAGHER: ( fixing his tie )
STEW: Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
GALLAGHER: What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
STEW: What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
GALLAGHER: I dyed one and washed the other.
STEW: ( enthusiastically )
GALLAGHER: Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
STEW: Staring at us?
GALLAGHER: My mistake - she's glaring.
STEW: Must be my wife.
STEW: It is my wife. Hi Anne. Don't go away. Stay right there, because I'm going to bring a friend up I want you to meet.
STEW: Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
ANNE: ( astounded )
STEW: Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
ANNE: Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
STEW: Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
GALLAGHER: How do you do?
ANNE: ( bitter-sweet )
STEW: Gallagher flashes a look at Stew - seeing that he fails to get the dynamite behind Anne's casually pleasant phrases. Anne plunges ahead. Her tone is unmistakable Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
ANNE: Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
STEW: ( surprised )
ANNE: ( with a world of meaning )
STEW: You see, we never look at Gallagher as a girl
ANNE: ( with her eyes on Gallagher )
STEW: ( fumbling for words )
GALLAGHER: ( not so comfortable herself )
STEW: 157. MED. SHOT OF THE THREE ( a deadly acid smile )
ANNE: ( a deadly acid smile )
GALLAGHER: ( same kind of smile )
ANNE: Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
GALLAGHER: ( resenting the tone of dismissal )
ANNE: Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
GALLAGHER: Goodbye, Stew
STEW: That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
ANNE: I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
STEW: You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
ANNE: ( furious )
STEW: I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am ( reassuringly )
GALLAGHER: ( reassuringly )
STEW: No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before. ( pause ) It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
GALLAGHER: INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL 160. MED. CLOSE SHOT The butler is just opening the door. Bingy, looking more disreputable than usual, steps inside.
BINGY: Hello, there, Meadows![13]
SMYTHE: ( disapproving once-over )
BINGY: I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
SMYTHE: Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
BINGY: Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know
BINGY: a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
SMYTHE: I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
BINGY: Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
SMYTHE: Pardon me, sir, but I've heard that one before.
STEW: ( to Gallagher )
STEW: ( referring to vase )
BINGY: No. I was just looking at it. Pretty, ain't it? I was just looking for the price tag.
STEW: What do you want?
BINGY: Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
STEW: ( sore )
BINGY: Oh boy, I'd love it.
STEW: How's that?
BINGY: ( appraisingly )
STEW: Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
BINGY: A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?
STEW: Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
BINGY: Take it easy! Take it easy, Dempsey.[16] Just relax, my boy, relax and open your 164. CLOSER TWO SHOT Stew glares at him. Bingy goes on.

SMYTHE: Yes, sir.
FADE IN: INT. SCHUYLER HOME 167. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT Anne and her mother at the breakfast Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
ANNE: Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
MRS. SCHUYLER: I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.
ANNE: Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( reproachfully )
ANNE: You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
MRS. SCHUYLER: It was a miracle. The man was ill or She suddenly notices front page of paper Anne is reading. Her face freezes in horror. She screams.

MRS. SCHUYLER: ( muttering, as she exits scene )
GRAYSON: ( close behind, contemptuously )
STEW: Good morning, everybody
MRS. SCHUYLER: Have you seen this?
STEW: Yes - the worm!
MRS. SCHUYLER: I beg your pardon?
STEW: He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on MRS. SCHUYLER To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
MRS. SCHUYLER: To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
GRAYSON: I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
STEW: You quit trying to stop anybody
GRAYSON: Well, at best you might deny it.
STEW: Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
GRAYSON: Traps shut!
STEW: Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.
ANNE: Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
STEW: Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
MRS. SCHUYLER: And you struck him right here in our Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Well, what else do you expect them to call you?

GRAYSON: Cinderella Man! That's fifteen.
FADE IN: INT. SCHUYLER DRAWING ROOM 177. FULL SHOT Six or eight people of distinction scattered around the room. All dressed in full evening clothes. Among them is Grayson, Anne, her mother, and one man in aviator's uniform. The men have their coats and hats in their hands, the women have their evening wraps on. Apparently they are ready to leave for someplace and are being detained. An indistinct murmur of ad-lib conversation is heard.
SMYTHE: Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
MRS. SCHUYLER: Are the cars ready?
SMYTHE: They've been ready for the last half 179. MED. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP Including Captain White, a young, handsome ( modestly )

STEW: I poisoned him.
ANNE: Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
STEW: I'm not going!
ANNE: What are you talking about?
STEW: I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
ANNE: ( controlling her anger )
STEW: Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
ANNE: ( getting angrier by the minute )
STEW: Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
ANNE'S VOICE: Do you know you're talking about my Yes, I'm talking about your friends, and they still give me the jitters.
STEW: Yes, I'm talking about your friends, and they still give me the jitters.
ANNE: Well, are you going - or aren't you?
STEW: Anne, come here. Listen
ANNE: ( sternly - slipping away from him )
STEW: I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves

STEW: Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
ANNE: Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
STEW: ( trying hard )
ANNE: ( hard )
STEW: I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
ANNE: Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
STEW: Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I

SMYTHE: Did you call, sir?
STEW: Smythe, come here. I want to talk to ( Smythe looks unenthusiastic. )
STEW: Shhh! Do you hear something?
SMYTHE: Yes, sir.
STEW: You try it.
SMYTHE: ( reluctant )
STEW: Smythe gives it a timid try.
STEW: No, no. Give it more volume.
STEW: No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
SMYTHE: ( incredulous )
STEW: Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
SMYTHE: Yes, sir.
STEW: Found no skeletons?
SMYTHE: No, sir.
STEW: It's haunted just the same.
SMYTHE: Yes, sir.
STEW: Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with Well, sir, I putter.
SMYTHE: Well, sir, I putter.
STEW: Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
SMYTHE: I just putter.
STEW: Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
SMYTHE: Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
STEW: Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
SMYTHE: Well sir, I'll show you.
SMYTHE: That's puttering, sir.
STEW: No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
SMYTHE: Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
STEW: Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
SMYTHE: Yes sir.
STEW: Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
SMYTHE: Yes sir.
STEW: How about me? Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
SMYTHE: You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
STEW: Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
SMYTHE: Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
STEW: A bird in a gilded cage?
SMYTHE: That's all I wanted to know!
STEW: That's all I wanted to know!
STEW: Hello, Gallagher old pal. How are you, old pal?
GALLAGHER: Oh, hello Stew. I'm pretty good, can't complain. How's our gentleman of leisure?
STEW: I'm on the coast of Norway and I can't get out - will you come and get me out of the coast of Norway?
GALLAGHER: Oh, your play. Hmmm, Act One, Scene One: Coast of Norway - and then a lot of blank. Is that it?
STEW: Yeah. Come on, don't be silly.
GALLAGHER: She hangs up, joyful at the prospect of seeing Stew. She hums softly to herself as she picks up the receiver again.
SOUND: ( bell ringing )
STEW: Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
SMYTHE: Very good, sir.
STEW: Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
GALLAGHER: Hello, Stew.
STEW: Hello, Hank. How are you?
HANK: Fine, but kinda thirsty.
STEW: Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
HANK: Okay - you remember Joe
STEW: I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
HANK: I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
STEW: It's all right. Bring him in.
HANK: Come in, Joe. It's all right.
STEW: Hello, Joe.
JOE: Hello kid, how are you? Glad to see Stew starts to close the door.
JOE: Just a minute - Johnson's outside. You don't mind if he comes in and dips a beak[17] do you?
STEW: No, no, bring him in. The more the merrier.
JOE: Come on in!
STEW: Hello, Johnson.
JOHNSON: Hello, Stew, old pal. How are you?
STEW: Glad to see you. Come in, kid.
JOHNSON: Wait a minute. I got two of the boys I brought along - they were cruising around with nothing to do. You don't mind if I bring them in?
STEW: You brought two of the boys? That's all right. Bring them in. What's the The two enter, followed in a single file by 12-14 men and women, all of whom greet Stew as they enter, ad-libbing hello's and hand-shakes. Stew stares at them dumbfoundedly.
STEW: I'm sorry nobody could come.
HANK: The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
STEW: Now Hank, are you sure they're coming? It will be lonesome without them.
SMYTHE: It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
STEW: Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
GALLAGHER: I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
STEW: I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
GALLAGHER: ( as Smythe passes by, being propelled by revellers )
STEW: ( as Smythe passes by, being propelled by revellers )
SMYTHE: ( dazed )
STEW: ( spotting him )
BINGY: No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
BINGY: ( warningly )
BINGY: ( striking a pose )
STEW: Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
BINGY: Fire water all right.
BINGY: Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
STEW: Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
BINGY: I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
STEW: ( indicating Bingy's false beard )
STEW: You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
GALLAGHER: Yes - and I'd love it.
SMYTHE: Sure, you'd love it.
GALLAGHER: How far have you gotten?
STEW: Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
GALLAGHER: ( reading )
GALLAGHER: ( smiling )
STEW: ( grins )
GALLAGHER: ( seriously )
STEW: ( grinning in spite of himself )
STEW: Never even been to New Madrid.
GALLAGHER: Then how do you expect to write about Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
STEW: Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
GALLAGHER: Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
STEW: Did who?
GALLAGHER: What do you know about Conrad?
STEW: What do you know about Conrad?
GALLAGHER: I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling Stew is noticeably impressed with this point of view.
STEW: Gosh, you look cute.
GALLAGHER: Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
STEW: Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
GALLAGHER: Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
STEW: 198. MEDIUM SHOT Then why don't you write about something you know? Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
GALLAGHER: Then why don't you write about something you know? Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
STEW: Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now . . .
GALLAGHER: Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine
STEW: ( warming up - he puts arm around Gallagher's shoulder )
GALLAGHER: ( smiling )
STEW: You could be something.
GALLAGHER: Here you are.
STEW: All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you LAP DISSOLVE TO: INT. SCHUYLER ENTRANCE HALL 199. MED. FULL SHOT Shooting through into the drawing room. It is many hours later. The members of the party, including Smythe, are pretty well lit. On the floor of the entrance hall a dice game is in progress. In the drawing room four or five are hanging over the piano singing "The Grasshopper Jumped Over Another Grasshopper's In general, a large time is being had. As the scene opens a door-bell is ringing. A key is heard in the lock.
HALL: The outer door starts to swing open. One of the party guests, very wall-eyed now, and carrying a whiskey bottle in his hand, staggers toward the door. It opens wider, and Anne and Mrs. Schuyler and Dexter Grayson stand gasping in the opening. The guest comes up to them.
GUEST: ( starting to close door )
BINGY: ( recognizing Grayson )
DEXTER: I know who's the cause of it all!
ANNE: Oh, Dexter!
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( to butler )
SMYTHE: ( thoroughly plastered )
GRAYSON: ( confidentially, to Mrs. Schuyler )
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( aghast )
SMYTHE: ( proudly )
GRAYSON: ( confidentially )
MRS. SCHUYLER: ( indignant )
SMYTHE: Well, for crying out loud, I don't know. And I don't care. Whoopee!
GRAYSON: ( confidentially )
STEW: Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - some-
GALLAGHER: Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
STEW: Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
GALLAGHER: Very good.
STEW: ( absently )
ANNE: ( tight-lipped )
STEW: What does what mean?
STEW: Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
ANNE: I see.
STEW: Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play! Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
ANNE: ( coldly )
GALLAGHER: I think I better go, Stew.
ANNE: I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
STEW: Wait a minute, Gallagher.
STEW: What's the idea, Anne?
ANNE: The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
STEW: Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
ANNE: Unreasonable! Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
STEW: Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
ANNE: ( pointedly )
STEW: ( getting the implication; after a pause )
STEW: I suppose I've been boarding out this past year.
STEW: ( quietly; grimly )
STEW: and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
ANNE: ( hotly )
STEW: ( hotly )
ANNE: You can't walk out of here like this.
STEW: Oh I can't? Who's going to stop me? I'd like to see somebody stop me. If you think I'm going to stick around this joint just to look at this mausoleum, not on your life! You're going to make no stuffed shirt out of me. Now what do you think of that?
MRS. SCHUYLER: What's going on here? Who is this woman?
STEW: ( snappily )
MRS. SCHUYLER: Heavens! The man's insane!
STEW: Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.
GALLAGHER: 212. MEDIUM SHOT Stew is stuffing things into a bag.
STEW: ( heatedly to Anne )
ANNE: That's ridiculous.
STEW: Fine! I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
ANNE: You're acting like a child.
STEW: All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.
STEW: ( to Mrs. Schuyler, pointedly )
ANNE: ( exasperated )
PANHANDLER: Pardon me, could you spare a dime for a cup of coffee?
STEW: Coffee? How would you like to be a Knight of the Garter?
PANHANDLER: ( stupidly )
STEW: ( as he removes the garters )
PANHANDLER: ( an afterthought )
GALLAGHER: ( comfortingly )
STEW: ( snapping out of it )
GALLAGHER: Why, you're just a first-class chump! You just staged a scene that would play like a million dollars! How about that declaration of independence for the second act curtain?
STEW: ( almost reverently )
FADE IN: INSERT: CLOSE SHOT OF NAME PLATE OVER "STEWART SMITH" LAP DISSOLVE TO: INSERT: SHEET IN TYPEWRITER On it is being typed:
DOORBELL: "STEWART SMITH" LAP DISSOLVE TO: INSERT: SHEET IN TYPEWRITER On it is being typed:
"STEWART SMITH": LAP DISSOLVE TO: INSERT: SHEET IN TYPEWRITER On it is being typed:
FULL SHOT: Inexpensive but comfortable. Stew is in his shirtsleeves. A battered old typewriter stands on the table with a sheet of blank paper in it. Stew is seated in a chair before it, and is picking out the letters, typing. He pauses, running up the roller to regard what he has written.
SHOT: Gallagher, in a little apron, is frying some ham and eggs. She looks up as she sees Stew from the doorway.
STEW: Hey, Gallagher!
GALLAGHER: How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty It'll be ready in a minute.
STEW: How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty It'll be ready in a minute.
GALLAGHER: It'll be ready in a minute.
STEW: ( accusingly )
GALLAGHER: ( in mock contrition )
STEW: Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
SHOT: There is a knock on the hall door.
GRAYSON: Hello, Smith.
STEW: ( puzzled )
GRAYSON: I suppose you know why I came?
STEW: No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
GRAYSON: Now don't be absurd, Smith
STEW: Surely, come right in.
GRAYSON: ( as he sits down )
STEW: Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
GRAYSON: I don't eat waffles.
STEW: You don't.
GRAYSON: Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
STEW: ( with enlightened expression )
GRAYSON: ( uncomfortably )
STEW: Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
GRAYSON: ( interrupting )
SHOT: Gallagher. Overcome by curiosity at the sound of voices, she leaves the frying eggs and goes quietly to the doorway and peeks out.
GRAYSON: We should like to know how much you would want to
STEW: ( interrupting )
GRAYSON: That's putting it crudely, but
STEW: ( closing in on him )
GRAYSON: I beg your pardon.
STEW: Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those ? 95 ? 224. CLOSE SHOT Showing kitchen door open a crack. Gallagher's eyes are glistening as she watches and 225. MED. CLOSE SHOT Stew and Grayson.
GRAYSON: ( weakly )
STEW: ( snaps )
GRAYSON: And now for that twentieth crack
STEW: And now for that twentieth crack
GALLAGHER: ( pretending ignorance )
STEW: ( without looking up from his typing )
GALLAGHER: What did he want?
STEW: Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third They sit at the little table.
GALLAGHER: What was the idea he gave you?
STEW: It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this? The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
GALLAGHER: Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
STEW: ( vehemently - as he scoops out some melon )
GALLAGHER: ( not sure of herself )
STEW: The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
GALLAGHER: ( ecstatic, but still fighting )
STEW: Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
GALLAGHER: There's nothing sudden about that
STEW: There's nothing sudden about that
STEW: ( tenderly )
STEW: ( tenderly )
