BIALYSTOCK: BIALYSTOCK GLIDES IN TOM-CAT FASHION OVER TO HIS PREENING RESUME ACTION. BIALYSTOCK FINISHES CROSSING TO DESK, PUTS HIS FACE DOWN NEAR HERS AND SOFTLY MEWS INTO HER EAR. SHE SUDDENLY LETS OUT A FIERCE HOWL AS SHE REBUFFS HIM WITH A SAVAGE SWIPE OF HER "PAW". BIALYSTOCK GRABS HIS STRICKEN FACE WITH BOTH HANDS AND SHRIEKS. CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S PAIN-RIDDEN FEATURES.

BLOOM: ( his forward motion arrested by the unbelievable scene ) How do you do. I mean . Excuse me . I mean .
BIALYSTOCK: You mean ooops, don't you? Say ooops and get out.
BLOOM: I'll wait in the hall .
BIALYSTOCK: ( backing out of door ) I can't abide a peeping Tom. There's one in the apartment just opposite my bedroom window. I swear that man NEVER takes his field glasses off me for a minute.
BLOOM: ( backing out of door ) I can't abide a peeping Tom. There's one in the apartment just opposite my bedroom window. I swear that man NEVER takes his field glasses off me for a minute.
BIALYSTOCK: ( stopping her ) Wait. Wait. We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
BIALYSTOCK: Thursday. Thursday. We'll play Thursday. We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
BIALYSTOCK: ( trying to steer her towards the door ) Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
BIALYSTOCK: ( harassed ) All right. All right.
BIALYSTOCK: I can't take my eyes off you. How can I drive when you drive me mad. Rudolfo, you dirty pig! Pull over.
BIALYSTOCK: ( upright ) Good. That's enough. We'll do the rest on Thursday. ( he reaches down and helps her off the couch ) That's a good girl. ( leading her to the door ) It's always such fun to see you.

BIALYSTOCK: Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give me the check. Can't produce a play without money, ha, ha, ha.
BIALYSTOCK: Oh, it's fine. Fine. Good. Good. Bye. Bye.
BIALYSTOCK: ( waving check at her ) Ta. Ta.
LANDLORD: That's the law.
BIALYSTOCK: Murderer! Thief! How can you take the last penny out of a man's pocket?
LANDLORD: ( turns back, shrugs ) I have to . I'm a landlord!
BIALYSTOCK: ( shouting to heaven ) Oh Lord, hear my plea. Destroy him. He maketh a blight on the land.
LANDLORD: ( to the Lord ) Don't pay attention. He's crazy.
BIALYSTOCK: ( biting his knuckle ) Nnnnn. That hurt. ( he sighs ) I'll have to make another call.
BIALYSTOCK: ( to Bloom, quietly ) Have you been there all this time?
BIALYSTOCK: And did you see and hear everything?
BIALYSTOCK: Then what do you have to say for Uh . uh . ooooooops?
BLOOM: Uh . uh . ooooooops?
BIALYSTOCK: ( shouts ) Who are you? What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak! Why don't you Scared. Can't talk.
BLOOM: Scared. Can't talk.
BIALYSTOCK: All right. Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
BLOOM: ( breathes deeply. Words tumble from his mouth as he exhales ) I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. ( he has run out of breath )
BIALYSTOCK: "Caught you with the old lady." Come in, Mr. Tact.
BIALYSTOCK: So you're an accountant, eh?
BLOOM: ( timidly ) Yes sir.
BIALYSTOCK: Then account for yourself! Do you believe in God? Do you believe in gold? Why are you looking up old lady's dresses? Bit of a pervert, Sir, I .
BLOOM: Sir, I .
BIALYSTOCK: Never mind. Never mind. Do the books. They're in that desk over there. Top drawer.
BIALYSTOCK: How dare you condemn me without knowing all the facts.
BLOOM: But sir, I'm not condem .
BIALYSTOCK: Shut up. I'm having a rhetorical How humiliating. Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
BIALYSTOCK: You know who I used to be? Max Bialystock! The King of Broadway! Six shows running at once. Lunch at Delmonico's. Two hundred dollar suits. Look at me. Look at me now! I'm wearing a cardboard belt!
BIALYSTOCK: I used to have thousands of investors begging, pleading, to put their money into a Max Bialystock Look at my investors now. Voila! Hundreds of little old ladies stopping off at Max Bialystock's office to grab a last thrill on the way to the cemetery.
BIALYSTOCK: Look at my investors now. Voila! Hundreds of little old ladies stopping off at Max Bialystock's office to grab a last thrill on the way to the cemetery.
BIALYSTOCK: You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect. One . Two .
BIALYSTOCK: Do the books! Do the books!
BLOOM: ( sighing ) Yes, sir. Thank you.
BIALYSTOCK: ( to himself ) Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
BIALYSTOCK: ( voice over as camera follows Rolls ) Look at that. A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
BLOOM: ( off screen ) Koff, koff . ahem, ahem . harrumph .
BIALYSTOCK: I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention. Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
BIALYSTOCK: I have hurt your feelings.
BIALYSTOCK: Good, what is it?
BLOOM: Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
BIALYSTOCK: ( looking at his watch ) Go! You have fifty-eight seconds.
BLOOM: Well, sir, it seems .
BIALYSTOCK: ( interrupting ) You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry. Hurry.
BLOOM: ( speedily ) In looking at your books, I've discovered that .
BIALYSTOCK: ( interrupting ) Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
BLOOM: Mr. Bialystock, I cannot function under these conditions.
BLOOM: You're making me extremely nervous.
BIALYSTOCK: What is that? A handkerchief?
BLOOM: It's nothing . nothing.
BIALYSTOCK: If it's nothing, why can't I see it?
BLOOM: ( shrieking in panic ) My blanket. Give me my blue blanket.
BIALYSTOCK: Here, don't panic.
BLOOM: ( clutching his blanket ) I'm sorry . I don't like people touching my blue blanket. It's not important. It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and . and . I find it very comforting.
BIALYSTOCK: ( to himself ) They come here. They all come here. How do they find me?
BLOOM: ( recovering his dignity ) Mr. Bialystock .
BIALYSTOCK: Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
BLOOM: This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last Where? What?
BIALYSTOCK: Where? What?
BLOOM: According to the backer's list you raised $60,000. But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand. There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
BIALYSTOCK: I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop. What difference does it make?
BLOOM: It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud. If they found out, you could go to prison.
BIALYSTOCK: Why should they find out? It's only two thousand dollars, Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around. You can do it. You're an accountant. The word 'count' is part of your title.
BLOOM: ( aghast ) But that's cheating!
BIALYSTOCK: It's not cheating . It's charity. Bloom, look at me . look at me! I'm drowning. Other men sail through life. Bialystock has struck a reef. Bloom, I'm going under. I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure. Bloom, I'm reaching out to you. Don't send me to jail. Help! Help!
BLOOM: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
BIALYSTOCK: ( faintly ) All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.
BLOOM: All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.
BIALYSTOCK: Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could con you.
BLOOM: Oh, it's all right . wha?
BIALYSTOCK: Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.
BLOOM: ( pouring over the accounts ) Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much. I'm sure I can hide it somewhere. After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that Yes. Right. Good thinking. You figure it out. I'm tired. I'm gonna take a little nap. ( crossing to couch ) Wake me if there's a fire.
BIALYSTOCK: Yes. Right. Good thinking. You figure it out. I'm tired. I'm gonna take a little nap. Wake me if there's a fire.
BLOOM: Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get .
BLOOM: ( musing to himself ) Heh, heh, heh, amazing. It's absolutely amazing. But under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
BLOOM: Yes. Yes. It's quite possible. If he were certain the show would fail, a man could make a fortune.
BIALYSTOCK: BLOOM LOOKS UP. HE IS STARTLED TO SEE BIALYSTOCK'S FACE SO CLOSE TO HIS OWN.
BLOOM: ( at a loss ) Yes, what?
BIALYSTOCK: What you were saying. Keep talking.
BLOOM: What was I saying?
BIALYSTOCK: You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
BLOOM: ( smiling ) Yes, it's quite possible.
BIALYSTOCK: You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how. How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
BLOOM: It's simply a matter of creative accounting. Let us assume, just for the moment, that you are a dishonest man.
BIALYSTOCK: Assume away!
BLOOM: Well, it's very easy. You simply raise more money than you really What do you mean?
BIALYSTOCK: What do you mean?
BLOOM: You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
BIALYSTOCK: What did I do?
BLOOM: You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
BIALYSTOCK: So what? What did it get me? I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
BLOOM: Ahhhhhh! But that's where you made your error. You didn't go all the way. You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
BIALYSTOCK: But the play only cost $60,000 to Exactly. And how long did it run?
BLOOM: Exactly. And how long did it run?
BIALYSTOCK: One night.
BLOOM: See? You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the But what if the play was a hit?
BIALYSTOCK: But what if the play was a hit?
BLOOM: Oh, you'd go to jail. If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
BIALYSTOCK: Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
BLOOM: What scheme?
BIALYSTOCK: What scheme? Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
BLOOM: Oh, no. No. No. I meant no scheme. I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory. It's just a thought.
BIALYSTOCK: Bloom, worlds are turned on such Don't you see, Bloom. Darling, Bloom, glorious Bloom, it's so simple. Step one: We find the worst play in the world a sure flop. Step two: I raise a million dollars there's a lot of little old ladies in this world. Step three: You go back to work on the books. Phoney lists of backers one for the government, one for us. You can do it, Bloom, you're a Step four: We open on Broadway and before you can say 'step five' we close on Broadway. Step six: We take our million dollars and fly to Rio de Janiero.
BIALYSTOCK: Don't you see, Bloom. Darling, Bloom, glorious Bloom, it's so simple. Step one: We find the worst play in the world a sure flop. Step two: I raise a million dollars there's a lot of little old ladies in this world. Step three: You go back to work on the books. Phoney lists of backers one for the government, one for us. You can do it, Bloom, you're a Step four: We open on Broadway and before you can say 'step five' we close on Broadway. Step six: We take our million dollars and fly to Rio de Janiero.
BIALYSTOCK: ( sings ) "Ah, Rio, Rio by the seao, meo, myo, meo . "
BLOOM: ( afraid of the scheme, afraid of the dance, afraid of Bialystock ) Mr. Bialystock. No. Wait. Please. You're holding me too tight. I'm an honest man. You don't understand.
BIALYSTOCK: ( leading Bloom as he talks ) No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
BLOOM: ( the back of his head practically touching the floor ) Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
BIALYSTOCK: OOOOOHH! OOOOOHH! OOOOOHH! OOOOOHH! I WANT THAT MONEY! Oh, I fell on my keys. I've got to get out of here.
BLOOM: ( to himself ) Oh, I fell on my keys. ( he shifts slightly to make himself more comfortable ) I've got to get out of here.
BIALYSTOCK: ( angrily hovering over Bloom ) You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar. Don't you ever want to become a butterfly? Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
BLOOM: ( his eyes widened in terror ) You're going to jump on me.
BLOOM: You're going to jump on me. I know you're going to jump on me like Nero jumped on Poppea.
BIALYSTOCK: ( nonplussed ) ( by now he is shrieking ) Poppea. She was his wife. And she was unfaithful to him. So he got mad and he jumped on her. Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug. Please don't jump on me.
BLOOM: ( by now he is shrieking ) Poppea. She was his wife. And she was unfaithful to him. So he got mad and he jumped on her. Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug. Please don't jump on me.
BIALYSTOCK: ( shouting and jumping up and down next to Bloom ) I'm not going to jump on you!
BLOOM: ( rolling away in terror ) ( hoisting Bloom to his feet ) Will you get a hold on yourself.
BIALYSTOCK: ( hoisting Bloom to his feet ) Will you get a hold on yourself.
BLOOM: ( up on his feet and running for cover ) Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
BIALYSTOCK: What are you afraid of? I'm not going to hurt you! What's the matter with you?
BLOOM: I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics. I'm hysterical. I can't stop. When I get like this, I can't stop. I'm hysterical.
BLOOM: I'm wet! I'm wet! I'm hysterical and I'm wet!
BLOOM: ( holding his face ) I'm in pain! And I'm wet! And I'm still hysterical!
BLOOM: No! No! Don't hit. It doesn't help. It only increases my sense of danger.
BIALYSTOCK: What can I do? What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
BLOOM: Go away from me. You frighten me. Sit over there.
BIALYSTOCK: ( exasperated ) Okay. I'm way over here. Is that It's a little better, but you still look angry.
BLOOM: It's a little better, but you still look angry.
BIALYSTOCK: How's this?
BLOOM: Good. Good. That's nice. That's very nice. I think I'm coming out of it now. Yes. Yes. I'm definitely coming out of it. Thank you for smiling. It helped a great Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you." Heh, heh. The man should be in a straight Feeling better?
BIALYSTOCK: ( for want of something sensible ) Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you." Heh, heh. ( to himself ) The man should be in a straight ( to Bloom ) Feeling better?
BLOOM: Much, thank you. But I am a little lightheaded. Maybe I should eat something. Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
BIALYSTOCK: They certainly do. They certainly do. Come, let me take you to lunch.
BLOOM: That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I .
BIALYSTOCK: ( interrupting ) Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy. I lowered your blood sugar, but least I could do is raise it a little.
BIALYSTOCK: And I promise you faithfully, I won't discuss that silly scheme to make a million dollars anymore.
BIALYSTOCK: BLOOM GRACIOUSLY COMPLIES. THEY EXIT. CUT TO EXTERIOR. ENTRANCE OF BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE BUILDING. THE DOOR OPENS. IT IS HELD BY BIALYSTOCK. BLOOM EXITS BUILDING INTO STREET.

BLOOM: ( out of breath ) I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
BIALYSTOCK: Thank you, Leo. And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max. It's only people I really like.
BLOOM: ( trying it on ) Okay . Max! And you can call me I already have. Come on.
BIALYSTOCK: I already have. Come on.
BLOOM: Where would you like to eat?
BIALYSTOCK: Where would you like to eat?

BIALYSTOCK: Let me see . it's such a beautiful day. Why waste it indoors. I've got it! Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
BLOOM: Coney Island??
BIALYSTOCK: What's the matter, Leo? Don't you like Coney Island?
BLOOM: I . I love it. I haven't been there since I was a kid. But it's nearly two o'clock. I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
BIALYSTOCK: Nonsense! As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
BLOOM: Then stick with Bialystock!
BIALYSTOCK: Then stick with Bialystock!
BIALYSTOCK: ( to Custard Man ) We'll have another round.
CUSTARD MAN: What kind now, sports?
BIALYSTOCK: What kind now, Leo?
BLOOM: ( he's loosening up ) I don't know. Let's see. We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
BIALYSTOCK: ( to Custard Man ) Two pistachios, my good man.
CUSTARD MAN: I'm not your good man, I happen to own this establishment.
BIALYSTOCK: Everybody's a big shot. Well, Leo, are you having a good I don't know. I think so. I feel very strange.

BIALYSTOCK: Maybe you're happy.
BLOOM: Yes. That's it. Happy. Well, whatta ya think of that. Happy.
BLOOM: ( licking his pistachio custard. He is ecstatic ) I love it. I love it. Get set. We're coming to another turn.

BLOOM: You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm a nothing. I spend my life counting other people's money people I'm smarter than, better than. Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share? I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!

LIEBKIND: ( as he hands glasses to Bialystock and Bloom ) Mr. Bloom, Mr. Bialystock. Gentleman, with your permission, I would like to propose a toast to the greatest man that ever lived. Let us say his name quietly to ourselves. The walls have ears.
LIEBKIND: ( a fervent whisper ) Adolph Hitler. ( he downs drink )

BIALYSTOCK: ( whisper ) Max Bialystock. ( he downs drink )
LIEBKIND: I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
BIALYSTOCK: With whom?
LIEBKIND: ( astonished by the question ) Vit the Fuhrer, of course. He liked me. Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite. I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
BIALYSTOCK: No kidding?
LIEBKIND: Oh, sure. I used to take him his hot milk and his opium. Achhh, those were the days. Vat good times ve had. Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing. You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
BIALYSTOCK: Really, I never dreamed .
LIEBKIND: ( flies into an indignant rage ) That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies. But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they? Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie! ( he gestures V for victory ) Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi. He would say Narzis, Narzis. Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis. But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off ( swinging along ) That's exactly why we want to do this play. To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart.
BIALYSTOCK: ( swinging along ) That's exactly why we want to do this play. To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart.

BIALYSTOCK: Why? Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
BLOOM: But if something should. God forbid. go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back. It would look better in court.
BIALYSTOCK: Stop talking like that, you white mouse! Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.

DE BRIS: ( his eyes flashing flirtatiously ) Do you really think it brings out my eyes?
CARMEN: ( irritated ) We can't tell a thing without your wig. As far as I'm concerned, you're only half-dressed.
DE BRIS: Ummmm. Well, if you're so worried about the wig, get it, o' wicked witch of the west.

To deal with conflict, with inner truth. Roger De Bris presents history. Of course, I think we should add a little music. That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war. It's too depressing. We'll have to put something in there. Aaahghhh! I see it! A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together. Two-three-kick-turn! Turn-turn- That's genius. That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME
