PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE: by Paul Thomas Anderson
BARRY: ...yes I'm still on hold...
OPERATOR: And what was this?
BARRY: I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
OPERATOR: This is "Fly With Us?"
BARRY: It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
OPERATOR: I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
BARRY: So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
OPERATOR: That's it.
BARRY: Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
OPERATOR: I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
BARRY: Can I call you back if I have any further questions...? Can I get your extension?
OPERATOR: It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
BARRY: Ok. Thank you.
BARRY: ....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
VOICE: If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
BARRY: It's a plastic, yeah.
VOICE: Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
BARRY: Did you have my home phone number?
VOICE: For what?
BARRY: If you wanted to call me back I could...
VOICE: I'm fine, I have your work number.
BARRY: Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
VOICE: It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
BARRY: Ok.
VOICE: Ok, bye, bye.
BARRY: Bye.
LENA: Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?

BARRY: I don't know.
LENA: Do you know them.
BARRY: Not very well.
LENA: Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them?

ELIZABETH: I'm trying to be your friend.
BARRY: I know.
ELIZABETH: I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.

ELIZABETH: All I'm trying to do is be your friend.

BARRY: I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
WALTER: Like a psychiatrist?
BARRY: I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
WALTER: You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?

BARRY: This makes me very uncomfortable.
SEXY VOICE: I need help.
SEXY VOICE: Should I just ask your girlfriend? (beat) Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?

BARRY: She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
ELIZABETH: It's not cool?
BARRY: It's fine, but --
ELIZABETH: -- do you think you'll ask her out?
BARRY: I feel really on the spot now.
ELIZABETH: Are you gonna do it?
BARRY: I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
ELIZABETH: You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
BARRY: I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
ELIZABETH: I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
BARRY: I don't know.
ELIZABETH: I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
BARRY: What?
ELIZABETH: Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? (beat) Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
BARRY: I didn't ask him that. He's lying.

BARRY: Do you have brothers or sisters?
LENA: No. I'm the exact opposite --
BARRY: That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
LENA: It's terrible, no.
LENA: What do you do with all this pudding?
BARRY: That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
LENA: Oh My God.
BARRY: It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
LENA: Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
BARRY: (to the guys) Are you guys hurt?
WORKERS/LANCE: No, no, we're ok....Barry, sorry --
BARRY: (back to Lena) So you do what she does, the same work, the same job?
LENA: I do, but I do field consultations mainly too which is cool because I get to travel. I travel. A lot of the time. I'm going to Hawaii on Friday.
BARRY: That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
LENA: Really?
BARRY: I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
LENA: -- well, if you're gonna go --
BARRY: -- I'm probably not gonna go though.
LENA: -- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
BARRY: -- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
ELIZABETH: I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
LENA: (to Elizabeth) You ready?
ELIZABETH: Are you coming to eat with us?
BARRY: Yeah I can't.

LENA: Bye, Barry.
BARRY: Goodbye.
ELIZABETH: Call me later.
ELIZABETH: So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
LENA: Ok.
LENA: I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
BARRY: Sure.
LENA: Do you want to pick me up?
BARRY: Sure.
LENA: Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
BARRY: Sure.
BARRY: This is funny.
LENA: Yeah.
BARRY: I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
LENA: Ok.
BARRY: Alright?
LENA: ....Hi.....
BARRY: ....Hi.....
LANCE (OC): Barry, Line One, Telephone!
BARRY: Hello?
SEXY VOICE: You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
DAVID: I'll do it.
JIM: I'll do it too.
DAVID: But it's gotta wait until my knee is better. I can't risk it.
LATISHA: You have to do it now.
JIM: If we drive there it's a problem.
LATISHA: Dean will loan you one of his cars.
JIM: Which one?
LATISHA: You have to talk to him --
DAVID: How do you know he's rich?
LATISHA: Because I know, I just know. I mean, I talked to him, I know.
NATE: Where are you guys going?
DAVID: California. Los Angeles.
NATE: When are you leaving?
DAVID: Right now.
LATISHA: Let's go talk to Dean.
DEAN: Hey guys.
DAVID/JIM/NATE: Hey, Dean.
LATISHA: So they'll go.
DEAN: I'm only paying two of you guys.
DAVID: That's cool.
DEAN: When can you leave?
DAVID: As soon as you want.
DEAN: I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
DEAN: You wanna fuck around, asshole? You wanna get tough, wanna see me kick some motherfuck around here?
REGULAR JOE: Take it easy, man, relax. Don't --
DEAN: I'll relax your fucking head -- this is my personal space, man, this is my personal fucking space, you don't violate that, you don't do that.
REGULAR JOE: I've got a glass in my hand why don't you chill out?
DEAN: You've got a glass?
DEAN: Take it easy, take it easy you guys in here, I need to talk to you later, Tommy -- I wanna know if you wanna book the boys --
MAN: I'll talk to you later.
DEAN: Your expenses are your own.
DAVID: I thought Latisha said you would --
DEAN: -- she didn't know what she was talking about --
DAVID: It's....whatever....that's not cool.
DEAN: David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.
DEAN: ...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
LATISHA: Uch. Shut up, Dean.
DEAN: What's the problem?
LATISHA: You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
DEAN: Flinchy. That's what I thought. Shut up. (to Greg) Call me when you see this guy -- check him out see what's what. She asked him for seven fifty when she was on the phone with him, so -- just call me when you get there.
DEAN: This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
DAVID: Ok.
DEAN: That's it.
DAVID: Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
LATISHA: Why?
DAVID: ...because it's California? I mean it's like a nine or ten hour drive. It's not like going to Salt Lake and getting the Mormon's, it's different...
LENA: Who is it?
BARRY: It's Barry.
LENA: Hi.
LENA: So I want to tell you something, I gotta tell you: I saw a picture of you guys, your sisters and you and I saw your picture and I really wanted to meet you. (beat) I came to drop my car off there on purpose, to try and meet you.
BARRY: ...really? That's nice...are you lying?
LENA: ...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
BARRY: That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that. (beat) You're friends with my sister?
LENA: Yeah.
BARRY: How long have you known her?
LENA: About six months.
BARRY: You like her?
LENA: Yeah. Yeah we get along well. (beat) You didn't get along with her very well?
BARRY: Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
LENA: No, no. I did.
BARRY: That's nice. It's nice. (beat) I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
LENA: Yeah.
BARRY: So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
LENA: Yeah?
BARRY: ....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
LENA: You were talking about the promotion --
BARRY: -- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
LENA: Yeah.
BARRY: That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
LENA: Yeah.
BARRY: You see?
LENA: Yeah, no, I see --
BARRY: You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
LENA: That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
BARRY: ....yeah....
LENA: So that was your pudding?
BARRY: ....No....
LENA: I'm sorry. I thought you said --
BARRY: No I didn't say that.
LENA: I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
BARRY: My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
LENA: Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
BARRY: I don't remember that, she might be lying. I have to go the bathroom.
MANAGER: Hello.
LENA & BARRY: Hi.
MANAGER: Sir, can I talk to you?
BARRY: Why?
MANAGER: Just have you for one second, please.
MANAGER: Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart.
BARRY: Yeah.
MANAGER: Did you do it?
BARRY: No.
MANAGER: You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
BARRY: No.
MANAGER: Well who did?
BARRY: I don't know.
MANAGER: You're hand is bleeding.
BARRY: I cut myself.
MANAGER: How?
BARRY: On my knife.
MANAGER: Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
BARRY: I didn't do that.
BARRY: Why? ...what?
MANAGER: Your hand is bleeding.
BARRY: I know.
MANAGER: I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
BARRY: Why?
MANAGER: Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
BARRY: I didn't do it.
MANAGER: Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
BARRY: Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
MANAGER: I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
BARRY: Please don't do this to me.
MANAGER: The police are on their way.
BARRY: Sorry.
BARRY: Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
MANAGER: That's fine.
BARRY: Keep the change, please.
BARRY: We should go I think, I don't like it here.
LENA: Ok.
LENA: Is everything ok?
BARRY: Yes.
LENA: What happened?
BARRY: Nothing.
LENA: What did he want?
BARRY: Nothing.
BARRY: I have a better idea of where we can go.
LENA: Ok.
BARRY: There's a better place for us to eat.
LENA: Did something happen; are you alright?
BARRY: Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
LENA: So....how is your harmonium doing?
LENA: Your portable reed organ....the piano.
BARRY: Well, it's fine. Thank you.
LENA: Did you pick it up from the street?
BARRY: What?
LENA: Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
BARRY: ...yes I did...?
LENA: Are you learning how to play it?
BARRY: Yes? I'm trying.
LENA: Oh that's great.
LENA: So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
BARRY: Yes no not really.
BARRY: Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
LENA: ...yeah...
BARRY: It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
LENA: I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
BARRY: Yeah.
LENA: If you come to Hawaii --
BARRY: Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
LENA: You don't think you'll go --
BARRY: I don't know.
LENA: Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
BARRY: Ok. Have a good trip.
RECEPTION WOMAN: Are you Barry?
BARRY: Yes.
RECEPTION WOMAN: It's for you.
BARRY: This is Barry.
LENA (OC): This is Lena.

BARRY: Really?
LENA: Yeah.
BARRY: So what do I do then?
BARRY: That was good.
LENA: Yeah.
BARRY: I'll see you later.
LENA: Ok.
BARRY: I don't freak out very often.
LENA: What do you mean?
BARRY: I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
LENA: ...I don't know what you mean....
BARRY: I don't freak out.
LENA: Ok.
BARRY: Have a good trip.
LENA: Thank you.
DAVID: Hey.
BARRY: Hi.
DAVID: I need to talk to you for a second.
BARRY: What?
DAVID: You gotta give me some money.
DAVID: You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
BARRY: Wait a minute --
DAVID: No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
BARRY: Please don't do this.
DAVID: It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
BARRY: Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
DAVID: How much money do you have in your pockets?
BARRY: Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
BARRY: It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
DAVID: What do you have in the house?
BARRY: Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
DAVID: You have an ATM?
BARRY: Yes.
DAVID: Is this where you live?
BARRY: Yes.
DAVID: You have another house somewhere or something?
BARRY: No.
MIKE D: This is three hundred and twenty. Let's just go to your ATM and that'll be it --
BARRY: I didn't promise her money. She said that it was confidential, this isn't fair --
MIKE D: Shut up, be quiet. Be quiet.
BARRY: -- don't --
DAVID: HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
BARRY: Alright, alright.
BARRY: How do you want to do this?
MIKE D: Let's just go to the corner, we saw a place on the corner, you'll just get your max out and that's it -- you get out what you can and that's it --
DAVID: Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
BARRY: You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
MIKE D: You don't challenge what my brother's saying, you don't say that --
MIKE D: Where the fuck are you going?
BARRY: ...what the hell?
LANCE: What's up?
BARRY: I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
LANCE: What happened?
BARRY: ....I made a call..... (beat) ....and, uh....

WORKER: Telephone on Line One, Barry.
BARRY: Hello?
RHONDA (OC): I need to talk to you about your behavior the other night --
BARRY: (to Lance) Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
LANCE: Where you goin?
BARRY: I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
LANCE: Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
BARRY: Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
LANCE: Ok.
BARRY: Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
LANCE: Ok.
BARRY: I saw the Teriyaki Chicken first and that was $1.79 and then the Soup which made a real deal but then to come across the pudding...it's just tremendous when you think about how most people just don't look...they don't....they're not looking at the fine print, Lance.
BARRY: (to Girl) They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
CHECK OUT GIRL: What is this, man?
BARRY: I'm sorry.
CHECK OUT GIRL: Are you serious with this?
BARRY: Yes. Sorry.
CHECK OUT GIRL: Well....what do you want, then?
BARRY: Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
CHECK OUT GIRL: This is a bunch of bullshit.
BARRY: I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....
BARRY: I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
BARRY: Sorry. I'm sorry, ma'am.

BARRY: I guess they're not open today.
BARRY: That's fine. I think I have enough.
BARRY: I get really sick of myself sometimes.
BARRY: No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
OPERATOR VOICE: It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
BARRY: I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
OPERATOR VOICE: I'm sorry.
BARRY: How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
OPERATOR VOICE: It takes time to process --
BARRY: No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
BARRY: Don't do that. Don't do that. That's not right. Calm down now, please. Please. Ok. Ok. Calm down now please.
BARRY: Ok: the pudding is gonna take six to eight weeks to process so that isn't gonna work for today, I'll just take a bath on that today. Ok. But here's the thing I gotta tell you:
BARRY: ....now: this pudding?
LANCE: Yeah.
BARRY: Let's just figure that out later -- (beat) Ok. I gotta go. I'm just gonna go now and I'll call you from there, you're in charge 'till I get back. And don't tell my sisters anything?
BARRY: I've never been on a plane before.

ELIZABETH: Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
BARRY: ......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
ELIZABETH: No she didn't; that's a lie.
BARRY: I....please don't do this.
ELIZABETH: What? Tell me why you wanna know --
BARRY: I just want to know where she's staying.
ELIZABETH: Tell me why.
BARRY: There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
ELIZABETH: -- what are you talking about, come on --
BARRY: -- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
