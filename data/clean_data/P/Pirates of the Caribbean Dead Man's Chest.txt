ELIZABETH SWANN: I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate.
ELIZABETH SWANN: These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.

CANNIBAL ISLAND: [two spherical cages of six Black Pearl crewmen apiece hang from ropes over a deep chasm]
WILL TURNER: Why would he do this to us? If Jack is their chief.
GIBBS: Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief. But he only remains chief as long as he acts like a chief.
WILL TURNER: So he had no choice. He's a captive then as much as the rest of us.
GIBBS: Worse. as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a god in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy
GIBBS: ?Argh! They'll roast him and eat him.
WILL TURNER: Where's the rest of the crew?
GIBBS: These cages we're in. weren't built 'til after we got here.

JACK SPARROW: Good doggie! ?Doggie.
JACK SPARROW: Alas, my children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost -
JACK SPARROW: .Captain Jack. Sparrow.
GIBBS: Let's put some distance between us and this island, and head out to open sea.
JACK SPARROW: Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.
GIBBS: Uh, that seems a bit contradictory, I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs, now where is that monkey? I want to shoot
JACK SPARROW: I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs, now where is that monkey? I want to shoot
WILL TURNER: JACK SPARROW WILL TURNER
JACK SPARROW: WILL TURNER
WILL TURNER: Elizabeth is in danger.
JACK SPARROW: Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on 'er? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.
WILL TURNER: She is locked up, in a prison, bound to hang for helping you!
JACK SPARROW: There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.
WILL TURNER: I need that Compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom.
JACK SPARROW: Mister Gibbs!

JACK SPARROW: We have a need to travel upriver.
GIBBS: By need, d'you mean a. trifling need, ?uh/?a. fleeting, as in say in a passing No, a. resolute and unyielding need.
JACK SPARROW: No, a. resolute and unyielding need.
WILL TURNER: What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.
JACK SPARROW: William. I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me. to find this.
WILL TURNER: You want me to find this?
JACK SPARROW: No. You want you to find this. Because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save your ?dolly/?dotty belle ol'. what's-her-face.
WILL TURNER: This. is going to save Elizabeth?
JACK SPARROW: How much do you know about Davy Jones?
WILL TURNER: Not much.
JACK SPARROW: Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.
BELLAMY: What's all this? If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share, and wear it one after the other.
BURSAR: It's not like that, Sir. This ship is Is it now? 'N' you?
BELLAMY: Is it now? 'N' you?
QUARTERMASTER: The. female presence. amongst us, yes. all the men. they can feel
BURSAR: I say. that we throw the dress overboard, and we hope the spirit finds it.
QUARTERMASTER: No! That - that will just anger the spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back!
BELLAMY: Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you. Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh. she's probably naked.
WILL TURNER: Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
GIBBS: Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off. And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness. The Kraken!
GIBBS: They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh! Imagine: The last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken, and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. If you believe such things.
WILL TURNER: And the key will spare him that?
GIBBS: Now that's the very question Jack wants answered. Bad enough even to go visit. Tia's shack
WILL TURNER: Tia's shack
GIBBS: Tia's shack
BAYOU: Tia's shack

JACK SPARROW: There'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without
JACK SPARROW: I thought I knew you.
TIA DALMA: Not so well as I had hoped. Come.
JACK SPARROW: TIA DALMA
TIA DALMA: What. service. may I do you? Hmmm?
JACK SPARROW: I brought payment.
JACK SPARROW: [Jack cocks his pistol, shoots the monkey, the bullet has no effect, but the monkey chatters in fright]
JACK SPARROW: An undead monkey! Top that!
GIBBS: No! You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.
TIA DALMA: The payment is fair.
JACK SPARROW: We're looking for this. And what it goes to.
TIA DALMA: The Compass you bartered from me. It cannot lead you to dis?
JACK SPARROW: Maybe. Why?
TIA DALMA: Ayeee. Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants! Or. do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own. Your key go to a chest, and it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it?
GIBBS: What is inside?
PINTEL: Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature?
RAGETTI: Nothing. bad, I hope.

RAGETTI: Dichotomy of good and evil.
JACK SPARROW: A woman.
TIA DALMA: A wo-man. He fell in love.
GIBBS: No-no-no-no, I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.
TIA DALMA: Same story, different versions, and all are true. See, it was a woman, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid. But not enough to cause him to die.
WILL TURNER: What. exactly did he put into the Him heart.
TIA DALMA: Him heart.
RAGETTI: Literally, or figuratively?
PINTEL: He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest! Could he?
TIA DALMA: It was not wort' feeling what. small fleeting joy life brings, and so. he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at all
WILL TURNER: You knew this.
JACK SPARROW: I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do. So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey!
TIA DALMA: Let me see your hand.
GIBBS: Uhhh! The black spot!
JACK SPARROW: My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.
TIA DALMA: I am justMy little ###, where are you? ###
TIA DALMA: Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years. Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow. And so you will carry land wid you.
JACK SPARROW: Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.
TIA DALMA: JACK SPARROW
JACK SPARROW: Is the. jar of dirt going to help?
TIA DALMA: If you don' want it, give it back.
JACK SPARROW: TIA DALMA
TIA DALMA: Den it helps.
WILL TURNER: It seems. we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.
TIA DALMA: A touch. of destiny!
WILL TURNER: That's the Flying Dutchman? She doesn't look like much.
JACK SPARROW: Neither do you. Do not underestimate
GIBBS: Must've run afoul of the reef.
JACK SPARROW: So what's your plan, then?
WILL TURNER: I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.
JACK SPARROW: And if there are crewmen?
WILL TURNER: I cut down anyone in my path.
JACK SPARROW: I like it. Simple, easy to remember.
RAGETTI: Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha, ha-ha-ha, Hey! If you do happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt! Might save your life!

CHAPLAIN: I'll take my chances, Sir.

DAVY JONES: What is your purpose here?
WILL TURNER: Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.
DAVY JONES: Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.
JACK SPARROW: DAVY JONES
DAVY JONES: You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. That was our agreement.
JACK SPARROW: Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied Then you were a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as Captain Jack Sparrow?
DAVY JONES: Then you were a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as Captain Jack Sparrow?
JACK SPARROW: You have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.
DAVY JONES: One soul is not equal to another.
JACK SPARROW: Aha! So we've established my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price.
DAVY JONES: Price? Pttt!
JACK SPARROW: Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?
DAVY JONES: One hundred souls, three days-uh.
JACK SPARROW: You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off.
DAVY JONES: I keep the boy. A good-faith payment. That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!
JACK SPARROW: Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, terrific soprano. Worth at least four. maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention. he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him. would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?
DAVY JONES: I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam it in blood? I mean. mm-mm - ink?
JACK SPARROW: Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal it in blood? I mean. mm-mm - ink?
JACK SPARROW: DAVY JONES
DAVY JONES: Three days. Three days.
JACK SPARROW: Oh, Mr. Gibbs.
GIBBS: JACK SPARROW
JACK SPARROW: Uh, I feel sullied and unusual.
GIBBS: And how do you intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days?
JACK SPARROW: Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.
GIBBS: Ah. Tortuga!
JACK SPARROW: Edinburgh Trader [inside a cabin aboard the Edinburgh Trader, Captain Bellamy is throwing documents down on the table]
BELLAMY: It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing fees, wharf handling, and heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then?
QUARTERMASTER: I'm afraid, Sir. Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters.
BELLAMY: A pirate port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep well each night, thank you.
BURSAR: [they all rush to the window of the cabin and look out] [they all see the dress float by the cabin window, on its second [one crewman gasps] [the men go outside to see the dress that was floating by the [the dress floats like a ghost, its left arm raised as if pointing]
BURSAR: She wants you to. do something.
BELLAMY: She's tryna give a sign.
BELLAMY: Over there! Look for a sign!
QUARTERMASTER: Look there! There it is. There's the That's seaweed.
?BURSAR: That's seaweed.
QUARTERMASTER: S-Seaweed can be a sign.
?BURSAR: Looks like entrails.
ELIZABETH SWANN: What's that over there?
GIBBS: And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?
ELDERLY MAN: Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young.
GIBBS: You'll do. Make your mark. Next!
JILTED MAN: My wife ran off with my dog. And I'm drunk for a month. And I don't give a ass rat's if I live or die.
GIBBS: Perfect! Next!
GIBBS: It's the crow's nest for you.
JACK SPARROW: I know what I want.
GIBBS: ROMANTIC MAN
ROMANTIC MAN: Ever since I was a little lad, I've always wanted to sail the seas. Forever.
GIBBS: Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.
ROMANTIC MAN: Thanks very much.
JACK SPARROW: How we going?
GIBBS: Including those four? That gives us - four!
GIBBS: And what's your story?
NORRINGTON: My story. it's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the Seven Seas. The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life.
GIBBS: No, not anymore, weren't you listening? I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I would have, if not for the. hurricane.
NORRINGTON: No, not anymore, weren't you listening? I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I would have, if not for the. hurricane.
GIBBS: Lord. You didn't try to sail through So do I make your crew, or not? You haven't said where you're going. Somewhere
NORRINGTON: So do I make your crew, or not? You haven't said where you're going. Somewhere
NORRINGTON: So am I worthy to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?
NORRINGTON: Or should I just kill you now?
JACK SPARROW: You're hired.
NORRINGTON: Sorry. Old habits and all that.
JACK SPARROW: Time to go?
GIBBS: [a swordfight is going on] [someone throws a bottle against the wall above the stairs, Jack ducks as it smashes above his head]
JACK SPARROW: Thanks, mate.
JACK SPARROW: Carry on.
NORRINGTON: Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. Come on, who's first?
ELIZABETH SWANN: I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself!
ELIZABETH SWANN: James Norrington. What has the world done to you?
BO'SUN: Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner!
BO'SUN: Step ?to-it/?tight!
WILL TURNER: Step aside!
BO'SUN: [Bootstrap sees that the other man at the rope is his son, Bootstrap is stunned]
BO'SUN: Haul that weevil to his feet!
BO'SUN: Five lashes to remind you. to stay on 'em!
BO'SUN: Impeding me in my duties. You'll share the punishment.
DAVY JONES: Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity?
DAVY JONES: Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous circumstance be this! Five lashes be owed. I believe it is.
DAVY JONES: The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own.
DAVY JONES: [Bootstrap reluctantly takes the whip] [two crewmen tear Will's shirt off, exposing his bare back]
BO'SUN: You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha!
WILL TURNER: I don't need your help!
WILL TURNER: So I'm to understand what you did was an act of compassion?
FLYING DUTCHMAN: below deck
WILL TURNER: I've sworn no oath.
WILL TURNER: Not until I find this. The key.
WYVERN: The deadman's chest.
WILL TURNER: What do you know of this?
WYVERN: Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart, or there'll be no captain. And if there's no captain, there's no one to have the So the captain has the key. Where is the key?
WILL TURNER: So the captain has the key. Where is the key?
WILL TURNER: Where is the key?
WYVERN: WILL TURNER
WILL TURNER: Where is the chest?
WYVERN: [Wyvern closes his eyes, and falls silent] Black Pearl [the Black Pearl is at a dock, loading fruits and livestock]
ELIZABETH SWANN: Captain Sparrow!
JACK SPARROW: Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I'm here to find the man I love.
JACK SPARROW: I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.
JACK SPARROW: Elizabeth. Hide the rum.
JACK SPARROW: You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack. I know Will came to find you. Where is he?
JACK SPARROW: Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but. through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Davy Jones?
NORRINGTON: Oh, please. The captain of the Flying doing here?
JACK SPARROW: You look bloody awful. What are you doing here?
NORRINGTON: You hired me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.
JACK SPARROW: You smell funny.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack. All I want is to find Will.
JACK SPARROW: Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?
ELIZABETH SWANN: JACK SPARROW
JACK SPARROW: Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to save Will the most.
ELIZABETH SWANN: And you have a way of doing that?
JACK SPARROW: Well, there is a chest.
NORRINGTON: Oh, dear.
JACK SPARROW: A chest of unknown size and origin.
PINTEL: What contains the still-beating heart o' Davy Jones.
RAGETTI: Unh-unh. unh-unh. unh-unh.
JACK SPARROW: And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including. saving brave William from his grim fate.
NORRINGTON: You don't actually believe him, do you?
ELIZABETH SWANN: How do we find it?
JACK SPARROW: With this. My Compass. is unique.
NORRINGTON: "Unique" here having the meaning of True enough. This Compass does not point
JACK SPARROW: True enough. This Compass does not point
ELIZABETH SWANN: Where does it point?
JACK SPARROW: It points to the thing you want most in this world.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth?
JACK SPARROW: Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?
ELIZABETH SWANN: To save Will?
JACK SPARROW: By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
JACK SPARROW: Mister Gibbs!
GIBBS: JACK SPARROW
JACK SPARROW: We have our heading.
GIBBS: Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh anchor, and prow that canvas!
JACK SPARROW: Miss Swann.
GIBBS: Welcome to the crew, former Commodore!
PINTEL: Welcome to the crew, former Commodore!
PORT ROYAL: EITC headquarters
MERCER: Most recently seen on the island of Tortuga, then left, in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow. And other fugitives from justice.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: [slow motion scene of falling dice] [three crewman are playing Liar's Dice] [organ music is heard in the background]
MACCUS: I wager. ten years.
?KOLENIKO: I'll match ten years.
GREENBEARD: WILL TURNER
WILL TURNER: I understand.
WILL TURNER: It's a game of deception. Your bet includes all the dice, not just your own.
WILL TURNER: What are they wagering?
WILL TURNER: So any crewman can be challenged?
WILL TURNER: I challenge Davy Jones.
DAVY JONES: I accept ?that-uh.
DAVY JONES: The stakes?
WILL TURNER: My soul. An eternity of servitude.
DAVY JONES: WILL TURNER
WILL TURNER: I want this.
DAVY JONES: How do you know of the key?
WILL TURNER: That's not part of the game, is it? You can still walk away.
DAVY JONES: What's this?
WILL TURNER: No! Don't do this.
DAVY JONES: Four fours.
WILL TURNER: Four fives.
DAVY JONES: Seven fives-uh.
WILL TURNER: Eight fives.
DAVY JONES: Huh huh huh. Welcome to the crew, liar.
DAVY JONES: And be called a liar myself for my trouble? Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship! Master Turner, feel free to go ashore.
WILL TURNER: Fool. Why did you do that?
WILL TURNER: It was never about winning, or losing.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: organ room
FLYING DUTCHMAN: WILL TURNER
WILL TURNER: It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either.
WILL TURNER: They'll know you helped me.
WILL TURNER: I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise.
GIBBS: ELIZABETH SWANN
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.
JACK SPARROW: Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word.
GIBBS: Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word.
JACK SPARROW: Beckett wants the Compass. Only one reason for that.
GIBBS: Beckett wants the Compass. Only one reason for that.
JACK SPARROW: Of course. He wants the chest.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes, he did say something about a chest.
GIBBS: If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea.
JACK SPARROW: A truly discomforting notion, love.
GIBBS: And bad. Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate. I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails. Brace the foreyard!
JACK SPARROW: Might I inquire how as to how you came by these?
ELIZABETH SWANN: JACK SPARROW ELIZABETH SWANN
JACK SPARROW: ELIZABETH SWANN
ELIZABETH SWANN: Decidedly not.
JACK SPARROW: Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack, the Letters, give them back.
JACK SPARROW: No. Persuade me.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You do know Will taught me how handle a sword.
JACK SPARROW: As I said. Persuade me.
NORRINGTON: It's a curious thing. There was a time when I would've given anything for you to look like that while thinking about I don't know what you mean.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I don't know what you mean.
NORRINGTON: Oh, I think you do.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's fiancé ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place?
NORRINGTON: So you never wondered how your latest fiancé ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place?
BELLAMY: Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open waters.
WILL TURNER: Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can.
BELLAMY: And what are we running from? That dress. Where did you get it?
WILL TURNER: That dress. Where did you get it?
BELLAMY: It was found aboard the ship. The crew it thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate.
WILL TURNER: That's foolish.
QUARTERMASTER: Oh, yes. ?Proceededly foolish.
BURSAR: It brought good fortune! The spirit told us. Put in at Tortuga. And we made a nice bit of profit there.
?BELLAMY: Off the books, of course.
WILL TURNER: I imagine. some of your crew may have jumped ship there.
BELLAMY: Why do you ask?
MESSENGER SAILOR: Captain, a ship's been spotted.
BELLAMY: MESSENGER SAILOR
MESSENGER SAILOR: She isn't flyin' any.
BELLAMY: WILL TURNER
WILL TURNER: Or worse.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: [Jones is on deck, having found the cloth that Will swapped for the key]
DAVY JONES: You will watch this.
DAVY JONES: Let no joyful voice be heard! Let no man look up at the sky with hope! And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake. the Kraken!
WILL TURNER: I've doomed us all. It's the Flying
BURSAR: Oh, Mother Cary's chickens. What happened?
?QUARTERMASTER: Must've hit a reef. Free the rudder! Hard to port, then hard to starboard!
?BELLAMY: Free the rudder! Hard to port, then hard to starboard!
FLYING DUTCHMAN: The boy's not here. He must've been claimed by the sea.
MACCUS: The boy's not here. He must've been claimed by the sea.
DAVY JONES: I am the sea.
DAVY JONES: You need time alone with your thoughts.
DAVY JONES: There are no survivors.
DAVY JONES: The chest is no longer safe. Chart a course to Isla Cruces. Get me there first, or there'll be the devil to pay.
KOLENIKO: DAVY JONES
DAVY JONES: Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship? Who told them of the key? Jack
JACK SPARROW: My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I just thought I'd be married by now. I'm so ready to be married.
JACK SPARROW: You know. Lizzy. I am. captain of a ship. And being captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a. marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right.
ELIZABETH SWANN: No, thank you.
JACK SPARROW: Why not? We are very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh. Except for a sense of honor, and decency and-and a moral center. And personal hygiene.
JACK SPARROW: Trifles. You will come over to my side, I know it.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You seem very certain.
JACK SPARROW: One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Why doesn't your Compass work?
JACK SPARROW: Uh my Compass works fine.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Because you and I are alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the right thing.
JACK SPARROW: I love those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You'll have the chance to do something. something courageous. And when you do, you'll discover something: that you're a good man.
JACK SPARROW: All evidence to the contrary.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have faith in you. Want to know why?
JACK SPARROW: Do tell, dearie.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Curiosity. You're going to want it. A chance to be admired. And gain the rewards that follow. You won't be able to resist. You're going to want to know. what it tastes like.
JACK SPARROW: I do want to know what it tastes like.
ELIZABETH SWANN: But - seeing as you're a good man I know you will never put me in a position that would compromise my honor.
ELIZABETH SWANN: I'm proud of you, Jack.
?GIBBS: Land ho!
JACK SPARROW: I want my jar of dirt.
PINTEL: You're pullin' too fast.
RAGETTI: You're pulling too slow. We don't want the Kraken to catch us.
PINTEL: I'm savin' me strength for when it comes. And I don't think it's Krack-en, anyways. I always heard it said Kray-kin.
RAGETTI: What, with a long A?
PINTEL: No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Krock-en's how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and Krack-en's closer to that.
RAGETTI: No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Krock-en's how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and Krack-en's closer to that.
PINTEL: Well we ain't original Scandinavians, are we? Kray-ken!
RAGETTI: It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants.
ISLA CRUCES: [their longboat arrives at the beach, Jack disembarks and begins to walk off]
JACK SPARROW: Guard the boat, mind the tide. Don't touch my dirt.
ELIZABETH SWANN: This doesn't work. And it certainly doesn't show you what you want most.
JACK SPARROW: Yes it does. You're sitting on it!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Beg your pardon?
JACK SPARROW: [they start digging under where Elizabeth was sitting] [Pintel and Ragetti are by the boat, clowning around, Ragetti is balancing a shovel on one hand]
PINTEL: "Mind the tide."
RAGETTI: I ?can/?may join the circus!
PINTEL: ?Don't ?mind ?if I shine your shoes, They're here. And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade.
FLYING DUTCHMAN: [Jones is watching Pintel and Ragetti on the beach through a
DAVY JONES: They're here. And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade.
MACCUS: Then trust us to act in your stead.
DAVY JONES: I'll trust you know what awaits should you fail! Down, then!
MACCUS: [view from the deck of the Flying Dutchman as it submerges, some underwater footage]
ISLA CRUCES: [Norrington is digging in the sand, Jack sits in a lotus position nearby on a sandy slope]
ELIZABETH SWANN: It's real!
NORRINGTON: You actually were telling the truth.
JACK SPARROW: I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.
WILL TURNER: With good reason! Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came to find you!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came to find you!
JACK SPARROW: How did you get here?
WILL TURNER: Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped to my feet.
JACK SPARROW: Not so easy, is it?
WILL TURNER: But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
JACK SPARROW: You do?
WILL TURNER: After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones.
ELIZABETH SWANN: JACK SPARROW WILL TURNER
JACK SPARROW: WILL TURNER
WILL TURNER: I was reunited with my father.
JACK SPARROW: Oh! Well. you're welcome, then.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Everything you said to me. every word, was a lie!
JACK SPARROW: Pretty much. Time and tide, love.
JACK SPARROW: Oy! What're you doing?
WILL TURNER: I'm gonna kill Jones.
JACK SPARROW: Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key.
WILL TURNER: I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.
NORRINGTON: I can't let you do that, either. So
JACK SPARROW: I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
NORRINGTON: Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, and get my life back.
JACK SPARROW: Ah. The dark side of ambition.
NORRINGTON: Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Stop it!
ELIZABETH SWANN: WILL TURNER
WILL TURNER: Guard the chest!
ELIZABETH SWANN: [duel resumes]
ELIZABETH SWANN: This is bar-baric! This is no way for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! Let's just - pull out our swords and start banging away at each other! This will solve everything! I've had it! I've had enough! Wobbly-legged, rum-soaked. pirates!
PINTEL: How'd this go all screwy?
RAGETTI: Well, each wants the chest for hisself, don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there - I figure 'e's tryna. settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father.
PINTEL: Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n a shiny penny.
RAGETTI: Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.
PINTEL: If we was any kind of decent, we'd remove temptation from their path.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will! Enough!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh! Oh.! The heat!
NORRINGTON: By your leave, Mister Turner.
ISLA CRUCES: [Jack and Norrington run through bushes on the beach, then up to a dilapidated stone church on the hill] [P2]
WILL TURNER: By your leave, Mister Norrington.
NORRINGTON: Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
WILL TURNER: Be my guest.
JACK SPARROW: Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to free said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, really, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
NORRINGTON: [Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to [Norrington and Will resume their part of the rooftop duel]
NORRINGTON: Unfortunately, Mister Turner. He's
JACK SPARROW: Still rooting for you, mate!
JACK SPARROW: [Jack stands up in the bottom of the hole]
JACK SPARROW: [Norrington backs Will onto the top of the mill's waterwheel]
JACK SPARROW: [the key that Jack had around his neck falls off into the wheel]
PINTEL: 'Ello, Poppet.
ELIZABETH SWANN: [a sword is thrown to Elizabeth, just in time]
PINTEL: [a sword is thrown to Pintel, just in time]
RAGETTI: [a sword is thrown to Ragetti, just in time] [Jack sees Hadrus running alone through the palms, carrying the small chest]
HADRUS: Aya! Uh ?seech! Aunido! Aunido! Follow my voice! Follow my voice! To the left, uh. No, to the right. Go to the
HADRUS: No. That's a tree.
JACK SPARROW: Oh, shut it.
ISLA CRUCES: [Jack is the first to arrive back at the longboat on the beach]
JACK SPARROW: Jar of dirt!
WILL TURNER: [Pintel & Ragetti attempt to escape by longboat, but Will blocks their progress]
PINTEL: Come on, Turner!
JACK SPARROW: Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.
ELIZABETH SWANN: We're not getting out of this.
NORRINGTON: Not with the chest. Into the boat.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You're mad.
NORRINGTON: Don't wait for me.
JACK SPARROW: Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
PINTEL: [the remaining Black Pearl crew escape by longboat] [Hadrus is holding his conch shell head under one arm, the head speaks to Norrington]
HADRUS: Your bravery is wasted. I shall pry the chest away from your cold. dead.
NORRINGTON: Here you go!
HADRUS: [Norrington flees, Hadrus drops his head onto the ground when catching the chest]
HADRUS: Uh! ?Ando! Aunido! Aunido! Pirates!
HADRUS: ?Vengo ?kowmpenay ?lachay. Hey! ?Hovaya!
WILL TURNER: What happened to the chest?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Norrington took it to draw them off.
PINTEL: You're pulling too hard!
RAGETTI: You're not pulling hard enough!
GIBBS: Where's the Commodore?
JACK SPARROW: He fell behind.
GIBBS: My prayers be with him. Best not wallow in our grief. The bright side is: You're back. And made it off free and clear.
GIBBS: Lord almighty.?us.
JACK SPARROW: I'll handle this, mate.
JACK SPARROW: Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey?
JACK SPARROW: Got it!
JACK SPARROW: Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git? Look what I got. I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it?
DAVY JONES: [the Flying Dutchman's cannon covers slide down, cannons emerge from the holes]
JACK SPARROW: Hard to starboard.
ELIZABETH SWANN: Hard to starboard!
WILL TURNER: Brace up the foreyard!
GIBBS: Hard to starboard!
DAVY JONES: Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths!
?PINTEL: She's on us! She's on us!
DAVY JONES: Let them taste the triple guns.
ELIZABETH SWANN: She's falling behind!
GIBBS: Aye, and we've got her!
WILL TURNER: We're the faster?
GIBBS: Against the wind the Dutchman beats us. That's how she takes her prey. But with the wind.
WILL TURNER: We rob her advantage.

BLACK PEARL: They're giving up! Yay!
?MARTY: They're giving up! Yay!
WILL TURNER: My father is on that ship. If we can outrun her, we can take her. We should turn and fight.
JACK SPARROW: Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs. is the proper leverage.
JACK SPARROW: Where is it? Where is the thump-thump?
WILL TURNER: No. It's not a reef! Get away from the What is it?
ELIZABETH SWANN: What is it?
WILL TURNER: The Kraken. To arms!

WILL TURNER: Hold. Hold.
PINTEL: I think we've held fire long enough.
ELIZABETH SWANN: WILL TURNER
WILL TURNER: [the crew fire the cannons, hitting the tentacles and nearly severing some]
WILL TURNER: It'll be back. We have to get off the There's no boats.
ELIZABETH SWANN: There's no boats.
WILL TURNER: Pull the grates! Get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold.
WILL TURNER: Whatever you do, don't miss.
ELIZABETH SWANN: As soon as you're clear.
GIBBS: There's only half a dozen kegs of powder!
WILL TURNER: Then load the rum!
GIBBS: Aye! The rum, too!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Step to!
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh you coward!
MARTY: Not good.
WILL TURNER: ?Pull ?away!
GIBBS: Heave! Heave like you're being paid for it!
WILL TURNER: Euh! Come on!I'm over here! Come
WILL TURNER: Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!
MARTY: Did we kill it?
GIBBS: No. We just made it angry. We're not out of this yet. Captain! Orders!
JACK SPARROW: Abandon ship. Into the longboat.
GIBBS: Jack! The Pearl!
JACK SPARROW: She's only a ship, mate.
ELIZABETH SWANN: He's right, we have to head for land.
PINTEL: 'S a lot o' open wa'er.
RAGETTI: That's a lot o' wa'er.
WILL TURNER: We have to try. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl.
GIBBS: Abandon ship. Abandon ship or abandon
ELIZABETH SWANN: Thank you, Jack.
JACK SPARROW: We're not free yet, love.
ELIZABETH SWANN: You came back. I always knew you were a good man.
GIBBS: Prepare to cast off! There's no time to lose! Come on, Will, step to!
ELIZABETH SWANN: It's after you, not the ship. It's not us. This is the only way, don't you see? I'm not sorry.
JACK SPARROW: [Elizabeth leaves Jack and climbs down into the long boat]
WILL TURNER: Where's Jack?
ELIZABETH SWANN: He elected to stay behind to give us a chance.
ELIZABETH SWANN: [the longboat casts off] [Jack struggles with his manacles]
JACK SPARROW: Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger,

RAGETTI: Never another like Captain Jack.
