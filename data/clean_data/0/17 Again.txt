JANITOR: Adolescence can be so cruel.
MIKE: What are you talking about?

JANITOR: `For of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: `It might have been.'
MIKE: That'll be my epitaph.
JANITOR: We all have regrets.
MIKE: Why's it have to be that way?
JANITOR: Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. Can't hurt to ask. You never know who's listening, Michael.
MIKE: How did you know.
MIKE: Hey, Guys. I was just talking to-
ALEX: Why are you limping?
MIKE: Tweaked my back pumping iron. Really, really heavy iron.

MAGGIE: You wouldn't understand.
MIKE: Try me.
MAGGIE: I have a lot of emotional stress right now. My friends are all going to different schools, I'm not even sure.

MIKE: Doesn't he live 30 miles from here?
SCARLET: What's your point?
MIKE: Come on. He's been after you since 10th grade and he's after you now.

MIKE: `Mouth is alive, with juices like wine, and I'm hungry like the wolf'
SCARLET: You no longer have the right to invoke the "wolf."
MIKE: Why are you destroying the yard?
SCARLET: I'm gonna use it as a showpiece for clients. Thanks for asking.
MIKE: Kind of a big undertaking isn't it?
SCARLET: I am a landscape designer. Then again you barely took an interest in my work so I guess that's a fair
MIKE: I didn't get it.
SCARLET: I'm sorry. But maybe this is what you needed. Maybe it's time you looked for something else?
MIKE: That's a great idea, Scar. Because there are so many options out there for a 36 year old with only a high school diploma.
SCARLET: And it's all my fault, isn't it?
MIKE: I didn't say that.
SCARLET: No, but it's what you think, right?
MIKE: But I did.
SCARLET: I'm sorry you're not happy with the way your life turned out Mike, really, I am, but you're not the victim here.

MIKE: He doesn't exist. Nothing makes Did he ask you for your soul?
ED: Did he ask you for your soul?
MIKE: That's a good sign. We can eliminate Satan. I think what we're dealing with here is a spell of enlightenment. "Spell affect"."casting procedure".yada, yada, yada. Basically it's a learning spell. There's something you need to figure out and until you do you'll stay a kid. My guess is that janitor was probably a war.

ED: My son? Mark! Get in here! Now!
MIKE: Ed throws his hands up in exasperation.
ED: See? The boy's out of control. He's acting up at home. He won't eat his vegetables-

MAGGIE: Sex? No, that's why he dumped me!
MIKE: There, there now. It's okay.
MAGGIE: Sure he was a jerk but he was there for me. Which is more than I can say for any other man in my life.
MIKE: When you're young everything seems like the end of the world. But it's not. It's just the beginning. And you might have to meet a few more jerks, but one day you'll meet a boy who treats you the way you deserve to be treated.like the sun rises and sets with you.
MAGGIE: You really think so?
MIKE: I know so.
MAGGIE: You're so sweet.

MIKE: Maggie, listen to me. I'm not the person you think.
MAGGIE: Shhh. Yes, you are. You're a good guy. You're not like the others.
MIKE: That's right! I'm not like the others. I'm very different than the others. So different that you and I can never be.

DOM: Let's do it.
MIKE: Don't you lay a finger on her, Johnson! I know where you live!
ALEX: It's weird to think about my mom with someone other than my dad.
MIKE: It's adultery! If this were Afghanistan she'd be dragged through the village by goats. You need to talk to her.
ALEX: My mom's been pretty sad the past few months. She deserves to be happy. My dad obviously is.wherever he is.
MIKE: Maybe he's not? Maybe he wishes he could be here right now with you but there's a real good reason he can't be.
ALEX: No, my dad's not a family guy. This is dumb but I used to tell him I was on the basketball team because I knew he'd never make it to a Then why would you tell him that?
MIKE: Then why would you tell him that?
ALEX: I guess I was hoping it would make him like me more.
MIKE: My wife's moving on. My son doesn't think I like him and my daughter's in love with me. I need to change back, Ed.
ED: What about college?
MIKE: I'm not going. I'll be a pharm rep til I die. I just want my family You're not gonna wear that, are

SALESMAN: Sir! Please!
ED: This isn't over.son!
MIKE: Not even close.Dad!

HOSTESS: There you are, Mr. Freedman.
ED: Thanks. Put this towards your
JULIE: When you asked me to get together to talk about Mark this isn't what I envisioned. This isn't a date, Are you insinuating that I'd use my son's misfortune just to go out with you? What kind of a father do you think I am?
ED: Are you insinuating that I'd use my son's misfortune just to go out with you? What kind of a father do you think I am?
JULIE: As long as we're on the same page.
WAITER: Good evening. Would you care to see the wine-
ED: Bring us the 1962 Petrus.
JULIE: I don't drink. So tell me what you think's going on with Mark?
ED: It's baffling really but I noticed he's been drinking a lot of diet ice tea lately. Maybe he's gay?
JULIE: You didn't ask me here to talk about Mark, did you?
ED: Do you like caviar? Because if you do you have to try the Almas. 100 year-old Beluga. $700 per ounce.
JULIE: You're disgusting, Ed.
ED: What? You don't like Beluga? You can get something else.
JULIE: I'm not some 22 year-old who you can impress with caviar and expensive wine.
ED: Would the caviar and expensive wine impress you if you were on a yacht off Monte Carlo?
JULIE: I came here because I'm concerned about the wellbeing of your son but you don't care about Mark. All you're concerned with is proving to me how wealthy you are.
ED: I do care about Mike.Mark. Whatever his name is.
JULIE: You know what's too bad, Ed? I'm sure when you were the guy the boys picked on and the girls ignored you were really sweet.
ED: Wait. You're right. I'm acting like an idiot. I'm sorry. Please
JULIE: Act normal or I'm leaving.
MIKE: I had the craziest dream. I was 17 again and back in high school. It was horrible, Scarlet-

ALEX: Mike, I blew it! I totally blew Blew what? What happened?
MIKE: Blew what? What happened?
ALEX: She wanted me to kiss her but I panicked. I didn't know if I should close my eyes or which way to turn my head or how much tongue I'm supposed to use-
MIKE: Slow down. Have you ever kissed a girl before?
ALEX: Not a real one. I used to practice on my dad's Playboys.
MIKE: How did you find.forget it. It's easy. All you have to do is take her face in your hands gently like
BOY: That is so wrong.
ALEX: What if I, you know, pitch a tent?
MIKE: If you feel it, you know, getting angry, take a step back. Now go get that kiss.
ALEX: Nicole stands-
NICOLE: I'm sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to-

SCARLET: He's like a totally different
MIKE: Believe me, I do. He's a great kid. And you're an amazing mother.
SCARLET: I'm not so sure. I mean look at me. I showed up at a party to drag my son home. Could I be any more embarrassing? And how many amazing mothers run their kids' father off?
MIKE: Hey, you didn't run him off. Don't blame yourself for his stupidity.
SCARLET: I knew he was unhappy. I knew he hated his job. I should've been more supportive, more sympathetic to what he was going through. He gave up a lot for me.
MIKE: That's bull shit! You, Maggie and Alex are the best thing that ever happened to me.him. He was just too selfish to recognize it. At least, that's how I see it.
