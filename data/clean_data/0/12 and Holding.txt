JACOB: You see `em?
RUDY: No. But that doesn't mean they're not here.
JACOB: What the hell is that?
RUDY: Rudy dumps the piss onto Jeff and Kenny.
KENNY: You and your deformed brother are
RUDY: ( calling to Kenny ) Anytime you're ready, dickhead.
KENNY: They're fucking dead!
MALEE: Mom, I need help.
MALEE: Move it, people. Outta my way!
LEONARD: ( mouthful ) You're late.
MALEE: Yeah well, I began menstruating this morning, and I had some difficulty inserting the tampon. What? It's a natural process. You know, I could conceive, carry and birth a child right now.
LEONARD: Big deal. You won't.
MALEE: But I could. That's what matters.
LEONARD: The twins said, they'd meet us at the spot.
MALEE: Wanna race?
LEONARD: Nah, I'm good.
JACOB: Maybe I should have mom look at it.
RUDY: If you didn't have that damn mask on, you'd have seen it coming. Our birthday comes once a year, and you ask for a hockey mask. You don't even play.
JACOB: Jason from "Friday the 13th" wears one. He's bad ass.
RUDY: Exactly. Jason wouldn't run home `cause of a little blood. He'd get back up, decapitate his victim and move on.
JACOB: You think Jeff and Kenny will come I dropped piss on their heads. I'd say the odds are pretty good.
RUDY: I dropped piss on their heads. I'd say the odds are pretty good.
RUDY: Jeff and Kenny were here. I dumped the piss I've been saving on their Why were you saving piss?
LEONARD: Why were you saving piss?
RUDY: Just incase. Pretty smart, huh?
JACOB: No, it's stupid cause now they're gonna come back here and kick all our asses.
RUDY: Don't be such a pussy.
LEONARD: Yeah, I could probably take them both myself.
RUDY: What are you gonna do, Leonard, eat All I'm saying is, who cares if they tear it down.
JACOB: All I'm saying is, who cares if they tear it down.
RUDY: This is OUR place. We've been coming here since we were seven.
JACOB: Nothing lasts forever.
RUDY: You're such a butt-munch.
MALEE: You guys, it's your birthday. Could you try and get along?
DEBBIE: I don't think therapy is helping.
YACCO: Why do you say that? Are you still
DEBBIE: It feels much better than it looks.
MALEE: Ma, I. Oops.
YACCO: Malee, out. Now.
MALEE: I'm sorry.
YACCO: Excuse me for a moment.
YACCO: I told you a 100 times to knock.
MALEE: I said, I was sorry.
YACCO: Why aren't you with the boys?
MALEE: Rudy and Jacob went for pizza with their parents.
YACCO: I found this in the backseat of my car this morning. Do you know how much flutes cost? Go outside, sit on the front steps and practice.
MALEE: But, mom.
YACCO: Angered, Malee grabs the flute and exits.
MALEE: Keep it moving. This ain't a show.
JIM: Okay, you got your small gifts this morning. Now for the big ones.
ASHLEY: This one is Rudy's.
RUDY: Sony play station! Oh my God! Oh my God! Yes! Too cool!
JIM: Since neither of you wanted a party this year, we were able to splurge.
JACOB: What is it?
ASHLEY: Only one way to find out.
JIM: Go ahead, read it.
JACOB: "Plastic Surgery. Isn't it about I don't get it.
ASHLEY: Your father and I are going to pay to have your birthmark removed.
JIM: Isn't that great.
JACOB: You got me surgery for my birthday?
JIM: Not just one. A series of them.
RUDY: ( overcompensating ) It's not "cool". It totally sucks!
JACOB: It's not "cool". It totally sucks!
JIM: INT. TWIN'S HOUSE - BOY'S BEDROOM - LATER Rudy enters the darkened room and crosses over to Jacob, who has his face planted in his pillow. Jacob has been crying.
RUDY: Don't sweat it. You can borrow my play station anytime you want.
JACOB: This isn't about the play station. It's about this thing on my face. Everybody hates it.
RUDY: I don't.
JACOB: Who cares what you think? You're the reason for all of this. Perfect you with your perfect skin. There to show the world what I'm supposed to look like. You know, sometimes I just wish I wasn't your twin.
RUDY: Screw you! Know what, I take it back, you can't use my play
GABE: 30 acres.
JIM: I already told you, Gabe, I'm not selling that land. Not 30 acres not five.
GABE: I'm willing to pay top dollar.
JIM: I'm not gonna let you tear down those woods, so you can stack twenty houses right on top of each I'm gonna write down a number.
GABE: I'm gonna write down a number.
JIM: No! My kids. hell, your kids play in those woods all the time. You can't put a price on that.
GABE: I believe I can.
PATRICK: Good eating, huh son?
LEONARD: Maybe you shouldn't have seconds, Dad, you know?
PATRICK: Who are you, Richard Simmons? C'mon, enjoy the day.
KENNY: ( o.s. ) Me and Jeff are gonna pay that tree house of yours a little visit
RUDY: Why don't you take your smelly ass back to the trailer park?
KENNY: Free country, asshole.
RUDY: You got nothing better to do than pick on us all the time?
KENNY: I did until yesterday.
RUDY: I thought you liked "golden showers". Oh no, that was your
KENNY: I'll finish this tonight!
RUDY: Kenny showed up. He said, Jeff and him are gonna tear the treehouse down tonight. We gotta sneak out and stop them.
JACOB: Mom and Dad would kill us.
RUDY: We can't let him tear it down.
JACOB: It's just a treehouse.
RUDY: No, it's not! You know what, you suck. I'm going. Leonard, you in?
JACOB: You don't have to go if you don't want to.
RUDY: Don't listen to him. He's a pussy.
LEONARD: I'll go.
RUDY: Finally, someone with balls.
JACOB: Unless you're coming with me, I don't want to hear it.
RUDY: Unless you're coming with me, I don't want to hear it.
JACOB: Jeff and Kenny pick on you all the time, and you don't do shit.
RUDY: Jeff and Kenny pick on you all the time, and you don't do shit.
JACOB: It's my problem.
RUDY: No, it's mine too. Cause we're brothers. That's what brothers do. They fight for each other, kill for each other, die for each other.
JACOB: I don't feel that way.
RUDY: Cause you're a pussy. So stay home, keep your head under the blankets. I'm gonna fight.
LEONARD: ( re: snack cakes ) Some provisions.
RUDY: We're only gonna be here a couple of hours.
LEONARD: When two o'clock rolls around, you'll be begging for one of these.
RUDY: Moron, the bat is for Jeff and Kenny. You know, to scare them a
LEONARD: I'm wide awake. I could stay up all night.
LEONARD: Oh, shit.
RUDY: What. What is it? They here?
LEONARD: Leonard rises, picks up his bag and opens the TRAP DOOR in the floor. He is about to exit.
RUDY: Where you going?
LEONARD: They're not gonna show up, I'm goin' home. It's three o'clock-
KENNY: Now yours. And aim for the window.
JEFF: You hear that?
RUDY: Put it out! Put it out!
JEFF: They're in there! They're in
KENNY: Wake up! Wake up, kid!
JIM: Ashley? What is it?
ASHLEY: I forgot to deposit your paycheck last week.
JIM: But I already wrote some checks.
ASHLEY: I know. With the cookout and everything, I forgot. I'll deposit it tomorrow. The holiday should buy us an extra day.
JIM: Write yourself a note so you don't forget again.
ASHLEY: I just did.
PRIEST: Rest in piece, Rudolph Eugene Carges. May God hold you in the palm of his hand.
GUS: Friend or family?
MALEE: The person who died.
GUS: The person who died.
MALEE: I'm sorry. You'll like Dr. Chung. This is only my second session, but she's good.
GUS: I'm sorry. You'll like Dr. Chung. This is only my second session, but she's good.
MALEE: I'm not a patient. I'm her
GUS: Oh. I can see the resemblance.
MALEE: Are you trying to make me sick?
YACCO: Mr. Maitland?
MALEE: It was a funeral, Mom. How do you think it was?
YACCO: I'm sorry I couldn't make it. Let Rudy's parents know I'm available if they need to talk. I won't charge for the sessions.
MALEE: I know it's okay to cry. I don't need you to tell me, it's okay to cry. If I want to cry, I'll cry.
YACCO: Yacco re-enters her office. A beat.
MOTHER: Ashley, there's more than enough food here.
ASHLEY: No, Rudy loved my deviled eggs. It's right that I make them. Where's the paprika?
ASHLEY: Maybe I threw it out.
ASHLEY: It's okay.
GRACE: This hospital is a nightmare. The elevator is never there when you need it.
PATRICK: Where are the girls?
GRACE: Haley took Sara up to the maternity
LEONARD: My head hurts.
GRACE: You're lucky you didn't get killed.
LEONARD: I told you, I'm sorry.
GRACE: You try being awakened at four o'clock in the morning by the police saying, they have your son, he's unconscious and on his way to the hospital. I've never been so scared in my life. And poor Rudy.
LEONARD: My best friend is dead!
GRACE: Eat this. It'll make you feel I'm not hungry. Besides, I can't taste anything anyway.
LEONARD: I'm not hungry. Besides, I can't taste anything anyway.
GRACE: Hospital food is always bland. This has flavor.
LEONARD: No, it's because of my condition. I can't taste or smell anything What are you saying, condition? What condition?
GRACE: What are you saying, condition? What condition?
LEONARD: ( shrugs ) My condition.
DOCTOR: Leonard has a condition. It's called Anosmia.
GRACE: Oh my God! Is it serious?
DOCTOR: No. Anosmia is when a person looses their sense of smell. It's not uncommon in patients who suffer serious head injuries. Unfortunately, it's also affecting his ability to taste. Again, not Is it permanent?
PATRICK: Is it permanent?
DOCTOR: Depends on the patient.
GRACE: What do we do? He can't eat.
DOCTOR: He can eat. He just can't taste what he's eating.
PATRICK: What she means is, he won't eat.
DOCTOR: Leonard's association with food is no longer about taste. It's about texture. While we may be partial to sweet or salty foods, Leonard will become partial to crunchy or smooth ones. Once he settles on a texture he likes, his appetite will I can't believe this is happening.
GRACE: I can't believe this is happening.
DOCTOR: Considering what Leonard could have suffered, he's lucky. Besides, he is severely overweight. A loss of appetite may be a benefit.
NURSE: How'd we do?
LEONARD: This stuff feels like shit in my It's macaroni and cheese.
NURSE: It's macaroni and cheese.
LEONARD: It feels gross. Like there's a film on my tongue.
NURSE: So, you can't taste it, right? Maybe you'll like the crunch.
GABE: I'm leaving, Jim. Again, so sorry.
JIM: Gabe, are you still interested in buying the land? Because I accept your offer.
GABE: This is hardly the time to talk Buy the woods, Gabe, please. Tear them down and build. Build houses, condos, a 7-11, I don't care. I just don't want to recognize it ever again.
JIM: Buy the woods, Gabe, please. Tear them down and build. Build houses, condos, a 7-11, I don't care. I just don't want to recognize it ever again.
LEONARD: You holding up alright, Jacob?
JACOB: Jeff and Kenny were the ones that started the fire. It was their fault. Or maybe mine. I should of been there.
MALEE: You wouldn't have been able to do anything. And it could have been you who died.
JACOB: I wish it was. You know the last thing Rudy said to me? He said, I can't be a pussy all my life. He was right, I am. And Rudy might be dead because of it.
MALEE: Don't say that. Why don't you talk to your parents about this?
JACOB: They can't help me.
MALEE: Give them time. It'll get better.
JACOB: What if it doesn't? My dad hasn't gone back to work yet. What if he loses his job. We could lose our house. I could be homeless.
MALEE: Then you'll stay with me.
LEONARD: Or me.
JACOB: We're best friends. We.
MALEE: Oh my God.
JACOB: That guy. I like know him. He's one of my mother's patients.
MALEE: That guy. I like know him. He's one of my mother's patients.
LEONARD: I've never seen a patient of hers actually out and about. Should we go over and say "hi"?
MALEE: I've never seen a patient of hers actually out and about. Should we go over and say "hi"?
JACOB: I just want to get out of here.
LEONARD: You coming, Malee?
LEONARD: Are we having company?
GRACE: No, this is all for you. Your favorites; fried chicken, spaghetti, pizza, french fries, and chocolate cheesecake for dessert. I made everything extra spicy, so you can taste it.
LEONARD: Ma, it doesn't matter how spicy the food is.
GRACE: So you're not even gonna try it?
LEONARD: I'm sure it's delicious.
GRACE: Forget it. Don't eat.
LEONARD: Why not?
GRACE: ( beat, searching ) It's unhealthy.
TEACHER: Tommy Wallace.
TOMMY: He's not in this class anymore.
TEACHER: How do you know?
JACOB: Cause he's dead.
TEACHER: I realize being new at this school puts me at a disadvantage, but joking about a fellow classmate's death is anything but funny, Mr..
JACOB: I'm his brother. Was. And I'm not joking. He's dead.
TEACHER: I'm so sorry. Wow, this is awkward. Would you like the seat left empty?
JACOB: In memory.
TEACHER: In memory.
COACH: Alright, ladies, welcome to gym. We will be starting things off this year with the United States Standardized Fitness Test.
LEONARD: That was as far as I could pull myself up.
COACH: Ten seconds. You need forty to
COACH: 23 minutes.
LEONARD: Not bad.
COACH: The goal was 8.
LEONARD: You don't like football?
COACH: You don't like football?
LEONARD: I love it. It's just I'll never make the weight requirement. Pop Warner league wouldn't let me play for five years because of it.
COACH: There's no weight requirement in high school ball, son.
LEONARD: One is on nutrition, the other exercise. You do what they say, and you can play for me once you get to high school.
COACH: One is on nutrition, the other exercise. You do what they say, and you can play for me once you get to high school.
LEONARD: Leonard begins walking back to the gym. After a few steps, he stops and turns back.
COACH: Because I've never seen a child so out of shape in my life.
MR FARMER: ( annoyed ) Did anyone practice over the
MR. FARMER: Great. Well, we still have a fall recital coming up. If anyone would like to perform a solo, sign up on the sheet outside my office. Class
ASHLEY: No, they're wrong. Call them back.
JIM: Ashley, I talked to the lawyer. He wouldn't lie.
JACOB: What's going on?
ASHLEY: This is all your fault.
JIM: If we had gone to the hearings like I said, this wouldn't be happening.
ASHLEY: If we had gone to the hearings like I said, this wouldn't be happening.
JIM: We agreed it would be too painful.
ASHLEY: You agreed.
JACOB: Mom, what happened?
ASHLEY: Tell him. Tell your son.
JIM: The boys who killed Rudy cut a deal. They got a year in juvinile hall and five years probation.
ASHLEY: A year. That's what your brother's life is worth. A damn year!
JIM: Ashley, calm down!
ASHLEY: How can you be so unaffected by this! How? Our son was murdered!
JIM: ( measured ) It was an accident, and the boys are juveniles.
ASHLEY: So that makes it okay?
GUS: Dr. Chung's daughter.
MALEE: You remembered. We were never introduced. My name is Malee.
GUS: They shake hands.
MALEE: I was in the mood for a picnic. I thought this would be a nice place to have one.
MALEE: Would you like to join me? There's plenty of food.
GUS: I don't go to lunch for another ten I'll wait. Meet me by the cement mixer when you're ready.
MALEE: I'll wait. Meet me by the cement mixer when you're ready.
GUS: The last time I saw you, you had just come from a funeral. How are you doing?
MALEE: Okay. Death is like so weird. I mean, it's sad, but I also feel like I've been given this sign. A sign which is telling me, life is short, so you gotta do what makes you happy. You gotta take chances. You gotta get crazy.
GUS: What are you doing to "get crazy"?
MALEE: I play the flute.
GUS: ( laughs ) Yeah, that's totally nuts.
MALEE: No, not that. See, every year my school has this recital. I've always been too scared to play a solo in front of people, but this year I've decided to do it.
GUS: Good for you. When is it?
MALEE: Why do you care?
GUS: Cause I'm gonna go.
MALEE: What? You can't go! Nobody goes to these things. I don't even think my mom is going.
GUS: You gotta have somebody rooting for ya. Besides, I like music, and I owe you for bringing me lunch.
MALEE: ( laughs, embarrassed ) Okay. Tuesday at 8:30 in the junior high school auditorium.
GUS: I'll be there.
MALEE: ( vulnerable ) Don't say it if you don't mean it.
GUS: I'll be there. Front row.
LEONARD: I can't believe how much you suck at this game.
JACOB: The boys sit in silence for a beat.
LEONARD: You wanna shoot some hoops?
JACOB: ( beat ) The sentencing thing totally upset my mom. She was up half the night,
LEONARD: I can't believe it either. A year ain't shit! Rudy is dead forever.
JACOB: I want them dead. I want to kill them. I could handle a year in Juvy hall.
MALEE: Whoa, what those guys did was an accident. If you were to kill them, it's premedicated. You'd get 20 years to life at least.
JACOB: So I'm just supposed to sit here and take it? Be like you guys.
LEONARD: What is that supposed to mean?
JACOB: You seem to have gone on with life pretty easily. Don't you miss him? Don't you care?
MALEE: It's not that we don't care. It's Life goes on.
JACOB: Life goes on.
MALEE: It does. You have to deal with it. If you don't, it could like eat you alive forever. 90 percent of people's problems is due to their inability to get over the past.
LEONARD: How do you know?
MALEE: My mom tells that to all her patients. I've eavesdropped on some of her therapy sessions.
LEONARD: That's awesome. Can I listen in No. Anyway, she says, if a person wants closure, they gotta deal with their problems head on. Go see these guys and let them know how you feel.
MALEE: No. Anyway, she says, if a person wants closure, they gotta deal with their problems head on. Go see these guys and let them know how you feel.
JACOB: I don't think my parents would be up for that.
MALEE: Go alone. Juvy hall is only like forty minutes from here. Take the
JACOB: Bye, Dad.
JACOB: Where's Jeff?
KENNY: He's sick. I think he.
JACOB: ( interrupting ) I hate you. You know that? You Rudy knew we were going to be there. He never should have come. You want the truth, all this happened cause of you.
KENNY: Rudy knew we were going to be there. He never should have come. You want the truth, all this happened cause of you.
JACOB: Yeah, you deformed retard! The only reason we started picking on you guys in the first place was because of that thing on your face.
KENNY: Yeah, you deformed retard! The only reason we started picking on you guys in the first place was because of that thing on your face.
JACOB: Every night, I lie in bed and plan your murder.
KENNY: I'm shaking.
JACOB: First I'm going to take a kitchen knife and chop off your fingers then your nose then your tongue. Then I'm gonna poke out your eyes with the end of a broomstick. Well, not really poke them out, but I'm gonna push them back into your brain. Then I'm gonna take scissors and cut off your ears. When they find you, it's gonna be like putting a jigsaw puzzle back
KENNY: If you kill me, you come here.
JACOB: So? What do I have to look forward to? You've already destroyed my What happened was an accident.
KENNY: What happened was an accident.
JACOB: There are no accidents. You're gonna pay for what you did. And it's gonna hurt like hell.
GRACE: What the hell is this?
LEONARD: I'm reading the list of ingredients in our foods.
GRACE: Research. Do you know the damage these chemicals can do to the human Leonard, put everything back.
LEONARD: Research. Do you know the damage these chemicals can do to the human Leonard, put everything back.
GRACE: Leonard, put everything back.
LEONARD: This is serious. You can't keep buying this crap. Don't you care that you're ingesting garbage?
GRACE: Just put everything back and go to
YACCO: Post traumatic stress is very common in your line of work. Many fire fighters go through this.
GUS: Yeah. But why now? I haven't fought fires in ten years.
YACCO: Sometimes we experience something so horrific, our memory blocks it out. That way we won't have to relive the pain. It's called repression. Our bodies are not so forgiving, however. Inside, we feel the effects of trauma even when we don't know why.
GUS: What does that mean?
YACCO: Something stirred your unconscious. If we find out what that was, we can begin the healing process.
GUS: A friend was making good money with construction. He got an offer to build that extension off Lindsay Acres. He suggested I come into town and work for a while.
GUS: "Light my Fire" is always playing.
YACCO: Light my fire. The Doors song. "Da da something. wallow in the mire. Da, da. we couldn't get much higher. Come on baby light my
GUS: Light my fire. The Doors song. "Da da something. wallow in the mire. Da, da. we couldn't get much higher. Come on baby light my

JACOB: You okay?
JIM: You okay?
JACOB: You okay?
JIM: Jim rips the rubber gloves off with his teeth.
JACOB: Jacob. I love you.
JIM: Jacob. I love you.
JACOB: ( frightened ) Will you join me? Join me in this celebration of life. A symbolic gesture of cleaning out the old and bringing in the new.
JIM: Will you join me? Join me in this celebration of life. A symbolic gesture of cleaning out the old and bringing in the new.
JACOB: Do I have to?
JIM: ( thrown for a loop ) No, you don't have to.
JACOB: Good night, Dad.
MR. FARMER: I'm sure Bette Midler would be most impressed with that rendition.
MALEE: Thank you, Mr. Farmer.
MALEE: Where's Jacob?
LEONARD: Couldn't make it. He.
MALEE: Oh my God! He's coming over.
LEONARD: Shut up! Leave now.
MALEE: Shut up! Leave now.
GUS: You were awesome.
MALEE: Really? Be honest. I'd rather you tell me I sucked then lie.
GUS: You were great.
MALEE: Excuse me for a second.
LEONARD: Ow, ow, ow alright. I'm going.
MALEE: So you really enjoyed it?
GUS: Yeah. Good song. What made you pick it?
MALEE: ( covering ) Oh, uh. my mother was humming it all last week. Big Doors fan.
GUS: Really? Is she here?
MALEE: She missed out.
GUS: She missed out.
MALEE: You're so sweet.
GUS: Yeah well, I have to go, but thanks again. I had a great time.
GRACE: That boy is going to bring the entire house down.
PATRICK: Let him be. He's looking good. I'm proud of him.
GRACE: ( to the girls ) Girls, have you decided what you're going to go as for Halloween?
SARA: Either a witch or a princess.
GRACE: That's nice. Haley?
HALEY: I'm going to go as a marble.
GRACE: What do you mean, a marble?
HALEY: You know, like a bag of marbles, but just one marble.
JEFF: I'm really sorry, man. I.
JACOB: You just think about what I said. Get out of my sight. And send Kenny in on your way out.
KENNY: What did you say to him?
JACOB: I thought you'd both like to know that Halloween was Rudy's favorite These are pictures from every single Halloween since we were five. You see how happy he was?
KENNY: Stop it.
JACOB: After we'd go trick or treating, we'd sit in our room and swap the candy we hated. Rudy loved Snickers, I Almond Joys.
KENNY: Almond Joy sucks.
JACOB: What sucks is that I'll never get to sit in my room and swap candy with my brother ever again. Thanks to you.
KENNY: Why are you doing this?
JACOB: To remind you.
KENNY: How could we forget? You been coming here for months to "remind No one is forcing you to talk to Anything to get out of my cell.
JACOB: No one is forcing you to talk to Anything to get out of my cell.
KENNY: Anything to get out of my cell.
JACOB: Is your cell small?
KENNY: So is a coffin.
JACOB: So is a coffin.
KENNY: You're not the only one who wishes he was still alive. I'd do anything to bring him back, but I can't. It's not easy being in here. Hell, you saw Jeff.
JACOB: What happened to him?
KENNY: He pissed off the wrong guy off. Jeff is totally fucked right now.
JACOB: Don't come back here ever again.
KENNY: Don't come back here ever again.
JACOB: Free country. I'll come if I want.
KENNY: Don't expect me to show up.
GRACE: Be careful now. Have a good night.
GRACE: Kids keep coming later every year.
HALEY: I hate him! I hate him!
GRACE: Who? What happened?
HALEY: Leonard! He threw away all our Halloween candy.
SARA: He grabbed our bags and just threw them down a gutter.
PATRICK: What the hell is going on? Why did you throw away their candy?
LEONARD: Because their sugar intake is completely unhealthy. Besides, Halloween is supposed to be a celebration of evil. How did candy get wrapped into it?
GRACE: I am going to ask you this once, and I want a straight answer. Are you in a cult?
PATRICK: This is what happens when kids join cults. The first thing they change is their diets.
GRACE: This is what happens when kids join cults. The first thing they change is their diets.
LEONARD: I'm not in a cult. This is all information you can find in books.
GRACE: The issue here is that you have stolen one of the most exciting nights of the year from your If anybody had done this to you when you were a child, we never would have heard the end of it.
PATRICK: If anybody had done this to you when you were a child, we never would have heard the end of it.
LEONARD: I wish somebody had done it to me. I wish either one of you had given a shit about my weight.
PATRICK: I do not care for your language.
LEONARD: I'm only trying to help you guys.
PATRICK: What's your point?
LEONARD: Dad, you and mom are going to die young if you keep eating as poorly as you do.
PATRICK: What is this obsession you have with weight?
LEONARD: The coach for Jefferson High is also my gym teacher. He told me that if I got into shape, I could start as center for the Freshman team when I get to high school.
PATRICK: Center is a great position. Toughest guy on the field. A good center can make or break a team.
LEONARD: I know. That's why I'm trying so hard to get into shape. You guys should to. At the rate you're going, you won't make it to your Look, Leonard. Your mom, to her, a tasty meal is just a way of showing she cares.
PATRICK: Look, Leonard. Your mom, to her, a tasty meal is just a way of showing she cares.
LEONARD: She doesn't! Tonight she served spaghetti and meatballs from a can. The amount of sodium alone can wreck havoc on a person's blood pressure. Not to mention.
PATRICK: Leonard, people just don't drop dead from eating meatballs.
GUS: I can't take your Halloween candy.
MALEE: You'll be doing me a favor. Chocolate gives you zits. Besides, if I want to keep this firm ass as an adult, I gotta develop good eating habits now.
GUS: ( uncomfortable ) Maybe just a snickers.
MALEE: So work is good?
GUS: To be honest, I can't wait till this job is finished. This place is creepy. You know, a boy died here like right before we started Rudy. His name was Rudy.
MALEE: Rudy. His name was Rudy.
GUS: You knew him?
MALEE: He was one of my best friends. Remember that funeral I went to?
GUS: That was him?
MALEE: I thought you knew. Two boys threw a flaming cocktail at him. Can you imagine killing someone like that? How evil can you get?
ASHLEY: Jeff Laskey is dead.
JIM: He committed suicide in his jail cell last night. Sally Yngve called just now to tell me.
ASHLEY: He committed suicide in his jail cell last night. Sally Yngve called just now to tell me.
JACOB: Why are you smiling? A boy died.
ASHLEY: No, a monster that murdered my son died. Justice is served; end of
KENNY: He used his bed sheet, waited until lights out and then jumped.
JACOB: That's terrible.
KENNY: His cell mate let him hang there the entire night.
JACOB: I'm sorry, Kenny.
KENNY: Like you even give a shit. I bet when you heard, you started I knew he wouldn't make it. It's my fault too. Jeff wasn't a saint when I met him, but he sure as hell wasn't headed here. That fucking asshole!

MALEE: I'm going for a bike ride.
YACCO: There's a foot of snow outside.
MALEE: The streets are ploughed. Besides, I like looking at all the lights.
YACCO: Be home in an hour. Be careful.
MALEE: Freeze! That's right.
LEONARD: Don't worry, white male infants are the hardest to come by. 60 minutes did a whole story on it.
MALEE: Since when do you watch 60 minutes?
LEONARD: Since I was in the hospital. They said, any adoption agency worth its salt has at least a three year waiting list. By the time your parents get a kid, you'll be in college. You think they'll want to start over again with that baby No, but it's like they're trying to replace Rudy.
JACOB: No, but it's like they're trying to replace Rudy.
LEONARD: It doesn't matter cause it's not gonna happen.
MALEE: I'm thirsty. Can you get us some drinks?
LEONARD: Why me?
MALEE: Because it's the gentlemanly thing to do.
JACOB: I'll get the drinks.
MALEE: I'll go with you.
LEONARD: Why are you all of a sudden going to get the drinks?
MALEE: ( bitchy ) Because you've upset me, and I don't want to see you right now.
LEONARD: Fine, I'll get the drinks.
MALEE: I need a favor. It's big. I need you to hide something for me.
JACOB: Hide what?
MALEE: Promise, you won't freak.
JACOB: I won't.
MALEE: You said, you wouldn't freak!
JACOB: That's a gun.
MALEE: I know.
JACOB: Where'd you get it?
MALEE: I can't tell you. I just need you to hide it for a while. When all is cool, I'll come for it.
JACOB: Why can't you keep it?
MALEE: My mother is a total snoop. She goes through my stuff like all the Please, Jacob. Somebody's life might depend on it.
JACOB: Is it loaded?
MALEE: No, but I do have some bullets.
JACOB: Nobody has the combination, but me. Besides, I could be building a bomb in here, and they wouldn't even
JACOB: I sent in some comics for ya. The X-men one is pretty sweet.
KENNY: That last batch was awesome.
JACOB: I better get going, I don't want to miss my bus.
KENNY: Before you go, I got some news. Apparently, the parole board feels I've been a model prisoner, so they're giving me early release.
JACOB: What? How can they do that?
KENNY: I don't know. They just did. You're pissed, aren't you? I knew you would be. It was an accident, Jacob.
JACOB: So you're getting out. Gonna head back to school, or.
KENNY: Fuck school. I'm going to live with my Dad in New Mexico. He's working on a ranch out there.
JACOB: You can't leave the state. That violates your probation. You'll have to.
KENNY: My dad won't tell anyone. No one will even care I'm out there.
JACOB: Your mom will.
KENNY: Jacob, in the entire time I've been locked up, you were the only one who came to see me. Trust me, she won't care.
MALEE: 200 dollars! Dad sent me 200
YACCO: ( covering ) Your father. went out. He's not home right now.
MALEE: You're acting weird. What's going Well, do you want to come with me to the mall and spend it?
YACCO: Well, do you want to come with me to the mall and spend it?
MALEE: Well, do you want to come with me to the mall and spend it?
YACCO: I'd prefer it if you'd put that money in the bank. Fine, spend it. You'll have to do it alone though. I have a patient this afternoon. Have a good day.
PATRICK: Here's the deal. You know how my company flies me to Florida every
LEONARD: You and I have been going since I was eight. It's the guy's week This year, I'm taking the girls. Just the girls. You're staying Why can't we all go?
PATRICK: This year, I'm taking the girls. Just the girls. You're staying Why can't we all go?
LEONARD: Why can't we all go?
GRACE: I'm not staying here all alone. Besides, you said it yourself, you've been going for years. Give your sisters a chance.
LEONARD: ( beat ) I need money.
PATRICK: What for?
LEONARD: Clothes. Nothing I have fits Your father and I aren't rich. You can't get a new wardrobe anytime you want.
GRACE: Your father and I aren't rich. You can't get a new wardrobe anytime you want.
LEONARD: What am I supposed to do, go to school naked?
GRACE: Wear a belt.
PATRICK: I'll give him some cash, he can get some clothes.
GRACE: No. He's gonna gain all his weight back in a few months.
PATRICK: What? It's true.
GRACE: What? It's true.
LEONARD: When I was fat. Now I don't have to wear a T-shirt when I go swimming. Who knows, maybe I could even get lucky.
JACOB: You're still ugly, though.
LEONARD: I don't understand what my mother's problem is. It's like the thinner I get, the more she hates me.
JACOB: She's probably jealous. Maybe you should put her on that diet.
LEONARD: Anytime I mention it, my mother goes crazy.
JACOB: If you really want her to drop a few tons, put her in jail. Kenny's lost about 30 pounds since he's been incarcerated, and he was already thin.
LEONARD: Yeah. Jail is the perfect weight loss program. You take a fat tub, throw them in a room and force them to eat right and exercise. Don't let them out till they do.
JACOB: Yeah. Jail is the perfect weight loss program. You take a fat tub, throw them in a room and force them to eat right and exercise. Don't let them out till they do.
YACCO: Malee, dinner!
MALEE: I got a new look. You know, for Spring. What do you think?
YACCO: You look.
MALEE: Different. What happened to your Contacts. It took me like forty five minutes to get them in, but beauty is pain.
YACCO: Different. What happened to your Contacts. It took me like forty five minutes to get them in, but beauty is pain.
MALEE: Contacts. It took me like forty five minutes to get them in, but beauty is pain.
YACCO: Honey, in the future, I'd like to know if you're going to radically change your appearance. Clean your stuff up and come down for dinner.
GUS: Malee? My God, you look.
MALEE: Beautiful. You look beautiful.
GUS: Beautiful. You look beautiful.
MALEE: I felt like I needed a change, you I bet you're driving the boys at school wild.
GUS: I bet you're driving the boys at school wild.
MALEE: Boys my age are so immature. I'm more attracted to older gentlemen.
GUS: You don't want somebody that much older than you. An age difference can cause problems.
MALEE: What kind of problems?
GUS: A lot of times when a couple has an age difference, they wind up splitting up because they want different things.
MALEE: You mean sex.
GUS: Gus catches a look of relief on Malee's face.
MALEE: Are you impatient?
GUS: No, but when I was a kid.
MALEE: Why don't you have a girlfriend?
GUS: I did, but it didn't work out.
MALEE: How old was she?
GUS: About my age.
MALEE: See that, age wasn't an issue, yet you still wanted different things. I don't think it's about age.
LEONARD: ( calling after them ) Have a good flight!
ASHLEY: We're home.
JACOB: Could you come downstairs for a minute. We have a surprise for
ASHLEY: Could you come downstairs for a minute. We have a surprise for
JIM: This is Keith Gardner. You're new brother. Keith our son, Jacob.
KEITH: It's nice to meet you.
JACOB: You get top bunk.
KEITH: I'm kind of afraid of heights.
JACOB: Sucks to be you.
KEITH: I never thought my future brother would have a KOOL AID stain, smeared across his face.
JACOB: Fuck you, it's a birthmark!
KEITH: We're getting off on the wrong
JACOB: When my parents said they were taking in an orphan, I pictured a baby. So what happened, your parents die or something?
KEITH: I was given up at birth.
JACOB: You gonna try and find your mother when you're 18?
KEITH: As far as I'm concerned, the fact she had me was enough. I don't need to show up one day and disrupt her life.
JACOB: Oh, but it's okay to just show up one day and disrupt mine?
JACOB: He's not some baby. He's like 10.
KENNY: You're blaming me for this?
JACOB: No. But can you believe it?
KENNY: Maybe this is the only way they can get over Rudy's death.
JACOB: He's a person not a fucking vase.
KENNY: I know.
JACOB: I gotta get out of there. I can't live in that house for one more day. I want to go with you to New No way. You've never even been out on the road.
KENNY: No way. You've never even been out on the road.
JACOB: It's not easy. After first night falls, you'll be pissing yourself.
KENNY: It's not easy. After first night falls, you'll be pissing yourself.
JACOB: No, I won't.
KENNY: You don't need me to run away from That's not what this is about.
JACOB: That's not what this is about.
KENNY: Yes, it is. And you want to come with ME of all people. Are you forgetting, I was the one who killed Rudy!
JACOB: That was an accident.
KENNY: If this is what you want. Alright.
MALEE: Is that Dad? Can I talk to him?
YACCO: Take some responsibility for yourself and grow. Hello?.
MALEE: Well, what do you expect? All you ever do is yell at him.
YACCO: Malee, you don't understand.
MALEE: He's my Dad! I'm sorry if it bothers you, but I love him. You keep this up then one day, when I'm old enough, I'll leave here and go and stay with him.
GRACE: Grace jumps up and runs out of the room.
GRACE: ( screaming ) Leonard, what's wrong?
GRACE: I'm calling 9-1-1!
GRACE: If I go downstairs, I won't be able to make it back up. Let me call 9-1-1 first, okay?
LEONARD: I hope someone is hungry.
GRACE: Get me out of here now!
LEONARD: No joke, Ma. For the next two weeks while Dad and the girls are away, you will be kept down here. I'll provide you with nutritious meals and plenty of water. You, mother, will learn what it means to be healthy.
GRACE: That's what this is about, food?
LEONARD: I'm trying to save your life, mom. Trying to give you a life. Cause I love you.
GRACE: My life is fine. I don't need you to "save me".
LEONARD: You don't even realize how sick you are. It's a problem when an otherwise healthy woman can't drag her ass up a flight of stairs because she's so obese. You're staying down here.
GUS: We follow him into the kitchen and FIND MALEE, standing beside the table and dressed only in her robe.
MALEE: I made dinner, my love. And I have a surprise.
GUS: You've been in my apartment before, haven't you?
MALEE: Don't you like my body?
GUS: Malee, stop.
MALEE: It's okay because I love you.
GUS: To go call your mother.
MALEE: But we're soulmates.
YACCO: I don't know what to say to you.
KEITH: Wanna play some catch?
JACOB: Where the hell did you get this?
KEITH: The closet. Ow, what's wrong?
JACOB: Did I say you could play with the glove? Did I?
KEITH: No, I just.
JACOB: Everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING in this room is mine. You are not allowed to touch a thing, especially the glove.
KEITH: Okay, okay.
JACOB: If you tell my parents what I said, I'll kill you. I'll shoot you in the fucking face, I swear it!
JACOB: ( cold ) What's wrong now?
ASHLEY: I was looking at a picture of you and Rudy when you were born. God, I miss him.
JACOB: But you have Keith now
ASHLEY: What the hell does that mean?
JACOB: You have Keith. Two boys again. Everything is fine.
ASHLEY: We didn't adopt Keith to replace Didn't you?
JACOB: Didn't you?
ASHLEY: For your information, your father and I discussed adopting for years.
JACOB: ( not buying it ) Right. Maybe if it was me who died, you wouldn't need another kid to get over it.
ASHLEY: How can you say that? I never wanted either of my children to But one of us did. If you had to choose which one, I bet you wish it was me.
JACOB: But one of us did. If you had to choose which one, I bet you wish it was me.
ASHLEY: I know you think we favored Rudy.
JACOB: You did! Admit it.
ASHLEY: I admit he was easier to raise, but we didn't love him more. Jacob, listen to me. You came with a different set of challenges.
JACOB: My birthmark.
ASHLEY: It's not easy being different.
JACOB: ( screams ) I'm not different!! You always made me feel like something was wrong. There's nothing wrong with I know.
ASHLEY: I know.
JACOB: No, you don't! It's like you don't know how to deal with me. You never did.
ASHLEY: I'm sorry if that is how you feel. You do the best you can as a parent. You don't always know what's right. But you're my son. I'd do anything for you. I'd fight for you, I'd kill for you, I'd die for you.
JACOB: Rudy used to say that exact same It's true. And as unchristian as it sounds, I still want the boy that killed Rudy dead. Someday, when you grow up, you'll understand what I mean. Someday.
ASHLEY: It's true. And as unchristian as it sounds, I still want the boy that killed Rudy dead. Someday, when you grow up, you'll understand what I mean. Someday.
GRACE: When Pat calls, and I don't answer, he'll know something is wrong. He'll know. I'll be fine.
GRACE: Open this door now! Let me out, God damn it! Leonard!
YACCO: Before we begin, I want to apologize. I should have known what was going on with Malee.
GUS: It's my fault. I knew she had a crush on me. I guess, I felt bad for her. She's a very unhappy
YACCO: This is your therapy. Not mine. Why was it therapeutic?
GUS: I slept last night. I can't remember the last time I slept so deep or so sound. I don't remember dreaming or anything.
YACCO: Why do you think that is?
GUS: One of the last fires I ever fought was a brownstone, beautiful. The place was burned from roof to basement. Whole family was wiped out. When I was upstairs, inspecting, I found a girl. She couldn't have been more than 12.
YACCO: What did you do?
GUS: Exactly what she wanted. I placed my hand over her mouth and what was left of her nose, and I. I killed her. I told myself it was the right thing to do, but I've never been sure.
YACCO: What does this have to do with When I saw her last night, she had the same look on her face as that girl. She just wanted me to take away her pain.
GUS: When I saw her last night, she had the same look on her face as that girl. She just wanted me to take away her pain.
YACCO: Would you mind if we. cut out early today? No charge.

GRACE: GRACE ( CONT'D ) ( cont'd )

LEONARD: What happened?
NURSE: Gas leak.
LEONARD: My mom, she's.
NURSE: She's fine. They've taken her into surgery. She blew out her knees somehow. We're trying to get your father on the phone right now.
LEONARD: Shh. You need your rest. Everything is fine now.
NURSE: Shh. You need your rest. Everything is fine now.
KENNY: We got sleeping bags, a tent, canteens and a lantern.
JACOB: ( half hearted )
KENNY: You're acting weird. You gonna chicken out?
JACOB: You better not. I already packed twice the amount of shit. I can't carry it all alone.
KENNY: You better not. I already packed twice the amount of shit. I can't carry it all alone.
JACOB: I'll be there.
KENNY: Good. I'm telling you, man. It's gonna be great.

GRACE: ( CONTINUED )
LEONARD: I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean to leave the gas on. It was an accident. And everything that happened, I. I just thought that maybe, I could help you.
GRACE: Leonard, my mother died at 52. We had to cremate her body because they didn't make a coffin big enough for her to fit in. Even if they had, no one could have carried I loved her so much. I don't want that to happen to me.
LEONARD: It doesn't have to.
GRACE: Even if I can manage the food. Can you honestly see me, running a You don't have to run a marathon. You just have to run to the end of the block. It's not so hard as you think it is.
LEONARD: You don't have to run a marathon. You just have to run to the end of the block. It's not so hard as you think it is.
GRACE: I'll try.
LEONARD: Did you tell him what happened?
GRACE: I told him there was a gas leak.
LEONARD: I meant.
GRACE: I know what you meant. I didn't tell him. I don't think I will.
KENNY: You're late.
JACOB: I'm here.
KENNY: Put this on.
JACOB: If people see me riding around in the middle of the night, we're screwed. You didn't bring a
KENNY: Who gives a shit what I'm up to.
JACOB: Yeah, but if we cut through the construction site, we'll hit the railroad tracks. It's faster and no one will bother us.
KENNY: Good point.
KENNY: What's wrong?
JACOB: I can't do this.
KENNY: Jacob begins rummaging through his backpack.
KENNY: Son of a bitch! I knew it. I knew you'd chicken.
