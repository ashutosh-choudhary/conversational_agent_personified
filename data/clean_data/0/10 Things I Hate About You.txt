CAMERON: That girl I
MICHAEL: You burn, you pine, you perish?
CAMERON: Who is she?
MICHAEL: Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it
CAMERON: Why not?
MICHAEL: I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility.
MRS. BLAISE: Well, then. Oh, yes. I guess that does it for our analysis of The Old Man and the Sea. Any other comments?
KAT: Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?
MRS. BLAISE: I'm sorry?
KAT: This book is about a guy and his fishing habit. Not exactly a crucial
KAT: ( continuing ) Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still revere Hemingway. He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of
JOEY: As opposed to a bitter self-righteous hag who has no friends?
MRS. BLAISE: That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.
KAT: I guess the school board thinks because Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's worthy of our time
KAT: ( continuing ) What about Colette? Charlotte Bronte? Simone de Beauvoir?
PATRICK: Mother Goose?
MISS PERKY: Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
KAT: Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
MISS PERKY: Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild. By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
KAT: I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
MISS PERKY: The point is Kat people perceive you as somewhat .

MANDELIA: The whole folio. All the plays.
TEACHER: ( disbelieving ) You've read every play by William Haven't you?
MANDELLA: Haven't you?
MANDELLA: Your sister is so amazingly without. She'll never read him. She has no idea.
KAT: The fact that you're cutting gym so you can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear his name, is a little without in itself if you ask me.
MANDELLA: Who's that?
KAT: Patrick Verona Random skid.
MANDELLA: That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
KAT: I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
MANDELLA: He always look so
KAT: Block E?
KAT: ( continuing ) Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
MANDELLA: Just a little.
KAT: What's this?
MANDELLA: An attempted slit.
KAT: I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
MANDELLA: But imagine the things he'd say during
KAT: Okay, say you do it. You kill yourself, you end up in wherever you end up and he's there. Do you really think he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball?
COHORT: Virgin alert.
JOEY: Lookin' good, ladies.
MANDELLA: Doesn't respond
ANOTHER ANGLE: Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can of beans linger on the grass behind them.
CAMERON: Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
MICHAEL: Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
CAMERON: He always have that shit-eating grin?
MICHAEL: Joey Dorsey? Perma-shit-grin. I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class. And a model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.

JOEY: ( practically spitting ) They're running the rest of me next
KAT: The people at this school are so incredibly foul.

KAT: Sadly, no. But it's only four-thirty.
KAT: ( continuing ) Where've you been?

WALTER: Hello, precious.
KAT: How touching.
WALTER: What's this? It says Sarah Lawrence?
KAT: I guess I got in
SHARON: What's a synonym for throbbing?
WALTER: Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
KAT: I know.
WALTER: I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
KAT: You decided.
BIANCA: Is there even a question that we want her to stay?
KAT: Ask Bianca who drove her home
SHARON: ( to Bianca; upset ) Who drove you home?
WALTER: ( to Bianca; upset ) Who drove you home?
BIANCA: Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy. and I think he might ask.
WALTER: No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
BIANCA: What if she never starts dating?
WALTER: Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
BIANCA: But it's not fair she's a mutant, This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
KAT: This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
WALTER: He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag.
WALTER: ( continuing ) Do you know what this is?
WALTER: This is why you're not dating until your sister does.
BIANCA: But she doesn't want to date.
WALTER: Exactly my point
WALTER: ( continuing ) Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
SHARON: ( to Sharon; as he leaves ) You're not helping.
WALTER: ( to Sharon; as he leaves ) You're not helping.
BIANCA: Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again.
CAMERON: Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
BIANCA: Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
CAMERON: ( looking down ) Okay. then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
BIANCA: You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
CAMERON: ( embarrassed ) Forget it.
BIANCA: No, no, it's my fault we didn't have a proper introduction -
CAMERON: The thing is, Cameron I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
BIANCA: The thing is, Cameron I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
CAMERON: Seems like she could get a date easy
BIANCA: The problem is, she's completely anti-social.
CAMERON: Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
BIANCA: Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
CAMERON: That's a shame.
BIANCA: Gosh, if only we could find Kat a Let me see what I can do.
CAMERON: Let me see what I can do.
MICHAEL: You're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl? Do you have no concept of the high school social code?
CAMERON: I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
MICHAEL: Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the
CAMERON: What about him?
MICHAEL: ( confused ) You wanna go out with him?
CAMERON: ( impatient ) No - he could wrangle with the sister.
MICHAEL: What makes you think he'll do it?
CAMERON: He seems like he thrives on danger
MICHAEL: No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz.
CAMERON: They always let felons sit in on Honors I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
MICHAEL: I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
CAMERON: Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?
MICHAEL: Did she actually say she'd go out with That's what I just said
CAMERON: That's what I just said
MICHAEL: You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side.
CAMERON: I thought you hated those people.
MICHAEL: Hey I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
CAMERON: So now all we gotta do is talk to him.
MICHAEL: I'll let you handle that.
PEPE: Some people like the Colombian, but it all depends on your acidity preference. Me? I prefer East African and Indonesian. You start the day with a Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian Sidamo in your cup, you're that much farther ahead than someone drinkin' Cosia Rican or Kona you know what I
CAMERON: Hey, there
CAMERON: ( continuing ) Later, then.
MICHAEL: Are you lost?
JOEY: Are you lost?
MICHAEL: Nope - just came by to chat
JOEY: We don't chat.
MICHAEL: Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested.
JOEY: We're not.
MICHAEL: ( grimacing ) Hear me out. You want Bianca don't
MICHAEL: ( continuing ) But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
JOEY: Does this conversation have a purpose?
MICHAEL: So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who's up for the job.
JOEY: That guy? I heard he ate a live duck once. Everything but the beak and the feet.
MICHAEL: Joey turns to look at Michael.
JOEY: What's in it for you?
MICHAEL: Oh, hey, nothin' man Purely good will on my part.
MICHAEL: ( continuing ) I have a dick on my face, don't I?
CAMERON: You got him involved?
MICHAEL: Like we had a choice? Besides when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
CAMERON: You're one brilliant guy
MICHAEL: Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who Embraces Guys In The Bathroom.
KAT: So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.

KAT: William didn't even go to high school
MANDELLA: That's never been proven
KAT: Neither has his heterosexuality.
KAT: ( continuing ) I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. ( pointing at her food ) Do you mind?
MANDELLA: Does it matter?

MANDELLA: Janice Parker told me he was a roadie for Marilyn Manson.
KAT: Janice Parker is an idiot

PATRICK: Touch of the flu.
MISS PERKY: I'm at a loss, then. What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
PATRICK: How 'bout your sex life?
MISS PERKY: Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
PATRICK: What's to discuss?
MISS PERKY: You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
PATRICK: Well, you know there's the prestige of the job title. and the benefits package is pretty good.
MISS PERKY: Fine. Go do something repugnant and give us something to talk about next
MANDELLA: Look, it's really easy.
TREVOR: You're a freedom fighter. Be proud,
MANDELLA: ( rotely ) It's Mandella with two L's. I am not related to Nelson Mandela. I am not a political figure. I do not live in South Africa. My parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking they were revolutionaries.
TREVOR: But you freed our people
MANDELLA: Your "people" are white, suburban high school boys who smoke too much hemp. I have not freed you, Trevor. Only you can free yourself.
BIANCA: C'esc ma tete. This is my head
CAMERON: Right. See? You're ready for the I don't want to know how to say that though. I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.

KAT: Oh, right. Friday.
PATRICK: The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
KAT: Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
PATRICK: I know a lot more than that
KAT: Doubtful. Very doubtful.
PATRICK: ( calling after her ) You're no bargain either, sweetheart.
SCURVY: So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a new Blaupunkt.
MICHAEL: He took the bait.
BIANCA: Have you ever considered a new look? I mean, seriously, you could have some potential buried under all this
KAT: I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my Can you at least start wearing a bra?
BIANCA: Can you at least start wearing a bra?

KAT: You covered in my vomit.
PATRICK: She slams her locker shut and walks away

KAT: Are you following me?
PATRICK: I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
KAT: She gets in and starts the car.

KAT: Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
KAT: ( continuing ) Hey do you mind?
JOEY: Not at all
JOEY: ( continuing ) You fucking bitch!
WALTER: My insurance does not cover PMS
KAT: Then tell them I had a seizure.
WALTER: Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
KAT: I thought you were punishing me.
WALTER: Why can't we agree on this?
KAT: Because you're making decisions for me.
WALTER: As a parent, that's my right
KAT: So what I want doesn't matter?
WALTER: You're eighteen. You don't know what you want. You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
KAT: ( emphatic ) I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices. I want
WALTER: Christ! I want a night to go by that I'm not staring a contraction in the
JOEY: When I shell out fifty, I expect I'm on it
PATRICK: I'm on it
JOEY: Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
PATRICK: I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
JOEY: Let me put it to you this way, if you don't get any action, I don't get any action. So get your ass on hers by the end of the week.

JOEY: Forget it.
PATRICK: Forget her sister, then.
JOEY: You better hope you're as smooth as you think you are, Verona.
CAMERON: La copine et I 'ami? La diferance?
BIANCA: A "copine" is someone you can count on. An "ami" is someone who makes promises he can't keep.
CAMERON: You got something on your mind?
BIANCA: I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
CAMERON: You have my word. As a gentleman

PATRICK: Why, don't you?
PATRICK: ( continuing ) I watched you out there I've never seen you look like that

KAT: ( yelling )
BARTENDER: ( to Kat, yelling ) You forgot to pay!
PATRICK: ( yelling ) I got it, Rick.

MANDELLA: What'd he say?
KAT: Who cares?
MANDELLA: Has he importun'd you with love in honourable fashion?
MANDELLA: ( continuing; off her look ) Don't be Cruella with me. I'm in favor of romance. You're the one that wants to march on Washington every five
KAT: Gigglepuss was so beyond.
MANDELLA: They were. I only wish William could have been here to witness the rebirth of punk rock with us.
KAT: So true.
CAMERON: So, then she says that she almost didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that dress because she thought she was mixing, you know, genres. And the fact that I noticed and I'm quoting here - "really meant something."
MICHAEL: You told me that part already.
CAMERON: Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
JOEY: Hey. Dingo Boingo
JOEY: ( continuing; to Michael ) I hear you're helpin' Verona.

MISS PERKY: You're completely demented.
PATRICK: ( cheery ) See you next week!
MISS PERKY: You two know each other?

BIANCA: She's obviously not going.
BIANCA: Daddy, I
WALTER: And where're you going?
BIANCA: If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
WALTER: Otherwise known as an orgy?
BIANCA: It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going
WALTER: Do you know about any party? Katarina?
BIANCA: Daddy, people expect me to be there!
WALTER: If Kat's not going, you're not going.
BIANCA: You're ruining my life' Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
KAT: What's normal?
BIANCA: Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
WALTER: What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
BIANCA: Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
KAT: At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked
BIANCA: Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
KAT: It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
BIANCA: Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend. I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
WALTER: Kat stares Bianca down
KAT: I know about the goddamn party. I'm
WALTER: Oh, God. It's starting.
BIANCA: It's just a party. Daddy.
WALTER: Wear the belly before you go.
BIANCA: Daddy, no!
WALTER: Just for a minute
WALTER: ( continuing ) I want you to realize the weight of your decisions.
BIANCA: You are so completely unbalanced.
KAT: Can we go now?
WALTER: ( to Bianca ) Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
BIANCA: Because she'll scare them away.
WALTER: Because she'll scare them away.
PATRICK: Nine-thirty right?
PATRICK: ( continuing ) I'm early.
KAT: I'm driving.
PATRICK: Who knocked up your sister?
BOGEY: Nice to see you. Martini bar to the right, shots in the kitchen.
JOEY: Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat
KAT: Wait was that? Did your hairline just recede?
JOEY: Where ya goin?
KAT: Your sister here?
JOEY: Your sister here?
KAT: Leave my sister alone.

JOCK: A fight!
JOEY: Just who I was looking for.
KAT: Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat
BIANCA: Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat
GUY: Drink up, sister.
PATRICK: What's this?
KAT: ( mocking ) "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
PATRICK: I say, do what you wanna do.
KAT: Funny, you're the only one
MICHAEL: ( high-fiving a jock ) Moose, my man! ( to Cameron ) Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters have already started calling.
MICHAEL: ( continuing; grabbing his belt ) Yo, Clem. ( to Cameron ) A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new Leanne Rimes. ( with a Jamaican swagger ) Ziggy, peace, bra. ( to Cameron ) Prefers a water pipe, but has been known to use a bong.

BIANCA: Would you mind getting me a drink, Pabst? Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?
CAMERON: Pabst? Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?
BIANCA: Surprise me.
MICHAEL: Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
CAMERON: The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
MICHAEL: Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.
CAMERON: No, I ' m not.
CAMERON: ( continuing ) She used me! She wants to go out with Dorsey. Not me. I'm an idiot!
MICHAEL: At least you're self-aware
JOEY: So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
BIANCA: Queen Harry?
JOEY: It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
BIANCA: My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
JOEY: My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
BIANCA: I'll be right back.
BIANCA: He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party Is he oily or dry?
CHASTITY: Is he oily or dry?
BIANCA: Combination. I don't know I thought he'd be different. More of a
CHASTITY: Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
BIANCA: Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
CHASTITY: All I know is I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
KAT: Bianca, I need to talk to you I need to tell you
BIANCA: ( cutting her off ) I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
PATRICK: Maybe you should let me have it.
KAT: I want another one
JOEY: My man
PATRICK: ( annoyed ) It's about time.
JOEY: A deal's a deal.
JOEY: ( continuing ) How'd you do it?
PATRICK: Do what?
JOEY: Get her to act like a human
PATRICK: I'm fine. I'm
KAT: I'm fine. I'm
PATRICK: You're not okay.
KAT: I just need to lie down for awhile
PATRICK: Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to I know, just let me sleep
KAT: I know, just let me sleep
PATRICK: What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference.
KAT: Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake,
PATRICK: C'mon, let's walk
PATRICK: Cameron, I'm a little busy
CAMERON: It's off. The whole thing.
PATRICK: What 're you talking about?
CAMERON: She's partial to Joey, not me
PATRICK: Cameron do you like the girl?
CAMERON: ( impatient ) Then, go get her
PATRICK: ( impatient ) Then, go get her
KAT: This is so patronizing.
PATRICK: Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
KAT: Why 're you doing this?
PATRICK: I told you
KAT: You don't care if I die
PATRICK: Sure, I do
KAT: Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
PATRICK: Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
KAT: Like you could find one
PATRICK: See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
KAT: Just let me sit down.
PATRICK: How's that?
PATRICK: ( continuing ) Jesus. You're like a weeble
PATRICK: ( continuing ) Why'd you let him get to you?
KAT: I hate him.
PATRICK: I hate him.
KAT: I hate him.
PATRICK: I know. It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
KAT: ( holding up a drunken head ) Hey man. . . You don ' t think I can be "cool"? You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
PATRICK: ( slightly sarcastic ) I thought you were above all that
KAT: You know what they say
PATRICK: No. What do they say?
PATRICK: ( continuing )
PATRICK: ( continuing ) Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up damn it!
PATRICK: ( continuing ) Kat! Wake up!
KAT: ( waking )
PATRICK: I thought you were.
KAT: Go away
BIANCA: Dinner taste better on the way out?
BIANCA: ( continuing ) I don't get you. You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
KAT: You're welcome.
PATRICK: BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT Kids loiter on the lawn. Bianca and Chastity walk outside Joey catches up to them.
JOEY: A bunch of us are going to Jaret's house. Wanna come?
BIANCA: I have to be home in twenty minutes.

JOEY: Then, c'mon. Maybe next time
CAMERON: ( slightly accusatory ) Have fun tonight?
BIANCA: He starts to walk on

PATRICK: I'm driving, so I get to pick the

KAT: ( continuing ) I should do this.
PATRICK: Do what?
KAT: She points to the radio

KAT: ( sarcastically ) My father wouldn't approve of that that
PATRICK: You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
KAT: Oh, so now you think you know me?
PATRICK: I'm gettin' there
KAT: The only thing people know about me is that I'm "scary".
PATRICK: Yeah well, I'm no picnic myself.
PATRICK: ( continuing ) So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass?

BIANCA: No offense, but you're sister is without. I know everyone likes her and all, but .
PATRICK: No offense, but you're sister is without. I know everyone likes her and all, but .
KAT: You know you're not as vile as I thought you were.
PATRICK: So, I'll see you in school
CAMERON: I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
BIANCA: ( faux-innocence ) I was?
CAMERON: You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
BIANCA: ( reluctant ) Well, no.
CAMERON: Then that's all you had to say.
BIANCA: You always been this selfish?
CAMERON: You always been this selfish?
CAMERON: Just because you're beautiful, doesn't mean you can treat people like they don't matter.
CAMERON: ( continuing ) And I'm back in the saddle.
DEREK: Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of my heart.
CLEM: Yippe kai-aye, bra. Dance for me, cowgirl.
CLEM: ( continuing ) Okay, now tell me again why he didn't shoot the deputy?
DEREK: Because the deputy meant him no harm, my friend. It was only the sheriff that was the oppressor.
JOEY: Kat, babe, you were on fire.
MRS. BLAISE: Well now, did everyone have a good Maybe we should ask Verona
JOEY: Maybe we should ask Verona
MRS. BLAISE: Okay then. Well. Oh, yes
MRS. BLAISE: ( continuing ) I'd like you all to write your own version of Shakespeare's Sonnet #141.
MRS. BLAISE: ( continuing ) Any form you'd like. Rhyme, no rhyme, whatever. I'd like to see you elaborate on his theme, however. Let's read it aloud, shall we? Anyone?
MRS. BLAISE: ( continuing )
DEREK: ( reading; in his Rasta stoner drawl ) In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors note/ But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise/ Who in despite of view is pleas 'd to dote.
CLEM: Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom pass? Damn if Shakespeare don't act as a laxative on my person.
MANDELLA: You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
KAT: I didn't have a choice.
MANDELLA: You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
KAT: I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
MANDELLA: You didn't
KAT: I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun.
PATRICK: She gathers her things and bolts out the door. Patrick looks at Mandella, who shrugs and follows Kat.
MICHAEL: So you got cozy with she who stings?
PATRICK: No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
CAMERON: What'd you do to her?
PATRICK: I don ' t know. I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
CAMERON: You realize this puts the whole operation in peril.
PATRICK: No shit. She won't even look at me
CAMERON: Why can't you just tell her you're sorry?
MICHAEL: I'm on it
MICHAEL: Hey there. Tired of breathing?
MANDELLA: ( shyly, as she loosens the scarf ) Cool pictures. You a fan?
MICHAEL: Cool pictures. You a fan?

MANDELLA: ( happily stunned ) Kat a fan, too?
MICHAEL: Kat a fan, too?
MANDELLA: ( puzzled )
MICHAEL: So, listen. I have this friend
CAMERON: She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
PATRICK: She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
PATRICK: ( continuing ) Maybe two.
PATRICK: ( continuing ) You makin' any headway?
CAMERON: She kissed me.
PATRICK: ( eyebrow raised )
NEARBY: Joey stands talking to two JOCK COHORTS. The guys don't see
JOEY: Don't talk to me about the sweetest date. That little halo Bianca is gonna be prone and proven on prom night. Six virgins in a row.
PATRICK: I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers. Another hundred for the tux
JOEY: Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I
JOEY: ( continuing ) Take it
KAT: Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
MANDELLA: Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
KAT: Listen to you! You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like I have a dress anyway
MANDELLA: Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like I have a dress anyway
KAT: You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective. We're making a statement.
MANDELLA: ( unconvinced ) Oh, good. Something new and different for us.
JOEY: Hey, sweet cheeks.
BIANCA: ( not looking at him ) Hi, Joey.
JOEY: You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
JOEY: ( continuing ) Listen, I want to talk to you about the You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go
BIANCA: You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go

JOEY: I'm taking care of it.
PATRICK: Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
KAT: ( frowning ) What are you doing here?
PATRICK: I heard there was a poetry reading.
KAT: You 're so
PATRICK: Kat stares at him, deadpan.
PATRICK: ( continuing ) Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
KAT: Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
PATRICK: Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
KAT: Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
PATRICK: So what did I have an effect on ?
KAT: Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
PATRICK: You were right. She's still pissed.
MICHAEL: Sweet love, renew thy force!
PATRICK: Man don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
CAMERON: ( exasperated ) You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
MICHAEL: Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
PATRICK: What's the worst?
CAMERON: You get the girl.
PATRICK: If I go down. I'm takin' her with me
PATRICK: ( 0. S. ) "This morning, I woke up with this feeling, I didn't know how to deal with, and so I just decided to myself"
PATRICK: "I'd hide it to myself. And never talk about it. And didn't I go and shout it when you walked into the room "
OUTSIDE: Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big
PATRICK: ( continuing ) " I think I love you I "
INSIDE: The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, mortified, but with a slight smile
MISCREANT: Nice song, Verona.
PATRICK: Flog me.
KAT: Sir, I'd like to state for the record that Mr. Verona ' s current incarceration is unnecessary. I never filed a complaint.
MR. CHAPIN: You didn't have to. He disrupted a
KAT: But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention. There are far more hideous acts than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis.
MR. CHAPIN: You're not gonna change my mind, Kat. Rules stick.
KAT: Wait, Mr. Chapin. There's something I've always wanted to show you.
MR. CHAPIN: From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.
KAT: From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.
MR. CHAPIN: I'm going to let that slide, Katarina. But if I catch you doing that again, you'll be in here with the rest of these
KAT: Thank you, Mr. Chapin.
KAT: He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
PATRICK: ( 0. S. ) Look up, sunshine
PATRICK: I guess I never told you I'm afraid of C'mon. It's not that bad
KAT: ( smiling ) C'mon. It's not that bad
PATRICK: Try lookin' at it from this angle
KAT: Put your right foot there
PATRICK: Forget it. I'm stayin'.
KAT: You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
PATRICK: ( voice trembling )
KAT: You shit!
KAT: The Partridge Family?
PATRICK: I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.
KAT: Good call.
PATRICK: So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
KAT: I dazzled him with my wit
PATRICK: ( sarcastic ) A soft side? Who knew?
KAT: Yeah, well, don't let it get out
PATRICK: So what's your excuse?
KAT: Acting the way we do.
PATRICK: I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
KAT: I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
PATRICK: So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
KAT: Something like that
PATRICK: Then you screwed up
KAT: You never disappointed me.
PATRICK: You never disappointed me.
PATRICK: ( continuing ) You up for it?
KAT: For. . . ?

KAT: No one else knows
PATRICK: No one else knows
KAT: You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
PATRICK: Go to the prom with me
KAT: Is that a request or a command?
PATRICK: You know what I mean
KAT: No what?
PATRICK: No what?
KAT: No, I won't go with you
PATRICK: Why not?
KAT: Because I don't want to. It's a stupid
PATRICK: People won't expect you to go.
KAT: Why are you doing this?
KAT: All of it what's in it for you?
KAT: ( continuing ) Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?
PATRICK: So I have to have a motive to be with You tell me.
KAT: You tell me.
PATRICK: You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
KAT: ( quietly ) Answer the question, Patrick
PATRICK: ( angry ) Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
PATRICK: cover that up
BIANCA: Quick question are you going to the
BIANCA: Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
CAMERON: Bianca stares at him for a moment.
BIANCA: do you listen to this crap?
CAMERON: What crap?
BIANCA: Me. This endless .blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
CAMERON: Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure.
CAMERON: ( continuing ) I figured you'd get to the good stuff What good stuff?
BIANCA: What good stuff?
CAMERON: The "real you".
BIANCA: Like my fear of wearing pastels?
BIANCA: ( continuing ) I'm kidding. ( beat ) You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"? And you don't know how to quit?
CAMERON: ( matter of fact ) Okay you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
BIANCA: Okay you're gonna need to learn how to lie.

BIANCA: No, but
WALTER: It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
BIANCA: He's not a "hot rod". Whatever that You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.
WALTER: You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.

WALTER: ( calling out ) You know what happens at proms?
SHARON: They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home. Let her go.
WALTER: Kissing? Is that what you think happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
BIANCA: Come in.
KAT: ( kindly ) Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
BIANCA: Like you care.
KAT: I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .

KAT: After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it. And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display
BIANCA: ( stunned ) Why didn't you tell me?
KAT: I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
BIANCA: No. you didn't! If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
KAT: That's not
BIANCA: I'm not stupid enough to repeat your I guess I thought I was protecting you.
KAT: I guess I thought I was protecting you.
BIANCA: God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
