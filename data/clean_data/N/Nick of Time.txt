MR. SMITH: Nah. Hates his wife.
MS. JONES: I hate rollerblades.
GENE: Lynn! Lynn!!
GENE: Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?
GENE: I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
LYNN: Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated We made it.
GENE: We made it.
LYNN: We made it.
MS. JONES: Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
MR. SMITH: Keep your eyes peeled.
MS. JONES: What about them?
MR. SMITH: Too old.
MR. JONES: MR. SMITH
MR. SMITH: If you ever had an idea it would die of malnutrition. First those blue hairs then some Spic. Leave this to me. I know people. It's my job. I'm a people person.

MR. SMITH: Right there.
GENE: I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do you see a phone? Come on, you.
GENE: Come on, you.
GENE: ( to LYNN ) Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
LYNN: On TV.
GENE: You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
GENE: ( to LYNN ) Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You can talk about her all you want. You know that, don't you?
GENE: So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?

MS. JONES: Young love.
MR. SMITH: ( sotto voce ) Foreigners! Fuck!

MR. SMITH: He starts forward.
MS. JONES: ( not so sure )
MR. SMITH: Could I see some identification, I.D. Could we see some?
GENE: MS. JONES ( ditto with the badge )
MS. JONES: ( ditto with the badge ) I.D. Could we see some?
GENE: Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem? Will a driver's license do?
MR. SMITH: That'll do just fine.
GENE: Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?

GENE: Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
MR. SMITH: Don't worry. She's good with kids.
LYNN: You stole that.
MS. JONES: No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
GENE: What is going on?
MR. SMITH: Into the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat.
MS. JONES: Let's get your seatbelt on. Always gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that
LYNN: I want my daddy.
MS. JONES: There's your daddy. See? We're your daddy's friends.
MR. SMITH: That's right. The policeman is your friend. Isn't that right, Daddy?
MR. SMITH: Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
GENE: Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
MS. JONES: Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
LYNN: Everybody does?
MS. JONES: Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it This is what they call the jack. Hi, It goes in that little hole.
MS. JONES: This is what they call the jack. Hi, It goes in that little hole.
LYNN: MS. JONES
MS. JONES: It goes in that little hole.
LYNN: Let me do it.
LYNN: ( loudly ) It's loud!
MS JONES: Removes a Pro Label Machine from under the seat. She begins to type in several characters.
MR. SMITH: Let's get down to business.
GENE: Who are you? You're not the police.
MS. JONES: MS JONES presses PRINT on the Labeller. A strip of plastic emerges that she begins to apply to a Name Tag. He looks back to her. MR. SMITH whacks him on the knee with the gun. It hurts.
MR. SMITH: Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be You wouldn't.
GENE: You wouldn't.
MS. JONES: Try us.
GENE: Get your hands off her.
MR. SMITH: Mr. Watson, you're not paying attention. Your daughter's life depends on you. Do you understand
GENE: Yes, yes, I understand.
MR. SMITH: He takes the manila envelope from MS JONES, tosses it in GENE'S lap.
MR. SMITH: This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
GENE: Yes, I'm listening.
MR. SMITH: She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
MR. SMITH: When you leave this van you will get yourself a cab and take it to the Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will take this.
MR. SMITH: .and you will kill the woman whose picture is in there. Not just shoot her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend you empty the gun into her. Close up. Got all that?
GENE: You're out of your mind.
MR. SMITH: What's your point?
GENE: I will do no such thing.
MR. SMITH: Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
MS. JONES: Don't worry. We'll take good care of the kid.
MR. SMITH: It is now 12:16. If the woman in the picture is alive at 1:30. .I call my partner, your daughter is dead.
MR. SMITH: And what happens if I don't call I kill her anyway.
MS. JONES: I kill her anyway.
MR. SMITH: Did you hear that, Mr. Watson? Do you understand?
MR. SMITH: The woman in the picture.
MR. SMITH: .or your daughter.
GENE: Oh, my God.
MR. SMITH: God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
MS. JONES: Only you.
MR. SMITH: You're wasting time.
LYNN: Where is my daddy going?
MS. JONES: He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
LYNN: My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
MS. JONES: Just like Power Rangers.
MR. SMITH: Let's test this thing. You on?
MR. SMITH: You'11 need some cash. I'll hang onto this for the time being. Oh, and.
MR. SMITH: You'll need these.
MR. SMITH: Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a
LITTLE GIRL: She pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up, reprimanding her in Spanish. GENE stays crouched, watching the LITTLE GIRL staring at him over HER MOTHER'S shoulder. Until a COP crosses his line of sight. A LOS ANGELES TRANSIT POLICEMAN, foot-patrolling the station. It's like a gift from above. Relief floods GENE's face. He is saved. He stands, hurries toward the COP, each step more Then, just beyond the COP, MR. SMITH casually slides into view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie. GENE walks right past the COP heading towards a cab stand. MR. SMITH falls in behind him speaking in his ear.
MR. SMITH: You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is Do it.
GENE: LYNN ( V.O. ) ( filtered )
GENE: Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
MR. SMITH: That's enough.
LYNN: ( filtered ) He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
GENE: Over and out.
MR. SMITH: Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
GENE: ( softly ) At one thirty my little girl is dead.
MR. SMITH: Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
MR. SMITH: And don't forget I'll be watching
CABBIE: Where to, sir?
GENE: The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
CABBIE: You just come in on Amtrack?
GENE: You just come in on Amtrack?
CABBIE: You just come in on Amtrack?
GENE: Uh, yes..
CABBIE: Business or pleasure?
GENE: Where'd you come from?
CABBIE: Where'd you come from?
GENE: San Diego.
CABBIE: Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego. It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops. Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
GENE: 'S okay. What do you think?
CABBIE: 'S okay. What do you think?
GENE: Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
CABBIE: Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
GENE: I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting.a grave.
CABBIE: Aw, too bad. Somebody close?
CABBIE: Somebody close?
GENE: The grave. Somebody close?
CABBIE: The grave. Somebody close?
GENE: Wife. Ex-wife. Almost ex. We were separated. She was thinking about a
GENE: Look.I've. I've got a problem. A big problem.
CABBIE: Oh, yeah?
CABBIE: Jesus! Watch it, buddy!
CABBIE: I'd love to hear about your problem, but the ride's over. Three-fifty.
CABBIE: Three-fifty. I hope your problem doesn't have anything to do with my
GENE: Right. Right.
CABBIE: What do I want with an accountant?
DOORMAN: I got one for the airport. You free?
CABBIE: You bet.
GENE: Oh, my God. Oh, no.
"HERE TODAY!": Oh, shit.
GENE: Oh, shit.
GENE: Oh, sweet Jesus.
GENE: Could you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room is?
GUSTINO: Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow the signs. Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
GENE: Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
GUSTINO: No problem.
BRENDAN GRANT: ( laughs )
BRENDAN GRANT: Nice body check.
BRENDAN GRANT: You know my wife has a deeply personal reason for going after repeat drunk drivers. They are felons and they should be treated as such. A drivers license is a privilege, not a right.
GENE: Excuse me, is the.thing over?
WOMAN: Yes. You didn't miss much. The food.chicken again.
GENE: Eleanor Grant is gone?
WOMAN: Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same at all these.
MR. SMITH: Check your itinerary. Move along.
GENE: This says "invitation only".
MR. SMITH: Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love
MR. SMITH: This'11 get you in anywhere. Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
GENE: Where did you get these? Who are I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
MR. SMITH: I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
ELEANOR GRANT: They-didn't hear a word I said. The mike was too low on the podium.
KRISTA: How much did we pay for that room?
CHIEF AIDE: We didn't.
ELEANOR GRANT: Somebody did.
KRIST: A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems.
BODYGUARD: Excuse me, sir, this car is for the Governor. You can take the next one.
ELEANOR GRANT: Don't you dare, Franco. This is one of our biggest supporters.
ELEANOR GRANT: Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't- it? I love saying that.
ELEANOR GRANT: Whose idea was it to have a lunch right after the brunch? I'm about to bust as it is.
KRISTA: We'll just walk through, do a little grip-and-grin, then get ready for the press con.
GENE: It comes out a little louder then he intended. He has turned, his back to the door. Everyone looks at him. He's committed.
GENE: I need your help.
ELEANOR GRANT: What can I do for you Mr..Watson?
GENE: Its'.ah.about my daughter..
ELEANOR GRANT: I think we can accommodate you.
ELEANOR GRANT: Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial A pleasure to meet you, Governor.
MR. SMITH: A pleasure to meet you, Governor.
ELEANOR GRANT: You were saying? Your daughter..?
GENE: ELEANOR GRANT
ELEANOR GRANT: ANGLE ON MR SMITH ANGLE ON GENE What to do now?
GENE: She ..ahh.wanted me to. be sure to get your autograph.
ELEANOR GRANT: Of course. I wish everything were that easy.
KRISTA: I've got the pen if you've got the
KRISTA: How about that?
KRISTA: Is that something precious?
GENE: No, that's,..that's fine
ELEANOR GRANT: What's her name?
GENE: Her name? Her name is Lynn.
KRISTA: It's funny. I don't even keep a pad of paper with me anymore, everything's gone so electronic.
KRISTA: If it wasn't for double A batteries I'd be in big trouble.
ELEANOR GRANT: Are you all right? Elevators make me queasy, too.
MR. SMITH: She was right in front of you! What's wrong with you!?
MR. SMITH: Are you 'fucking with me!?
GENE: The gun.
MR. SMITH: What about the gun?
GENE: It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
MR. SMITH: He raises a fist. Struggles with the impulse to smash GENE, controls it. Angrily, he takes the gun from GENE's pocket, expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket.
MR. SMITH: You won't get many chances like that, Mr. Watson. That's the way life works. Don't blow the next one.
GENE'S POV: The van. It's moving into a parking spot across from the Bonaventure, on Flower Street.
MS. JONES: That's pretty good.
LYNN: I've done much better ones than this.
MS. JONES: You have, huh?
LYNN: Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
MS. JONES: That's good. That's good, sweetie pie.
MR. SMITH: There, all loaded. Ready for the
HUEY: Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they.?
HUEY: ( calling after him ) You don't see your face, you don't
HUEY: Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they say? What you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.
HUEY: Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in
ECU WATCH: The minute hand clicks to 12:33 as he watches.
HUEY: So, are you a visitor or lucky enough to live in The City of Angels?
GENE: I'm.I'm visiting. What do you do, if I may be so bold?
HUEY: What do you do, if I may be so bold?
GENE: ( looking at MR. SMITH ) I'm just an accountant.
HUEY: Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants? They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
HUEY: Now you take tips. Time was a tip was between a man and his customer. Not any more. They've figured out what they call a formulae, don't laugh, it ain't for babies. They take your sales, see, and slap a percentile on there, figuring that somewhere between your lies and your bad luck they'll hit on the mean amount, mean meaning "in the middle", but if you ask me it means "just plain mean". Why you can have Uncle Scrooge wring a nickel over your poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins like manna from heaven, don't make no difference, they'll tax your behind according to that same figure. Doesn't seem quite right., does it?
GENE: No. No, it doesn't.
GUSTINO: Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'?
HUEY: It's a load, my friend, but somebody's got to carry it.
GENE: I have to do something.
HUEY: What's that? You have to speak up. I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
GENE: I said I have to do something.
HUEY: I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
GENE: Is within himself. Drove me crazy. There must have been one on me. I didn't add up so she left. That's what attracted me to her In the first place. She made up her mind and she did it. She wouldn't sit around waiting for.whatever. She'd do something. She'd do Yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. Wears like iron. You're a wise man. There ya' go. Two bucks.
GENE: Drove me crazy. There must have been one on me. I didn't add up so she left. That's what attracted me to her In the first place. She made up her mind and she did it. She wouldn't sit around waiting for.whatever. She'd do something. She'd do Yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. Wears like iron. You're a wise man. There ya' go. Two bucks.
HUEY: Yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. Wears like iron. You're a wise man. There ya' go. Two bucks.
HUEY: You got anything smaller?
GENE: Keep it.
HUEY: It's a twenty.
GENE: Keep it.
HUEY: Well.thanks muchly.
GENE: Can I get out to Flower Street from Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
HUEY: Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
GENE: GENE walks toward the bar. HUEY shakes his head: time for the boys in white.
MR. SMITH: You get another chance in ten minutes.
GENE: Then I have time for a drink.
MR. SMITH: All right, Mr. Watson, but make it just one. I don't want you.
REPORTER: So where was I?
BARTENDER: I don't know. Something about the Governor's new regime.
REPORTER: Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old Boys like yesterday's newspapers.
REPORTER: The white boys are in for it. When they got her elected they never thought she was gonna make the Governor's office look like the United
REPORTER: We're talking Custer's Last Stand here. The only minorities not on her staff are the ones still lost in the Rain Forest.
GENE: ( a gasp ) Shhh. You'll wake the baby up.
MS. JONES: ( softly ) What we have here is what they call a Mexican standoff. The thing you gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind the seat?" Now, a twenty-two'd go right through it, but even a button will throw a twenty-two off so there's a good chance it'd get screwed up somewhere along the way, miss the target. Maybe a thirty-eight? A thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll bust up in little bitty pieces. They'll keep going but they'll be slowed down quite a bit. How's about a three-fifty-seven? It'll go through the seat, her, you, the dashboard, shit, it'll go through the engine block before it knows it's hit anything, end up in some pedestrian three blocks away. What do you think? What's my poison?
MS. JONES: Well it's a comfort to know you've got the co-Jones to pull that thing out. Whether you've got the balls to pull the trigger we've still got to
MS. JONES: ( into the walkie-talkie ) He's coming back in.
MR. SMITH: ( filtered ) I've got him in the crosshairs.
GENE: Pool Deck?
HECTOR: Fourth Floor. Take that escalator.
GENE: INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - BAR AREA - DAY - 12:39PM GENE heads toward the escalators. Ahead of him, he sees ELEANOR GRANT and BRENDAN GRANT surrounded by AIDES and SECURITY MEN facing a crowd of PRESS PEOPLE. The Governor and her husband have an arm around each other. They are smiling, relaxed, quite the" happy couple. They give each other a warm kiss. Camera flashes, recording the moment. GENE, heading toward them, has to thread his way through a large WEDDING PARTY - tuxedos and bridesmaid gowns. When he clears them he has neared the impromptu press conference.
BRENDAN GRANT: My wife is not interested in negative campaigning. She wants to accentuate the positive. I don't know about you but I find that refreshing.
A REPORTER: Have you ever thought of running for office yourself?
BRENDAN GRANT: ( smiles, charmingly )
BRENDAN GRANT: I'm just a business man.
GENE: What would you do in my place?
MR. SMITH: He flips the walkie-talkie, catches it.
MR. SMITH: The bitch would be dead. Course I ain't sayin' which bitch.
GENE: There's a plot to kill the Governor. If you don't believe me, check that guy right there. He has a gun.
OFFICER TRUST: So do you, Mr. Watson.
OFFICER TRUST: You got this under control?
MR. SMITH: OFFICER TRUST
OFFICER TRUST: It doesn't look like it.
MR. SMITH: It's under control.
OFFICER TRUST: It better be.
MR. SMITH: I oughta throw you after that walkie- talkie but I'm going to give you a break because you're an amateur.
MR. SMITH: Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker.
MR. SMITH: Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.
MR. SMITH: There was this guy. Big guy. Irish- Italian. Red-faced, black-haired, jolly son-of-a-bitch.
MR. SMITH: Nobody could make me laugh like him. We closed more bars together than I can count. He was my pal. I loved that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to say it. But he was fuck-up. He had this image of himself. Thought he was con man. Always trying to shave the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always miss him. Tell me why.
GENE: MR. SMITH
MR. SMITH: Tell me why I miss him.
GENE: He's dead?
MR. SMITH: That's right. He's dead. Tell me How should I.?
GENE: How should I.?
MR. SMITH: Tell me why he's dead.
GENE: You killed him.
MR. SMITH: That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
MR. SMITH: I loved that motherfucker but I got the call and I put him down like a sick animal. So if you've got any doubts about what's going to happen if you don't deliver let me tell you something. I'd make gravy out of your little girl just to season that black Irish cocksucker's meat.
MR. SMITH: Do what you're supposed to do. Do it
MR. SMITH: ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM In the crowd, GENE is bumped this way and that. His face displays an inner devastation. His eyes focus desperately on something ahead: It is the back of ELEANOR GRANT'S head. She is turning this way and that, greeting supporters. GENE's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun. He is at the end of his rope. He is going to do it.
TOM BRADLEY: It is my extreme pleasure this afternoon to introduce to you.
TOM BRADLEY: .a woman who can only be characterized as a one-of-a-kind.
TOM BRADLEY: An iconoclast with class.
KRISTA: The elevator. You weren't feeling
TOM BRADLEY: A genuine lady who's not afraid to get into the trenches.
KRISTA: Are you better now?
TOM BRADLEY: .and go to the mat with greedy special interests. The finest Governor our state has ever had.
TOM BRADLEY: The finest Governor our state has ever had.
TOM BRADLEY: My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor
GENE: My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
KRISTA: Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
GENE: You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
KRISTA: Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
GENE: Look.my daughter . she's going to die.unless you can help me.
KRISTA: Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist you, he's our.
GENE: ( sotto voce ) No! You have to listen to me.
KRISTA: I'm listening, I'm listening.
ELEANOR GRANT: My friends, my good friends.
GENE: Please.please.you have to believe me. They have my daughter. They want me to kill Eleanor Grant  or they'll kill my daughter.
KRISTA: All right, let's just.let's get security in on this.
GENE: No! You can't! They're in on it.
KRISTA: I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- I don't know. One of them is following me. If he knew what I'd just told you they'd.
GENE: I don't know. One of them is following me. If he knew what I'd just told you they'd.
GENE: Look, how did I get in here with
KRISTA: I don't know.
GENE: You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
KRISTA: It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
GENE: You're right, it is. Will you trust me now?
GENE: Will you trust me now?
KRISTA: I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's one person we can go to.
GENE: The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
KRISTA: He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
KRISTA: We've got about ten minutes.
GENE: Are you sure?
KRISTA: I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him. We will.
GENE: Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
KRISTA: Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
GENE: She starts to lead him away.
GENE: He stops her, points to the gun she still holds.
GENE: I think you better put that away.
KRISTA: I think you're right.
ELEANOR GRANT: But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy us, has a curious way of giving us
ELEANOR GRANT: I doubt if I would be before you now, if I hadn't been put through that crucible of loss.
ELEANOR GRANT: And though I can never forget William and Bill Junior or the love I felt for them.
ELEANOR GRANT: I have found joy again in serving this great state. I have found love again in my second husband Brendan.
GENE: Where are we going?
HALL GUARD: Ms. Brooks .
KRISTA: Is he in?
HALL GUARD: Yes, ma'am.
GENE: Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
KRISTA: I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
BRENDAN GRANT: What is it? Is there a problem?
KRISTA: We need to see you, Brendan.
GENE: ( to KRISTA ) We have to hurry.
KRISTA: I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
BRENDAN GRANT: What? What are you talking about?
KRISTA: We need people we can "trust. We only have a few moments.
BRENDAN GRANT: This is.this is insane. How do you know this?
GENE: I know it because I'm the one who's supposed to kill her.
BRENDAN GRANT: You are!? You brought this man here!? You brought this man to my room!?
KRISTA: I had to. Her Security people may be
MYSTERY MAN: Is there a problem, Brendan?
BRENDAN GRANT: There certainly is. This man says he's been hired to kill Eleanor.
GENE: Not hired. They're blackmailing me.
MYSTERY MAN: Who is this "they"?
GENE: I don't.I don't know. Please, Mr. Grant! They have my daughter. I'm not some lunatic. Your wife is in trouble. Someone is trying to kill her. Someone is trying to make me kill her. Please, listen.
MYSTERY MAN: And on the strength of this story, you bring this man to Brendan's suite? Does that show good judgment, Ms. Brooks? I'm just a friend of Brendan's, but it seems to me.
KRISTA: He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
MYSTERY MAN: ( beat ) He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
KRISTA: He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
MYSTERY MAN: I see. Where is this gun?
KRISTA I: Have it.
MYSTERY MAN: Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
KRISTA: It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
MYSTERY MAN: Could I see it?
MYSTERY MAN: My goodness. It certainly looks real.
MYSTERY MAN: What's your opinion? You're the expert in these matters, supposedly.
BRENDAN GRANT: Jesus Christ!
MR. SMITH: ( calmly, staring at
GENE ): Yeah, I'd say it's real.
MYSTERY MAN: Are you out of your fucking mind!?

MR. SMITH: Help me get her off the rug.
BRENDAN GRANT: What have you done to me!? Christ
GENE: He tries to rush to the bathroom but MR. SMITH is right there, gripping him. GENE struggles frantically, uselessly, watching the bathroom door close. MR. SMITH is beyond anger. He grabs GENE'S throat, muscles down. GENE grips the iron hand that's cutting off his air.
MR. SMITH: You fucked up.
MR. SMITH: You want me to kill your kid!? You want me to kill you!?
MYSTERY MAN: Don't let him go!
GENE: I killed you.
MR. SMITH: You fucked up.
BRENDAN GRANT: I'm on record. I never wanted this. I wanted simplicity; a telescopic sight, a powerful rifle, but no. What was good enough for Oswald wasn't good enough for you two. You had to get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off the street, stick a gun in his hand.
MYSTERY MAN: It's academic now. She had to be What were you going to do, Brendan? Lock her in a closet? You're in the fucking kitchen now. Get used to the heat. He's been seen all over the hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes. We even got him on video. It'll work. Don't worry about it.

MYSTERY MAN: ( about GENE ) Is he awake?
MR. SMITH: He yanks GENE to his feet.
BRENDAN GRANT: Oh Great. Why don't we just give him our home phone numbers while we're at it?
MR. SMITH: It doesn't matter what he hears.
MR. SMITH: That's what it looks like. She was alive a minute ago. Now she's dead. Because you wouldn't do what I told you to do.
MYSTERY MAN: Get going. You've only got a few minutes to pull it together.
MYSTERY MAN: It's too late for that.
BRENDAN GRANT: There is a dead woman on my bathroom What about it? She's Eleanor's assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun, by the same lunatic. Some, anonymous loser who went over the edge.
MYSTERY MAM: What about it? She's Eleanor's assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun, by the same lunatic. Some, anonymous loser who went over the edge.
BRENDAN GRANT: ( breathing easier ) Only thing better would be if he were a postal worker.
OFFICER TRUST: He won't be doing any work once I get through with him.
MYSTERY MAN: And in a few months you're in the Governor's mansion. The people'd make you king of California if they

GENE: How am I supposed to get away?
MR. SMITH: That's not my problem, Mr. Watson

GENE: How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
MR. SMITH: ( into the walkie-talkie ) Come Back..Fucking Radio.
MR.SMITH: I told you she'd be alright, if you do your job.
GENE: And I'm supposed to trust you?
MR. SMITH: What choice do you have?
MR. SMITH: After you.
MR. SMITH: Look out there! You see the van?
MR. SMITH: You see it?!
MR. SMITH: Come back.
MR. SMITH: Do it!
GENE: He struggles to turn around. MR. SMITH kidney punches him, hard! GENE goes down on one knee. The car stops. SOMEONE starts to board it, stops in surprise. MR. SMITH sticks a badge in their face.
MR. SMITH: Security. Take the next car.
MR. SMITH: ( a gasp ) No, please.
GENE: ( a gasp ) No, please.
MR. SMITH: You got one last chance. Half an hour and that kid is dead. I'll kill her myself. I'll rip her fucking head off right in front of you!
OMIT: INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:01PM GENE staggers over to the row of sinks. Leaning on one sink with both hands, his body shudders violently. And he throws A man exits a toilet stall and walks toward the sinks. He sees GENE retching, turns away in disgust, and leaves quickly. GENE turns on the faucets.to wash the mess away. He tries to clean up, but catches his reflection in the mirror. He has trouble looking himself in the eye.
MR. SMITH: The next time I tell you to do something, you goddamn well do it!
MS. JONES: Hey, fuck you! You want to baby-sit a screaming kid in traffic, come out here and do it yourself. He got the message, didn't he?
HUEY: ( still not looking up ) Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in

HUEY: What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.

HUEY: Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change? You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
MR. SMITH: Come on, let's get some privacy.
GENE: He's deaf.
GENE: He can't hear a word we're saying.
MR. SMITH: You wouldn't be kidding me now, would you, Mr. Watson? Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can't hear me? Nigger?
HUEY: Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient just got multiplied by two. What do you think of that? You'll have to forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm deef as a post. Compliments of the United States Army. .Artillery Corps. Can I give you a shine, sir? You don't see your face, you don't pay.

GENE: What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
MR. SMITH: ( glances again at HUEY ) You know what I'm gonna do.
GENE: What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
GENE: It would be a lot less trouble just to let me talk to her.
MR. SMITH: ( into it ) Come Back.
MR. SMITH: Put her on.
MR. SMITH: Just put her on.
GENE: Yes, sweetie, it's me.
GENE: I know you do, honey.
LYNN: Can we go now?
LYNN: To be a hero?
GENE: No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
GENE: He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
MR. SMITH: That's enough.
GENE: Will you promise me that?
GENE: All right. Kisses to you.
GENE: No. Kisses to you.
MR. SMITH: I don't care who the fuck you do it for just so you do it. Hey. You done yet?
MR. SMITH: You done yet?
HUEY: Just about.
HUEY: Two dollars, if it pleases you.

HUEY: Cover your mouth.
GENE: This gorilla's watching you, is that That's right.
HUEY: This gorilla's watching you, is that That's right.
GENE: That's right.

HUEY: That was your kid on the walkie- My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
GENE: My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.

HUEY: What are you supposed to do?
GENE: Kill the Governor.
HUEY: I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
GENE: One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
HUEY: The Governor. If I could just talk to her.
GENE: The Governor. If I could just talk to her.
HUEY: Oh, Jesus .

HUEY: Then why'd you drag me into it?
GENE: ( getting emotional ) It's my kid. I've got to.to somehow.do right by my little girl.

WAITRESS: Here's your Ginger Ale, sir.
TV REPORTER: They're all the same.
TV REPORTER: You know what bothers me?
TV REPORTER: When they get all weepy eyed about the "ordinary citizen", the "regular Joe", the "normal American". Gimme a break. There ain't no such animal. We're a nation of two hundred forty million special interest groups.
GENE: Well, I'm just a regular guy.
TV REPORTER: Is that right?
GENE: Yeah, that's right. But I've built a good solid business out of nothing. Don't underestimate the regular guy.
BARTENDER: Sir, you haven't paid.

GENE: Irene is going to help.
HUEY: Irene is going to help.
GENE: Thank you.
GENE: Where am I going?
HUEY: You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
GENE: You're going to go see her.
HUEY: You're going to go see her.
GENE: The elevator doors close.
HUEY: You sure she's asleep?
IRENE: I took up extra pillows. She take a nap before her big speech.
GENE: What am I supposed to say to her?
HUEY: It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable
HUEY: ( shocked )
GENE: ( softly ) Excuse me.
ELEANOR GRANT: Who the hell are you?
GENE: No, please. Mrs. Grant, Governor.I won't hurt My security people are right next I appreciate that.
GENE: Mrs. Grant, Governor.I won't hurt My security people are right next I appreciate that.
ELEANOR GRANT: My security people are right next I appreciate that.
GENE: I appreciate that.
ELEANOR GRANT: One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
GENE: If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
ELEANOR GRANT: That's.a comfort to hear.
GENE: I have a problem.
ELEANOR GRANT: Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
GENE: Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
ELEANOR GRANT: I remember you.in the elevator.
GENE: That's right.
ELEANOR GRANT: You were very nervous.
GENE: It was because I had this.in my
GENE: I need you to listen to me. Carefully. Three lives depend on you listening very carefully to what I have to
ELEANOR GRANT: ( friendly as can be ) Of course. But suppose we set up an appointment. I have an important speech to deliver and you're cutting into my nap time. Krista Brooks is dead.
GENE: Krista Brooks is dead.
ELEANOR GRANT: How do you know that?
GENE: I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
ELEANOR GRANT: You shot her?
GENE: ELEANOR GRANT
ELEANOR GRANT: Who did?
GENE: I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your And your husband works for somebody What the hell are you saying?
ELEANOR GRANT: And your husband works for somebody What the hell are you saying?
GENE: And your husband works for somebody What the hell are you saying?
ELEANOR GRANT: What the hell are you saying?
HECTOR: He's gone.
HECTOR: Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long? You need to eat more fiber.
GENE: I knew you wouldn't believe me.
ELEANOR GRANT: I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you I don't blame you. I don't have any proof. But nothing like this occurs in a vacuum. You can't be totally oblivious. You must suspect something. You're doing things which are making people angry. People who have been in power a long time are losing their jobs. You know them better than me. How much does it mean to them? How far would they go to hang onto it?
GENE: I don't blame you. I don't have any proof. But nothing like this occurs in a vacuum. You can't be totally oblivious. You must suspect something. You're doing things which are making people angry. People who have been in power a long time are losing their jobs. You know them better than me. How much does it mean to them? How far would they go to hang onto it?
GENE: There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
ELEANOR GRANT: ( smiling, covering her inner thought ) I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
GENE: It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
ELEANOR GRANT: I love it when pistolero's talk of
GENE: This? I've never even fired one.
ELEANOR GRANT: ELEANOR GRANT'S hand sweeps the lamp off the table, plunging the room into blackness.
ELEANOR GRANT: ( in the blackness ) Franco! Franco.'
FRANCO: What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!?
ELEANOR GRANT: I.I'm afraid I've had a bad dream,
HUEY: I don't know.
GENE: I don't know.
HUEY: What are you going to do now?
GENE: I don't know. I have to get back.
HUEY: What are you going to do!?
GENE: This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
MR. SMITH: In the john.

MR. SMITH: Out of there, Mr. Watson! Your time's
MR. SMITH: You forgot to wash your hands.
MR. SMITH: I've got faith in you, Mr. Watson. I know you're not just a regular guy, see, I know that. Even if you don't know it yourself. Maybe that's why I picked you.
GENE: I know what I have to do. I'll do it. Let's go.
BRENDAN GRANT: Hey, El, how's the head?
MYSTERY MAN: She nods, turns back to the mirror.
ELEANOR GRANT: Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
BRENDAN GRANT: It's an important speech.
MYSTERY MAN: I'd say critical, not that it's any of my business.
ELEANOR GRANT: It's just another speech in a Tower of Babel so high that Nimrod himself would be put to shame. Cancel. Make my apologies.
BRENDAN GRANT: Excuse me.
MYSTERY MAN: I'll trot along. Nice to see you,
BRENDAN GRANT: During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
ELEANOR GRANT: What's he doing here?
BRENDAN GRANT: Who, him? Just visiting.
BRENDAN GRANT: He's my friend. And he did help you to get elected, after all.
ELEANOR GRANT: Don't remind me.
BRENDAN GRANT: ( re the broken lamp ) What happened here?
ELEANOR GRANT: Nothing. I broke a lamp. Eleanor, please. I'll put it this way. This speech or a half-dozen rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do you say?
BRENDAN GRANT: Eleanor, please. I'll put it this way. This speech or a half-dozen rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do you say?
ELEANOR GRANT: Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
BRENDAN GRANT: Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the
ELEANOR GRANT: All right, I'll do it.
BRENDAN GRANT: That's my girl.
ELEANOR GRANT: But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
BRENDAN GRANT: Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
ELEANOR GRANT: You sent my assistant on an errand.
BRENDAN GRANT: ( trying to look sheepish ) I've been a bad boy.
POLITICO: Ladies, gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to introduce to you the esteemed spouse of our Governor. Let's give a big L.A. welcome to Mr. Brendan Grant.
BRENDAN GRANT: Ladies and gentlemen of the press, campaign volunteers, and those of you who were looking for any excuse to take off work for the afternoon.
BRENDAN GRANT: We have with us today the first woman Governor of our great state.
BRENDAN GRANT: Governor Eleanor Samara Grant. What can I say about her..that won't get me in trouble when I get home
BRENDAN GRANT: She's a woman who loves our great I can't get shit on this stupid radio.
BRENDAN GRANT: A brilliant legislator.

GENE: Look out!
BRENDAN GRANT: My God, he did it!
OFFICER TRUST: You little son of a bitch.
ELEANOR GRANT: Are you all right, Franco?
FRANCO: ( painfully ) I'd be better if they'd put sleeves on these damn vests.
MS. JONES: ( on the walkie talkie ) It's time..You read me? I don't hear from you I'm going ahead now.
LYNN: Why do you keep looking at me?
MS. JONES: That's my job. I'm your babysitter.

LYNN: I'm not a big girl but I'm not a

HUEY: You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
MS. JONES: No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
HUEY: Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
MS. JONES: For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
HUEY: It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.

MS. JONES: Goddammit, give it to me, you
