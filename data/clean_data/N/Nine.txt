NINE: Written by
GUIDO: You kill your film several times, mostly by talking about it. A film is a dream. You kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it - but then it dies again, buried in film cans. Mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room, a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when, finally, an audience sits in the dark, if you're lucky very lucky - and sometimes I've been lucky - the dream flickers back to life again. That's why I'm secretive.
GUIDO: Finally, a serious question.

GUIDO: ( looking around, Why is there no fire escape in here? What if somebody needed to escape? I can't face these reporters. I have nothing to say.
LILLI: You'll be fine. You're a world class liar, darling, go out there and lie for Italy, lie for Italia.
GUIDO: What the hell's wrong with me? I can't sleep. I can't think. I can't write. I can't breathe. My heart is racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you flowers, I know. I'll come to the cemetery at the weekend. You should have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I could visit you every week. Don't look at me like that.
MAMMA: ( with kindly patience ) Oh, Guido, Guido.
MAMMA: This is your Rome, Guido. The world sees Rome the way you invented it. Your films did that.

GUIDO: Grazie. Maestro Contini, your new film is called Italia. big title.
DINARDO: Grazie. Maestro Contini, your new film is called Italia. big title.
GUIDO: Actually, it's my shortest title yet.
DINARDO: But hardly a modest one.
GUIDO: Films are not modest. They cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people. So they should have grand titles.
DINARDO: And might you tell the press what the film is about?
GUIDO: Why? I still don't know what my last film was about.
LEOPARDI: ( In a loud aside to That was the problem. Nobody else did.
GUIDO: Of course I can tell you what my film is about.I can tell you the story, I can tell you who I am going to cast, the music I want to use, I can tell you everything. but. I. won't. I'm afraid that if I say anything, the word might get out to the Press. Our next film will be exactly as it sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a woman, Italy as a dream.
DANTE: Our next film will be exactly as it sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a woman, Italy as a dream.
LEOPARDI: Is this true?

REPORTER FOUR: But she hasn't worked at all since working with you.
REPORTER FIVE: But why are you being so tight-lipped about this film? It's a serious question. What's the big deal?

GUIDO: Oh yes, very much so. Not as much as I would like to be, not as much as you would like me to be, I'm sure, but certainly yes, I'm trying.
CARDINAL: Try harder.
GUIDO: Yes, yes. I will, I will. Your Eminence, I am not happy. I'm searching for something. I feel a sense of misery, of despair and
CARDINAL: ( interrupting ) I saw your films. Not the flops, the others, the good ones. But you think people need to see so much sex? It's not necessary. We can all imagine.
GUIDO: ( laughing ) Excuse me - my films are what I Then your imagination has no moral ( nonplussed ) How do you train the imagination?
CARDINAL: Then your imagination has no moral How do you train the imagination?
GUIDO: ( nonplussed ) How do you train the imagination?
CARDINAL: The imagination is God's garden; don't let the Devil play in it. Teach our Italian women to be wives, not whores, don't make us look at filth and debauchery. Make us proud to be
YOUNG GUIDO: ( not loud enough ) ( louder )
BOYS: Saraghina! Saraghina!
YOUNG GUIDO: ( loudest ) Saraghina! Sa-ra-ghina!
SARAGHINA: So, you little Italian devils, you want to know about love? Saraghina will tell you.and if you want to make a woman happy, you rely on what you were born with. Because it is in your blood.
SARAGHINA: ( sings )

MAMMA: I am ashamed of you, Guido.
YOUNG GUIDO: But Mamma, what did I do.
PRINCIPAL: Bring him here. That savage is the devil. God will punish you for your sins, now and forever.
CARLA: What? What?
GUIDO: I can't breathe, I can't breathe.
CARLA: Guido, don't die on me! Can you imagine. poor Luigi! It would kill If I die it would kill your husband?
GUIDO: ( finding her ridiculous ) If I die it would kill your husband?
CARLA: No, that's not what I meant, Guidino. No. Where are you going?
GUIDO: I have to go to work. Carla, I can't
CARLA: Let me come with you.
GUIDO: It's impossible.
CARLA: Because it's impossible. Please.
GUIDO: Because it's impossible. Please.
CARLA: But why is it impossible? Look at your producer! He's married, he brings his girlfriend to work and nobody cares. Guido. Everybody knows about me. Why? Why won't you let me near you?
GUIDO: For the very same reason you don't want me to die on top of you. It's not fair to your husband. It's not fair to my wife.
CARLA: See, you're playing with me. You're twisting everything. Please let me come with you.
GUIDO: Guido heads towards the door, still dressing.
CARLA: I'll be here waiting for you with my legs open.
GUIDO: Let's say there were ten sequences, each one set in a different period, but played by the same cast, a man and a woman, a woman and a man. Something light and hectic - like Mozart would do it, like Figaro. Like the circus.
DANTE: Claudia is going to be amazing.
BENITO: It sounds like a masterpiece.
FAUSTO: ( hissing at Dante ) Dante, you see, he hasn't written a ( defending his director ) The screenplay is first of all a map. That's a map.
DANTE: ( defending his director ) The screenplay is first of all a map. That's a map.
GUIDO: Let's try to dig for something else. Maybe a group of people digging, with shovels, in the desert.
LILLI: She nudges him. He looks across the restaurant to see his wife at the entrance looking for him.
GUIDO: He jumps up from the table and hurries towards the dance floor, genuinely happy.
LUISA: The jungle drums said it was an The jungle drums exaggerated just a tiny bit.
GUIDO: The jungle drums exaggerated just a tiny bit.

GUIDO: I hope not. Happy Birthday, my

CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: Oh no.
LUISA: CARDINAL'S SECRETARY ( To Guido )
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: I was telling your husband how much I admire his movies. Publicly, you know the Church condemns them - we have to - but we all love them. Last year we did our own version of your Il Vicolo at the Christmas That I would pay to see.
LILLI: That I would pay to see.
GUIDO: Luisa was in that film.
LILLI: She was the best thing in the movie.
GUIDO: It's true. It was your first part.
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: Of course! - you're Luisa Acari! Oh my Lord!
LUISA: I was.
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: You can't stop being somebody.

LUISA: Excuse me, I suddenly feel very tired.
GUIDO: I'm staggered by my own stupidity. I could vomit.
LUISA: I'm staggered by my own stupidity. I could vomit.
GUIDO: Luisa - will you please just tell me what happened?
LUISA: You open your mouth and a lie comes What lie?
GUIDO: What lie?
LUISA: Why am I surprised? - it's like breathing to you.
CARLA: Raging, he grabs her and frogmarches her out the door.
CARLA: ( trying to explain ) I was hungry. I'm tired of eating alone in that room.
GUIDO: There are plenty of restaurants.
CARLA: I wanted to see the hotel. I told you I came here with my parents when I was little. I didn't come to disturb you.
GUIDO: Well you certainly managed to.
CARLA: Why didn't you tell me Luisa was going to be here!
GUIDO: I didn't know she was here. She just turned up.
CARLA: Well, she could have warned you.
GUIDO: The only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me. A taxi, please, for the Signora.
GUIDO O.S: A taxi, please, for the Signora.
GUIDO: Carla, you have to wait outside.
CARLA: Will you wait with me?
GUIDO: I'm in the middle of a working dinner with my colleagues.
CARLA: So why do I have to wait outside?
GUIDO: ( shamed ) I'll find someone to escort you home.
DE ROSSI: ( carefully ) Signora, would you rather wait inside?
CARLA: I'm going to walk. Please tell my friend I had to leave.
GUIDO: Apparently she's staying in some grotesque pensione next to the
LUISA: ( without opening her eyes ) Very plausible.
GUIDO: Because it's true.
LUISA: You told me it was finished.
GUIDO: It is. Look, she was worried about me, she came to see if I was all right - which yes, is stupid but not, as far as I know, a crime, and hardly a mortal sin.
LUISA: Nothing. If you could see yourself. I couldn't live with it - the absurdity of being you, the effort of having to hide and lie and cheat. It's exhausting, no wonder you've got no script, you're too busy inventing your own life.
GUIDO: It's finished. It's finished. If it wasn't before, it is now.
LUISA: ( lying back on her bed ) Blah blah blah blah blah.
GUIDO: A voice comes from behind him.
GUIDO: Yes, I remember very well, Stephanina from Vogue.
STEPHANIE: So, coincidence. You being here. And me being here.
GUIDO: ( taking his glasses off ) Amazing. May I take a cigarette?
STEPHANIE: That was quite a performance. At the Press Conference. The Vanishing Act.
GUIDO: ( paying ) ( eyeing Guido ) I've seen all your movies.
STEPHANIE: ( eyeing Guido ) I've seen all your movies.
GUIDO: ( eyeing Guido ) I've seen all your movies.
STEPHANIE: ( eyeing Guido ) I've seen all your movies.
GUIDO: ( lights their cigarettes ) Like a million times. They're the only movies that tell the truth about the modern world.
STEPHANIE: Like a million times. They're the only movies that tell the truth about the modern world.
GUIDO: And what truth is that?
STEPHANIE: ( thinks ) Death of religion. Sexual I don't think religion is dead. And what exactly is the sexual revolution?

STEPHANIE: That we can talk about later.

STEPHANIE: It's great: you care as much about the suit as the man wearing it.
GUIDO: I hate that man.
STEPHANIE: No! Style is the new content! It's what my readers love. They want to dress like Claudia Jenssen. They want to undress like Claudia Jenssen. They want to ride on a Vespa down the Via Veneto. They want to live in an Italian movie.

CARLA: ( distant ) You came.
GUIDO: ( taking her hand ) I'm here. Signor Contini.
DOCTOR RONDI: Signor Contini.
CARLA: Come back.
DOCTOR RONDI: She took five or six pills, enough to make herself very sick. I understand she's your mistress. This is a sordid business. You movie people, I suppose you don't consider yourself bound by morality.
GUIDO: Thank you. I'm going to stay with her If you need us for anything, just call, okay? Francesca, andiamo.
MATRON: If you need us for anything, just call, okay? Francesca, andiamo.

MINE!: YES, MINE!
YES, MINE!: She gently spins Young Guido, and - as he completes the turn - he is replaced by Older Guido. Mamma now waltzes with her adult son.

DANTE: We're going back to Rome.
GUIDO: ( anxious ) Where's Luisa?
DANTE: Luisa? She's gone. She's had it with And quite frankly, so have I. You drag a whole crew up here and then you just disappear.
GUIDO: ( sits ) I can't.
DANTE: You can't. You must. Don't sit down.
GUIDO: I need help.
DANTE: ( still packing ) You've had help. You've seen the doctors, you've seen the priests, you've taken the cure.
GUIDO: I'm not cured.
DANTE: ( decisive, no arguments ) That's enough! The movie calls, your star has landed. Fausto - take his things please.
PIERPAOLO: Maestro, the screen tests are back from the lab. Will you watch them now?
DANTE: Tonight. We'll watch everything tonight and make some decisions.
PIERPAOLO: Design meeting? Production meeting?
DANTE: Dante marches Guido towards the stage. Lilli joins
PIERPAOLO: Dante marches Guido towards the stage. Lilli joins
LILLI: Claudia says where are you? She's in fine form. Feisty.
GUIDO: ( knows what that means ) She asked if she could read my script as she didn't have one. I said I didn't quite have mine.
LILLI: She asked if she could read my script as she didn't have one. I said I didn't quite have mine.
LUISA: Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up. I want you to be with me in the screening room tonight. I want to talk to you about the casting, about the script. Everything.
GUIDO: Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up. I want you to be with me in the screening room tonight. I want to talk to you about the casting, about the script. Everything.

GUIDO: Now just one slow turn for us.
CLAUDIA: ( she turns around ) Okay, one slow turn.
GUIDO: Bellissima. Brava. Cut.
PIERPAOLO: We've got it. Next costume please.
CLAUDIA: Has anybody got a script? Script missing, handsome reward.. Lost, one script, title Italia. Can't make a film without it.
PIERPAOLO: ( anxious ) But please, just a couple more costumes, Claudia.
CLAUDIA: ( to Guido ) I'm going back to my hotel now, my darling, and when I there is a script, I'll read it and then we'll take it from there. ( calls over to Lilli ) I love the costumes, Lilli. They are ( back to the guys, Ciao Bello.
GUIDO: That's fair.
DANTE: ( to Dante ) That's fair.

DANTE: ( calling to Guido ) You've got dailies, Guido.
GUIDO: I'll be right back.
DANTE: ( shouting ) You've got meetings.
GUIDO: You look ravishing.
CLAUDIA: You're not seeing me, you're seeing Lilli's wigs and makeup, I'm somewhere hidden underneath.
GUIDO: It's good to see you.
CLAUDIA: I'm assuming that's code for there's no script.
GUIDO: Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed with the script? Talk to the people who love you in our films, they're not interested in my script! They're interested in the way you turn your head, the way the camera looks past you to the moon. the way you smile a little as you cry, the way you really do blush for the camera - how?! - who even knows, but whatever else it is, it's not my script.
CLAUDIA: So Lilli says I'm playing a million different parts -
GUIDO: Not a million - you're the muses, the incredible women who made Italy what it is today, a country run by men - who are themselves run by women, whether they know it or not.
CLAUDIA: ( teasing him ) So I'm the women behind the great men?
GUIDO: ( trying hard to tell the The great women.
CLAUDIA: ( deflating ) And these muses - they fall in love with the man?
GUIDO: Exactly! They fall in love with him.
CLAUDIA: ( decisive ) I'd rather be the man.
GUIDO: I'd rather be the man.
CLAUDIA: I'd rather be the man.
CLAUDIA: IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, ONE TIME I NEEDED YOU, IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, YOU WERE MY FRIEND. MAYBE IT LASTED A DAY, MAYBE IT LASTED AN HOUR, BUT SOMEHOW IT WILL NEVER END. These women who come off their pedestals for a kiss - they're just No, you misunderstand.
CLAUDIA: These women who come off their pedestals for a kiss - they're just No, you misunderstand.
GUIDO: No, you misunderstand.
CLAUDIA: IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU, IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, I WANT TO CRY. SOMETHING INSIDE ME GOES WEAK, SOMETHING INSIDE ME SURRENDERS, AND YOU'RE THE REASON WHY, YOU'RE THE REASON WHY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO TO ME. YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE. YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME LOOKING AT YOU. IT SCARES ME SO THAT I CAN HARDLY She's his inspiration.
GUIDO: She's his inspiration.
CLAUDIA: I can't keep playing that part.
GUIDO: I fall in love with you every time.
CLAUDIA: When there's a camera between us.
GUIDO: It's not a real person, Guido. And this man you describe - he doesn't know how to love.
CLAUDIA: It's not a real person, Guido. And this man you describe - he doesn't know how to love.
GUIDO: There was a time once, we were on location, some terrible hotel - and you were in the room directly above me and I could hear you walking about.
CLAUDIA: And why didn't you?
GUIDO: I don't know. I don't know.
CLAUDIA: SPECIAL TO ME IN MY LIFE, SINCE THE FIRST DAY THAT I MET YOU. HOW COULD I EVER FORGET YOU, ONCE YOU HAD TOUCHED MY SOUL. IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, YOU'VE MADE ME WHOLE.

BENITO: She's a very funny actress.
DANTE: She's peculiar. You don't like her
FAUSTO: She's very natural.

GUIDO: ( dawning on him ) What are you talking about?
LUISA: And this is our life. You think to create is to forgive yourself in public. Fine. But don't think I can forgive you in private, because I can't ever.
LUISA: SO GO AHEAD TAKE IT ALL YOU WANT MY SOUL? TAKE IT ALL! IT'S TIME TO LEAVE. IF I'M TO LIVE. BECAUSE I HAVE NO MORE, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE.

LILLI: Guido, she's my friend. I'm not her mother. I don't know. I expect so. Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me you're going to let me cut your hair and get rid of that awful beard.
GUIDO: I like to get about without everybody pointing at me.
LILLI: And where are you getting about?
GUIDO: Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be able to walk.
LILLI: Are you seeing anybody?
GUIDO: No, no. Nobody.
LILLI: ( teasing ) Well, it sounds exciting. Walking around and not seeing anyone, growing a beard. I might come up here and join you.
GUIDO: Don't tease me, Lilli. My heart is -
