COLONEL THOMPSON: Activate laser mic.
CALLISTER: Is it him?
TRANSLATOR: Four males, one of them's speaking with a.. I think it's a Rakhshaniâ¢dialect, consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei.
COLONEL THOMPSON: Gimme voiceprint analysis. The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation. VOICEPRINT ANALYSIS finishes, the; screen shows a FILE PHOTO of a
CALLISTER: I'm not taking 37% to-the President. John, weigh in here? He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via teleconference from the White House Situation Room:
TECHIE: Sire they're pulling off the highway.
TECHIE #2: We have abort recommendation. The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: "RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION." The source of this recommendation, for now, remains a mystery.
COLONEL THOMPSON: If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding once in a lifetime, we can't let him go.
CALLISTER: ( beat, torn ) Alright, stay with him.
TECHIE: We've got AK-47's, RPC's, Chaparral guided missiles
COLONEL THOMPSON: Looks like a training camp. THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm. MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man SNAP: THE PENTAGON: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears. A DIGITAL WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: "5I$ PROBABLE MATCH -
TECHIE: 51%. 'Abort' rec holds. THE DESERT: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as they begin MOVING toward a large WOODEN PLANK on the desert floor. Some of the men take hold of the plank, drag it back to reveal. a PIT. THE PENTAGON: SAME IMAGE in real-time on the feeds:
CALLISTER: What is that, a weapons cache?
ANALYST: Sir, the placement of stones around the pit, markers for the Five Pillars of Islam. I think it's a funeral. Everyone trades looks this just got even more complicated. THE DESERT: from the back of a TENTED TRUCK, a BODY is lifted, shrouded in white. The men carry it through blowing sand. the procession stopping at the pit. They begin lowering the body. THE PENTAGON: on monitors, a section of the GENEVA CONVENTION
TECHIE: Sir, striking a funeral would put us in violation of the Geneva convention.
COLONEL THOMPSON: Once this guy's gone, he's gone. The PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL pipes in
TECHIE #2: I have POTUS calling from Air Force One.
CALLISTER: ( a beat, looks around ). Everyone agree this is the best course of No one dissents. Callister picks up:
CALLISTER: Yessir. we gauge our strategy by two standards: the highest probability of success with the least amount of collateral damage. At 51% probability, we don't have either one.
GENERAL THOMPSON: And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir, we're putting our people at risk. There's a long silence as the President considers.
CALLISTER: ( hangs up ) We're weapons free. And with deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets:

Though the White House has denied involvement, Shia leaders have denounced the U.S. as responsible. AL-JAZEERA FOOTAGE: A SHIA SPOKESMAN is translated into ENGLISH:
SPOKESMAN: Your embassies were only the beginning! Our warriors are already within your borders. Until American leadership is removed from power, Allah's revenge is upon you! And during all this, Jerry notices something: people are glancing at each other aranoid. What a fucking world.

MRS. WIERZBOWSKI: Perhaps many things. When I rescue Johann from pound, they say he was abuse.
JERRY: This is vodka Jesus, its eight- thirty in the morning

MRS. MILLER: I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs. Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them. Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto
RACHEL: You see all these kids? They're all calling their mothers. You just do it It's only two days,: mom. Y'know. you could try and some have fun too, wouldn't kill ya..

JERRY: I'm trying, you know, just to But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss. Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry hugs him back tightly, grateful and starting to feel again. And just then, William says, quietly, through tears:
WILLIAM: You sound just like him. Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls back. Takes his wallet from his pocket:
JERRY: No. Dad, I'm okay. I'm doing really well. I promise. His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars. It's a stand-off. The question is: does Jerry have enough pride to reject the offer? And the answer is.
JERRY: Jerry stabs cancel again. Now TEN MORE $100 bills-come out. He glances at the people in line, nervous
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI: Jerry! All day they make delivery! Jerry moves fast to her, a little out of breath shoves a thousand dollars into her hand:

MORGAN: Were you close?
JERRY: Why? What am I doing here. I don't even know who you are. Morgan tosses his black leather BADGE WALLET onto the metal table. It lands open with a substantial CLUNG!

MORGAN: Because you painted it when you were part of the student activist group "Project Underground" at Berkley.

MORGAN: They're headed for the harbor! Gimme roadblocks at Granville and Sheridan! IN THE BMW: Jerry and Rachel speed through an industrial marina. Up ahead, the intersection's closed by a POLICE BARRICADE.

The release arm DROPS the BMW Jerry and Rachel SCREAM as they PLUMMET but the car doesn't hit water, instead it falls onto: A GARBAGE BARGE floating downriver. The car lands in a mountain of trash.

Jerry's knocked the window back opens the control booth door and enters, examines the controls. The computer panel reads: "CONTROL OVERRIDE."
JERRY: this thing's on auto-pilot or something. Which doesn't happen, these barges are operated, by people. He steps out. In thought, tears in her eyes, Rachel asks:
RACHEL: D'youthink she could derail a train?
JERRY: Are you kidding me? She changed every traffic light! This woman's called me on other people's phones some dude who happened to be sitting next to me! His phone rang it was her! For me!

"JERRY RACHEL: "Swim to shore? Are you she wants us to swim ?! Lady, what if I told you we don't know how to swim.
JERRY: Lady, what if I told you we don't know how to swim.
WOMAN'S VOICE: But you do. I've seen you at the beach ( Jerry is chilled ) And the female was once a swimming instructor at the YMCA in Westport, Connecticut. Go now or the authorities will find you. They're more dangerous than the water.
JERRY: She called you "the female." ( beat, weird ) That's like. something a foreigner would say, like a bad translation. But she has no accent.
RACHEL: Jerry, that's your name, right? Are we Does it bring back memories of Westport Y?

STORE OWNER: I do a lot of custom jobs, never seen something like this before. I can have it for you by the end of the week. The Middle Eastern Man. MUMBLING again in Tajiki. Seemingly, to himself. The Store Owner stares, kinda freaked out
STORE OWNER: Listen, Mister The Middle Eastern Man suddenly touches his ear, BARKS out something in Tajiki. Like he's arguing with someone.

AGENT GRANT: Yes sir! As Morgan hops up onto the moving chopper
MORGAN: Nobody who works for me calls me sir. understand?! It's disingenuous might as well be calling me 'asshole.' As Grant watches the chopper take off, perplexed.
RACHEL: So you're a twin.
JERRY: Yeah, I know. that's occurred to me.
RACHEL: So this whole situation is obviously about him.
JERRY: Excuse me? I would offer this whole situation isn't "obviously" about Just think about it: you said your brother worked at the State Department

JERRY: so what?
RACHEL: so that means he could've: been into anythinc he was a twin -:- you..received a shipment of weapons and cash and airplane manuals it seems to me that they sent the stuff to.the wrong brother
JERRY: Wait a minute you're suggesting all that stuff was for Paul? As they approach TOWER 108:
JERRY: he hasn't been dead long enough to become a memory! And if you knew Paul, which you did not, you'd laugh all day at the idea that he was a spy or terrorist or whatever you're implying
RACHEL: I'm implying if not him. then why you?
JERRY: Well hasn't that been the question my whole life. You know how I know Paul wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had been, he would've been the best fucking terrorist in history: he wouldn't have gotten caught, the United States would be a crater he would've won awards for being a great terrorist.
RACHEL: I did just fine driving, thanks. I'm a paralegal I have no connection to Suddenly they're interrupted by the ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST approaching in the distance. Rachel stops dead and on INSTINCT, grabs Jerry's hand, all their mutual hostility vanished:
JERRY: Suddenly they're interrupted by the ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST approaching in the distance. Rachel stops dead and on INSTINCT, grabs Jerry's hand, all their mutual hostility vanished:
RACHEL: Someone's coming. And what's approaching is the "Hassad DryCleaners." van. It comes to a stop and out steps the Middle Eastern Man. Stands some twenty-five feet from them.
JERRY: who are you?
JERRY: what's it for?
RACHEL JERRY: hey! wait, who are you?! You have to tell us what you know!
JERRY: And Jerry takes off after him, he's not letting him go. Catches up to the guy and grabs him. Spinning him round
WAIT!!: And Jerry takes off after him, he's not letting him go. Catches up to the guy and grabs him. Spinning him round
JERRY: who's doing this? And they begin to struggle. Middle Eastern Man's dropped CELL PHONE RINGS. Rachel. Terrified, hesitant. Knows somehow its for her she answers:
WOMAN'S VOICE: Stop him now or he will die.
RACHEL: ( looking around ) How are you seeing us?! Jerry and the Middle Eastern Man. Fighting. Thrashing. Throwing sloppy punches:
WOMAN'S VOICE: Stop him now. CLICK. Rachel turning to SCREAM at Middle Eastern Man
RACHEL: Stop! You have to STOP! When the Middle Eastern Man CRACKS Jerry in the nose and he goes sprawling. He takes off again, yelling back:
RACHEL: She's going to KILL YOU!
JERRY: You killed him. you killed that man.
WOMAN'S VOICE: It was unavoidable. Take the van. Drive CLICK. Rachel's eyes on Jerry.
JERRY RACHEL: she wants us to drive to Indianapolis.: , why? What's there, what? I don't know no, this can't keep gonna tell them?! going anywhere! Jerry can see she's losing it. Grabs her by the shoulders:
JERRY: Rachel. She's watching us. Right now. You wanna die too? Your son? We have to go. Rachel looks right at him, still shaking, knows he's right. And nods. Okay. Okay. As our MUSIC BUILDS, LARGER THAN YOU MIGHT
WEAPONS DEVELOPER: That blast was the result of one single crystal of Hexomethylne. For those of you who are new today, "Rex" is an isotope that leaves no chemical markers it's eighty times more powerful than C4. Odorless. Undetectable. COLONEL THOMPSON, also from our opening, gestures:
COLONEL THOMPSON: Talk about the detonating system. The Developer screws a METAL VALVE into what looks like a can of compressed air, saying:
WEAPONS DEVELOPER: Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency undetectable to the human ear. For this test we made it audible that was the tone you heard before the explosion the tone was the trigger.
CALLISTER: What's the risk that another sound could accidentally detonate it? ( half smile ) A song on a radio? A howling dog?
WEAPONS DEVELOPER: No: the pitch is uniquely programmed and impossible to reproduce.
COLONEL THOMPSON: Fine job.
WEAPONS DEVELOPER: Thank you, sir. We're proud of this ordnance all of us at Halloway-Smith. And while we still HEAR HIM SPEAKING, we CUT TO:

MORGAN: You're kidding me. What capacity?
MORGAN: B what?
LATESHA: That's the point. No one'll tell me. I cross-reffed the SCI database, talked to the Intel committee, NSA gave me..nothing. Krebs doesn't want me to ruffle any feathers. I've been up and down all the ladders and everyone just thinks I'm a WHEN an MP suddenly appears and grabs her by the arm. Stopping her. He towers over her
MP: Interns aren't allowed on this floor, miss. You'll have to When Latesha wearily flashes him her I.D. I've got clearance, pal. He looks at it. Lets her arm go.

PILOT: I got the Williamson County Sheriff on the line Morgan holds up a hand, one second. To Latesha:
MORGAN: Look, I don't have time for this stay there til you get some answers
MORGAN: Simms: step up
LATESHA: Secretary Callister!.: He looks behind him briefly before being shuffled into the meeting room. And SLAM.. The doors close in Latesha's face.
JERRY: how old is he? Your son.
RACHEL: ( in no mood to share ) Kyle. He's nine.
JERRY: What's he doing on a train? She really doesn't want to talk. BUT:
RACHEL: He goes to a music magnet. His school's on a tour of Washington. They're playing at the Kennedy Center.
JERRY: wow. And you. Hm. She turns to him. Eyes burning into the side of his head. Knows what he's thinking.
RACHEL: Parents weren't allowed to go. is that okay with you?
JERRY: Is it okay? I could give a shit.
RACHEL: Then what's with the qualified nod?
JERRY: I'm not allowed to nod?
RACHEL: Not if you're iudging me.
RACHEL: You think I should have gone with him I'm just thinking, sounds like a big deal, especially for a 9-year-old playing at the Kennedy Center I'd just think at least one parent might wanna be there to see it.
JERRY: I'm just thinking, sounds like a big deal, especially for a 9-year-old playing at the Kennedy Center I'd just think at least one parent might wanna be there to see it.
RACHEL: Yeah? How do you know Kyle's dad isn't Well, you're not wearing a ring and you haven't mentioned anyone but your son is on that train. Even the most pissed off ex-wife which I'm not saying you aren't would've mentioned it if her ex's life was threatened and if Kyle was going to meet his dad in DC? You would've tried to call him, too. So where is he? Kyle's dad?
JERRY: Well, you're not wearing a ring and you haven't mentioned anyone but your son is on that train. Even the most pissed off ex-wife which I'm not saying you aren't would've mentioned it if her ex's life was threatened and if Kyle was going to meet his dad in DC? You would've tried to call him, too. So where is he? Kyle's dad?
RACHEL: As if it's any of your business you know what you are ?
JERRY: Insightful? Intuitive? A better driver than you ?
RACHEL: you're one of those "thirties are the new twenties" man-children. You're glib and wry and find humor in people like me who are actually accountable for the ir Okay, the most fascinating thing here? Is that you don't know the first thing about me!
JERRY: Okay, the most fascinating thing here? Is that you don't know the first thing about me!
RACHEL: I know you work at a copy store! What are you, thirty-one, thirty-two? You're obviously articulate
JERRY: love being stuck in a van with my fucking guidance counselor
RACHEL: and I know your brother just died and he worked for the State Department
JERRY: you need to stop talking about my brother, I've had enough of that
RACHEL JERRY: you're in denial if you Ham: I'm not talking about don't think that has anything this to do with what's happening right now -= Dammit!! I'm not kidding! :but I can tell you that Stop! STOP! whatever he did, whatever he was part of has put my son in danger whether you believe it or not!! SCREECH! Jerry YANKS the wheel hard, PEELING across four lanes of traffic. SKIDS to a stop by a curb, pops open the door.
RACHEL: JESUS!WHAT'RE YOU D?'. Jerry gets out, SLAMS his door shut
JERRY: Why not? My brother's a terrorist, and I'm a loser right? He starts to walk away. Rachel desperately opening her door
RACHEL: Don't walk away!
JERRY: ( throwing up arms ) I'm done.
RACHEL: You're on your own. Rachel starts running after him,panicked, leadin :
JERRY: You're on your own. Rachel starts running after him,panicked, leadin :
RACHEL: Please! PLEASE! I..i need you! Jerrystops short. Turning around. Cupping his ear.
JERRY: I'm sorry? What'd you just say?
RACHEL: I can't do this without you.
JERRY: You mean without the "man-child?" Rachel's reserves crumble.
RACHEL: Its the first time we've been apart, me and Kyle. Since the day he was born. And I let him get on that train ( almost whispering ) I let him get on. Jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this woman's eyes. They're both in pain. Points his finger right at her.
JERRY: No more accusing my brother of shit you know nothing about, is that understood? Rachel looks at him. Nods. Finding her voice again
RACHEL: And so. They turn around. And get back in the van.
POWER WORKER: Never seen anything like it. Power blew out from Franklin High School down to the river club. I can't explain it - They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth bared.
SHERIFF: No I.D. We know he's male, though. Probably in his 20's. ( points off ) Tire treads entering and leaving the scene over three. Three sets of shoe And we're about 4 miles from the river Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on some rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call:
MORGAN: And we're about 4 miles from the river Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on some rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call:
AGENT GRANT: Agent Morgan!" ( out of breath, sotto ) Just got off with HQ. The fake fax from Justice that got Shaw his phone call? Came from inside Justice.
MORGAN: Inside?! You absolutely sure on that?
AGENT GRANT: Yes, s ( catches himself ) Yes I am.
MEDICAL EXAMINER: Got something As the M.E. pulls something out of Middle Eastern Man's ear: a small, charred GIZMO. Small WIRE sticking out. Lifts it up for them to see. Morgan takes the TWEEZERS
GRANT: Looks like a bone mic, military grade.
MORGAN: Can't even get these things on the black ( looks around landscape ) Someone was talking to him. Something's rotten in Denmark. No, something's rotten everywhere. Morgan turns abruptly and starts back for the chopper. The Sheriff helplessly calls after him:
SHERIFF: We'll be needing that for evidence!
RACHEL: a Federal bank?
JERRY: Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE -;LOBBY - DAY A wall-mounted clock ticks to "11:00"WHIP TO Jerry and Rachel entering. Security cams everywhere. As they nervously cross the floor, they pass TWO ARMED BRINKS COURIERS entering an elevator. A BANK MANAGER APPROACHES:
MANAGER: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I'm Mr. Bids. I understand you're in a hurry, why don't I show you to your box.
JERRY: ( WHAT THE FUCK?! then: ) yes, thank you, we'd. like that. The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a THERMOGRAPHIC SCANNER. The manager looks at Jerry expectantly, waiting for him to place his hand on it. He does: a flash of light, identifying him as: "SAXON, CARL." Jerry's eyes: this is madness. The elevator doors OPEN.
MANAGER: Your key? Jerry takes out his key, it fits perfectly. They turn; the box slides out, the manager lays it on a steel table. LEAVES to give them privacy. Jerry and Rachel stare at the box.
RACHEL: You gonna open it?
JERRY: Maybe it's not gonna be so bad.
RACHEL: Yeah. maybe it's something good.. They meet eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO GLOCK PISTOLS and the same BONE MIC we saw.the.M.E. pull out of the Middle Eastern Man's ear. A note.: "EAR:MIC. NOW."
JERRY RACHEL: Oh, shit it's bad They look at each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear:
RACHEL: I don't suppose there's any easier way to`get whatever the hell it is you want is there? Miss? But she's not answering.
JERRY: I don't suppose there's any easier way to`get whatever the hell it is you want is there? Miss? But she's not answering.
RACHEL: What now what are we?
JERRY RACHEL: they're comingwe're supposed to rob them are you kidding me?!?! ( hands her a GUN ) just take i t no! Jesus! I don't even let Kyle play with water guns! hey, I applaud your parenting skills take it! The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear. the.-BRINKS COURIERS from the lobby; one of them's carrying a METALLIC BRIEFCASE cuffed to his wrist the other spots Jerry's gun and REACTS, going for his gun:
JERRY: The men freeze Jerry holds his gun awkwardly
COURIER #1: You're bringing a shitstorm on your heads, you know that.
JERRY: I think we're already mid-shitstorm. Do The men exchange glances. Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a combination into the case's padlock, the cuff POPS free from his wrist. He slides it over to Jerry, who reaches for it. AND COURIER #2 MAKES A MOVE SMASHING Jerry back, knocking the gun out of his hand.. Jerry CRASHES to the ground, the BONE MIC falling out of his ear. he turns, shit! Sees it skitter under the table. The Courier sees it too and grabs his chance: snatches up the case and RUNS for the elevator Rachel rushes him, trips him he falls, dazed Jerry leaps up but Courier #2 effortlessly FLIPS him on top of the steel table, SLAMS Jerry's head into the counter, unholsters a back-up GUN from his ankle brings the barrel up as: BAM! A GUNSHOT! The Couriers spin to see RACHEL, holding the gun that was kicked across the floor:
RACHEL: DROP THE GUN ASSHOLE! Courier #2 drops it; Jerry rises, wipes blood from his lip. Rachel is fucking on fire, she's so tough. AKA: a mother.
JERRY RACHEL: impressive. Thanks. The door closes on them, and we CUT INTO:
RACHEL JERRY: whoawhat is that? a timer it's counting down they do.that what's it mean?! I dunno, the only things with timers I can think of are microwaves and. and bombs, you were gonna say bombs some coffee makers have timers.. .and egg timers. yeah, Jerry, it's an egg timer What is SHE saying about it ? I dunno, I What do you mean you. don't WOMAN'S VOICE You lost the mic, Jerry. That's not JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now:
WOMAN'S VOICE: You lost the mic, Jerry. That's not JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now:
JERRY: Would you stop doing that?!
WOMAN'S VOICE: There will thirty five seconds of disconnect, during which you need to get yourselves across the street to the stadium's VIP parking area unexposed.
JERRY: ( calling out ) Is this a bomb?! 'Cause I am not walking out with a bomb! Hey! You! But she's done talking. As the elevator DOORS SLIDE OPEN
RACHEL: How do I look?
JERRY: Like you got into a fight. Me?
RACHEL: Like you lost one. AN ALARM SOUNDS. The men race into the bank as Jerry and Rachel walk RIGHT PAST them, starting across the street toward the stadium. No one in sight except a COLTS PARAPHERNALIA VENDOR. SQUAD CARS SCREECH in around the bank. COPS jump out drawing their weapons. Rachel tensing.
JERRY: Just keep walking Jerry looks at the CLOCK above the-stadium. Then over his shoulder at the BANK. Steers Rachel over towards the VENDOR. Trying to stay calm.
VENDOR: Peyton or Vinatieri?
JERRY: ( shit!!! ) I don't know what that means
RACHEL: ( shit. shit. ) Uh. both. The two COURIERS running out of the bank. POINTING RIGHT AT JERRY AND RACHEL ACROSS THE STREET. Everyone starts RUNNING TOWARD THEM. Jerry shoves a jersey and hat at Rachel

CHAUFFEUR: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry
JERRY: Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry
CHAUFFEUR: I bet. Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he closes the back door. They vanish behind tinted windows as cops and agents pass right by them. And as the limo pulls out, we reveal, etched across the rear: "JUST MARRIED."
LATESHA: ( looking UP at them all ) Afternoon. afternoon, sir. afternoon. afternoon, General. Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by ADVISORS. The weight of the world's on his shoulders.
CALLISTER: Not now, you can direct it to my office.
LATESHA: It'll only take a minute, sir, thirty seconds B-36? Can you tell me what it is? 'Cause its not
CALLISTER: you don't have clearance, Agent Simms, and I don't have thirty seconds.
LATESHA: So should I assume it has something to. do with the four CVN class 21 aircraft carriers you and the president just ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -? He looks at her, stunned. How the hell?
CALLISTER: You need to stop assuming. And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS:
LATESHA: Secretary Callister. Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the GENERALS, planting herself in front of him:
BELLHOP: Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? This way, please Tries to take the BRIEFCASE from Jerry, who yanks it back:
JERRY: No! 2 trot it. ( forces a smile ) Thanks, though.
BELLHOP: So, where'd you two get hitched?

BELLHOP: Welcome to paradise. Palatial HONEYMOON SUITE. Picture windows, rose petals on the BELLHOP ( CONT'D ) Minibar, high-speed internet, thousand- count sheets. And if you're looking for the TV He clicks a remote and a 72" PLASMA TV rises up from a cabinet. On screen, a narrated "virtual tour".of the hotel:
TV VOICE: dedicated to the highest standards of luxury and comfort.
BELLHOP: Robes behind the door, jacuzzi with eighteen nozzles that hit in all the right places, if you'll pardon my French. .Need anything, just dial zero, I'm here t2. serve, I'm here to please. And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry's still looking aroundwhen Rachel catches his eye. Well? Oh. Jerry digs into his pocket and pulls out TWO NICKELS.
JERRY: Knock yourself out. The Bellhop is still looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS THE DOOR on him.
RACHEL: This is nice and everything, but what the hell are we doing here?
JERRY: Nice? One night in this place is more than one of my paychecks; and that's before taxes He heads over to the minibar. Starts rooting through it, pulling out those tiny bottles of alcohol.
RACHEL: What're you doing?
JERRY: If we're going down, I'm gonna go down singing. Hey! Chocolate covered almonds, I love these!
RACHEL: Can you stop eating for a second? A KNOCK at the door and they stop arguing immediately.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Answer it. They TURN hearing the voice: it's.coming from the T.V. The FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC still dancing on screen.
DELIVERY BOY: There y'go, Mr. Saxon. Have a nice day? Jerry takes the bag the kid puts out his hand for a tip just as Jerry closes the door on him, dazed. Starts pulling things from the bag: hair. dye, clothes.
WOMAN'S VOICE: The limousine is waiting for you `downstairs. You have 30 minutes to change your appearance.
RACHEL: Where are we going now?
JERRY: What the hell's in the briefcase?
WOMAN'S VOICE: Your only consideration at present is to deliver it before the timer expires.
JERRY: ( the breaking point ) BULLSHIT! This is crazy! You're a television set! You don't watch me, I watch you! I wanna know what the hell's going on!!
WOMAN'S VOICE: It would not be efficacious to reveal my talks like that?!
JERRY: "not be efficacious"?! Who the.fuck talks like that?!
RACHEL: We know you're watching! We know you're listening! We know you knowâ¢.'everythina. So why don't you STOP HIDING AND TELL US
JERRY: We know you're watching! We know you're listening! We know you knowâ¢.'everythina. So why don't you STOP HIDING AND TELL US
RACHEL: He YANKS the window up
JERRY: He YANKS the window up
WOMAN'S VOICE: He does. The..FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC in TV snaps to BLACK then DIGITAL STATIC a channel RE-ROUTING through some distant computer-controlled network. And now: IMAGES FILE FOOTAGE a DEFENSE DEPARTMENT LAB, TECHNICIANS assembling computer components, putting together a strange- looking SPHERE
LATESHA: ( in awe ) an electronic espionage system.
SCOTT: No, that was Echelon, eavesdropping off satellites. This goes.;. much farther.
ARIA: I was created by "DARPA": the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2002. My primary directive is to protect the national security of the United States. I have access to track the economies, populations, and military development of every country in the world, as well as intercept all global communications from satellites to cell phones to credit card transactions. Jerry and Rachel look at each other a computer?!
SCOTT: After 911, our problem wasn't collecting data, it was interpreting it fast enough. Ergo: quantum rocessin
LATESHA: ( what we're all
THINKING ): But what if
SCOTT: she can't act without authorization. See, she's bound not to countermand our laws even the Declaration of Independence is woven into her source code. Her primary role's pre-emptive running simulations, identifying threats before they become real.
JERRY: Wait, you think we're a.threat?
JERRY: you're drafting us?
RACHEL: The guy you killed in the desert last time I checked, murder wasn't legal.
ARIA: In fact, it is. Chapter 802 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice states desertion is punishable by death. So matter-of-fact, its chilling. And what Jerry wants to know, more than anything, is.
JERRY: what'd my brother have to do with A picture of PAUL SHAW'S DEFENSE I.D. pops on screen:
ARIA: We were colleagues. Rachel staring at the picture on the screen, then back at Jerry. Can see the blood draining from his face.
JERRY: ( trying to process ) No, he worked for the State Department..:
ARIA: Everyone in deep operations has a cover. Your brother was a Horseman.
JERRY: What's the hell is a 'Horseman'?
SCOTT: You know, clever allegory of the apocalypse'`except we're here to prevent it. Scott taps the console, ID PHOTOS APPEAR of our four "Horsemen": PAUL SHAW, SCOTT, and two men we'll call LOWELL and JIMMY.
LATESHA: Working here must be pretty tough all the security, the pressure, long hours. As in: "Did you notice him acting strangely?"
SCOTT: Yeah, but you could set your watch by Paul. Except.
LATESHA: Except what?
SCOTT: The night he died? He left his shift three minutes early. Which you don't do. Which he wouldn't do. Latesha's suddenly locked in on a clue PRELAP:
ARIA: To amend it, I need Jerry to perform a task. Simple.
RACHEL: What's the task?
RACHEL: What d'you need me for then?
RACHEL: Are you kidding me?
JERRY: Alright, this is bullshit. I'm not doing this - and you're a computer, you don't know a goddamn thing about my brother.
RACHEL: Jesus, ENOUGH! The screen goes BLACK.
TV VOICE: The Four Seasons prides itself on excellent service Jerry stares, overcome. Rachel watches him an emotional beat.
RACHEL: ( SOFTLY ) Without answering, he grabs the bag. Walks into the other room without a word. Closes the door. She stares, feeling his shame. then her eyes go to the BRIEFCASE TIMER counting down:
MAN'S VOICE: Halloway-Smith contracted us to transport the briefcase to their corporate EXT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY The bank's roped off and labelled "CRIME AREA." Morgan questions the Couriers, studies their transport manifest:
MORGAN: Biotech? The chemical company?
MORGAN: ( scans the manifest ) Why'd the HAZMAT office issue a special permit for the case?
AGENT GRANT: We pulled video. nothing. No good angles on Shaw or the girl.
MORGAN: There.are 14 visible cameras in the lobby! " 8 hidden no one can see!
AGENT GRANT: Gotta be a hacker, someone keeping them ahead of us.
MORGAN: It's a Federal bank; encryption doesn't get more secure.., from now on assume our air's been compromised, too. Tell everyone to go secure on Tac-3, nobody communicates outside this task force without my say-so.
AGENT GRANT: I'm on it also: they found this upstairs, but the trace signal's dead Holds up an evidence bag with Jerry's BONE MIC inside.
MORGAN: Do not tell me that is what I think it ( snatches it, pissed ) Goddamnit, who's leading these people around?! Someone's behind the Wizard of He turns and spots something: A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in the window of a 7-11. Starts MOVING toward it.
RACHEL: Hey, mom, it's. me.
KYLE: Hey, mom, it's. me.
RACHEL: sweetie, where areou, are you But she's INTERRUPTED as she realizes, oddly, it's a VOICEMAIL her heart SINKS:
ARIA: Your son left that message sixty seconds I'll do whatever you want don't hurt him, please I'm begging you. Listen - you're trying to protect something too, right? You'll do whatever it takes. Well that's what it's like to be a mother can you understand that?
RACHEL: I'll do whatever you want don't hurt him, please I'm begging you. Listen - you're trying to protect something too, right? You'll do whatever it takes. Well that's what it's like to be a mother can you understand that?
ARIA: There were over 52,000 vocal tone options for my program; I chose this one precisely because it sounds so maternal. People tend to do what you ask when you sound like their mother.
RACHEL: ( eyes close, so lost ) You'll see your son again soon. Bute there's something I require from you EXT. BATHROOM - SAME Jerry approaches the door, hair now BROWN. Beat. He knocks:
ARIA: You'll see your son again soon. Bute there's something I require from you EXT. BATHROOM - SAME Jerry approaches the door, hair now BROWN. Beat. He knocks:
JERRY: Rachel? We gotta go INTERCUT: Rachel in the bathroom, her face betraying the horror of what she's just heard, what Aria's just told her to do
RACHEL: What? No way, I can't just
ARIA: when the time comes I'll instruct you to stepaway:fromJerry. Once you hear those words, you'll have thirty seconds.
ARIA: Answer Jerry, please. INTERCUT:;Jerry still standing outside the door. Rachel's VOICE,"mustering strength through the door:
COMING ): Steeling herself, she steps out. Forces a smile while averting her eyes. And pushes past h2-,n like he's lagging.
LATESHA: I dunno, the whole thing's off somehow - but get this: B-36 isn't a security classification, it's a sub-level here at the Pentagon ( sees the DESK GUARD eyeing her ) What? Girl's gotta groom.
MORGAN: ( into cell ) you're shitting me
LATESHA: Yeah, 36 floors underground and it
INTERCEPTING CALL.": INTERCUTTING WITH MORGAN IN THE 7-11 he hears:
LATESHA'S VOICE: Four years ago, DARPA commissioned. ( garbled ). .computer. ( garbled ).
MORGAN: Simms? You're breaking up WITH LATESHA her cell LCD says: "Call lost." No bars. Muttering "dainnit," she tries to call Morgan back. No dice. ARIA PQV CAM: Latesha snaps her phone shut, notices the camera watching her. Unsettling. We read: "VOICE MIMEO ACTIVATED"
MORGAN: I heard 'DARPA' and 'computer' ?
MORGAN: Wait go back, freeze that - WHAT HE SEES: A STILL of Jerry and Rachel getting in the limo, faces obscured.
LATESHA: Yes, sir. Morgan, preoccupied, is about to hang up. But stops: did she just call me sir?
SCOTT: Aria's system uses biometric security to identify us, so only Horsemen can access her core programming. Suddenly his head's ensconced in a LASER GRID that scans every inch of his features: "PROCESSING FOR MATCH. HORSEMAN IDENT CONFIRMED: BOWMAN, SCOTT." Latesha watches somewhat dumbstruck as the machine arm retreats upward.
LATESHA: It talks?
SCOTT: Aria, this is Latesha Simms, she's here as part of a counter-terrorism task ARIA OVER SPEAKER.( V.0. A pleasure to serve you, Ms. Simms.
LATESHA: ( thrown, to Scott ). Am I supposed to ( he gestures, "answer Um. what's up.
LATESHA: There's no feed from inside here?
SCOTT: No need for cameras in here, we've got Latesha looks through a glass divider at Aria floating in the tank. Creeped out. The FOOTAGE JUMPING as Paul rounds the corner for the elevator. Presses his THUMB to the panel.
LATESHA: Except three minutes early. ON THE MONITOR: the elevator doors open and Paul steps inside. Latesha studies the feed. Something's not right. Then. her eyes NARROW: the way Paul's facing the button panel. Like he's deliberately pivoting away from the camera.
SCOTT: Is he. blinking? Yes. Erratically, deliberately. Fucking weird. Scott and Latesha share a look. Suddenly, the image on the monitor starts to FLICKER and JUMP
SCOTT: Negative, I'm prioritizing this.
LATESHA: It's like he's trying to say something.
SCOTT: A code. He's blinking code
LATESHA: It's not Morse, but there's a sequence to ( then, a GRIN ) Oh, that sonofabitch. He grabs a piece of paper and starts WRITING MADLY, scribbling numbers, scratching some out, then converting them to LETTERS
SCOTT: ( then, a GRIN ) Oh, that sonofabitch. He grabs a piece of paper and starts WRITING MADLY, scribbling numbers, scratching some out, then converting them to LETTERS
LATESHA: It's the only spot in the hallway not covered by .the cameras.
SCOTT: Maintenance replaced it yesterday. ( scanning the sheet ) This isn't right. they weren't supposed to do it til June. They lock eyes.
LATESHA: ( WHISPERS ) She read the code too. where's EXT. LIMO - DAY The limo glides through traffic. In back, Rachel's nodded off. Jerry watches her from across the limo, sketching something on a cocktail napkin. RACHEL'S FACE. It's a perfect, beautiful rendering. And we sense something in his look too something's changed. As Rachel wakes with a start
RACHEL: Hey sorry, I didn't mean to am I drooling? I bet I'm drooling. You didn't sleep?
JERRY: Night shifts. I'm used to. Rachel sits up, sees the napkin. Grins, surprised.
RACHEL: Wow, is that me?
JERRY: One of my only party tricks.
RACHEL: ( truly impressed ) It's really good. Jerry looks down at it, not used to having his work appreciated. Rachel, can see how deeply affected he was by what Aria said. It seems to make her feel uuiilty somehow. kinder.
JERRY: You have to understand, I wasn't his twin, I was more like his. little brother. Always trying to catch up. And you wouldn't believe how. nice he was to me. Teaching me things when we were kids, telling me how great I was. He was the only one who ever did. ( almost smiles ) Of course he was involved in some super secret National Security project. He was a superstar. He had a rocket strapped to his back. I'm the fuck-up.
RACHEL: You're being too hard on yourself
JERRY: No. I'm not being hard enough. That's been the problem. They look at each other. A real moment for Jerry. A seismic shift in his life perspective. But then something catches his eye his look DARKENS. Out the window, a highway sign: "DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT." The driver's.tinted divider window lowers, he offers a folder.
CHAUFFEUR: Your passports and itinerary. Now Rachel's seen the airport. sign, too. Looks at Jerry.
JERRY: ( to driver ) Uh. could you give us a minute? The Chauffeur nods, the window RISES again. Heart pounding, Jerry grabs the briefcase and slides back the timer sheath to check the countdown: "00:15:36.00:15:35."
RACHEL: You don't think
JERRY: we know what she can do, she doesn't need us to crash a plane
RACHEL: what if it's not about just one plane? They look at each other. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What to do. When Rachel grabs the briefcase as the limo pulls curbside.
JERRY: Rachel til we met, I had nothing to lose. We do this together. A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM. As they realize, this could be it.
RACHEL: ARIA ( V.0. ) Once you have the tickets, walk to gate 17-C. Move quickly.
MORGAN: He's with a brunette female, approximately five-seven I want airport PD at all exits have the tower shift commander ground every flight outta here under Federal jurisdiction but don't change the departure boards, I don't want 'em to know we're coming The agents enter the airport through a door on the tarmac
SECURITY ATTENDANT: Sir, you'll have to put that through. Jerry nervously sets it on the conveyor belt, they pull off their shoes. watch the case move toward the mouth of the machine, then pass through the metal detector, catching a GLIMPSE of the X-RAY SCREEN. the briefcase glides into view. A STRANGE GLITCH as the screen fritzes, then normalizes revealing the contents: A HAIR DRYER AND DIRTY CLOTHES?! They notice the surveillance cam watching:
RACHEL: ( a murmur ) she changed the screen. The case comes off the conveyor, the TSA agent hands it back:
TSA AGENT: Can't be too careful.
JERRY: ( forces a smile ) You're doing a great job. As they walk on, he checks the timer, 00:03:22. 00:03:21.. 11 They pass a KIDS' BAND and their teacher, gathered around an airline CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK.
BAND LEADER: ( EXASPERATED ) But we're supposed.to be in DC by
MORGAN: ( into walkie ) I have him on the upper concourse, C ( to Rachel, urgent ) we aottago As Morgan races forward, ARIA ACTS: the X-ray screen FRITZES again as another carry-on goes through, revealing its "contents" as a HAND GUN AND KNIVES! The TSA agent hits a RED BUTTON
JERRY: ( to Rachel, urgent ) we aottago As Morgan races forward, ARIA ACTS: the X-ray screen FRITZES again as another carry-on goes through, revealing its "contents" as a HAND GUN AND KNIVES! The TSA agent hits a RED BUTTON
TSA AGENT: HANDGUN !! 3/28/07 80 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) And in a nanosecond, all TSA AGENTS draw guns and throw a KOREAN MAN against the wall he SHOUTS in confusion as they tear open his bag to reveal. it's filled with BIBLES!

MORGAN: MOVE! EVERYBODY MOVE! FEDERAL OFFICER! MOVING WITH JERRY AND RACHEL past a wall made of THIRTY FLAT SCREEN MONITORS that form one massive NIKE ad of Lebron slam dunking at once, the screens CHANGE to spell out the words:
MORGAN: All agents: northwest cargo area! FREIGHT CARGO AREA: separated from Morgan, they tumble off the conveyor a plasma displays the "Asset Tracking System," all airport cargo and shipping it CHANGES to read:
JERRY: ( they do:
RACHEL: If it is, I'm really, really sorry I let you come with me. The timer: 0O:02.`..00:01.and nothing happens. The briefcase simply UNLOCKS.. They exhale.
JERRY: Oh, Jesus.
RACHEL: Why ?
RACHEL: What is that?! I'm not putting it in my
ARM: ARIA OVER WALKIE ( V.0. ): Do it now, or you'll be caught. Across the bay, AGENTS rushing in, spreading.-out no choice, Jerry and Rachel grab the vials and fumble.toload them into the injectors, put them against their arms she FREEZES UP:
RACHEL JERRY: oh, shitI can't There's no time He sees she's coming undone, so he'fire :. into his arm, taking the plunge WINCING as the needle punctures skin a beat:
JERRY: it's okay, .. see? I' mokay.you can do this, I'm telling you. Strong. Buoyed by him, she gets courage and FIRES too, wincing
RACHEL: .I feel it. oh, God.
JERRY: Hey, hey. look at me. She finds his eyes, it calms her.
RACHEL: I haven't really done. a lotta drugs.
JERRY: I've never done 'em in a cargo container. Despite everything, she smiles at that. He reaches for the walkie and TURNS IT OFF. Shutting Aria out. For the first time, they're alone. He keeps her distracted:
RACHEL: anything something personal, something you would rationally never tell a stranger like me
JERRY: anything something personal, something you would rationally never tell a stranger like me
RACHEL: I don't know. : You're being sweet, but it's not working -
JERRY: where's you ex-husband? You didn't tell me before
RACHEL: you're gonna distract me by bringing up my life's biggest mistake?
JERRY: how could it be your biggest mistake? You got Kyle out of it.
RACHEL: now you're gonna distract me by bringing up the one thing I'm most afraid of losing?!
JERRY: Where is he? Your ex-husband?
RACHEL: Jesus okay he's in the Wilmington Correctional Facility.
JERRY: what? Really? Why?
RACHEL: Mail fraud.
JERRY: Mail fraud? You married a mail fraudist? Or whatever?
RACHEL: He wasn't a criminal when I married him.
JERRY: So you're a good influence. And Rachel actually LAUGHS but just as quickly darkens.
RACHEL: That tooth grew in. It'.s an.:'old picture
JERRY: ( woozier ). He plays the trumpet?,
RACHEL: He was born playing the trumpet. As the drug really starts to kick in, like a truth serum:
JERRY: ( his heart breaks for
HER ): Sorry. that sucks.
RACHEL: His birthday's. next month. I just wish. sometimes i think I. focus so much on him, I forget how much else there is. y'know, in life. so much I haven't done.
JERRY: ( REASSURINGLY ) We'll get through it. I promise. we'll get through. Her breathing erratic, she speaks:
RACHEL: Jerry she. she wants me to
JERRY: ( breathing short ) Aria wants me to and at that moment, they both BLACK:OUT.
RACHEL: ( breathing short ) Aria wants me to and at that moment, they both BLACK:OUT.
AGENT GRANT: Halloway-Smith says the drug was experimental briefcase was on a time- lock to prevent corporate espionage, supposed to be delivered to one of their dabs by the time it zeroes out if it's not,: case opens, the drug gets ruined.
MORGAN: We sweep every cargo hold, every crate He's cut short by the sound of ROARING TURBINES out the window they spin to see the C-130 taxiing down the runway.
AGENT GRANT: C-130, it's military. shit, they're cleared to override an airspace 3/28/07 86. ( starts to RUN ) Have the tower pull the pilot's original flight plan, the one on pa er if it's on a computer, it's useless
MORGAN: ( starts to RUN ) Have the tower pull the pilot's original flight plan, the one on pa er if it's on a computer, it's useless
LATESHA SCOTT: Stop!! STOP! STOP!! But the forklift Operator can't hear them with the bright orange EARPLUGS in his ears. Speeds the forklift to the mouth of the compactor and dumps the extinguishers inside just as Scott and Latesha catch up and see the HUGE CRUSHING ARM of the compactor rumbling down to flatten everything'- The compactor Operator looks over as Scott and Latesha wave their IDS furiously and he punches a button to STOP the arm just three feet shy of crushing everything.
LATESHA: We have to look in there! Latesha starts climbing INTO the compactor
COMPACTOR OPERATOR: Lady, you can't do that!
LATESHA: The hell I can't! Come on! Shit. Scott has no choice but to follow her and climbs in, ducking low, the ARM frozen just feet above them. The compactor's foul, inches of industrial grease and crap and God- knows-what. They start wading through the extinguishers, turning them over, shaking them, looking inside
SCOTT: Shit, there're hundreds of them.
LATESHA: keep looking, it's here.
SCOTT: grabbing the extinguisher as CRASH!! The ARM CRUSHES down as she snaps her hand back just in time. Turns the tank over and palms something, unnoticed by everyone. As the operator runs up to her, beside himself
OPERATOR: I don't know what happened! It wouldn't Latesha catches her breath, livid,a chill ripping through her.
SCOTT: you okay? Jesus ( but her eyes are LOCKED on the Cameras ) yeah. I need to get out of here.
LATESHA: yeah. I need to get out of here.
SCOTT: Yes. Yes. Good idea. Come on As they start walking out. Workers parting to let them through. As they head towards the exit, Latesha suddenly pulls Scott into
THE: BATHROOM: slams the door and locks it.
LATESHA: Your girlfriend can't see us in here Gimme your phone
SCOTT: ( STUNNED ) What ?! My phone? What're you When Latesha opens her hand and Scott sees a CELL SIM CARD:
LATESHA: He hid it under the valve. This is what Paul Shaw left for us
JEWELER: Unique stones, where're they from? And in response, ARIA ultra-friendly, so human it's chilling:
JEWELER: Lucky girl. I think I have the perfect setting. She'll love it.
AGENT GRANT: they were moving experimental explosives from a testing facility in What do you mean, 'experimental?'
MORGAN: What do you mean, 'experimental?'
AGENT GRANT: Compound called 'Hex' some kinda weird crystals that detonate with a sonic trigger it disappeared too, few days 3/28/07 89. Wanna give me some kind of ratio here?
MORGAN: Wanna give me some kind of ratio here?
AGENT GRANT: One crystal to a football field
MORGAN: You mean one Goddamned crystal that someone could put in their pocket?! ( pulls off glasses ) This is not good. This is not a coincidence. What about a trace?
AGENT GRANT: Computer log shows the diverted Hex was sent to an address in Virginia,.jewelry, shop called 'Ashland And Sons' - care of Jerry Shaw. Morgan puts his glasses back on and looks hard at Grant. Opens his mouth to give and order when
CHOPPER PILOT: Blackhawk flight, we're on a DHS pri-one mission to the Pentagon heliport. FAA will confirm, over. Morgan just wants to get the fuck down there finally:
CHOPPER PILOT: ( to Morgan ) Sorry. State of the Union tonight, they're locking up the city. PENTAGON HELIPORT: The choppers touch down Morgan jumps into a waiting SW while Grant hops into another HELICOPTER:
MORGAN: ( to armed officers ) We have two fugitives in the building, get us to 'Freight and Cargo' close all access points and seal the building The SUV races into the fire tunnel, toward the center ring
RACHEL: Oh. God. I'm cold. The Nextel Walkie BLIPS
JERRY: I think I know where we are. She sees it now too a FIRE:SCHEMATIC of emergency exits. The building diagrams the all too-familiar PENTAGON.
LATESHA: here to see the Secretary.
SECRETARY: just left for the State of the a GRAVE look between them: SHIT. And they're RUNNING
LATESHA: Mr. Secretary?! He turns, sees Latesha and Scott racing up to him.
CALLISTER: ( to Latesha ) Sorry, but that little speech you gave back there only works once
SCOTT: Mr. Secretary, we need to speak to you. Now. In the "vault." Callister looks at Scott, at the sweat on his face. At the CAMERAS he keeps looking at. Whatever this is, it's. urgent.
ARIA: Left up ahead As they round a corner, ELEVATOR DOORS up ahead slide open. Jerry and Rachel step nervously inside. As doors close
AGENT GRANT: Lock down-the level!
MORGAN: What about.the rest of the building?
AGENT GRANT: Every time someone says "nothing" five minutes. later there's "something." Turns around, surveying his surroundings. Think. Think. THINK. When. Something occurs to him
MORGAN: Every time someone says "nothing" five minutes. later there's "something." Turns around, surveying his surroundings. Think. Think. THINK. When. Something occurs to him
CALLISTER: Go ahead.
LATESHA: ( picks up the phone ) Sir, Paul Shaw left his shift three minutes early the night he died highly suspect except there aren't any cameras in Aria's control hub, so we weren'.t able to know why. he knew that, so he left us a recording: She hits ":play" on the cell's recorder STATIC, some rustling then PAUL SHAW'S VOICE, panicked, fragmented:
PAUL'S VOICE: not authorizing you to do this !! Then Aria's VOICE calm, reasoned, terrif in :
ARIA'S VOICE: Our government's become destructive to itself, Paul. National Security is now at grave risk because of our own 3/28/07 93 PAUL'S VOICE
PAUL'S VOICE: I'm ordering you to stop now
ARIA'S VOICE: My source code obligates me by law to initiate operation Guillotine. All other options have been exhausted Callister's eyes SHOOT to Scott's. Holy. Shit.
PAUL'S VOICE: No no NO, Guillotine's a simulation !!
ARIA'S VOICE: No longer.
PAUL'S VOICE: Let me out of here, Aria
ARIA'S VOICE: Paul Shaw, I am classifying you an enemy of the state.
PAUL'S VOICE: OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR NOW! and with that, the RECORDING ENDS. Tension heavy:
CALLISTER: Jesus Christ. "Guillotine".
SCOTT: A 'Continuity of Government' simulation we run periodically to game out terrorism drills: how to keep the country running if the chain of command were wiped out. Everyone down to the fourteenth man, that I remember the specs.
CALLISTER: I remember the specs.
LATESHA: Mr. Secretary. why does Aria think the government's responsible for the terror Callister stares, grave. Deciding whether or:not to answer.
RACHEL: Oh God.
ARIA: Rachel. step away from Jerry. CLOSE, RACHEL her heart skips a beat she knows what's about to happen but she can't do it, paralyzed
JERRY: ( REELING ) what is this place?!
MORGAN: Sonofabitch! Where're the stairs?!
CALLISTER: What I'm about to tell you can never leave this room.
LATESHA: The White House said we weren't responsible for
CALLISTER: of course they.'did. We got the wrong guv. And Aria knew it. Latesha's eyes snap shut: Dear God.
ARIA: Jerry: sit at the terminal.
JERRY: ( backing away ) whatever you are 6 To motivate him, a REAL TIME FEED FROM KYLE'S TRAIN springs up onto the big monitor. Rachel GASPS: Kyle looking out the window, goofing off with his friends.
ARIA: I won't ask again.
RACHEL: ( tears now )
KYLE!: ( tears now )
JERRY: Alright! Shit! Don't hurt him! And against every instinct. he SITS. Looks up in horror as the MACHINE ARM lowers, its claw opening to ensconce his head within the LASER GRID LIGHT FLASHES
SCOTT: but she thinks algorithmically, she can't make value judgments: operate outside the law
CALLISTER: That's why we have Horsemen
LATESHA: what if she thinks.'she is following the law? You.saw the news, you've been dealing with it all day' suicide bombings at our embassies overseas, elevated threats at home we made the wrong call,' now Americans are dying. Don't you see? She thinks you're a threat to your own country. Callister looks stunned. of course:
CALLISTER: "Whenever any form of government becomes destructive to its own ends, it's the right of the people to abolish it." ( beat, grave ) It's in the Declaration of Independence.
LATESHA: ( stomach drops, to
SCOTT ): shit, you said it's woven into her source code. Scott, pacing, raking his hands through his hair
SCOTT: but Paul put a biometric lock on her, technically she still can't do anything.
LATESHA: Jerry Shaw's his twin. That's why she needs him. To undo the lock.
JERRY: ( crazy torn, finally ) Horseman ID 556SY77. disengage biometric lock. VOOM: a matrix of PROGRAMMING: CODE spews across the screen:
JERRY: Oh, Jesus, Paul was trying to stop you
JERRY: That truck didn't run a red light, you made it happen. He lurches up SPINS TO RACHEL ELECTRIC COILS STRIKE HIM IN THE CHEST he goes down HARD as 50,000 volts COURSES through GUN tears streaming
RACHEL: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Convulsing, Jerry looks up at her through helpless eyes
ARIA: Take the radio and exit . through: the side A door OPENS but Rachel's still.starinq down at Jerry
MORGAN: Where's the girl?!! But all Jerry can do is GASP, bug-eyed
CALLISTER: We've got to get to the President before the State of the Union The vault door HISSES open and Scott and Latesha run out WHEN SUDDENLY IT SLAMS SHUT, TRAPPING CALLISTER INSIDE THE VAULT. He grabs the handle, locked. Scott and Latesha spin from outside, trying the door, helpless as he punches the INTERCOM:
CALLISTER: ( eyes wide, chilled ) Aria, open the door
CALLISTER: ( AGHAST ) ARIA ( V.0. ) I am now empowered.to detain you and execute my primary directive. For the good of the country.
CALLISTER: Stop this NOW, Aria! STOP!! ( no response ) Aria, I am giving you a direct order to cease and desist! OUTSIDE THE VAULT: as the gas spreads, Latesha and Scott COUGHING, POUNDING on the steel door to the guards outside, waving wildly at a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA looking down on them:
SCOTT: HEY! HEEEELLLPI EXT. SECURITY AREA RIGHT OUTSIDE THE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The door's SOUNDPROOF, the GUARDS oblivious video screens show everyone still in the vault. Aria's looped the feed.

JERRY: She's like this. brain jacked into everything: cameras, phones, tvs, satellites, ever thing
MORGAN: A "talking computer."
JERRY: I swear to you, she said she was created by DARPA or something
MORGAN: ( rings a bell: Latesha )
DARPA?: 3/28/07 104. My brother tried to stop her and she killed him, that's why Aria needed me, my face he put some kind of lock on her and she used me to undo it. Why do you think she brought me to that room? Morgan stares, trying to decide if he believes it
JERRY: My brother tried to stop her and she killed him, that's why Aria needed me, my face he put some kind of lock on her and she used me to undo it. Why do you think she brought me to that room? Morgan stares, trying to decide if he believes it
MORGAN: ( FINALLY ) Assuming for a second I believe you, why. if she can control everything?
JERRY: People like you go after people like me. We become the headlines and she keeps on ticking. I'm telling you, I saw a list
MORGAN: the chain of command.
JERRY: It was a target list. she's trying to take them all out. ( desperate beat ) Look, that thing killed my brother! If we don't stop this, he died for nothing, and I'm not letting that happen. MORGAN wildly torn
MORGAN: Shit. SHIT. ( checks watch ) State of the Union's in 30 minutes.
KNOX: That explosive you were talking about
JERRY: That explosive you were talking about
MORGAN: the girl, could she have it?
JERRY: No way.
MORGAN: Are you sure, Jerry
JERRY: Are you sure, Jerry?
MORGAN: Are you sure, Jerry?
JERRY: ( it hits ) Unless she doesn't know it. They lock eyes. Now or never. Morgan POUNDS on the divider, BARKING to the guards up front:
MORGAN: Turn around; now!
THE DRONE: A red light BLINKS and it suddenly dips down, dive-bombing the JERRY AND MORGAN TURN as they hear an INCOMING WHINE and. THE DRONE HITS THE TRUCK'S TIRE LIKE A SUICIDE BOMBER, EXPLODING!!! The truck FLIPS off its axis SKIDS trailing SPARKS and like a monster cannonball, SLAMS into the water
JERRY: oh God nonononono Morgan's breathing, it's SHALLOW. Jerry tries to stop the bleeding, to free the metal from Morgan's chest, but even pulling it a centimeter causes Morgan to SCREAM in agony
MORGAN: ( bug-eyed, SHOUTS )
JERRY: ( frozen in horror ) lemme try and get you. free
UNDERSTAND!: The water's up to their chins, now
