BRANDON VOICEOVER: I would've stood there all day to sink one. Just to see that EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1984 - DAY BRANDON runs, wears a too-big helmet and pads. A DOG chases him as DAD throws a football long pass TIME SLOWS and
BRANDON VOICEOVER: To pop, sports were a religion. To me, it was about purity, a place where all wrongs could be made right, or at least temporarily forgotten. I was going to fill the whole house with trophies for him. There was no doubt in my mind, I was going to make him happy.
BRANDON: Last play. Slant red, right back on two. On two, Scottie. It's a lock. A guaranteed TD. I've already seen it. So relax. and they're shoving cameras in your faces, I don't want to hear any "Hi moms." Guys, it's overdone, the fans are tired of it and if you have to thank some one you can just thank me. See you in the end zone.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: I'd been a quarterback since pee-wee football. Set high school records. Won state championships. I wasn't driven by joy, it wasn't winning as much as terror, pure and simple fear of South West Nevada needs a score. Seven seconds on the clock. for Lang. The big question, should he turn pro now or wait until Lang's got the snap
TV ANNOUNCERS: South West Nevada needs a score. Seven seconds on the clock. for Lang. The big question, should he turn pro now or wait until Lang's got the snap
BRANDON VOICEOVER: . My first thought was I can tape it and play next week. Then I puked.
BRANDON: What's the rehab time? The SURGEONS talk between themselves, impressed by the break.
BRANDON: When do I play again? One DOCTOR examines his x-rays. BRANDON grabs his smock.
BRANDON: The patient's got a question! Anesthetic haze. A wavy world is melting far, far away.
SURGEON VOICEOVER: Football's done, son.
MAN'S VOICE: Brandon. Brandon, it's me. BRANDON opens his eyes, focuses on his FATHER ( older, cheap suit, beard stubble, clutching a $2 bouquet of flowers ).
BRANDON'S DAD: You okay? I saw what happened on the tv. Helluva thing that happening like that.
BRANDON: ( edge ) What are you doing here?
BRANDON'S DAD: I brought some flowers. From downstairs in the shop.
BRANDON: ( pressing the nurse's call button ) No, you gotta go where's the nurse?
BRANDON'S DAD: I'm thinking of getting into a new program, Brandon. A NURSE comes fast through the door, watches unsure
BRANDON: Could you get him out, please?
BRANDON'S DAD: It's okay, we're fine, I'm his father.
BRANDON: Just get out! BRANDON tries to rise, IV'S coming loose. The NURSE takes his DAD'S arm, leads him out to the hall.
BRANDON'S DAD: ( pulling away, straightening ) He didn't recognize me. Must be all the drugs and all. Boy's been through a lot.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: It doesn't rain much in the desert. Maybe it was that, or maybe the look on my mother's face, or how fast coach left after getting me up the steps, but I swore then and there no matter what, I'd get back I would play again.
OMIT: EXT. SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY TRACK - DAY Sprinters dart by. Here comes BRANDON. Several months have passed. Big ass brace on his leg. A GIRL'S TRACK TEAM bounds past like a herd of gazelles. BRANDON presses on, possessed.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: Doc told me it would take years to heal. One bad hit and it'd be over. But the team needed me and I had to play to get drafted.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: Every minute of recovery I'd dreamt about this moment. There were NFL scouts in the stands. I knew what happened next.
BRANDON: Let's ease back into it with our bread and butter TD first play. We're going deep. Split right. Deep two on three! ( coming up to the line ) Red 38! Red 28! Set! Set BRANDON drops back. Blitz. Brandon about to throw when one of his own LINEMEN is knocked into him and BRANDON'S off balance. it buckles. BRANDON falls. The play whistled dead.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: .It was over. I could've gone out with class, a gritty smile and a little wave to the crowd from a stretcher, instead I opted to go psycho on national tv.
JIM ROME: Welcome to the jungle! Hey clones, do you believe this idiot?! fighting championship! What we have here is too much muscle and not enough brain mass this is why we need a life-time ban! Make an example out of him! Because the sport deserves better than this! Talk to me!
BRANDON VOICEOVER: It made all the highlight films. People wrote editorials. Overnight I became the poster boy for the "Dark Side of Sports."
PSYCHIATRIST: Who did the referee represent, Brandon?
BRANDON: He represented the nearest guy I could grab.
PSYCHIATRIST: . Let's try again.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: Football wasn't a sport, it was my life. Maybe I couldn't play anymore but I couldn't leave. So I went with it,
BRANDON: You've reached the Jessica Simpson hot line! Jessica's going to tell you all about Nick's surprise birthday party and her rockin' new panty line at Wal-Mart, but first, here's a little fan trivia to win a VIP Gold Package back stage pass to Jessica's Omnicon Hotels Summer Tour
BOSS: Got a job for you, Lang.
BRANDON: I'm in the middle of taping.
BOSS: Bauer's sick, can't update his betting line. You know anything 'bout sports?
BRANDON: . Yeah, a little.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: 900 numbers, audio text, the racket had a lot of names.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: This guy's gig was sports handicapping. Predicting winners for people who bet. I was supposed to just record his picks.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: My picks went 9-and-1 that weekend. By football season, the job was mine.
BRANDON: Kansas City is 7-1 against the point spread versus division opponents coming off a Monday night game. Take K.C. minus the six points. Call tomorrow for my pro football game of the year Tampa Bay versus Oakland. That's 900-656-3100. This is Brandon Lang saying good night and good luck everybody.
BRANDON: I went 9-2 in pro football Sunday and hit my third straight Monday night parlay.
BOSS: That's what you get paid for.
BRANDON: I want a raise to 12 bucks an hour.
BOSS: I don't make 12 an hour.
BRANDON: You're not picking 75 percent.
BOSS: If you're so good then bet your own games, get rich and send me a postcard
BRANDON: Hey Stu, where's the action this weekend?
BRANDON: You think?
BRANDON: That game's gonna be won by coaching, Stu. Gruden put that Tampa Bay team together before he came to Oakland, right? He knows every weakness of that team and every strength. He knows Brown only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he'll have him double-teamed to the right. He knows Gannon always throws on a 3-step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of the field. Gannon'll be intercepted at least 4 times on Sunday.
STU: Thanks, B.
OMIT: EXT. BRANDON'S HOUSE - NIGHT BRANDON rides up. His younger brother, DENNY ( 18, Metallica t-shirt ) and some FRIENDS work on an old, bondo-pocked muscle car in the garage.
DENNY: I scrounged some old headers, B! Check it out! DENNY turns the key. The car rumbles to life. He revs the bored-out engine, flashes a shit eating grin.
BRANDON: . Awesome dude. That's a righteous ride, Denny.
MOM: I'm late. Dinner's in the oven. Where the hell's my lucky crucifix? BRANDON reaches to a key rack, hands it to her. She dons it.
MOM: Thank God. A man won 5600 at my table last night. Tipped me out in color. I gave it to Denny, help him with college.
MOM: Mail came, letter for you, from Chicago. You just tried out last week. They got back to you quick. That's a good sign.
BRANDON: Wanna bet?
MOM: Open it. BRANDON opens it. Reads. Words pop out: "Arena Football League"."We regret to inform you"."but based on your performance"."staff At least they kicked me a cap.
BRANDON: At least they kicked me a cap.
MOM: INT. BRANDON'S ROOM - NIGHT Filled with exercise equipment. BRANDON pins the letter to a wall covered by dozens of rejections National Football League Canadian Football League Arena Football League. BRANDON changes into shorts. And now we see, he's in amazing shape. the length of his leg makes you wonder. As BRANDON pumps it out we realize he still has a dream of coming back, a dream we sense by his intensity is fast slipping away and
BRANDON: MAN'S VOICE MAN VOICEOVER
MAN'S VOICE: MAN VOICEOVER
BRANDON: MAN VOICEOVER
MAN VOICEOVER: Congratulations! You went 9-2 last Sunday! 20-4 college! Picking 77 percent winners since opening weekend! I've been following you! I'm a big fan, Brandon! A big fan.
BRANDON: How'd you get this number? If you want picks, call my 900 line.
MAN VOICEOVER: What I want, Brandon, is for you to come to New York and work for me.
BRANDON: Who is this?
MAN VOICEOVER: This is Walter Abrams. I don't know if you know me but I run the biggest sports service in the country. Hell, I started the industry. Ask around. Ask anyone,
BRANDON: Do me a favor and lose my number, I gotta go to work. BRANDON hangs up and
BRANDON: WALTER VO
WALTER VO: It's me again.
BRANDON: This is a joke, right?
WALTER VO: A joke can be the ultimate intellectual pursuit sometimes. This? with your name on it.
WALTER VO: That's travel cash and an airline ticket. It's not a magic trick, Brandon. I paid someone to put it there, who incidentally
WALTER VO: Run the numbers, do the math. Hold on a sec Muzak. BRANDON juggles the phone, searching, finds a pay stub. flips it. The coin bounces, spins, falls and
BRANDON: I'm gonna pay. I'll pay you
DRIVER: Pay me? Pay Walter. His car. I'm Milton, I drive for him.
BRANDON: I thought it was a service. ( moving to the jump seat, seeing MILTON is driving very fast )
MILTON: Oh yeah, going on two weeks. ( off BRANDON'S look ) I was bike messenger. Walter's driver hit me with his car. I lie on ground, make it look worse than is, big car, you
WALTER VO: Bring him in!
WALTER: I'll hire the trainers too. Well run it by them, you won't know until you try. So, they can stay the night. I'll put 'em up at the Plaza, nice suite, park view. Okay double it. Triple it. Everything's about money. Look, on Sunday, my daughter, an angel, turns six, it's not likely to happen again. She
WALTER: Whoa, look at you. The Marlboro man. ( feeling his bicep ) Jesus you're in great shape.
BRANDON: I've been in better.
WALTER: ( assessing BRANDON as he speaks ) Modesty's not a virtue, it's a vice, as evil as vanity. There are rules to
BRANDON: If you can sell you'll never starve. Ever speak in public? Perform? Anything like that?
WALTER: If you can sell you'll never starve. Ever speak in public? Perform? Anything like that?
BRANDON: I played quarterback in college. Division one.
WALTER: I know, I'm talking about not in uniform.
BRANDON: I used to sing at church.
WALTER: Oh really? So you're religious?
BRANDON: I don't know. I guess.
WALTER: Certain things, you either are or you aren't. Which is it?
BRANDON: When I was a kid I thought I wanted to be a pastor. obviously not now. I mean, yeah, I believe in God.
WALTER: Relax. What do I care? Besides, it's against the law to hire based on religious orientation. You're not a republican are you? Just kidding.
BRANDON: That was six years ago.
WALTER: C'mon, you won three conference titles at a major university. but mostly by keeping my eyes open and asking a lot of stupid fucking questions. I swear to God I'm looking at myself 30 years ago. A taller, more athletic version maybe, but the resemblance is remarkable.
WALTER: I'm not supposed to smoke any more, among other things. It's bad for my condition. So before I die, did you do anything other than the sports phone in Vegas?
BRANDON: Just the 900 number recordings, it was full time, I mean we got 10 bucks a call.
WALTER: Chump change, Brandon. We're angling for bigger fish here. You see, the networks don't talk about it and Uncle Sam can't tax it, but sports gambling is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year-business. a losing weekend, a lot of them have big needs.
WALTER: That's every pro game played last Sunday. Do you know why Monday Night's the most watched game of the week? out of the hole before paying their bookies on Tuesday. Sports betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one, but what we do is 100% legal it's exactly the same as a stock broker, only instead of touting stocks, we advise people on how to bet. client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they gladly give to keep getting our picks. When they lose we get zip. So the object here, my tall, athletic, religious friend is to win.
TV WALTER: Hello this is Walter Abrams and welcome to The Sports Advisors and week three in professional football. After a nice five day vacation on my yacht I can't be any more ready than I am right now. Studying the mismatches this weekend I can only conclude they're giving my handicappers a license to steal. I want you to take out a blank
WALTER: ( freeze frames himself, to BRANDON ) My cable show. Tapes Thursday, airs Saturday and Sunday morning.
BRANDON: How'd you afford that yacht if the picks are free?
WALTER: There is no yacht. Good, keep asking question. Next.
BRANDON: You didn't answer about the free picks.
WALTER: I know. What else?
BRANDON: What's on the second floor?
WALTER: That's where we print the money. Any more?
BRANDON: No, that clears up pretty much everything.
WALTER: Great. Welcome aboard. We got some good stuff to work with.
WALTER: Ever have a manicure?
BRANDON: Me? No. Why?
WALTER: Because you need one. Besides, there's a girl you gotta meet.
BRANDON: Really? What's she like?
WALTER: Beautiful, you'll like her ( answering the phone ) This Barnum or Bailey?
TONI: I see a beautiful woman. What are you all of 35? I have a girlfriend, she was stunning, went in to "tighten it up a bit" and came out with a permanent smile. Even when she cries she looks like she's laughing. Another, she's on her third eye lift. butt she'd look like a baby bird.
WOMAN: I'm just thinking of a tune-up.
TONI: Oh yeah, first it's a tune-up, then it's something else, and one day you'll come teetering in with your new 36Cs and a stretched face and you won't be able to say how unhappy you are because of all the collagen they shot in your lips.
WOMAN: Easy for you to say. You used to model. The other WOMEN CUSTOMERS listening nearby nod in agreement.
TONI: Oh yeah, that's true. Those were the good days. Sometimes I like to just curl up on the ledge with my box of retouched photos and reminisce about rehab.
WOMAN: Tightly wound today, aren't we?
TONI: I guess. Must be the coffee talking. ( handing her a fashion magazine ) Here, read a fashion magazine. Feel more insecure about yourself.
TONI: . Brandon?
BRANDON: I'm Toni. Walter said you'd stop by.
TONI: I'm Toni. Walter said you'd stop by.
BRANDON: Nice to meet you. ( immediately, re: the pedicure ) This was his idea.
TONI: I know.
BRANDON: He makes all his employees do this?
TONI: Every one.
BRANDON: How often?
TONI: Once. Before they start work.
BRANDON: You think?
TONI: You think?
BRANDON: I've never had my nails done before.
TONI: I can see that. ( putting his hands in water ) Strong hands. Nice. Do you drink?
BRANDON: No thanks. I'm fine.
TONI: No, do you drink?
BRANDON: Excuse me?
TONI: Alcohol. Are you a drinker?
BRANDON: I've been pretty focused on staying in shape. I mean a beer once in a while.
TONI: What about gambling?
BRANDON: What about gambling?
BRANDON: What about it?
TONI: Look, I'm sorry, I'm pressed for time. ( stopping work, regarding him ) I asked do you bet. Are you a bettor?
BRANDON: Really? Why not? BRANDON meets her gaze. Gears turning. She's hitting on him.
TONI: Really? Why not? BRANDON meets her gaze. Gears turning. She's hitting on him.
BRANDON: Toni, huh? Are you here full-time?
TONI: It's my shop, I better be. Why don't you gamble?
BRANDON: Well I'll tell you, Toni. I bet on something once. Risked everything I had and lost.
TONI: I swore I'd never do it again. You're sticking to that story? Hey, we just met. I sure wouldn't want to start our relationship off by lying.
BRANDON: I swore I'd never do it again. You're sticking to that story? Hey, we just met. I sure wouldn't want to start our relationship off by lying.
TONI: Well Walter could definitely use someone with a little resolve in his life.
BRANDON: ( leaning in ) Ya know, Toni, this is my first time in town. I'm not used to how fast things run around here. I'm wondering if you'd like to have dinner tonight? Let's get
TONI: . He didn't tell you.
BRANDON: Brandon, Walter and I are married.
TONI: Brandon, Walter and I are married.
BRANDON: What? Walter just said I was meeting a woman. He acted like.
TONI: Walter's got a weird sense of humor. Look, he has a big, bright, beautiful spirit, you'll love working for him, but he's held together by meetings. If it has "anonymous" at the end, Walter goes. He has to. He also has to be very careful who he let's into his life. In most ways, Walter's brilliant but he can be bullshitted and I can't. So he sends 'em over to me before he hires 'em.
BRANDON: You're kidding me? Coming here. the manicure. this was an You're swift.
TONI: You're swift.
BRANDON: How'd I do?
TONI: Except for an illegal forward pass, perfect, flying colors. Congratulations. I'm late for my next TONI walks away, glances back, smiles and
WALTER: I'm starting you on the 900 numbers, same gig you did in Vegas. Monday through Friday and five times a day on weekends. Each call's worth 25 bucks a shot. Right now we get a few dozen hits a week. We should be doing triple that. I'm sending down some test copy. Before you record it, a little advice.
WALTER: Your pitch sucks, it doesn't exist. The pieces are there, we just gotta bust you out.
WALTER: From now on you have a new name John Anthony, "The Million Dollar Man."
BRANDON: Hold on. What's wrong with Brandon Lang?
WALTER: Brandon Lang is still at home with his mother. You're selling a lifestyle here, and John's livin' large. John's got a direct line to God and for a measly 25 bucks a call you're gonna let the world's losers listen in.
BRANDON: Hello sports fans! This is John Anthony in the Big Apple with my big money picks! The action starts Saturday with college ball and our first matchup, Michigan against Indiana
WALTER VO: INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - DAY WALTER turns from the window, faces BRANDON.
WALTER: What's your sales pitch?
BRANDON: What's my sales pitch? 77 percent's my sales pitch.
WALTER: Stats aren't enough! These are gamblers you're talking to, people ready to risk what they can't afford for what they can't have! You're selling the world's rarest What's that?
WALTER: Certainty in an uncertain world!
BRANDON: John Anthony here, ready to make all your betting dreams come true! Call now and let me win for you! The point spread in the Indiana/Michigan game's up to four, making that game a gimme
WALTER: What is that shit? You spent 6 years bouncing from one dead-end job to another. Riding to work on a frigging bicycle. Were you making some kind of statement? What the hell were you afraid I wasn't afraid of anything. I was working my ass off, trying to get back in the game.
BRANDON: I wasn't afraid of anything. I was working my ass off, trying to get back in the game.
WALTER: You are back in the game! Convince me you belong here!
BRANDON: This is John Anthony here, and from Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood, all your big money stays and plays with me! Winning consistently's the name of this game and I always remain the same, winners on a consistent basis, 77 percent winners! So sit back and relax because it's a scud attack this weekend and I'm shelling your INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY BRANDON bounding up to WALTER'S office.
BRANDON VOICEOVER: Game one of my three-team parlay is Michigan hosting Indiana; the big boys at Michigan are just 2-7 against the spread as a double-digit home favorite and with arch rival Wisconsin on deck next week, Indiana will catch them looking ahead! Take Indiana plus the 16 points! It's a lock!
BRANDON VOICEOVER: You want more? John Anthony's the man with a plan to make you money! Game two goes to Florida and North Carolina! I don't care how many points you gotta lay with Florida, lay it! They'll win by 50!
BRANDON: C'mon! First too little, then too much
WALTER: It's a start.
BRANDON: Tell me what you want.
WALTER: No. What do you want, Brandon? That's what this is about!
BRANDON: Walter? Are you okay?
WALTER: . Huh?. It's nothing. ( popping a pill from the vial, beat, taking another ) . Small one.
BRANDON: Should I call someone?
WALTER: Not unless they got a spare heart. I'm okay. WALTER finds a cigarette. Lights it. Savors the first drag.
BRANDON: What are you doing?
WALTER: Courage wants to laugh.
WALTER: He's a machine, all he does is work out and pick winners. Talk about fit. Go take a peek, see him with his shirt off. I did.
TONI: Enjoy your daughter's party.
WALTER: Check him out, you know you want to.
TONI: Get out of your head, Walter. It's a bad neighborhood. TONI kisses him, walks with WALTER through the party and
BRANDON: I'll have the bruketta and the this, with the pasta.
WAITER: ( takes the menus, departs ) Very good, and may I say, sir, an excellent choice.
WALTER: It's bruchetta. Like little pizzas without the cheese.
BRANDON: Don't worry about it. Anyone goes 20 for 24 in college football, 12 for 14 pro can call it whatever he wants. Ever drink a thousand dollar bottle of wine? Steward!
WALTER: Don't worry about it. Anyone goes 20 for 24 in college football, 12 for 14 pro can call it whatever he wants. Ever drink a thousand dollar bottle of wine? Steward!
TONI: It's a waste, Walter. He hardly drinks.
WALTER: It's a celebration. Just because he's out with a couple of reformed drunks doesn't mean he can't enjoy himself.
TONI: I was a lot of things, Walter, but I was never a drunk.
BRANDON: Actually, truth be told, I've never had a 12 dollar bottle of water either.
WALTER: He thinks we're fighting.
BRANDON: No. I just, this place is great.
TONI: Watch out, Walter, he's a fixer.
WALTER: 175 calls on the 900 number.
TONI: Did you call home? Let 'em know how you did? How you're doing?
BRANDON: I will tomorrow. My mom works nights at the casino, she'll sleep till three.
TONI: Are you close with your parents?
WALTER: He's very close. They sound terrific.
TONI: Is your name Brandon?
BRANDON: Oh, they're great. We talk all the time.
TONI: What're they like?
BRANDON: Mom's terrific. Amazing lady. I got a little brother, Denny, going to college next year. Complete motor head. Dad's a. well he's a sports nut. He was, I mean, it all came from that.
WALTER: Kid grew up with the frigging Cleavers.
WALTER: I should've ordered two.
TONI: What'd the doctor say, Walter?
WALTER: Oh yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. I had a check-up yesterday. he was very concerned. He sat me down, looked me in the eye and said, "Walter, who do you like in the Buffalo/Oakland game?"
WALTER: You didn't touch the sauce.
TONI: Neither should you, Walter.
WALTER: I read chocolate's good for you.
TONI: I'm not raising a kid alone.
WALTER: Don't get dramatic, Toni. In biblical times you'd just move in with my brother Morty.
WALTER: Wow. What a meal. Do you feel good, Brandon? Content?
BRANDON: Yeah, I can tell. Don't be. Ever. One week's over, another begins. The past is merely a prologue. In this job you have to push the envelope every day.
WALTER: Yeah, I can tell. Don't be. Ever. One week's over, another begins. The past is merely a prologue. In this job you have to push the envelope every day.
WALTER: Look at that. Beauty and the beasts. What do you think of her, She's cute.
BRANDON: She's cute.
WALTER: Cute doesn't half cover it. The girl's gorgeous. And bored out of her mind. Waiting for some young buck to save her from those two gorillas. Check it out. She's eyeing you again, Brandon.
BRANDON: So are the two guys she's with.
WALTER: I'll bet you 10-to-1 on a 1000 you can't pick her up, cash, if you leave with her.
WALTER: Who's gambling? It's a challenge. If Brandon leaves with her I give him ten thousand dollars, that's probably more than he made last year. If not, he gives me a grand, which I'll give to you.
BRANDON: I don't bet, Walter. ( glancing over, look from the GIRL ) . But I do love a challenge.
WALTER: All right. Before you bust a move, just one thing. ( talks across the table, addressing the MODEL and the two MEN )
TONI: What the hell was that?
WALTER: I'll send over a bottle of champagne. You'll pick up their check.
WALTER: The voice of reason. She's right. I owe 'em a meal. Hey here we go, Brandon, your girlfriend's going to the bathroom.
WALTER: Well get moving, slick. After that introduction?
WALTER: Hey, I just raised the bar. C'mon, kid. John Anthony could close her.
TONI: I'd prefer Brandon. BRANDON smiles. He walks through the restaurant, up the stairs as the WOMEN'S ROOM door opens and the GIRL emerges before him.
BRANDON: You're beautiful.
GIRL: ( stepping past ) Excuse me.
BRANDON: I just want to get to know you.
GIRL: You just want to get into my pants.
BRANDON: I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul. I don't see you wearing any pants in this equation.
BRANDON: I'm Brandon. What's your name? Alexandria. Beautiful name for a beautiful girl. BRANDON leans in close, talking too low now for us to hear. Selling hard. ALEXANDRIA laughs at something he says and
BRANDON: Alexandria. Beautiful name for a beautiful girl. BRANDON leans in close, talking too low now for us to hear. Selling hard. ALEXANDRIA laughs at something he says and
OMIT: INT. BROWNSTONE BACK STAIRWELL - DAY WALTER and BRANDON reach the second floor landing, stand outside a solid steel door.
WALTER: Everything you've ever done's been leading up to this moment.
WALTER: We use the 800 number and free tips to bait the hook. Then the bettors are
WALTER: This is the day's phone sheet, it's a list of everyone who's called. Only way to keep track of the action. All leads equal BRANDON'S POV walking by SALESMEN doing their thing. The first is a chain smoker, battering ram tone. This is SOUTHIE.
HERBIE: Trust me, we're going to turn all this around. I'm aware last weekend was difficult. Well of course I do, that's a substantial ( cupping the phone, to WALTER ) He's a bit miffed about our picks
WALTER: Fuck him if he can't take a joke.
BRANDON: You're telling me that all this is legal?
WALTER: It better be. Five of these guys are off-duty cops. We're just advising people how to bet, not making the bets for 'em.
WALTER: Brandon Lang, meet Reggie.
REGGIE: You're the QB that went off on the refs. ( BRANDON shamefully nods ) Yeah, but you covered! Shit, as much money as the refs cost us every year, that was pure. Totally crystal. Hell, I like you already. Even if you did get the best office.
WALTER: ( re: an item on the sports ticker ) Barker's not playing this weekend?
REGGIE: No, he's in the middle of renegotiating. It's a tantrum, he'll play Sunday.
BRANDON: No, he's in the middle of renegotiating. It's a tantrum, he'll play Sunday.
JERRY: ( typing on a computer as he speaks ) I know it's a new stadium, I'm asking if they used Astroturf or Astroplay?. Astroplay, it has a rubber silica base, like ground up tires. Look, I don't have time to explain abrasion indexes and resistance scales to you, trust me, it makes a big fucking difference.
WALTER: I had three guys who picked games. I fired one last weekend. your picks are going straight to our biggest customers. How do you like it?
BRANDON: What's not to like? JERRY SYKES appears at the door. Fast glance at BRANDON, attention to WALTER
JERRY: The Miami/New York point spread shifted a half tick up to 10.
WALTER: What do you think?
JERRY: Miami's still a lock. The win/loss ratios and RPI ratings are off the charts. I'm keeping it on my sheet.
WALTER: Jerry's our top handicapper, came to me straight out of grad school. Jerry, meet the new kid in town.
JERRY: Whoa, phone guy makes good. Big jump from the 900 numbers. Watch out you don't get a nose bleed. Just kidding, best of luck, I gotta get back to work.
BRANDON: Pleasure meeting you. By the way, Jerry, New York's gonna win straight up. They always play the fish tight. Tonight it's foregone, they win outright.
JERRY: Really? Listen up, stick to college, sonny. You have to work up to pro ball around here. Nice try though.
WALTER: ( watching JERRY walk away ) I got three guys who can handicap and 20 who can sell but I never had one who could do both, not really, not until now.
BRANDON: You mean me?
WALTER: Not you. John Anthony.
BRANDON: John Anthony doesn't exist.
WALTER: That's a shock 'cause I'm standing in his office and you're sitting in his chair!
BRANDON: Look, making predictions is one thing but pushing people to bet, it's not me.
WALTER: Pushing people? Get real, this country was built on gambling. hawking the lottery. If people want to pay for advice on who to bet, who are we to say no? Stop being selfish, spread the word! Check your bible, Brandon, tis better to give than receive.
BRANDON: You got a whole room full of salesmen.
WALTER: Big bettors don't want to talk to a middle man, they want to speak to the guy making the picks and you're picking 80 percent What's the matter? Gonna lose your purity? C'mon, what do you think selling is? We're just talking a few well-timed phrases. your money, I want your bookie's fucking money?"
WALTER CON'D: What's the matter? Gonna lose your purity? C'mon, what do you think selling is? We're just talking a few well-timed phrases. your money, I want your bookie's fucking money?"
BRANDON: I don't want your money
WALTER: Jesus, don't start that shit again. Sell me.
BRANDON: I don't want your money, I want your bookie's money!
WALTER: What happened to the fuck?
BRANDON: Nothing, I just don't talk like that.
WALTER: I can't have someone working for me who can't say fuck.
BRANDON: It's not that I can't. Why do I have to?
WALTER: Because there's no other fucking word that can convey the precise feeling and fucking flavor of life's various predicaments and certain concepts the way a well-placed fuck can. Fuck is your friend. Fuck can be your best friend.
BRANDON: I'm happy for you and your friend, Walter, but I'm not using Chaucer used it 600 years ago. It was good enough for him. ( calling out to the SALESMEN ) this fucking guy has a problem saying fuck! A chorus of "Fuck yous" fill the air.
WALTER: Chaucer used it 600 years ago. It was good enough for him. ( calling out to the SALESMEN ) this fucking guy has a problem saying fuck! A chorus of "Fuck yous" fill the air.
WALTER: C'mon, repeat after me fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. Fuck he, fuck she, fuck me, fuck them, fuck me try it.
BRANDON: It's not me. Let it go.
WALTER: Backbone. Almost as good. We'll keep working on the other thing. So, you really like New York in tonight's game?
BRANDON: Where are we going?
WALTER: Continue your education.
WALTER: We're here for the gambler's anonymous meeting.
BUSINESSMAN: .I mean you'd think with two mortgages out, repo guys staking out my car, my job on the line and my wife threatening to leave, you'd think I'd have the goddamn brains to stop, instead of staying in the chase, doubling down, which of course is what I did. I know I'm sick because I keep thinking if I just pulled that game out then I got a lock on the parlay and I'm flush going into Monday night and
MEMBER #1: . It's a disease, Leon.
MEMBER #2: Admitting you have a problem is the first Then I guess I'm doing pretty good because I got one big fucking Someone claps. Everyone joins in. LEON smiles. Warm beat.
WALTER: My name's Walter. I'm new to the group. ( various "hellos" ) Hi. I've been going to meetings like this for 18 years. Once a week, every Friday night, for 18 years. This, my friends, is my 936th consecutive meeting.
LEON: It's not?
WALTER: Not even close. You're a lemon. Like a bad car, there's something inherently defective in you. And you. And me! All of us here we're lemons! Big, juicy, acidic, ice-tea flavoring lemons! most people make a bet they want to win, while we, the degenerate gamblers of the world, we're subconsciously playing to lose. us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves off into the void! And we like doing it so much we do it time after time after time! Me? I always felt most alive when they were raking away the chips, and every one here knows what I'm talking about. before we give it all back. But when we lose, and I mean the kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a decimal point, there's a moment when you're standing there and you've just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time and you suddenly realize hey, I'm still here, I'm still breathing, I'm still alive! In order to really live you have to be aware of your own mortality and a losing bet of a certain size is one of the best ways
WALTER CON'D: I know of getting that feeling. When you win, you defy death, but when you lose,
BICYCLE MESSENGER: Hey! You're the guy I see on tv every weekend selling betting . Yeah. So? This guy peddles a tout service on tv.
WALTER: . Yeah. So? This guy peddles a tout service on tv.
WALTER: Check the charter, buddy, we all left our jobs at the door. You gonna toss an ex-alcoholic bartender out of an AA meeting?
BICYCLE MESSENGER: ( to BRANDON ) Hey, didn't you come with this jerk?
BRANDON: . No, I mean, we walked in together
WALTER: ( handing out business cards ) My card we're topping 80 percent this season put it in your wallet, in case you fall off the wagon
BRANDON: What the fuck was that?!
WALTER: . What'd you just say?
BRANDON: You heard me! I said what was that?
WALTER: No, you said "What the fuck?" That's what you said.
BRANDON: That was great! It was all worth it! Don't you see? I felt your anger because of that one word! Well done! I'm proud of you! The progress you're making Brandon, I gotta say, it's exhilerating!
WALTER: That was great! It was all worth it! Don't you see? I felt your anger because of that one word! Well done! I'm proud of you! The progress you're making Brandon, I gotta say, it's exhilerating!
OMIT: INT. SALESROOM - DAY Cacophony of calls. Building buzz. College football games play in the BG. The big, bearded MAN exits his pack-rat cluttered work space, strides to the office coffee machine, pours a quick cup. BRANDON approaches, extends a hand.
BRANDON: Hey, I stopped by to say hi, I'm Brandon.
BIG MAN: ( averting his gaze, walking past ) I'm picking now with you and Jerry.
BRANDON: I'm picking now with you and Jerry.
CHUCK: ( ducking back into his office ) The MAN shuts the door, leaves BRANDON looking at the KEEP OUT sign. SOUTHIE stops for a coffee, has seen the exchange.
SOUTHIE: Don't take it personal. Chuck's got a condition, get's anxious around people.
TAMMY: His name's Amir, he's a dime bettor. Owns a dry cleaners. We got him for the subscription. He's on line three.
TAMMY: Walter wanted your first call to be special. Go get 'em tiger.
BRANDON: ( picking up ) Amir, my man, John Anthony here!
AMIR: Yes, hello.
BRANDON: Today's your day, Amir! It's a Pamplona thing, I'm running wild in the streets this weekend! Starting with the hottest Saturday of my life! How much can you lay with your bookie? 20 large?
BRANDON: Amir, this is my lock of a lifetime! Texas plus the six points!
BRANDON: ( looks up, sees WALTER watching ) Oklahoma huh? Okay. well considering that, I like Texas even more now.
BRANDON: Amir, buddy, I'm talking about banging out the biggest win of your life.
BRANDON: Hold on, I got Vegas on the line. ( pressing HOLD )
WALTER: There's only one thing you have to know about any of our clients they're all in the hole. The second they pick up the phone, wham! Right to the point! You're above them! Let 'em feel it! More confidence! More John Anthony!
AMIR: Favorite drink? I dunno, Pina Colada.
BRANDON: Tomorrow we gotta get you a new drink. But for now, this is what you're gonna do. First, you're going to bet 20 large on Texas, then you're going to put on a
AMIR: . What about payment?
BRANDON: Good question. What about it? Well how much is this going to cost me?
BRANDON: We take a percentage if WE win, Amir not exactly your problem of late, is it?
BRANDON: It's simple, you don't get any more picks. Comprende? So make the bet, make the drink and let's roll this into
BRANDON: To hell with power ratings McNab lost his dog yesterday! Hunting accident. Everyone knows you don't mess with a man who just lost his dog! Take Atlanta plus the points and send me ten thou Western Union by tomorrow, Stan let's ride this wave into Sunday!
SOUTHIE: Billy, thanks for the 15,000 Fed Ex. What're you up, 160 or something?
REGGIE: The fuck do you care how he does it? And where the hell's our 30 grand for hitting that 3-team college parlay last night?
HERBIE: ( sipping a cup of tea ) Do this, call your off-shore sports book right now and put the whole 100,000 on Green Bay-Dallas-Cleveland, it's called a three-team parlay and pays 6-1. I do appreciate the 40,000 you sent us today, but let me assure you we've only just begun to make serious INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY NFL GAMES fill the TV screens. Theme music, announcers and action create a frenetic pace.
TIME LAPSE: SAME SHOT. LATER. Sunday sports start winding down and
TIME LAPSE: SAME SHOT. LATER. All the screens are dark save one, where the last game of the day finally ends in overtime and
JULIA: Faster daddy! WALTER crawls around the room, stops before BRANDON, grins.
WALTER: 10-2 in pro football? 85 percent for the weekend? Jesus, you're a mutant.
JULIA: Go daddy! WALTER whinnies like a horse, keeps crawling. BRANDON goes into the kitchen. TONI cooking at the stove, referring to a daily planner, talking on the phone.
TONI: Monday's no good because I take Julia to ballet. Tuesday I work late at the salon. Wednesday's a maybe if I can move a couple clients to after six but I'll have to check. I really want to come in with him. Listen, I have to call you back tomorrow.
BRANDON: What's all the commotion?
TONI: The doctor, thank God, put Walter,on an exercise program. I want to be there the first time he goes. Make sure the trainer understands Walter's aversion to consistency.
BRANDON: Aversion to consistency?
TONI: He's always been that way.
BRANDON: Well that's consistent. CLOSE ON WALTER watches from the living room sees TONI and BRANDON laughing, enjoying each other and
WALTER: Life is fucking. good. ( burp, regarding BRANDON ) Let's talk about making it better.
TONI: Duck, Brandon, here it comes.
WALTER: I've been tracking you since last year.
TONI: Don't let him steamroll you.
WALTER: Can I get the damn thing out? I want to put John Anthony on tv this week.
BRANDON: That's me. You mean me.
WALTER: That's right. You, John Anthony. You're one in the same.
TONI: Go on get to the good part, Walter.
WALTER: Hold on. Before I say another word, understand you do this thing, Brandon, and from here out you gotta eat, sleep, shit, breathe, walk, talk and fart John
TONI: Think it over, Brandon, don't decide now.
BRANDON: It sounds like a promotion.
WALTER: Bet your ass it is. Five-star.
BRANDON: I'm in.
TONI: Well that's a thoughtful response. Here I was, worried you'd rush your decision.
BRANDON: It's the only move. For six years I've been living on Ramen noodles. For the
WALTER: Living, not acting. You understand that as of right now Brandon Lang with his fettucini knee and his self-fucking pity is as flat dead as Donald Trump's hair and John "I-can-walk-on-fucking-water" Anthony has taken his place?
TONI: Listen to what he's asking you, Brandon.
WALTER: She's right. There's no going back. I mean that. This is gonna cost me. I'm talking about building an empire around you. Do you understand that?
BRANDON: . Should I wait a little to create some tension? Of course I understand, I'm John Fucking Anthony. I've got the crystal INT. TONI'S SALON - DAY BRANDON'S FACE FILLS SCREEN. Scissors come in, start cutting. her up in the chair, TONI laughing at something he says and
WALTER: I need a new car for my friend.

BRANDON: Walter, do you trust him?
DEALER: Walter, do you trust him?
WALTER: With my wife naked.
DEALER: ( calling to BRANDON ) In that case, which one do you want? BRANDON comes over, runs his hand over a sleek, silver SL500.
WALTER: I think he likes that one.
BRANDON: ( handing him a card ) I don't lose. BRANDON heads into the bar, meets WALTER and a group of HEAVY HITTERS outside. John ANTHONY instantly comes alive and
WALTER: You okay?
BRANDON: I'm scared shitless.
WALTER: Don't worry about your lines, it's all scripted. You've been here before, kid, just think of it like a football game.
BRANDON: This is different.
WALTER: There's no opponent.
BRANDON: There's no opponent.
WALTER: Perfect, then you're a lock to win.
TECH: 30 seconds. Walter, we're not getting your audio.

JULIA: Can we play?
TONI: Okay, let me just put the groceries away.
JULIA: I want to play princess.
TONI: So do I. Go put your dress on. JULIA runs off to her room when TONI suddenly spies a tacky, woman's jacket draped on a chair. TONI regards it and
WALTER: Easy 200, huh? Here's something extra for a cab.
GIRL: Thanks, Walter. Talk to ya.
WALTER: ( seeing TONI ) I can explain. The CALL GIRL slides by, shows herself out. TONI staring.
WALTER: No, no, you think she was for me? Are you crazy? No. I just had her come up to pay her. I got her for John.

WALTER: You'll be happy to know he didn't sleep with her. I paid her off just for coming. No pun intended.
WALTER: . Julia my jewel, you're getting big angel.
JULIA: Can we play princess, Daddy?
WALTER: Course we can. Who am I gonna be?
JULIA: You're the king, daddy, like always.
BRANDON: Let's get really wild and you can blow mine. The GIRL laughs. BRANDON crosses the stage, takes his place on the set between WALTER and JERRY. CHUCK sits off to the side, eating a muffin. WALTER looks voer at BRANDON
WALTER: Look at you. I like the tan.
BRANDON: Toni put one of those lamps down in my room. The ladies do love 60 seconds!
TECHNICIAN: 60 seconds!
WALTER: John's up first tonight, Jerry.
JERRY: John Anthony's leading off tonight.
WALTER: John Anthony's leading off tonight.
JERRY: John Anthony's leading?
WALTER: Somebody tell the engineer there's an echo in here.
JERRY: Two years I lead and you bury me in the deck over a few lousy fucking weekends? The Sykes System's based on percentages the long haul.
WALTER: No, that's called a mutual fund, Jerry.
JERRY: ( to CHUCK ) You gonna sit for this shit? CHUCK shrugs, finishes his muffin. JERRY turns to WALTER
JERRY: . He leads, I'm walking.
WALTER: He's leading. JERRY unclips his microphone, stands.
WALTER: That's baby talk! You need a fucking rattle! Sit down! ( staring him down ) You probably think you know what I'm gonna say. how everything you got I pay for. Your apartment, your car, your kid's school and it's true. You'd be right. I do. Now I don't know, Jerry, maybe you break your losing streak, end the shneid, start winning again and find yourself another job, but then of course maybe you don't. I don't see you taking that chance. My gut says you'll walk out of here on principle or even pride but not on a gamble, a hunch yet. And if you do, fuck it. I give a shit? The only reason I keep you around is it makes me look loyal and him
WALTER: See that? He made the safe play. Me, I would've walked, but I'm a fucked-up human being. That's the difference between us. not a gambler, not really until you bet more than you can afford to lose.
TECHNICIAN: Five, four, three, two, one
WALTER: Welcome to week 7 of pro football!
BRANDON: Denny, it's me. What'd I tell ya?. Hey, it's your money, dude, you won it. Well did you hook it up yet?. Hell yeah, crank it, let me hear
DENNY: It's the bomb, B!
BRANDON: Sure sounds like it! I'm heading out with some people, everything else cool?
DENNY: Everything's great. Did dad reach you?
BRANDON: Dad? No, why?
DENNY: He keeps calling. He saw you on tv, wants to talk to you. I gave him your work number but he says they won't put him through.
BRANDON: BRANDON'S eye catches WALTER across the set, watching a playback of the show. TONI enters the studio, kisses WALTER hello and
WALTER: I'm starved, there's a new steak house around the corner. You two split a prime rib, I'll get the porterhouse, we'll whack it up!
TONI: Let's walk, you could use the exercise.
WALTER: Stop worrying. We're set ( arm around BRANDON ) I got the next Jimmy the Greek here! I'm serious! Nostra-fucking-damus was a novelty act next to this guy!
BRANDON: Let me ask you something, Walter.
WALTER: Have you been blocking any of my calls?
BRANDON: Have you been blocking any of my calls?
WALTER: Of course. You don't need distractions, there's a lot of crazies out there.
BRANDON: Does that include my father?
WALTER: You're asking, I'll tell you. Yeah.
BRANDON: ( striding outside ) Son of a bitch for how long?
WALTER: ( following ) Week or so.
TONI: EXT. TV PRODUCTION HOUSE BUILDING - NIGHT WALTER and TONI trail BRANDON down the lamp-lit sidewalk.
WALTER: Hold on, Brandon, if I didn't block his calls would you've talked to him? Honestly.
BRANDON: That's not the point!
WALTER: Then what exactly is the point, Brandon? What's the full story here? What's the deal with your old man?
BRANDON: You tell it, you seem to know.
WALTER: I only know pieces. I was trying to spare you from something.
BRANDON: ( stopping under a street light ) Spare me? By blocking my calls? There's nothing you can spare me from. He's a drunk. Left when I was 9. I couldn't t compete with a bottle. End of story.
WALTER: . That's it? That's the best you can do? Hell, Toni and I'll match our dysfunctional childhoods against yours
TONI: I didn't have a great home-life either.
WALTER: "Great?" Tell him about the uncle
TONI: He gets the idea.
WALTER: Don't sugarcoat this shit, you were abused by everybody but the family pet, isn't that right, honey?
TONI: Walter, please.
WALTER: ( to BRANDON ) Your father was a drunk, a jerk so what? It happens. I'm glad I blew him off. Know why? Because what you need is a new image of a man. How 'bout me?
BRANDON: That's a really scary thought.
WALTER: If not me, then pick someone else. It's all in your head! The shit that happened to you, to Toni, to me you know what it is? Just that, shit that happened.
WALTER CON'D: It's not who we are. After
MAN: I'm trying to sleep, asshole!
WALTER: Dad! Is that you?
MAN: I'll crush you like a beetle!
WALTER: How's Mom?!
MAN: Fucking freak!
WALTER: I love you too! Don't wait up! WALTER, TONI and BRANDON all laugh. The three of them doubled over on the dark, deserted street. MAN screaming from above.
BRANDON: Are you serious, Amir? You gonna fucking haggle with me over a measly 50 thousand on the 250 grand I won you this weekend?
AMIR: Don't get me wrong, John. I'm thankful, very much, you're amazing, it's just that 50 thousand seems slightly steep
BRANDON: The first time you call me you're in a hole the size of the Grand Canyon, you're crying about hocking your fiance's ring and this weekend you're phoning me from a suite at the Bellagio that I put you in you know what I'm cutting you off. You want to continue with me, I'm tagging on a 10 percent aggravation tax! Now get to Western Union and shoot me 75 grand by tonight and we'll kiss and make up.
WOMAN VOICEOVER: This is. May I please speak to a Brandon Lang?
BRANDON: . Mom?
BRANDON'S MOTHER: Brandon, is that you?
BRANDON VOICEOVER: That's me.
INTERCUT: BRANDON'S MOTHER
BRANDON'S MOTHER: Are you okay?
BRANDON: Never better. Kicking ass and taking names. Did you get the money I sent?
BRANDON'S MOTHER: Well that's why I'm calling, honey.
BRANDON: Good good good. I talked to Denny. Next month I'm flying you and him out here. First class. I'll put you up at The Plaza.
BRANDON'S MOTHER: It sounds great, Brandon, but the money it's too much. Where did you get it?
BRANDON: I made it. Earned it. Every fucking cent. Put it in Denny's college fund.
BRANDON'S MOTHER: Listen to you.
BRANDON: It's just how people talk here. ( looking down at the TAILOR, edge ) How many times I gotta say no cuff?
BRANDON'S MOTHER: Who's this John Anthony person?
BRANDON: He's me. I'm him.
BRANDON'S MOTHER: And he talks like that?
BRANDON: He's pretty fucking salty geez, I'm sorry, Mom I mean yeah.
BRANDON'S MOTHER: Then you should know you can't be two people, Brandon.
BRANDON: I appreciate the concern, Ma, but the checks I've been sending the checks you've been cashing those are from John Anthony.
BRANDON'S MOTHER: Funny, I thought they were from my son. WALTER enters, slaps an airline ticket on his desk.
WALTER: We're going to Puerto Rico!
BRANDON: Gotta put you on hold, Ma. ( pressing a button on the headset ) What's in Puerto Rico?
WALTER: Since Ricky Martin moved out, all that's left are tourists, cruise ships and C.M. Novian one of the biggest sports bettors in the world. He just called. Wants to meet you in person! To-day!
BRANDON: ( activating the headset ) I gotta go, Ma. Ma. Son of a bitch my own fucking mother hung up on me!
BRANDON: What do you know about him?
WALTER: Not much, 'cept for the fact he's a world class prick. Bastard treated me worse than my Hong Kong tailor. Never once returned a call. I've been trying to bag this guy for years. Do you have any idea what this is worth?
BRANDON: No, but I want a bonus if we pull it off.
WALTER: Look at me. There is no if it's only when. This time he called us, remember? You hooked him. Know that. Sweat that.
BRANDON: Relax, I'll get in character in the car. WALTER suddenly slows, winces. He angles toward a bathroom.
BRANDON: . Walter? WALTER grabs for a water fountain, misses, suddenly collapses.
BRANDON: Your vial where's your pills, Walter? WALTER finds the vial, pops it, his chest heaves and the pills spill on the floor. WALTER looks wide-eyed up at BRANDON, mouths "Big one." BRANDON frantically loosens WALTER'S shirt. A crowd gathers. A BUSINESSMAN pulls a cell phone, dials 911.
BRANDON: Hold on, Walter we're getting help! Oh my God. Listen to me.
WALTER: Save your strength. Help's coming. Help's coming.
BRANDON: Save your strength. Help's coming. Help's coming.
WALTER: . Do you love me?
BRANDON: Of course I do.
WALTER: I do. I really do love you.
BRANDON: I do. I really do love you.
WALTER: . How much?
BRANDON: A lot! Now don't talk. ( turning to the CROWD ) We need a doctor! Several stunned ONLOOKERS run for help. WALTER fading fast.
WALTER: I believe you. I believe you love me. I love you too. Just one thing
BRANDON: Save your strength, Walter.
WALTER: . Would you love me if this was a joke?
BRANDON: I'm fine. Just practicing. WALTER smiles. Stands. Brushes himself off. To the CROWD
WALTER: I'm fine. Just practicing. WALTER smiles. Stands. Brushes himself off. To the CROWD
WALTER: I'm okay! Little gas. Must've had too many peanuts on the plane.
BRANDON: You sick fucking fuck! That was too goddamn fucking far!!!
WALTER: You weren't listening! You're not paying attention to me! There's no such thing as too far! Push everything as far as you can! more! Remember that when you're with this guy today!
OMIT: INT. PUERTO RICAN MANSION - DAY Palatial. Drapes dance before the open doors. Music plays.
WALTER: I start to die, fuck the hospital, just sit me down, I wanna kack here.
WALTER: Mr. Novian! What can I say? An honor. This is my associate, John Anthony.
NOVIAN: You should know I think that most sports services are a complete scam. However, I hear your boy here's having quite a season.
WALTER: ( looking around ) Our system? Fuck that, what's your system? Walter laughs. Novian stone-faced, glances at his watch when
BRANDON: It's a privilege to meet you, Mr. Novian. You have a beautiful home. Let's start with how much you bet.
NOVIAN: A million a game, across the board.
BRANDON: Nice round number, is that our ceiling here? Is that the most we're working with?
NOVIAN: "We're" not doing anything until I hear how you feel about this Do you rent that yacht out there?
BRANDON: Do you rent that yacht out there?
NOVIAN: I own it.
BRANDON: Well, sir, that's how I feel about this weekend. That may sound cocky, I don't care. I didn't come down here to lie.
NOVIAN: Do you have inside information?
BRANDON: If I did I wouldn't share that with you. My record speaks for itself. The truth is I know these teams better than they know themselves. I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend, and that includes the Monday Night parlay.
NOVIAN: Why should I believe you?
BRANDON: With all due respect, Mr. Novian, you can't afford not to.
NOVIAN: I can afford to do any damn thing I please.
BRANDON: Can you? What I'm saying is can you can anyone for that matter afford to lose as much as a man like you probably needs to bet to feel a win? Winning's a funny thing, Mr. Novian. it's one of those rare commodities on earth money can't buy. Or was, until you called me.
BRANDON: The price is a quarter million, Mr. Novian up-front in addition to a percentage of every game you win.
NOVIAN: Fuck you. I never pay anything up front.
BRANDON: And we've never charged it before. But with what you're betting, 250 up front's a bargain. You want this weekend's winners, that's my offer. Take it or leave it.
NOVIAN: ( standing ) . Step outside. BRANDON and WALTER exchange looks, unsure where this is going.
NOVIAN: . Ever pick oranges, Mr. Anthony?
BRANDON: I have, in fact it's how I started. Builds character. See those girls down there? Pretend they're oranges and pick some ripe ones. Take 'em upstairs and build some character. Mr. Abrams and I need to refine the terms.
NOVIAN: I have, in fact it's how I started. Builds character. See those girls down there? Pretend they're oranges and pick some ripe ones. Take 'em upstairs and build some character. Mr. Abrams and I need to refine the terms.
YOUNG SALESMAN: They need it, Mr. Anthony. BRANDON picks up his pen, regards the box for Monday Night Seattle or New Orleans? The point spread is Seattle minus 3. BRANDON about to pick when he stops, looks up, smiles
BRANDON: Three questions. What's your mother's name?
YOUNG SALESMAN: What street did you grow up on?
BRANDON: What street did you grow up on?
YOUNG SALESMAN: Atlantic Avenue.
BRANDON: Who do you like Monday night?
YOUNG SALESMAN: I don't know.
BRANDON: Pick one.
YOUNG SALESMAN: That's your job.
BRANDON: I'll do your job tomorrow, today you do mine.
YOUNG SALESMAN: What are you talking about?
BRANDON: Pick one. Stop stalling. You know who's playing. Seattle versus New Orleans.
YOUNG SALESMAN: . I dunno. I guess I like Seattle giving the two points.
BRANDON: ( writing on the form ) Over or under?
YOUNG SALESMAN: You can't do that.
BRANDON: Sure I can! Over 34 points or under!
YOUNG SALESMAN: BRANDON checks it off, gives him the finished form.
YOUNG SALESMAN: I'm not handing that in. Like a million dollars is going on that game!
BRANDON: Like a lot more than that. Relax. I think we know I can pick.
YOUNG SALESMAN: What if I'm wrong?
BRANDON: Didn't they tell you? There is no if.
WALTER: They score, we win! AL MICHAELS/vo from tv Kuhn's stopped at the 10! Seattle down by three. Two seconds on the clock. Kuhn suffered a concussion last week and with that foot injury in the first quarter he has no mobility Hanratty drops back, he's out of the pocket, breaks one tackle, throws downfield, it's tipped! Raymond's got it! Breaks the plane!
WALTER: 100 fucking percent! Champagne corks start popping. Someone hits the remote and the wall of screens fill with a jamming MTV video. The lights dim.
YOUNG SALESMAN: He kinda mesmerized me, see, and like Spock or something I visualized Seattle and the over and he wrote it down! Said picking me was the same as him doing it.
SOUTHIE: What kinda power is that?
REGGIE: Who fucking cares? He's money. JERRY SYKES stands nearby, listening. Whoops of excitement as WALTER jumps up on his desk, starts throwing cash. JERRY moves through the raucous CROWD, finds BRANDON against a wall, out of the fray, watching WALTER hurl money in the air.
JERRY: Congratulations, Brandon. Or should I say John? Either way it's amazing. I must say I am impressed. Letting salesmen make your picks? That's balls.
BRANDON: ( watching WALTER hurl money ) Best get in there and collect some of this, Jerry. The way you're picking, you're gonna need some for a rainy day.
JERRY: Keep talking, sugarmouth. Must feel pretty good to be that plugged in. You got a good streak going. Well enjoy it while it lasts.
WALTER: Here, get you teeth fixed. There might be some other businesses you can make two mill in one weekend, but tell me, someone please tell me where else are you gonna have this much fun?
BRANDON: How much of that big stack's mine?
WALTER: A one with five zeros behind it.
BRANDON: .A 100 fucking thou? On two million?
WALTER: You're working out of my shop.
BRANDON: I was thinking of ten percent.
WALTER: Really? Is that what you were thinking?
BRANDON: I got you Novian.
WALTER: Nice job, now don't blow it by getting ahead of yourself. I'm looking beyond the money.
BRANDON: You can afford to, you're holding it all. C'mon, I only want what's fair, Walter.
WALTER: "Fair?" Honey, you don't know what fair is. What's fair is not giving you the money. Now I'm only gonna say this once. sneeze you have to do more than think about it. Or ask for it. out of my fucking talons. John Anthony would know that. That's what he'd do. As a matter of fact, next time you come with that shit, come as John Anthony. 'Cause from now on I'm not talking to you about money.
TONI: The big winner. How are you doing?
BRANDON: I'm winning. I'm winning. BRANDON leaves. WALTER pulls her close, moves with the music.
WALTER: Dance with me. Close, that's it. I gotta dance with you more. any time we want. There's a house for sale in the Bahamas with a runway right beside it. Comes with its own 50-foot boat. Two for one. What an investment. Anything happens, you and Jules always have it. Let's go down and check it out. Next week, just us, barefoot in the sand.
TONI: . Are you gambling again, Walter?
WALTER: What? Oh, c'mon hell no.
TONI: Look me in the eye and say it.
WALTER: I am not gambling. Not now, not ever. 18 years clean. That shit's over.
TONI: It's never over, Walter. You know that.
WALTER: Get a lie detector if you don't believe me. Shoot me with truth serum. Baby we just made two-million dollars. I'm working miracles here. Now can I enjoy a dance with my wife? Huh? I swear, it's a shame you can't drink, we need something to kill that bug up your ass.
BRANDON: It's just like sex. You start by massaging the numbers, very getting a feel, see how they move. Then there's a shift, a plan forms and you connect to your teams.
FRIEND: ( totally turned on, kissing him ) Nice job description. BRANDON presses her below FRAME, naked ASIAN GIRL climbing on top as the sound of APPLAUSE is heard, building in volume and
WALTER: Know what time it is?
BRANDON: ( glance at his watch ) Yeah, it's
WALTER: Wrong. It's time to press, my friend. We're yanking out all the stops. When you're winning you press.
WALTER: What are you doing?
BRANDON: I have a 10:30 tee time at Wingfoot with a client, that Howell guy. Don't call me unless the lines change.
WALTER: The salmon are running! You're staying right here and fielding calls. You're not going off to play golf and have fun.
BRANDON: Fun? Senor, you have obviously never played Wingfoot.
WALTER: Stop screwing around, you got a lot to do before this weekend.
BRANDON: I'm not asking you if I can leave, Walter I'm telling you that's how it is, understood? You want my picks, hell I'll make 'em now.
WALTER: Whoa hold on slow down today's only Tuesday, you have all week.
BRANDON: I don't need it.
WALTER: Hey we're gonna be advising somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million dollars this week.
BRANDON: Nice neighborhood.
WALTER: You're really gonna make your picks now? No study? No analysis?
BRANDON: I'm in the zone, Walter. Locked in. You want my picks, I might as well do it now!
WALTER: . Okay, fine. Take a break. Go play golf. We'll put the picks on ice and look 'em over tomorrow.
BRANDON: ( walking out ) I won't be in tomorrow.
WALTER: Then the next day! But BRANDON'S gone. WALTER considers what's just occured, regards the finished betting form. He dons his glasses and begin examining BRANDON'S picks and
BRANDON: Where're you headed?
TONI: Some of us have to work.
BRANDON: Come on, get in. I'll give you a lift. ANGLE ON upper brownstone window. WALTER looks down. Watches TONI'S legs swing into BRANDON'S sports car and
BRANDON: Some ride, huh? Feel that? Feel that?
TONI: Slow down, Brandon.
BRANDON: Why? This car was made to go fast.
TONI: Not with me in it.
BRANDON: C'mon, Toni, loosen up. ( goosing the gas, laughing ) Let me ask you something. When you're not at the shop, or running Julia to play dates or keeping Walter from losing his mind, which I know is a full-time job,
TONI: I stay busy.
BRANDON: That's not what I asked.
TONI: Yes it is.
BRANDON: What do you do for you, Toni, for yourself.
TONI: "What do I do for myself?" If you drove past my salon and went two blocks down Prospect Street you would have found me 20 years ago with a needle in my arm. I was a 5-bag a day junkie. I would have sold Julia to get high. Keeping it all on track, that's what I do for myself.
BRANDON: That's not living, Toni. That's just maintaining. You cashed What the hell does that mean? Are we talking perfection here?
TONI: What the hell does that mean? Are we talking perfection here?
BRANDON: Well, nobody's perfect. except me last weekend going 14 and
TONI: Yeah, that's living.
BRANDON: Hell yeah. You oughta try it some time.
TONI: ( stepping from the car ) Thanks for the ride, John. TONI enters her shop and
CHRIS BERMAN: Big loss for Washington, going down 24-12 in Miami. Saint Louis upsets K.C., 34-14. And another Sunday surprise, Philly trounces Pittsburgh, 23-10.
BRANDON: I'm gonna go work out.
WALTER: Sit down! You're watching every game! Every second of every minute of every game! Don't even think of leaving!
WALTER: . How do you go 3 and 11? Wanna know how you make Sunday's picks on Tuesday! It rained in Cincinatti! Two starting QBs didn't play! You're a handicapper, not a psychic!
BRANDON: There's still Monday night and the parlay.
WALTER: Fuck Monday night! Fuck the parlay! You were pissed at me, right? The commission thing?
BRANDON: I don't know.
WALTER: You fucked with me, right? Joke's on me, right? The money thing. you a bump, 10 percent. Now what about Monday night's game? down to climb out of the fucking hole you put 'em in.
BRANDON: Monday night's fine.
WALTER: You'd bet your mother's house on it?
BRANDON: I don't bet.
WALTER: If you did?
BRANDON: I like the pick, Walter.
WALTER: On your mother's house or not?
BRANDON: With my mother in it.
GIRL: Oh my God Brandon! BRANDON glances up, quickly goes back to watching the game.
BRANDON: ( eyes glued to the game ) This is like such a concidence. I live right around the corner.
HEATHER: ( leaning in, laughing ) Earth to Brandon, you're blowing it. The BARTENDER steps in front of the TV to deliver her drink BRANDON jumps from his seat so he can see flurry of action on the screen the game ends the final score flashes and
BRANDON: ( pounding the bar )
FUCK!: HEATHER taken aback, pulls away.
BRANDON: Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!!! HEATHER quickly leaves. Other PATRONS react. BRANDON in his own world of pain. BARTENDER eyeing him now. BRANDON throws down the rest of his drink, trying to steady himself. His beeper suddenly sounds. He looks and
BRANDON: Denny! Hey yeah, I'm in a bar.. Of course in New York, I own this town. What's going on you okay?. Tonight's game?
QUICK CUTS: A dozen rapid-fire kick-offs fill the SCREEN RECEIVERS catch passes, OTHERS drop them spectacularly RUNNING BACKS brilliantly juke tackles, score QUARTERBACKS are slammed from behind, stripped of the ball kicks miss goal posts by inches PLAYERS are carried off on stretchers footballs sail through RECEIVERS'S hands, their fingers clawing empty air scoreboards blink outcomes, stadium lights flare and
WALTER: Helluva swing. Great game. Sport of kings, right? Or is that horse racing?
BRANDON: What are you doing here?
WALTER: Southie told me where you were.
BRANDON: I had to get out. Clear my head. ( teeing one up ) Well talk to me. How'd we do?
WALTER: You haven't seen the scores?
BRANDON: Nope. That's how I wanted it. Just make the picks and get the results later.
WALTER: Highest sales volume ever. Take a guess.
BRANDON: I think we kicked ass.
WALTER: It was amazing.
BRANDON: I told you. Last week was nothing. BRANDON smacks a drive, watches it soar
WALTER: You're right, nothing compared to how much we lost today!
BRANDON: . What'd I go?
WALTER: I have an idea. I give you a few glimpses of what happened here today and you take a stab.
BRANDON: Just give me the numbers, Walter.
WALTER: You don't like that game. Too bad. Woulda been fun. Grown men crying on the phone. Wives screaming in the background.
BRANDON: No. When you lose 10 out of 12, fuck doesn't quite cover it. Shit!" Or "My Fucking God." Or "Jesus Fucking Christ!"
WALTER: No. When you lose 10 out of 12, fuck doesn't quite cover it. Shit!" Or "My Fucking God." Or "Jesus Fucking Christ!"
BRANDON: Enough. I get the idea, Walter.
WALTER: You're right. I mean 2 for 12 on our biggest volume weekend what the hell's left to say? Except maybe keep the phone number and switch it over to a fucking suicide hotline!
WALTER: Tomorrow morning, Brandon! Bright and early! We start in all over again! No getting off! I'm gonna ride you until you're more sick of me than losing! Turn it around and we avoid a lot of pain!
OMIT: EXT. BROOKLYN PARK - EARLY MORNING Gloomy fog. A few PEOPLE heading home from work. BRANDON riding his bike, pedaling fast when a MAN suddenly steps out, flash of something in his hand, jamming it in the spokes and BRANDON wipes out, over the handlebars hard to the ground
BRANDON: Son of a bitch. What the fuck
BODYGUARD: Mr. Novian wants to see you. Now.
BRANDON: ( seeing a gun in his waistband ) . Tell him to call.
BODYGUARD: You tell him. BRANDON looks, sees NOVIAN nearby.
NOVIAN: I didn't recognize you without the suit, John.
BRANDON: This is my time off. It's how I clear my head. You want to talk, pick a time.
NOVIAN: Or should I call you Brandon? Someone costs you 18 mill, you do some research.
BRANDON: I'm leaving. The BODYGUARD grabs his arm. Iron grip.
NOVIAN: Feel that? I hate the cold. Winter's coming. Water's getting What the fuck is this about? If you don't like my picks, use someone else.
BRANDON: What the fuck is this about? If you don't like my picks, use someone else.
NOVIAN: Oh, I'm not using you again. That's already decided. And I can't get my money back. It's gone. No, I came for an apology.
NOVIAN: Look me in the eye and say you're sorry. Say it so as to make me believe you mean it.
BRANDON: You flew to New York for
NOVIAN: That's right.
BRANDON: . I'm sorry.
NOVIAN: I don't accept it. Not good enough. Try again.
BRANDON: I don't know what you want me to say. I'm sorry. I am. I'm very sorry.
NOVIAN: I am very, very sorry. That's a lot of money.
BRANDON: I am very, very sorry. That's a lot of money.
NOVIAN: Not even close.
BRANDON: I'm sorry!
NOVIAN: This isn't going to work. I'll have to get satisfaction somehow Look, I'm not it I. NOVIAN inches from BRANDON. Unbuttons his coat. Sound of a zipper. BRANDON glances down, sees Novian reach into his fly.
BRANDON: Look, I'm not it I. NOVIAN inches from BRANDON. Unbuttons his coat. Sound of a zipper. BRANDON glances down, sees Novian reach into his fly.
JERRY: I scored you the new mikes, Walter. No wires to mess with. What do you think?
WALTER: I'm busy.
JERRY: Listen, I think I should lead off. I have some really strong You got a good hole, Jerry. Stay in it.
WALTER: You got a good hole, Jerry. Stay in it.
JERRY: C'mon, I went 8 for 12 last weekend. I'm hot. I'm feeling it.
TECHNICIAN: 60 seconds.
JERRY: What am I, wood?
WALTER: You got one good weekend under your belt, don't push it.
JERRY: One weekend? The Sykes System revolutionized this industry.
WALTER: Take a hike.
JERRY: You heard me. You're fired. Goodbye.
WALTER: You heard me. You're fired. Goodbye.
JERRY: I'm not fired, you need me more than ever.
WALTER: Beat it, you cut-rate parasite!
JERRY: In six years my worst weekend was never as bad as any of his last three weeks!
WALTER: Get out! You don't work for me anymore!
JERRY: What the hell are you doing, Walter? C'mon, man it's me, Jerry. These other guys come and go.
WALTER: ( pointing at BRANDON ) Not this one! That's true talent! I'm firing your ass 'cause you don't see it and I can't explain it to you!
JERRY: Think what you're fucking doing!
WALTER: I am! You couldn't pick your fucking nose without a computer!
WALTER: . Fuck him where he flosses. Asshole doesn't understand I'm building an empire around you. Finish the countdown, we got a big weekend to get to! Let's go, chop chop!
TONI: It's me, Brandon. Can I come in?
BRANDON: No. It's not a good time. What do you need?
TONI: I need to talk to you, it's important. BRANDON lost, doesn't answer.
TONI: You need to get out, Brandon. You need to go.
BRANDON: I gotta pick a winner is what I gotta do. I gotta get back on It won't matter. You could go 100-and-0 and it won't be enough it'll never be enough. He'll ride you into the ground.
TONI: It won't matter. You could go 100-and-0 and it won't be enough it'll never be enough. He'll ride you into the ground.
BRANDON: I gotta figure this out.
TONI: Please, Brandon.
BRANDON: I'll figure it out. TONI leans her head against the door, exasperated, spent and
BRANDON VOICEOVER: Alex, it's Brandon. Hey, it's been awhile but I never got your number that night. I was in the neighborhood so I thought I'd take a chance and stop by.
BRANDON: Man, you got a Doberman for a doorman.
ALEX: What are you doing here?
BRANDON: I came by to take you out for a late dinner and a couple of killer bottles of wine. C'mon. We'll go back to that place where we Are you out of your fucking mind? ( stepping close for emphasis ) I live in this building, asshole. It's home. I don't like creeps coming around unannounced. Lurking around outside.
ALEX: Are you out of your fucking mind? ( stepping close for emphasis ) I live in this building, asshole. It's home. I don't like creeps coming around unannounced. Lurking around outside.
BRANDON: What the hell's gotten into you? What about that night?
ALEX: Let me make this real clear so this shit doesn't happen again. 5000 bucks. Your friend set it up.
BRANDON: Intercut - amir in payphone beside N.J. Turnpike - dawn ( dishevelled, distraught ) I'm wiped out, John.
BRANDON: My business. My house. My credit.
BRANDON: No, now listen to me we got a big weekend coming up, buddy
AMIR: Still you talk like this. Who the fuck are you, like this is some kind of game. I was betting a few thousand a Sunday when I called you. You pushed me. Every call. All the time with your talk. I lost $380,000 this weekend. I was going to get married. I had a life.
AMIR: No words now, huh? No more money to squeeze so you shut up.
BRANDON: ( face hardening ) Fuck him if he can't take a joke. TAMMY puts the day's newspapers on his desk, leaves. BRANDON glances down, something catches his eye. BRANDON pulls a newspaper from the pile finds himself staring at a full-page ad for JOHN ANTHONY. Big smile. Copy advertising "The Million Dollar Man!" and
BRANDON: I know what the problem is! BRANDON freezes. WALTER watches two MEN unload stacks of money from a briefcase, pile them on his desk.
BRANDON: I'll come back later.
WALTER: No! C'mon in. We're done here. Right fellas? All through?
BRANDON: Who were they?
WALTER: We need a bat light or something, you know a signal I can shoot up at the
BRANDON: Who were they?
WALTER: They're from the Salvation Army. How the hell does someone go 1-for-8? A fucking monkey tossing darts could do better!
BRANDON: What's with the money, Walter?
WALTER: ( coming around the desk ) I have a plan. From now on we take your picks and reverse everything!
BRANDON: ( staring at the pile of cash ) How much is that?
WALTER: ( sweeping the pile to the floor ) How much is what? Oh, that 275,000 dollars!
BRANDON: What happened to the two mill, all the other money?
WALTER: I was carrying twice that in red ink before you showed up. The last few weeks I thought keep the pressure off. He'll come around. the lights! Let him see the toilet he's drowning us all in! got three mortgages on this house, I'm gambling again and to cover my losses I just got a loan from a guy who works out of a bar on a 106th and Broadway! All this everything you see around you
WALTER CON'D: . What'd you say when you came in? You were in a good mood when you walked through the door and you said something.
BRANDON: You're betting my picks?
WALTER: You went 82 and 11! You were picking 80 percent how could I fucking not!? Trouble is I bet heavy after you went a hundred percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet! One decent weekend and I would have been set for life! One decent weekend!
WALTER: "I know what the problem is!" That's it! You came in with a big smile and said, "I know what the problem is!"
BRANDON: . I'm Brandon Lang, Walter. Brandon's the one who played sports. myself. It wasn't an act, man. I became John Anthony. But he's not me. If I go back to being Brandon
WALTER: You can pick again! Of course! All you gotta do is go back to being Brandon! Talk like Brandon! all my fault. I see that now. I pushed you into something you weren't. I took the golden goose and tried to turn it into a duck. We're winding down the season. There's only two games this weekend. Two winners and two over/unders. That's all we need. You crunch the numbers, sprinkle in a little Brandon magic, we get the sales people burning up the phones and come Monday we go four for four going into the big game! Right? Huh? Let's something to eat! Go to Smith and Wo's!
BRANDON: No thanks. I'll stay here. Eat light.
WALTER: ( kneeling down, stacking the cash ) The Brandon thing! What am I thinking trying to get you to go out? What would Brandon eat for lunch? Peanut butter and jelly?
BRANDON: ( on the floor, helping him ) I'll get something.
WALTER: You want anything shipped from home? Your bed? Clothes? Porno No, I'm fine.
BRANDON: No, I'm fine.
WALTER: Blow job?
BRANDON: Thanks anyway. Maybe later.
WALTER: Because it's important.
BRANDON: Pressure doesn't help.
WALTER: God forgive me, you're an artist. I fucked with that. Two little winners and a couple of over/unders. That's all we need. You could phone it in. Two's nothing. Not for you. Not for Brandon.
WALTER: These are the winners?
BRANDON: That's who I like.
WALTER: Brandon made these picks?
BRANDON: You're looking at him.
WALTER: ( regarding the picks, to the room ) New York and the under, Tenessee and the under! Sell 'em hard!
WALTER: Sure, Angel. I need you to root for me. ( pointing at ATLANTA ) They're the bad guys. Atlanta. We want the blue team. New York. They have to win by more than five points. And root for a low score. Both teams have to make less than 42 points total.
JULIA: Why do we like the blue team?
WALTER: Because Brandon likes them. JULIA looks at BRANDON, smiles. BRANDON'S barely holding up here, forces himself to find a smile in return.
DISSOLVE TO: INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT WALTER and BRANDON alone in the room. Sound of the ANNOUNCERS as Atlanta get trounced by Denver. Not even close. Well over 42 total points scored. The game ends. All four bets lost.
BRANDON: .I'm finished. I'm done.
WALTER: That's great.
BRANDON: I can't do this anymore, Walter. I can't sleep at night. I can't eat.
WALTER: You're not gonna sit there and tell me you're ending this because you have a little indigestion or some insomnia.
BRANDON: It's a lot more than that.
WALTER: I made it very clear before we started what the stakes were.
BRANDON: Walter, it's over. What use could John Anthony be to you now?
WALTER: Wrong! Hot streaks go cold, cold streaks go hot. Bettors will climb back aboard.
WALTER CON'D: They know you! And when your luck turns they'll remember you went 80 percent for half the season! We'll make it all back on the last game and by next year they'll forget everything.
BRANDON: Who said anything about next year?
WALTER: Sports betting's year-round.
BRANDON: I'm not doing this next year.
WALTER: You made a career choice! I bankrolled it!
TONI VO: Let him go, Walter. WALTER and BRANDON turn, see TONI at the door.
WALTER: Of course you stick up for him!
TONI: Meaning what?
WALTER: Who's side are you on?
TONI: I didn't realize I had to choose.
WALTER: ( to BRANDON ) Look, you got a magnificent gift. Own that. So you strike out sometimes, big deal, you're swinging for the fences. You're a champion, Brandon. A champion goes down 186 times but gets up 187. I'm not letting you stay down. This isn't about you or me or Toni, this transcends that this is metaphysical, this is cosmic, this is eternal this is God. Besides, we have a contract.
BRANDON: You can't own someone, Walter.
TONI: You can't own someone, Walter.
WALTER: I created the hottest sports tout this country's ever seen! I plugged him, took out full page ads, built a show around him, hooked him up with every major client I have and I will be goddamned if he's going to walk out the door and take all that with him! me and him! Get out!
BRANDON: Don't talk to her like that.
WALTER: I need you to tell me how to talk to my wife? When I'm talking you'll shut your fucking toilet!
TONI: ( to BRANDON ) INT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT BRANDON comes down the hall. TONI and WALTER heard yelling through the office door. BRANDON hesitates, walks out and
WALTER'S VOICE: Brandon. Brandon. BRANDON'S POV. His eyes open. WALTER'S face fills FRAME.
WALTER: Wake up.
BRANDON: What time is it?
WALTER: Five in the morning. Listen, I gotta fly to Vegas to meet with some clients. Hand holding thing. Keep 'em on board for the final game. Because you can do this thing, Brandon. End of the season's the perfect place to turn this streak around. I'll be back to you out to dinner. Get you back in the groove. 9:30.
BRANDON: Hey, I didn't know you were coming.
TONI: Walter was delayed, he's coming back in the morning. Asked if I'd fill in.
BRANDON: ( processing this ) That's funny, he didn't call me. You look great. TONI silent. You okay?
TONI: Julia did her ballet recital today. God she was beautiful.
BRANDON: She is. . He's betting again. BRANDON regards her.
TONI: I can't believe I'm here again. I saw it coming. I just. I just couldn't stop it.
BRANDON: Nobody could.
TONI: He won't stop on his own. He can't.
BRANDON: I gotta win one more game.
TONI: You can't fix this, Brandon. After Sunday's game I'm taking off.
BRANDON: It's still early. Come in for a while.
TONI: I don't think so. She leans in to kiss him on the cheek and BRANDON suddenly shifts. Their lips meet. A casual goodbye suddenly grows in intensity as neither tries to part. Seconds ticking by. Things getting heated. TONI tries to pull away.
TONI: BRANDON comes close, whispers something. He unlocks the door. She hesitates before BRANDON takes her hand, leads her into his dark apartment and
DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - DAY Gray, winter day. View of a snow-covered window sill
WALTER: Look at that. With the leaves and all. This goes on my desk.
TONI: Happy anniversary. KNOCK at the door JULIA vo I'll get it. JULIA hands the CAMERA to WALTER. VIDEO CAMERA view of JULIA and the puppy running to the door, opening it and
JULIA: Hey darlin'. Walter vo There he is. C'mon in. We're having a little celebration. Toni and I were married 12 years ago today.
BRANDON: Hey darlin'. Walter vo There he is. C'mon in. We're having a little celebration. Toni and I were married 12 years ago today.
BRANDON: Congratulations, I didn't know. WALTER vo Sit down. I want you to be part of this. Okay angel, give Mommy my gift. WALTER aims the CAMERA as JULIA hands TONI a small gift box.
BRANDON: I can't take this. WALTER vo Why not?
BRANDON: It's too much. WALTER vo For what? You're family, Brandon. We all love each other, right? I guess that makes you his mother.
TONI: They're for evening. WALTER vo Good, wear 'em to bed tonight. ( VIDEO CAMERA back on BRANDON ) Who do you think'll win the big game?
BRANDON: Turn it off. WALTEr/still taping Better yet, don't say anything. Surprise me. We'll break it when we do the live show. Take your time, Brandon. Enjoy yourself.
TECHNICIAN'S VOICE: 60 seconds till we go live, Mr. Anthony! BRANDON looks over. The unfinished pick sheet lies crumpled by the toilet. He smooths it. Pulls a coin.
BRANDON: Heads, New York. Tails Denver. He flips the coin. Palms it. Heads. BRANDON checks the box.
BRANDON: Heads, over. Tails, under. BRANDON flips again, lets the coin hit the floor, watches it spin, slowly come to a stop, drop to its side and
TECHNICIAN: Ten seconds!
BRANDON: Wanna know about the picks?
WALTER: New York minus the two-and-a-half points and the over, what should I know?
BRANDON: I flipped a coin to decide.
TECHNICIAN: Five, four, three, two, one

BRANDON: It's not over yet, Walter. I wouldn't change my bet.
WALTER: Where the hell's Brandon?
WALTER: You're missing the game! We're back in it! A New York touchdown and we win both bets!
WALTER: . He left.
TONI: I know.
WALTER: And you didn't you tell me?
TONI: He asked me not to.
WALTER: Just like that? No goodbye?
TONI: I'm sure it's in the letter.
WALTER: I'm sure it is. I wonder what's not in here?
TONI: What do you mean?
WALTER: What do you mean, what do I mean? When it comes to Brandon you seem to have all the answers.
TONI: He had enough. He wanted his life back.
WALTER: He said that to you?
TONI: Yeah, loud and clear, by leaving.
WALTER: I think it's something else.
TONI: Yeah, tell me.
WALTER: You know.
TONI: ON the TV. New York's driving. Game reaching a head. A clock in the corner counts down the final two minutes.
WALTER: You have no idea, huh?

TONI: You mean you lied to me about the trip!
WALTER: Don't talk to me about lying!
TONI: I guess you had the whole thing planned?
WALTER: Don't make this about me!
TONI: Put me out there on a tray!
WALTER: Yeah, I put the tray out there but you didn't have to shove an apple in your mouth and jump on it! On him!
WALTER: Admit it!
TONI: You played me!
WALTER: You're damn right I did!
TONI: . Brandon was right. Son of a bitch!
WALTER: You don't deny it!
TONI: Best pick he ever made.
WALTER: What the hell are you talking about?
TONI: You were gambling with me that night, Walter. Brandon knew it. believe him I mean after all we've been through but I figured what the hell.
TONI CON'D: didn't even stay here. And you. you were in such a good mood the next day. I figured he must have been wrong. Otherwise why wouldn't you confront us? Confront me?
TONI: And now I find out you've been thinking ever since then that we did sleep together? Living with it like that? Looking at me like that? You sick fuck! You wanted to lose! You set us up! Like I was something you just toss on the table! Only we booked your bet, Walter!
BRANDON: It's me.
BRANDON'S DAD: Hello, Brandon?
BRANDON: Hey, hey the big winner. What's going on?
BRANDON'S DAD: Nothing much. the usual.
BRANDON: C'mon, I know it's rough, it's supposed to be. A friend turned me on to the place. She said it's the best.
BRANDON'S DAD: Where are you headed?
BRANDON: I don't know, but I got an airport full of planes to choose from.
BRANDON'S DAD: Does your mom know I'm in rehab?
BRANDON: Yeah, I told her.
BRANDON'S DAD: Great pick on New York. It's like I always said, you don't bet quarterbacks and receivers
