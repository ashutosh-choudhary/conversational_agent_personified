SAM: Something like that.
SHERYL: Precisely like that.
SAM: Get you started with one of these.
SAM: How long you folks hiking for?
MIKE: Two days. Heading out early Sunday.
SAM: Well, if you move at a decent clip, you could hit the summit by midday tomorrow. Should still give you time to take it all in and make it down.
SHERYL: Any particular path?
SAM: You folks experienced hikers?
MIKE: We've done some ah
SHERYL: ( interrupting ) No. Nothing like this.
SAM: For first-timers, I recommend either Willow Creek Bridge or Donner Trail.
SHERYL: Donner Trail? As in "The Donner I'm not sure of the name's origin. They're the two paths we regularly patrol. Something happens and you're on one of the other trails, it might be awhile before we find you.
SAM: I'm not sure of the name's origin. They're the two paths we regularly patrol. Something happens and you're on one of the other trails, it might be awhile before we find you.
MIKE: Where do we camp?
SAM: Unless it says not to, you can set up where you like. Just make sure when you turn in that you extinguish your fire. Oh, and this here's bear country. They're not animals to fool with. You see one, you head the other way, especially if he's feeding. If the bear thinks you're getting in the way of his food, that's all she wrote.
SHERYL: ( Sarcastic ) You got yourself a first aid kit?
SAM: You got yourself a first aid kit?

SAM: Good for you. The question was, do you have a first aid kit?
SHERYL: Yes, we have a first aid kit.
SAM: Great, see how easy that was. It's off-season, park's pretty quiet. Even more than usual. You may run into a few locals, but
SHERYL: People live up here?
SAM: We have a few generations of families that have called these mountains home. Most of `em are friendly. Respect their land and they'll respect you.
MIKE: ( Moving on ) Base is just outside, to the left. At about two miles up there'll be a junction where you can pick your path.
SAM: ( Moving on ) Base is just outside, to the left. At about two miles up there'll be a junction where you can pick your path.

SHERYL: I'll take mine.
MIKE: Just to annoy you.
SHERYL: Just to annoy you.
MIKE: SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 11. Huh? Mike shakes his head, puts his phone in the glove Sheryl tucks her phone and the flier into a side pocket of her backpack. Zips it shut. ANGLE ON - Mike's keys and his Boston Red Sox key chain. Mike locks the door.

SHERYL: So what were you?
MIKE: Me? I was a stoner.
SHERYL: So what does that mean?
MIKE: How the hell am I supposed to remember? I was high all the time.
MIKE: Where'd you get that bandana?
SHERYL: It's cute, right? I stopped by that Army-Navy store on Grover yesterday. Keeps the sweat out of your eyes.

SHERYL: What is it?
MIKE: Looks like it's a, or was, a fox. Come on.
SHERYL: What do you think? "Cannibal" Trail or the other one?
MIKE: Guidebook says a couple of these other trails lead to some pretty sweet We're not Lewis and/or Clark. We're gonna stick to one of the ones the Ranger said.

MIKE: We're just going over our options Well, take it from me, any way you choose, you can't go wrong.
IDA: Well, take it from me, any way you choose, you can't go wrong.
SHERYL: The Ranger at base suggested Donner Trail or.
IDA: .Willow Creek Bridge. I think Sam only knows those two trails. Well. Between those, I'd pick Donner Trail. Willow Creek will shoot you to the top, but there's not as much to see. Donner weaves through Peddler's Point, it's a better hike and prettier all around view.
SHERYL: ( To Mike ) What do you think?
IDA: That's a pretty ring.
SHERYL: Thank you.
IDA: Not your traditional wedding ring, but it's all the same in the Lord's eyes. How long have you two been wed?
SHERYL: Oh. we're not married. Not yet
SHERYL: It's a ring my father gave me for Oh, I'm sorry. You just looked like you was married is'all. Both so I'm just an old fashioned silly-bird. I need to mind my own business.
IDA: ( embarrassed ) Oh, I'm sorry. You just looked like you was married is'all. Both so ( Beat ) I'm just an old fashioned silly-bird. I need to mind my own business.
SHERYL: No, it's fine.
MIKE: ( changing topics ) Which one of those trails got the best Clearings? Neither will give you much in the way of clearings. But, there's another path, this one here. ( Points to the map ) Timber Falls. Its got some beautiful vistas and one of the prettiest falls you'll ever see.
IDA: Clearings? Neither will give you much in the way of clearings. But, there's another path, this one here. Timber Falls. Its got some beautiful vistas and one of the prettiest falls you'll ever see.
MIKE: Sounds perfect. Well, I'll leave you to it. Last thing you need is me fussing'round you, taking you from your private
IDA: Well, I'll leave you to it. Last thing you need is me fussing'round you, taking you from your private
IDA: I'm just gonna say it and go, but if you two were to marry. I bet the Lord would bless you with a happy, healthy and handsome child. Good luck and God bless you both.
SHERYL: I suddenly feel the need for Not yet? Love taking your shots, don't ya?
MIKE: ( Still lingering on. ) Not yet? Love taking your shots, don't ya?
SHERYL: When I see an opening.
MIKE: ( Checks map ) That path she was talking about winds through these falls. What do you I think. if you get eaten by a bear and there isn't a Ranger around, I'm not carrying what's left of you down this mountain.
SHERYL: I think. if you get eaten by a bear and there isn't a Ranger around, I'm not carrying what's left of you down this mountain.

SHERYL: I know. All done.
MIKE: Not bad, Nightingale. Not bad at all.

MIKE: No, we're from Virginia, just up for a weekend trip. And, uh. you folks live up here?
BRODY: It's easy to spot the city folk. It's like they're trying to be friendly, when really they don't want to be.
MIKE: I think you just startled us is all.
MIKE: We'll just be on our way. May I have those?
DARRYL: Finders keepers.
BRODY: Brody concedes, gestures to Darryl to give the shorts back. Darryl reluctantly obliges. Mike passes them to Sheryl who slides them on. Darryl and Lonnie soak in every inch of Sheryl as she does. Mike takes Sheryl's hand. They make a move, but. Brody stops them with the barrel of his shotgun.

MIKE: Same reason you brought your cellphone. Better to have it and not need it. To protect us.
SHERYL: Lotta good it just did.
MIKE: ( Then, call out ) You want to go back? ( No response ) Sheryl? I'm sorry.
SHERYL: We should have stuck to one of the patrolled paths.
MIKE: ( Under his breath )
MIKE: You alright?
SHERYL: ( balances herself )
MIKE: I'm sorry.
SHERYL: Do you know how many times I've had someone die on me? How many children? I stopped keeping count.
MIKE: I thought. I wasn't thinking. What do you want me to do?
SHERYL: Get rid of the gun.

SHERYL: Was that all of them?
MIKE: Mike steps back to Sheryl, they hug.
SHERYL: Thank you.
CLYDE: Oh. Didn't mean to startle you folks. Just clearing some of the brush off
MIKE: It's fine. We were led to believe this trail wasn't regularly patrolled.
CLYDE: It's not, but. It's one of my favorite spots, so I often find an excuse to swing by.
SHERYL: It's gorgeous.
CLYDE: Yup. There are a couple more falls in the park, but none quite so. inviting as this one. Now don't take my word for it, you can see for yourself. How long's your stay?
SHERYL: Just til Sunday.
CLYDE: Yeah, no. The other falls are clear on the other side. It would take you a couple nights just to get there.
SHERYL: Maybe next time.
MIKE: This is a quickie trip. Just getting out of the city for a couple days.
CLYDE: The city, huh. Which? If it's Charleston, I wouldn't blame ya. Whole place smells like feet. I gotta haul myself all the way down to the hospital there for my yearly because the darn HMO's rules and regulations won't let me visit the local Doc. Not my cup of tea at all, but if you like it there, then.
SHERYL: No, we're not from Charleston.
MIKE: But apparently we look like we are.
SHERYL: We live in Alexandria. It's just outside of D.C.
CLYDE: Oh. I've been there, few years back. Now that city I like. Lotta beautiful churches if I recall correctly. Which congregation do y'all belong to?
MIKE: Um. Not sure. Sheryl keeps track of all that for us. Sheryl?
SHERYL: Uh. We're between congregations at the moment. Well. I should get back to work. Sun'll be down soon and that path ain't gettin'clear on its own.
CLYDE: Well. I should get back to work. Sun'll be down soon and that path ain't gettin'clear on its own.
SHERYL: Excuse me. Sir?
CLYDE: The name's Clyde.
SHERYL: Clyde, would you recommend a nice spot nearby to make camp for the night?
CLYDE: Be happy too. Let's see. Oh, I got it. "Five Corners" will be perfect. It's just a bit up the ways here, near the Lake. It's five large rocks which sit in a clearing with a view of the whole park. The rocks retain the heat from the day, so if you set up camp between them you won't be so cold.
SHERYL: Sounds perfect.
MIKE: Just doing my job. You have fun and be careful. Good evening.
CLYDE: Just doing my job. You have fun and be careful. Good evening.
SHERYL: This is incredible.
SHERYL: Ranger said there's a lake near by.
MIKE: The lake. I'd kill to rinse off.
SHERYL: The lake. I'd kill to rinse off.
MIKE: Whoa. Wait a sec. It'll be dark soon.
SHERYL: Where's your sense of adventure?
MIKE: Sher. Seriously. Let's wait `til
SHERYL: Mike stares at the many assorted parts of the tent, the sheet of instructions laid out. He holds one of the poles, which consists of separate links connected by a string. He has no idea where to begin.
SHERYL: Do you know what you are doing?
MIKE: I think its pretty obvious that I
MIKE: That was. the worst dinner ever.
SHERYL: ( Beat ) You cooked.
MIKE: Yeah, I'm aware. You know what would make this evening perfect? Moonshine. I got a whole jar of it. There's a sentence I never thought I'd say. "I have a jar of moonshine." Matter of fact, I've got enough to share with our entire . in Charleston.
SHERYL: . in Charleston.
MIKE: Our home city, of course. But I should start with you. Would you like some moonshine?
MIKE: Then what would you like?
SHERYL: I'd like to fuck you.
MIKE: Not very Christian of you.
SHERYL: I'm more Old Testament.
MIKE: What's that mean?
SHERYL: Not sure. But I think it's the nastier of the two books.
MIKE: I was good. I mean, even better than If you don't say so.

MIKE: . if I don't say so myself, yeah. Top notch performance. What, you Nah, it was good. Do you think I had anything to do.
SHERYL: Nah, it was good. Do you think I had anything to do.
MIKE: No. All me.
SHERYL: ( Beat; cautious ) I liked what the old woman said about us earlier.
MIKE: What did she say?
SHERYL: That she thought we were married.
MIKE: ( Groans ) You are relentless.
SHERYL: I wouldn't be a proper girlfriend if I didn't nag every now and then.
MIKE: I get it, but it makes me feel like the bad guy every time. Which makes me feel like shit.
SHERYL: I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Where are you going?
MIKE: Do out there, what you did in here.
SHERYL: What's that?
MIKE: Put out the fire.

MIKE: 51 EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY ( 2ND UNIT ) 51
SHERYL!: 51 EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY ( 2ND UNIT ) 51
MIKE: Mike writhes in pain on the ground. His eyes watering. The pain UNBEARABLE. Then. MIKE'S POV - Someone or thing appears, stepping from the forest. They come closer. THE SUN BLASTS DIRECTLY BEHIND The FIGURE keeping their identity hidden. Mike's eyelids flutter, can't determine who/what it is. The pain overwhelms him. He doesn't care any longer. Then. Ida bends down next to Mike.
HELP!?!?!: Mike writhes in pain on the ground. His eyes watering. The pain UNBEARABLE. Then. MIKE'S POV - Someone or thing appears, stepping from the forest. They come closer. THE SUN BLASTS DIRECTLY BEHIND The FIGURE keeping their identity hidden. Mike's eyelids flutter, can't determine who/what it is. The pain overwhelms him. He doesn't care any longer. Then. Ida bends down next to Mike.
IDA: Michael, can you hear me? Michael.
MIKE: A sharp pain shoots through his body. Mike reaches for his leg. The tourniquet conceals the damage. A damn towel is wrapped around where the wound is. A bandage has replaced the Gray Bandana on his arm. Ida enters the cabin from the back door, into the kitchen. She removes the teapot from the burner. The whistling stops.
IDA: Look who's up.
MIKE: Where am I?
IDA: You're in my home, Michael. You gave me quite a scare. I thought I lost
IDA: Lucky the snap didn't break the bone, just bruised it. I know that's of little comfort now, but trust me, it's a good thing. That dirty trap however's prime for spreading infection, need to finish cleaning out that wound and then I'll get some "evening primrose" in you. Same stuff the Indian Tribes used it back in the day to heal, well. just about everything. So's do I.
IDA: Try and relax.
MIKE: Thank you. For saving my life.
IDA: You don't have to thank me. Up here, we take care of one another. That's the only way any of us survive.
MIKE: ( Thinks. ) I'm sorry, but I don't know your name.
IDA: Oh for the sake of sunshine. how rude a host am I? Name's Ida Foster.
MIKE: Ida, I need some help.
IDA: I'm moving as fast as I can, sweetie.
MIKE: No, not me. It's Sheryl. My girlfriend. You met her with me yesterday. Something's happened to her. She was gone this morning when I woke up. I looked everywhere and I couldn't find her. We need to call someone. A Ranger. Somebody. We need to find her right away. Do you have a phone?
IDA: I'm sorry, but I don't. Never really had use for one. I do have a radio. We can call down to base if you'd like.
IDA: After we take care of you.
MIKE: I'm fine, Ida, please. if you could call now.
IDA: You want to lose this leg? Cause that's what you're risking. Soon as we're done, I'll call. Okay?
IDA: Bite down on this. I ain't gonna lie. Lotta pain about to hit you
IDA: It's okay. It's almost over.
IDA: We'll get some of that primrose in you and you'll be good as new.
MIKE: Ida? The radio. Please. Can you call down please?
IDA: I'll take care of it right now.
MIKE: ( Whispers ) He's looking for me.
IDA: ( Whispers; concerned ) Why's that?
MIKE: ( Whispers ) I think he had something to do with Sheryl going missing.
IDA: ( Whispers ) I'll take care of it.
IDA: I'm coming!
BRODY: What took you so long?
IDA: What do you want, Brody?
BRODY: I'm looking for a man hiker.
IDA: This "man hiker" alone or wit someone?
BRODY: He had a lady friend, but. I'm just looking for him now.
IDA: Well, I ain't seen no one in days.
IDA: What'd he do you for anyway?
BRODY: He busted Darryl's face in with a shotgun. Left him a mess of blood and teeth. Nearly killed him. You spot anyone you don't know, you be sure to find me.
IDA: Brody eyeballs Ida one last time, then leaves. Ida watches him go, closes the door and heads to the alcove.
IDA: He's gone. Brody and those boys are a pain in the backside. I'm sure that cousin of his had it coming.
MIKE: What did the Ranger say? Does he need to speak to me? When is he coming?
IDA: Sorry, I wasn't able to reach anyone.
MIKE: God damnit!
IDA: Please don't take the Lord's name in vain in this house.
MIKE: I'm sorry.
IDA: Drink this.
MIKE: Something's not right.
IDA: I'm sure they're just on rounds and will be back any minute. We'll try them again and we'll find Sheryl. You'll see. She probably just took a wrong turn up here, ended up in the middle of "don't know where." Happens lots of times. Please drink up, Michael, it will make you feel better.
IDA: What's wrong?
MIKE: How did you know my name?
IDA: ( Confused ) Excuse me?
MIKE: Michael. You keep calling me Michael. You did it just now. You did before, just after I woke up. You called me Michael. Nobody calls me Michael.
IDA: I'm sure you're mistaken. You musta told me before.
MIKE: No, I would have told you "Mike." Only my grandmother, who's dead, ever called me Michael.
IDA: Well, how else could I have known your SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 17, 2006 49.
MIKE: ( Beat; thinks. ) On my driver's license and credit cards, it says Michael. If you stole my wallet from the campsite. that's how you'd have known.
IDA: You're accusing me of stealing your wallet? I saved your life. Twice. Why would I steal your wallet? Now, just drink your primrose.
MIKE: Fuck the primrose!
IDA: Where do you think you're going?
MIKE: I want to call the Ranger myself.
IDA: Ida springs to her feet, jumps in front of Mike.
NO!: Ida springs to her feet, jumps in front of Mike.
MIKE: I'm getting in that room, Ida.
IDA: I can't let you in there.
MIKE: Where is Sheryl, Ida? She's in that room, isn't she?
IDA: You sinners are all alike. I heard you last night. Spitting in the face
IDA: You and your bitch whore girlfriend will atone for your sins.
MIKE: Mike moves faster, reaches the end of the hallway, faces the door. He turns the knob, pushes it open, and.
MIKE: Oh my God.
MIKE: I need something to cut you down,
MIKE: Are you okay?
SHERYL: Get me out of here. Hurry.
SHERYL: He'll be back soon.
MIKE: Who's he?
SHERYL: Come on, come on, come on.
MIKE: He banged his injured leg on something.
SHERYL: ( Whispers ) What are you doing?
SHERYL: ( Whispers ) Mike? Mike?
SHERYL SCREAMS!: The Concealed Figure swings the axe/sickle, slices Mike across the forearm. BLOOD SPRAYS ACROSS THE FLOOR. Mike YELPS in pain, drops the flashlight and knife.
MIKE: Sheryl, run!
MIKE: ( To Sheryl ) Get the fuck out of here! Now!
SHERYL: ( No response )
SHERYL SCREAMS!: HE LUNGES FOR SHERYL, but misses. She runs through the door, 66 INT. CHAPEL - IDA'S CABIN - DAY 66 . Sheryl rushes into the room, but trips on something. When she gets up, the first thing she sees. THE FETUS JARS! She coughs violently, almost pukes. She stumbles, hurries up the trap door steps. A moment later. The Concealed Figure pops through the iron door. For the first time we see the Concealed Figure wholly. THIS IS DEACON. Half his body scarred, burned. He stands well over six feet tall, muscles rippling everywhere. A frightful sight. He peers up the trap door steps, pursues Sheryl.
SHERYL: Thank you God.
HELP!: Sheryl darts down the hill, and falls out onto.
CLYDE: Oh my stars, what happened to you?
SHERYL: ( Out of breath ) You have to help me. I was kidnapped. My boyfriend came. And this man's chasing me. He's chasing me right Calm down. I can't make heads or tails of what you're saying.
CLYDE: Calm down. I can't make heads or tails of what you're saying.
SHERYL: He's coming. He's right behind me.
CLYDE: Look, miss, there's no one there.
SHERYL: Oh my God, Mike.
CLYDE: It's going to be fine, Miss. I promise you. Everything's going to be
CLYDE: Deacon, what's going on? How the heck did she escape? Want something done, gotta do it
CLYDE: Want something done, gotta do it
IDA: Perfect. Just perfect. You are lovely as a summer's day. It's almost time.
CLYDE: That's enough. Get him ready.
CLYDE: And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband."
IDA: And so, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, I ask you Michael. and you Sheryl, do you accept the sacred covenant of marriage?
CLYDE: And so, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, I ask you Michael. and you Sheryl, do you accept the sacred covenant of marriage?
CLYDE: I'll ask again. Do you accept this covenant of marriage?
CLYDE: Then by the power vested in me, I pronounce you man and wife.
MIKE: Why are you doing this? We did nothing to you people. Let us go!
CLYDE: You may kiss the bride.
MIKE: You fucking people are fucking sick!
CLYDE: ( Stern and cold ) Do not use that type of language in this house again. Now. kiss the bride or. ( Gestures to Deacon ) . he'll cut off your lips.
MIKE: I love you.
MIKE: What are you doing?
MIKE: LET HER GO! SHERYL! Let her go!.Please, let her go!
MIKE: ( To Ida )
SHERYL!: ( To Ida )
IDA: I know you will.
CLYDE: Gonna untie your mouth, now. Have a little "man to man" talk.
MIKE: Please. It's not too late. Let us go. We won't tell anyone.
CLYDE: ( Beat ) How well do you know your bible, Jesus Fucking Christ.
MIKE: Jesus Fucking Christ.
CLYDE: I told you before to watch that mouth, Fuck you.
MIKE: Fuck you.
CLYDE: You through?
CLYDE: I'll ask again. how well do you know the bible?
MIKE: Not very.
CLYDE: That's okay. It's fine. That's why I am here. teach you the way things are and the way they should be.
IDA: I'll be right back.
SHERYL: I want you, Deacon. I want you to fuck me. Hard.
CLYDE: Lord knows the will of a man gets tested. Cruelly most times. But the righteous persevere. They do what needs to be done, even though they don't want to. It's what makes a man, a man. Let me tell you the story of Judas, he was one of Jesus's apostles. Judas led Roman Soldiers to the capture and eventual death of our Lord Jesus Christ. And now, is supposedly seated next to Satan, his soul burning in hell forever for this sin. But I don't believe that's the case. I have my own theory. The death of Jesus was predicted thousands of years before Judas ever came along. And for the prophecy to be fulfilled, Jesus had to die. If he didn't, the gates of heaven couldn't be opened for mankind. I don't think, for an instant, Judas wanted to be the one, but. someone had to. Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus could die for our sins. Save us all. And I believe at this moment. Judas is in heaven, despite his sin, because it led to the greater good. Relations prior to marriage is a sin. You and Sheryl are sinners in the Lord's eyes. And because of those sins, your souls are damned. But Ida and Me, we're gonna give you a chance to save your souls and do the right thing, but. as previously stated, you will need to persevere and show the strength and will of your character. But you'll do it. Because that's what needs to be done.
IDA: You get away from her. Git! Now!
IDA: I'm sorry about that, Sugar. My brother, he's not well.
IDA: It's not all his fault. Our father wasn't very Christian and then there was the accident. Along with the scarring, lost use of his vocals. Can't speak a lick. Now, I've spoken to him. What happened with the others won't happen to you. He's promised me
IDA: I'm gonna take that out of your mouth now. I brought you some tea, got some primrose in it. Help you relax, get some rest. Okay?
SHERYL: Please don't do this. Please let me go. Please..I just want to go home.
IDA: ( Cold ) Drink the tea.
IDA: That's better. Good girl. I almost forgot to ask. How does it feel being married?
SHERYL: Why are you doing this?
IDA: I thought you'd be happy about that. All I ever wanted out of life was two things. to be married and to have a baby. The Lord blessed me with Clyde and I thank Him every day for that.
IDA: But having a baby's been.
CLYDE: She can conceive fine. just. can't seem to make it all the way through. Timothy was the toughest. Made it to month eight.
CLYDE: City Doctor had some fancy mumbo-jumbo words for the condition. Breaks my heart every time. That woman was born to be a mother. It's her calling in life. Just like you and Sheryl have a calling.
MIKE: What exactly do you want from us?
IDA: You're young, strong. It's gonna be easy for you. Not like me.
SHERYL: ( Barely conscious ) You're gonna have a baby, Sheryl. ( Beat ) My baby.
IDA: You're gonna have a baby, Sheryl. My baby.
MIKE: Oh my God.
MIKE: What have you done to her?
IDA: She'll be out for hours, but she's Ida'll come back in a little bit, check to see that the deed has been done. If it hasn't.the next time you see your little lady.a piece of her will be missing.
CLYDE: Ida'll come back in a little bit, check to see that the deed has been done. If it hasn't.the next time you see your little lady.a piece of her will be missing.
IDA: Now, we know conception's not automatic. So don't feel like all the pressure's on right now. We're prepared to do this however long it takes. You give us the effort each time, eventually the magic will You're out of your fucking minds.
MIKE: You're out of your fucking minds.
CLYDE: What did I tell you about the
CLYDE: Deacon will be right outside that door. The only door. This room has no windows and is buried twenty feet below ground. Cutting to the chase. there's no way out and you can scream yourself hoarse, no one will hear you.
IDA: We'll let you have your privacy now. Oh, almost forgot.
IDA: It's gotta work this time.
CLYDE: It will.
IDA: Promise me. Promise me, Clyde.
CLYDE: I promise.
CLYDE: Was I at all unclear yesterday?
MIKE: No, but.
CLYDE: Did you understand what was expected of you?
MIKE: Yes, but. How do you expect.
CLYDE: Clearly you did not understand. You did not even attempt relations last What you're asking to do is sick. You're sick.
MIKE: What you're asking to do is sick. You're sick.
CLYDE: You didn't have a problem when penetration was a sin, but when it's your wife, it's sick?!? Unbelievable.
CLYDE: You knew the rules, Michael. I warned you. Now, Deacon, here, will remind
CLYDE: I'm going to be late for work.
IDA: Be home at the regular time?
CLYDE: Might be a bit late. I have an errand that needs attending to.
MIKE: You don't have to do this. Come on.
SHERYL: What are they doing to him?
IDA: You should concern yourself with what's about to happen to you.
SHERYL: What are you doing, Ida?
IDA: You think you're so much smarter than me, don't you?
SHERYL: Yes you do. Admit it'cause I can see it in your eyes, darling. With your fancy schools and job and such. You think you are better than me.
IDA: Yes you do. Admit it'cause I can see it in your eyes, darling. With your fancy schools and job and such. You think you are better than me.
SHERYL: No, I don't.
IDA: ( Beat ) Might surprise you, but I was quite the student back in the day. Straight A's. Every subject'cept for Science. Infuriated me how they tried to explain away the Lord's creations. Our teacher, Mr. Billings, once said. in the future, humans won't be born with a pinky finger'cause of ( Frustration building ) Of all the. I shouted, "No! We are created in the Lord's image. not some nonsensical theory by Darwind."
IDA: I suppose Mr. Billings and Mr. Darwind can stand up and cheer, because you, little lady. you're about to
MIKE: No more. Please. No more.
MIKE: What are you going to do with that?
SHERYL: Please Ida, don't. Don't do this.
IDA: You think I want to hurt a pretty thing like you? Pains me, but. until you and your husband obey, my hands, much like yours, are tied.
SHERYL: I know about your condition, Ida. It's not your fault. There are a lot of women that can't carry a baby full term. I know how much you're hurting.
IDA: You don't know anything about me or what I've gone through.
SHERYL: I'm here for you now. I'll help you.
IDA: You can help. by following the
BRODY: G'morning, Brody.
CLYDE: G'morning, Brody.
BRODY: I stopped by your place the other day.
CLYDE: Ida mentioned.
BRODY: So have you seen or heard anything about that man hiker?
CLYDE: ( Beat ) In fact I have. I saw him and his lady leave.
BRODY: When was this?
CLYDE: Yesterday. Just before dusk.
BRODY: Believe what you want.
CLYDE: Believe what you want.
BRODY: I saw their car last night in the parking lot at base. So they didn't leave, "Just before dusk."
CLYDE: Well, I was down at base this morning. car's gone now.
BRODY: Something don't feel right here, Clyde. Between you and Ida.
CLYDE: I don't have time for this.
CLYDE: Take your hand off me, Brody.
BRODY: What do you know about that hiker you ain't telling me?
CLYDE: I told you, Brody. I saw them leave. Let it go.
MIKE: How do you expect me to do this? Like Do we need to provide you with some more motivation?
CLYDE: Do we need to provide you with some more motivation?
IDA: You wouldn't want to put that lovely bride of yours through a day like she had today again, now would you?
MIKE: You'll never get away with this. We have friends and family. They know where we went. They'll come looking for us. They'll find us!
CLYDE: That may very well be. but they won't find your car.
MIKE: Oh baby, what did they do to you? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
SHERYL: ( Without moving, barely Are they gone?
MIKE: ( Surprised ) Yeah. You're awake?
SHERYL: I didn't swallow that shit she gave
SHERYL: Oh my God. Mike.
MIKE: It's okay. I'm okay.
SHERYL: You're not okay. We're not okay. What are we gonna do?
MIKE: I don't know.
SHERYL: Maybe. we should just give them what they want?
MIKE: If it stops them from hurting you and me. maybe we should.
SHERYL: If it stops them from hurting you and me. maybe we should.
MIKE: Absolutely not. No fucking way. Forget the fact, that the moment you get pregnant, they'll kill me. Then the moment you give birth, you're dead. Beyond both of those reasons. ain't no fucking way I am going to give them our child.
MIKE: For all my coward marriage moments. I've thought about our child. Is that stupid? I picture what he'll be
SHERYL: Wishful thinking. I picture your heart. your eyes. And I picture us, raising him. Growing old with No. Ain't no fucking way I'm going to give him to them. They keep talking about sins. that would be the worst sin of them all. I'll get us out of this, Sheryl. I promise you.
MIKE: Wishful thinking. I picture your heart. your eyes. And I picture us, raising him. Growing old with No. Ain't no fucking way I'm going to give him to them. They keep talking about sins. that would be the worst sin of them all. I'll get us out of this, Sheryl. I promise you.
CLYDE: It's time.
EVELYN: Good morning, Sam.
SAM: Ain't no better than any of the other days, Evelyn, so bring the "glee" down some, would ya?
EVELYN: Hey, Sam, do you remember a Virginia couple pass through here sometime Friday? Well.There was one couple, but they didn't say where they were Gal's mother's called three times this morning. Said she hasn't heard from her daughter since before she left and she didn't show up for work yesterday or She sure this was the park they were coming to?
SAM: Friday? Well.There was one couple, but they didn't say where they were Gal's mother's called three times this morning. Said she hasn't heard from her daughter since before she left and she didn't show up for work yesterday or She sure this was the park they were coming to?

SAM: She sure this was the park they were coming to?
EVELYN: Yup. Woman's already offering up a Damn it. Have her fax some photos up here. Notify patrol.
SAM: Damn it. Have her fax some photos up here. Notify patrol.
EVELYN: Been a while since we had a couple go missing. Twelve months ago the last?
SAM: ( Concerned )
MIKE: You don't have to check. Nothing
CLYDE: We do appreciate your honesty, Michael. And believe me, we understand your extreme situation, but. Punishment's going to have to be handed down.
CLYDE: Go for, Clyde. Restrain him.
CLYDE: ( To Deacon and Ida ) Restrain him.
MIKE: I told you. I told they'd be coming.
CLYDE: Copy that.
CLYDE: ( To Deacon ) Get him in the other room. Now.
BRODY: Shit. Get rid of the dope.
EVELYN: Morning, gentlemen. Pardon me. Afternoon.
LONNIE: Evelyn, damn, hurts looking at you. When you gonna give it up to me?
EVELYN: Now with a line like that, it's a shocker I haven't already.
LONNIE: You stone cold tease.
EVELYN: Was wondering if either of you had seen any hikers pass by in the last day or so?
BRODY: What's this about?
BRODY: These two are missing?
EVELYN: It would seem so. Why, have you seen
BRODY: You talk to Clyde about this?
EVELYN: All the Rangers are on the lookout. Family's even offering up a reward.
BRODY: ( Beat ) How much?
EVELYN: How much they offering?
BRODY: How much they offering?
EVELYN: Don't exactly know. I'm guessing it's a fair amount.
BRODY: Well, me and Lonnie will keep a lookout for you too. Anything we can do to help.
LONNIE: You change you mind, I'll ride you
LONNIE: It'd be the best fifteen seconds of your life, darling!
CLYDE: Noose is starting to tighten, Ida.
IDA: No. You promised. You promised, this time, would be the time. I want that baby. You promised.
CLYDE: We're gonna have to double our efforts, here.
IDA: Leave that to me.
CLYDE: I think we have to have another. man to man discussion, here, Michael.
CLYDE: Seems as though, time is now factoring into our situation.
CLYDE: We're not violent people, Michael. It pains us to pain you.
MIKE: I don't know. Seems as though Deacon and yourselves get a real kick out of it.
CLYDE: Now see, this is what I am talking about. It's your attitude. It's the disobedience, the cussing.Sooner we get what we want, then no further harm has to fall upon you and your wife.
MIKE: Way I see it, you need us alive. You need us, period. And now that Park Services and State Police are looking for us, you're starting to panic,
SHERYL: ( Weak, soft )
SHERYL: ( Stronger )
CLYDE: What was that?
IDA: Deacon! Stop right there!
IDA: Out! Get out!
CLYDE: This is getting out of hand, y'all. Nobody wanted what just almost happened to Sheryl to happen. But, you keep dragging this thing out. things are gonna. happen.
IDA: I sent Deacon away for a bit. He knows he done wrong. You say right now that you are ready to perform your marital duties, then I'll keep him Have you ever thought that God doesn't want you to have a child? That's why he fucking kills them before they're born. Because you're fucking insane monsters that don't deserve a child.
MIKE: Have you ever thought that God doesn't want you to have a child? That's why he fucking kills them before they're born. Because you're fucking insane monsters that don't deserve a child.
IDA: You take that back!
MIKE: Take it back.
IDA: Take it back.
MIKE: Go ahead and torture me. There's absolutely no way I would ever give a child of mine to you.
IDA: How very brave. Fine. I won't torture you. I'll torture her. I can bring back Deacon. Let him have her. Plenty of other holes he can go into where a baby can't be made.
IDA: Or maybe we can just start dicing. All we need is a healthy heart, brain and uterus. She don't need the rest of her fingers, or toes. or her nose, ears. I could carve out her eye right now.
MIKE: Ida takes the knife away, gets in Mike's face.
IDA: Then you will give me my baby. My child, born in wedlock, saved from its sinner parents and raised to fear God and give him praise.
SHERYL: That's why you married us? So we could conceive our child in wedlock? The fucking joke's on you. I'm already pregnant. Eight weeks
IDA: You're lying.
SHERYL: I was trying to find the right time to tell you.
IDA: No, no, no, no! This can't be. NO!
LONNIE: We shouldn't just go in. Ain't right.
BRODY: I'm going in. You don't want to, then don't. Check round back or something.
LONNIE: 117 INT. TORTURE ROOM #1 117
MIKE: Help! Down here!
CLYDE: Ida. you know what we have to do?
IDA: ( Already anticipating ) No. I can give her an abortion. Get rid of the bastard child, make them conceive one in wedlock. And then we are right as rain.
CLYDE: Abortion? No. That we won't do.
IDA: It'll work. Ain't no sin to abort a Ida, writings on the wall here. Michael's right. With a reward on the table, do you think Brody and Lonnie will be the only two coming? Gonna have lots people looking for these We're gonna have to make it so no one can ever find them.
CLYDE: Ida, writings on the wall here. Michael's right. With a reward on the table, do you think Brody and Lonnie will be the only two coming? Gonna have lots people looking for these We're gonna have to make it so no one can ever find them.
IDA: Ida and Clyde. A sadness covers their faces, especially Ida.
CLYDE: We'll find another couple, Ida.
IDA: No. You promised me, Clyde, this time was the one.
CLYDE: It's too dangerous. We'll find another couple. A better one.
IDA: ( Long beat ) It's not fair.
CLYDE: I'll do what needs to be done. You finish up here. And watch your time, rain's coming.
CLYDE: What the.?
