SUZIE: Remember, especially you men, that working together now will already have formed a bond before the child arrives. The woman is very Somewhere in the room a Male Voice booms out.
GIDEON: Spoiling the little foxes that spoil my vines.
GIDEON: My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
SUZIE: Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the RHONDA, Gideon's granddaughter, 13 years old, comes out of the bathroom.
GIDEON: I was looking through my trunk and I can't find my toby.
RHONDA: What's that?
GIDEON: It is a charm that my great grandmother made me. Everyone notices the worried look on Gideon's face.
SUZIE: It will show up.
RHONDA: If my daddy calls, tell him I walked home.
SUZIE: You be careful and thank you for looking after Sunny. Sunny is asleep on the sofa with a half-eaten apple ready to fall out of his hand.
GIDEON: Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
SUZIE: Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
GIDEON: I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
KIDS: Shut up! Go help your mama wash INT. GIDEON'S KITCHEN - DAY Suzie is standing over an egg that just fell on the floor. The SCREECHING SOUND of the trumpet from next door is interrupted by the doorbell. Suzie cannot decide on what to do, to clean the egg up or answer the door. The doorbell keeps RINGING.
DAVIS: We have a complaint from one of your neighbors about a rooster crowing in the mornings.
SUZIE: The police are here to talk to you about the chickens. The good mood that Gideon was in dissolves quickly. Gideon wipes the soap off his face and throws the towel down. Suzie leaves. Gideon brushes his hair and adjusts his bathrobe.
GIDEON: What can I do for you, Officer? Suzie returns to the kitchen to clean the egg on the floor. Officer Scott keeps her in view.
DAVIS: You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live I always had chickens, ducks and Not anymore, not in the city.
GIDEON: I always had chickens, ducks and Not anymore, not in the city.
DAVIS: Not anymore, not in the city.
GIDEON: We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
DAVIS: Well, you just have to move further Now how far would further out be?
GIDEON: Now how far would further out be?
DAVIS: I'm not here to argue, sir.
SCOTT: You guys don't make anything illegal, do you?
GIDEON: Like what may I ask?
SCOTT: You might have a distillery pumping out barrels of moonshine. Suzie looks at Scott for a moment and goes into the kitchen. Gideon is about to lose control. Davis heads off the Look, just get rid of the chickens and you all have a nice day. Gideon stands in the doorway watching the Police go down the I'll be damned if I get rid of my chickens. I ought to get some hogs and put them out there.
DAVIS: Look, just get rid of the chickens and you all have a nice day. Gideon stands in the doorway watching the Police go down the I'll be damned if I get rid of my chickens. I ought to get some hogs and put them out there.
GIDEON: I'll be damned if I get rid of my chickens. I ought to get some hogs and put them out there.
SUZIE: Who is it?
BABE BROTHER: I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
SUZIE: This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
BABE BROTHER: He will be alright. The camera follows Babe Brother. He passes Gideon's room where Gideon is asleep, snoring loudly.
BABE BROTHER: Thanks for taking care of him. I will try not to be so long next Babe Brother gives his mother a good-night kiss. Gideon comes to the door.
GIDEON: What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
BABE BROTHER: I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
GIDEON: That's a lie.
SUZIE: Let us settle this tomorrow.
GIDEON: Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
BABE BROTHER: ( shouts ) I pay my own way.
GIDEON: Since when? He reaches for Babe Brother but Suzie comes between them.
SUZIE: Take Sunny home, please. She pushes Babe Brother away. Babe Brother walks away, staring back at his father.
GIDEON: Your feet are cold.
SUZIE: Go back to sleep.
GIDEON: I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
SUZIE: You all act like two roosters.
GIDEON: I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
SUZIE: You and Babe Brother are so much He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
GIDEON: He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
SUZIE: You're always taking his side.
GIDEON: You're always taking his side.
SUZIE: I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
GIDEON: I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
SUZIE: You're going to find yourself on the floor.
BABE BROTHER: I want you to be the richest man in the world so I can be the richest father in the world.
SUNNY: I don't want to be rich. I want to work on the railroad like Son, if you are going to have a family, you can't always choose a job just because you like it. I don't want you to shine anybody's shoes or be a porter. You let somebody else carry your bags. Sunny quietly gets up and follows his car out of the room.
BABE BROTHER: Son, if you are going to have a family, you can't always choose a job just because you like it. I don't want you to shine anybody's shoes or be a porter. You let somebody else carry your bags. Sunny quietly gets up and follows his car out of the room.
LINDA: Sunny pleads with her in silence but Linda refuses to yield.
BABE BROTHER: He wouldn't want any if you didn't try to keep it away from him. Linda leaves the table but stops for a moment and looks down at her husband.
LINDA: Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
BABE BROTHER: My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
LINDA: I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
BABE BROTHER: What is a sip of coffee going to Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
LINDA: Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
BABE BROTHER: I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
LINDA: How old are you?
GIDEON: Instead of standing here doing nothing, I better give those chickens some scratch before they start cackling.
SUZIE: How are you?
OLD JOHN: Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
SUZIE: It is so considerate of you. Gideon sticks his head over the fence.
GIDEON: Well, well, look who is taking up all the sunshine. Brother John, how are you doing?
OLD JOHN: I'm still here. Suzie leaves the two men talking.
GIDEON: Tell me something. How do you get energy to stay on the move all day?
OLD JOHN: You couldn't sit on your rump under my daddy's roof. No sir. If you couldn't outwork his mule, you wasn't worth the salt you put in greens. You had to wake up looking for something to do. I was raised as a mule and now I'm a rolling Suzie sticks her head over the fence and hands a bag of red tomatoes to Old John.
SUZIE: I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
OLD JOHN: But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
SUZIE: I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
MOTHER: It hurts.
SUZIE: Don't push too fast! Breathe! The hard part is over. You can see the top of the head.
MOTHER: It hurts. The pain. It's tearing me.
SUZIE: Father, give her a hand.
FATHER: Hey, this is too much.
SUZIE: You do your part.
MOTHER: Can you tell what it is?
SUZIE: Almost there.
FATHER: It's a junior.
MOTHER: Ah, I wanted a girl. Suddenly the baby begins to SCREAM.
JUNIOR: When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
BABE BROTHER: You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
JUNIOR: You used that excuse to get out of the army.
BABE BROTHER: You always got something to say.
GIDEON: Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
BABE BROTHER: I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
GIDEON: What did your wife get her?
BABE BROTHER: We got the same thing. Junior laughs at Babe Brother's story.
GIDEON: Boy, go tell your wife to come in.
BABE BROTHER: Why don't you come in for a while?
LINDA: I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
SUZIE: You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
GIDEON: Babe Brother is a poor boy.
JUNIOR: You all should have been hard on him like you were me and he wouldn't be the way he is.
SUZIE: Everybody got the same. I breast fed him like I breast fed you.
PAT: Junior, you are wrong.
BABE BROTHER: Just for a minute. A dirt rock HITS the front windshield. Linda lets out a little scream. Babe Brother looks around. Skip is on top of the roof next door.
SKIP: I didn't mean to hit your car. I was throwing at my birds.
GIDEON: I need about five pounds of laying mash and you better give me about the same of scratch. While at the counter, Gideon turns and looks around at the prices of different items. Suzie brings her plants and puts them on the counter.
CASHIER: You missed it. We had a two-day sale last week.
GIDEON: What kind of a sale is a two-day sale? I thought sales last a week or two.
CASHIER: Every day we have something different. Today's sale is hay. 25% off. If you have a horse or cow, you're in business.
GIDEON: All of the preachers were down in the basement of the church confessing their sins to one another. They were way down in the basement 'cause they figured no one would hear them. One of the preachers said, it makes me feel too shame to tell how bad I have been. You know them young gals that sit up in the first row. I can look at them and forget my text. I'm just lost when it comes to women, even them middle age sisters. Then another preacher said, I don't think I can tell you what my sin is 'cause it's bad. Another preacher said, Brother, we all amongst friends. Tell us what's troubling your soul. Clear your conscience. Gideon takes a sip of water.
SUZIE: You oughtn't tell him stories like Tell me another story.
SUNNY: Tell me another story.
GIDEON: I'll you a story about the terrapin and the rabbit. No, you tell me a story. Come on.
SUNNY: Once upon a time, my mommy and daddy lived in this big house that I bought for them. I got them this big car. A strong wind causes the broom handle to knock against the china teapot, KNOCKING IT TO THE FLOOR. Suzie stops Sunny from trying to help pick up the pieces.
SUZIE: You stay back. You might cut your Suzie looks down sadly at her broken tea pot.
GIDEON: I looked everywhere for my toby.
SUZIE: Harry, I can't believe it is you. Gideon, look who is here. Gideon comes in, wiping his hands. Sunny, carrying the broom, follows behind.
GIDEON: Harry, good God Almighty, man! It's been, what, thirty years or more. Suzie, we haven't seen Harry since we left home. Harry is more interested in the boy, but Sunny doesn't want to come near Harry. It is Gideon's arm that is keeping him within close range of Harry.
HARRY: He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age. Sunny, playing with the broom, accidentally touches Harry's shoe with it. Harry hides his anger about being touched with the broom. Harry takes the broom from Sunny and spits on the bottom of it.
GIDEON: He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
SUNNY: I'm sorry.
GIDEON: What are you doing in these parts?
HARRY: I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
GIDEON: Why didn't you catch a plane?
HARRY: My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
GIDEON: Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
HARRY: I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
SUZIE: Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
HARRY: Well, I don't want to put you out.
GIDEON: Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
HARRY: Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
SUZIE: Poor old Harry, he really must have been worn out. He has been asleep all day. Without anyone being aware, Harry has been standing in the doorway for some time.
HARRY: Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
SUZIE: You should go back and rest.
HARRY: No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
GIDEON: Man, act like this is your home.
HARRY: That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
SUZIE: One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
HARRY: Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
GIDEON: You had to tread softly. The doorbell rings and Gideon goes to answer it.
SUZIE: Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
HARRY: You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
SUZIE: I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
HARRY: All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it Gideon comes back with Junior, Pal and Rhonda.
GIDEON: Harry, I would like for you to meet my oldest son, his wife and Pleased to meet you. So you're from back home, too. Harry and Junior shake hands, but Rhonda gives Harry only a nod of her head and a smile. Pat, who is pregnant, attempts to shake hands with Harry, but is forced to withdraw her hand because of a sudden pain in her stomach.
JUNIOR: Pleased to meet you. So you're from back home, too. Harry and Junior shake hands, but Rhonda gives Harry only a nod of her head and a smile. Pat, who is pregnant, attempts to shake hands with Harry, but is forced to withdraw her hand because of a sudden pain in her stomach.
PAT: This boy must be turning over. Oh, he just kicked me again. Junior feels her stomach. Pat again tries to shake Harry's hand and again gets a jolt from her stomach. She finds a chair to sit down in. The SOUND of rocks hitting the roof causes everyone to look It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
GIDEON: It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
HARRY: I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
HARRY: Good morning.
GIDEON: You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
HARRY: Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
GIDEON: I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
HARRY: Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
GIDEON: Well, I would appreciate that.
LINDA: You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
HARRY: Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil. And evil is a thing you work at. Harry takes his knife, a crab apple switch, out. It has a rabbit foot attached to it. Harry cleans his fingernail with the knife. Sunny is interested in the rabbit foot. He reaches for the knife.
LINDA: I think he wants to see your rabbit I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
HARRY: I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
LINDA: What's a toby?
HARRY: You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child. In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
LINDA: I thought you weren't old In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a
HARRY: In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a
HARRY: Did you have your child at home?
LINDA: No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
HARRY: Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
LINDA: Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
HARRY: Country people got so many strange Harry looks again at the chicken that he is boiling.
BABE BROTHER: Did you ever have to use this That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out. Linda picks up a card and looks at it. There is a naked woman on the back.
HARRY: That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home.

He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out. Linda picks up a card and looks at it. There is a naked woman on the back.
BABE BROTHER: Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
HARRY: I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets. I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me. Sunny is busy playing in the curtains. The SOUND of Gideon and Suzie arriving makes them scurry to get the cards put away. Harry puts his knife away just as Suzie and Gideon enter. Linda feels a little embarrassed.
LINDA: How was church? Gideon and Suzie are surprised to see Linda. They don't know what to say.
HARRY: How often is your wife called to help delivery?
GIDEON: It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home. Gideon takes the pipe off. It has rotted. Gideon cannot believe it.
HARRY: Everything these days is made You and Babe Brother hit it off so Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
GIDEON: You and Babe Brother hit it off so Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
HARRY: Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
GIDEON: I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
HARRY: Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways. . but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what? I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
GIDEON: You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
HARRY: You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
GIDEON: My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to 'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are Off-screen, Rodney starts to practice on his HORN.
HARRY: 'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are Off-screen, Rodney starts to practice on his HORN.
LINDA: It has three bedrooms, one and a half baths. Well, yes, that means two toilets and one bath. Well. Yes, by appointment. Call me back if you decide. She hangs up the phone.
LINDA: You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
BABE BROTHER: Will you still get the money from your father?
LINDA: I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
BABE BROTHER: Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
LINDA: We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
BABE BROTHER: I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way. Babe Brother is lost in his thoughts. He stares down at his hands resting on his knees. He picks up the telephone.
JUNIOR: You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
JUNIOR: This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
JUNIOR: Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
JUNIOR: Babe Brother always acts like a gambler who is in the biggest game of his life and don't know about playing cards.
HARRY: I can sit here and look at train tracks all day. We laid enough of them, didn't we? So many memories are stretched along tracks like Gideon looks down the tracks. A bowl of dust stirs off in the distance. The hot temperature makes the tracks appear liquid.
GIDEON: In weather like this, you cannot walk around bare-headed. He wipes the sweat from his hat band.
HARRY: We'll go a little farther. The walk will do us some good.
PAT: Did you do your homework?
RHONDA: ( beat ) Can I name the baby?
PAT: Can I name the baby?
RHONDA: Can I name the baby?
SUZIE: I have someone I want you to meet.
HARRY: I'll be right there.
HATTIE: I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
HARRY: Girl, do you still sing and dance?
HATTIE: No, I'm a different person now, Hattie has a nervous condition that causes her to squint from time to time. Gideon comes in from the kitchen.
GIDEON: Haven't the years been good to It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
HARRY: It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
HATTIE: Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
HARRY: Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
HATTIE: Some people grow up and change their ways.
HARRY: I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
HATTIE: My mother passed on years ago.
HATTIE: M.C., you still ain't house broken.
GIDEON: Good God Almighty, if it ain't like a parade of people from out of the past. M.C., where did you come I live here. There is a TAPPING on the door.
HATTIE: Harry, what did you do, rob the Herman hobbles in and, after a minute of COUGHING, a smile forms on his face.
HATTIE: I'm in church.
HATTIE: Suzie, you still have Joe's number?
SUZIE: I will have to look for it.
HATTIE: None of your business.
HARRY: That is a boy from home, Lulla's Suzie is surprised.
SUZIE: Harry, you know everything.
HARRY: You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything. Gideon brings a fresh pot of coffee. Gideon tries to signal M.C. to stop harassing Hattie. M.C. leans over Hattie again to use the ashtray. Harry is helping Herman to his feet. Herman starts to cough. They come over and join the rest of the crowd at the table. Harry seats Herman next to Gideon and pours Herman a cup of coffee. He puts the sugar and cream in the coffee for Herman. Suzie comes back with Joe's number and hands it to Hattie.
HERMAN: M.C., I'm worn out. You ready to If you are tired, go sit in the Suzie, do you have any Swamp Root?
HERMAN: Suzie, do you have any Swamp Root?
SUZIE: No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
HATTIE: I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
HARRY: You can certainly tell how old you are, my dear. Hattie is angered.
HATTIE: You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
HARRY: Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
HATTIE: I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
HARRY: "Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
HERMAN: You all ought to get along.
HATTIE: Harry, you know you remind me of so much that went wrong in my life. When I heard you were here, I made a special effort to come and see you. I see you are still a pile of wet chicken feathers.
HERMAN: Oh Lord.
HARRY: My sister, women can get away with so much. I don't have any enemies 'cause I don't live in the past. As Pushkin, you don't know him, said, "In the hope of glory and good, I look without fear ahead."
HATTIE: An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
HARRY: Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
HERMAN: I don't have too many fish fries We can have it here next week.
HARRY: We can have it here next week.
HATTIE: Is this your house?
HARRY: Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you Well, it's up to Suzie.
GIDEON: Well, it's up to Suzie.
SUZIE: It would be nice.
HATTIE: In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
HARRY: I already have, my dear.
HERMAN: Please, M.C., take me home.
WILSON: No one in my family ever been to a hospital to give birth. My sister has four children and all were born at home. My mother and her mother, it just goes on and on.
HARRY: A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
PAT: That's nice.
HARRY: Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the Pat beams with joy because Harry recognizes the important work she is doing.
HARRY: How many people do you all feed?
PAT: Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
HARRY: Good God Almighty, bless your But the problem grows.
PAT: Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
HARRY: Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't. You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste. Harry looks at the baby picture pasted over the mirror. He takes the picture of his children from his old black dusty wallet and compares the faces of his kids with those on the mirror. He talks to himself more than to Pat.
PAT: I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
HARRY: Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
JUNIOR: I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
HARRY: Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
JUNIOR: He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
HARRY: Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
JUNIOR: All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
HARRY: You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
JUNIOR: We can't really bring another family in here with us.
PAT: Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
JUNIOR: When did you talk to Harry?
PAT: Don't shout!
GIDEON: I think we have enough. So now tell me a story.
GIDEON: Be careful of the water. Sunny looks back at his grandfather, who appears to be There is one fish in the bucket.
SUZIE: Are you feeling well?
LINDA: I've never been so tired in my life. Where is Sunny?
SUZIE: He is getting his things together. Babe Brother, you ought to take your wife home so she can get some In a minute. Sunny comes in carrying his night-clothes folded neatly. He stands next to Linda. Harry, in a mild but demanding way, ushers Babe Brother out of the door.
BABE BROTHER: In a minute. Sunny comes in carrying his night-clothes folded neatly. He stands next to Linda. Harry, in a mild but demanding way, ushers Babe Brother out of the door.
HARRY: Take your wife and child home, boy. Babe Brother seems all too happy to obey Harry. After Harry closes the door behind Babe Brother, he turns with a wide I got a surprise for you tonight. Harry flops down on the couch and kicks his shoes off.
SUZIE: Fred Jenkins.
JENKINS: Suzie, you haven't changed and you, Gideon, if you don't look like John Henry. Oh, this is my wife, Esme. My first wife Lulie died. More people arrive, bottle-necking the doorway. Gideon helps the Jenkinses to a chair. Hattie comes with her brother MARSH, who is not too pleased to see Harry. OKRA TATE, an elderly black man with dark circles under his eyes, comes in limping badly with an old Polaroid camera hanging from his Babe Brother, Linda, Junior, Pat and Rhonda, who is holding Sunny's hand, all come in together. M.C. drags Herman through the door coughing. FLIM ANDERSON and his son DOUG are followed by the twins, WILLIAM and LOVIRAY NORWOOD, who are in their late 70's. Babe Brother leaves Linda standing by herself to be next to Zenia Dent, an elderly white woman with a strong Southern accent, arrives with her husband, Howard Dent, a black man, who is in a wheelchair. The Twins and Howard are the center of attention. Okra comes over and whispers into Harry's ear. Okra leaves through the front door. Okra comes back in with a bag. Harry, Babe Brother, M.C. and Herman follow Okra to the kitchen.
BABE BROTHER: What is that?
HARRY: Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor. A crowd starts to gather around.
FLIM: What is in the bottle?
HERMAN: There is a fight in every bottle.
GIDEON: You tappy heads better not tear down my house.
HATTIE: Look, you better get out of my face before I slap the living daylights out of you. Harry stops the music.
HARRY: You folks excuse me but you know we have a celebrity from out of the past, our own nightingale. If you had any good times in your life, you remember Hattie. She use to keep those juke joints steaming. If Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith were the stars, she was the sun. Let's get Hattie to sing something from the old days. Hattie has started her nervous twitch again. She is so mad that she bites her lip to keep from exploding.
HATTIE: Harry always tries to be the king fish. I told him I'm a new person. I'm saved. Harry signals an old man, PERCY, to start playing his guitar. Percy starts to play but Hattie doesn't join him. He looks to Harry for a sign of what to do. Hattie walks away. Percy starts to SING by himself but someone puts a record on, interrupting his singing. People are back to dancing. A YOUNGER WOMAN is dancing with an OLDER MAN with such vigor, forcing the old man to try to keep up, that people grow concerned. People near him try to make him slow down but his pride forces him to be ridiculous.
MARSH: Harry, you will not remember me but we go back quite a ways. I'm glad Hattie told me that you will be here 'cause there is a matter that has been troubling me all these years that maybe you can help me clear it up. Harry stares into Marsh's eyes, then looks him over from head to toe.
HARRY: Man, I can't talk to you now. I'm filling in the gaps with these Harry turns his back on Marsh. Marsh stands there looking at Harry's profile. He turns and walks away. The record ends. The Younger Woman and the Older Man wait for the next record.
YOUNGER WOMAN: How do you manage to keep in step and move around so like one of them young boys?
OLDER MAN: Get yourself a pace-maker like me. Linda is standing by herself. She watches Babe Brother and Harry walk towards the kitchen. Pat comes to talk to her.
PAT: These old folks can dance better than I can. Get rid of that long face. Get one of these old farts to show you how to do the Black Okra, holding his camera, all of the attachments in one hand and a glass in his other hand, tries to offer Hattie a drink.
OKRA: Don't be so stand-offish. Hattie pushes him away. The drink spills on him. She turns and walks away. He follows her.
HARRY: Son, you haven't danced with your wife all night. Babe Brother is reluctant to leave, but Harry gives him a nudge. He goes looking for Linda.
MARSH: There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
HARRY: Now who are we talking about?
MARSH: Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one.
HARRY: Wasn't Hocker lynched?
MARSH: You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
HARRY: What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
GIDEON: Tell me, how come me and Suzie have to be mother and father to your child? You never take the boy to the park, circus or anything. If we did not take him to church, he wouldn't have any sense of I think forcing him to go to church when he really doesn't understand is not saving his soul. When he gets old enough to make up his own mind about religion, that will be better. It will be his intellectual Is that the way your parents raised Why, you don't want us to bring him No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
LINDA: I think forcing him to go to church when he really doesn't understand is not saving his soul. When he gets old enough to make up his own mind about religion, that will be better. It will be his intellectual Is that the way your parents raised Why, you don't want us to bring him No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him?

GIDEON: Is that the way your parents raised Why, you don't want us to bring him No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
BABE BROTHER: Why, you don't want us to bring him No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
GIDEON: No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
BABE BROTHER: Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and Junior spends time with his child.
GIDEON: Junior spends time with his child.
BABE BROTHER: Oh here we go with that.
WILLIAM: Hurry up and take this picture.
FRED: If it wasn't for the NRA, colored people would have been the lost Remember what they use to call the NRA? Negro Raggedy-ass Army. M.C. is still holding the naked lamp while Okra tries to take INT KITCHEN - NIGHT Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
FLIM: Remember what they use to call the NRA? Negro Raggedy-ass Army. M.C. is still holding the naked lamp while Okra tries to take INT KITCHEN - NIGHT Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
MARSH: Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
HARRY: Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
SUZIE: Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
GIDEON: No, I'm too hot now.
SUZIE: You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
GIDEON: I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it. Son, you make me wish I was dead.
SUZIE: Gideon, don't say things like that.
BABE BROTHER: Why does he always pick on me?
LINDA: He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
BABE BROTHER: I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.
SUZIE: Babe Brother, I'm going to take my hand and hit you across your mouth.
LINDA: He doesn't mean what he says.
GIDEON: Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
SUZIE: No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any Linda gives Babe Brother a jab with her elbow. His hand reaches out to Gideon.
HATTIE: Don't make me say something nasty Percy starts to play an old religious number and Hattie STARTS TO SING. Everything stops for a moment as her VOICE fills the room. Then most of the guests pick up and join in. M.C. moves the lamp next to Percy so Okra can take his picture.
HARRY: I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
MARSH: Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
HARRY: Those boys never did have good You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
MARSH: You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
HARRY: Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth. M.C. and Okra come in wanting to take pictures. Marsh is pretty mad about them intruding. M.C. sets the naked lamp in front of Marsh, on the floor, almost between his legs. Before Okra can get his camera set to shoot, Marsh leaves. Harry smiles as if he had won a major victory. Herman flops down in the empty chair and starts to COUGH. Suddenly Suzie and Gideon burst into the kitchen holding up one of the twins, Loviray. They carry the twin towards Herman's seat. Herman is slow to react. Herman gets up very slow. Finally, they are able to seat the twin.
SUZIE: She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil. The twin is holding her throat and PANTING like a fish out of water. She is in a lot of pain. William, the twin brother, is standing at the door with a tragic face.
LINDA: Are you going to work or sleep all He snores louder. She opens the window and pulls back the cover. The cold air makes him draw up. On walking out, Linda says in a rather hurt voice:
LINDA: Remember, you promised to take Sunny to Magic Mountain today. Babe Brother slowly gets up holding his chest as if his heart is bothering him.
GIDEON: I'm worn out.
SUZIE: Just stay in bed and rest.
GIDEON: I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
SUZIE: You stay inside. I will see to I will appreciate that.
GIDEON: I will appreciate that.
HARRY: How is everybody?
SUZIE: Tolerable well.
JUNIOR: How did you sleep last night? There is obvious hostility in Junior's tone. Harry senses Junior's hostility and chooses to ignore it.
HARRY: Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
SUZIE: He wasn't able to get out of bed I hope that it's nothing serious.
HARRY: I hope that it's nothing serious.
SUZIE: He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
HARRY: Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time. Junior stares at Harry. Harry returns Junior's stare and Junior finds himself embarrassed. Junior looks down at his pants leg and attempts to fix the crease in his pants by making a wedge with his fingers and running his fingers along the old crease. As Harry walks towards the back door, he looks back at EXT. BACKYARD - EVENING The pigeons take to the air like an explosion. The chickens start to CACKLE and run about as Harry reaches for one with his cane. The SOUND of the boy next door practicing with his trumpet adds to the bedlam. Suzie is standing on the steps, shouting to Harry. The noise of the panicked chickens and the boy playing the trumpet next door drown out Suzie's voice. Not getting Harry's attention, she hurries down the steps. Harry has caught a hen that is SCREAMING her head off. He looks around and finds Suzie hurrying towards him.
SUZIE: Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
HARRY: You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
SUZIE: Oh my Lord!
OKRA: You think old Gideon is going to live to see this month out?
HARRY: When I came upon the valley of bones, the serpent said, "Make this your home. Dry as my soul be, heaven is lost to thee." We all got to make way. Harry puts the rooster face to the ground and draws a straight line. Harry lets the rooster go, but the rooster stays motionless, unable to move.
OKRA: Herman, you will have to catch the next one 'cause I'm out of breath.
HERMAN: If I have to chase after one, we won't eat. A sack drops over the fence. Okra limps over to see what is in the bag. He uses a stick to open the bag. He doesn't like what he sees and throws the bag back over the fence.
GIDEON: I don't want to stay here. Where is Babe Brother?
HARRY: Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
BABE BROTHER: It is just a regular card.
HARRY: Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT A moth flies around the light casting a shadow that floats over everything. Suzie turns out the kitchen light and then turns out the dining-room light. She goes to her room and closes the door, leaving the room dark. A car headlight passing outside casts a moving pattern that moves along the The light reveals Harry's presence standing in the hall EXT. HOUSE - DAY Gideon is being helped up the steps by his sons.
BABE BROTHER: Doesn't he look a whole of lot Well, you look better than you did Next time, I don't care how sick I'll be, don't take me back to the Veteran's Hospital. Harry comes out of the bathroom, having just taken a bath. Harry seems delighted to see Gideon again.
SUZIE: Well, you look better than you did Next time, I don't care how sick I'll be, don't take me back to the Veteran's Hospital. Harry comes out of the bathroom, having just taken a bath. Harry seems delighted to see Gideon again.
GIDEON: Next time, I don't care how sick I'll be, don't take me back to the Veteran's Hospital. Harry comes out of the bathroom, having just taken a bath. Harry seems delighted to see Gideon again.
HARRY: Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
GIDEON: I tell you, I feel like a ghost. Harry signals Babe Brother to come over to him.
HARRY: Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
BABE BROTHER: Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me Harry flops down on the couch. Suzie sets a cup of coffee on the table for Gideon. Harry looks up from sharpening his knife on a hand sharpening stone. He spits on it.
HARRY: That smells like fresh coffee.
SUZIE: Let me get you a cup?
HARRY: Only if you can spare it. Junior stands over Harry's shoulder looking at him sharpening his knife. Harry feels uncomfortable with Junior standing behind him. Harry looks up at him.
BABE BROTHER: What in the hell.
GIDEON: It's good to be able to hear that.
SUZIE: You must have been really sick.
GIDEON: How is the garden doing?
SUZIE: I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
GIDEON: How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell He takes a deep breath and blows it out.
GIDEON: Oh, I couldn't have last another day in that hospital. You get weary being in the old soldiers home, old soldiers and war stories. They wait to tell you their last story; the next morning the nurse pulls a sheet over their face.
PAT: He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
JUNIOR: Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
PAT: Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls. Junior slips on the ladder and the wires touch. There is a big spark. All the lights in the house go out.
HARRY: How old is that boy? Babe Brother looks at Sunny's shoe.
BABE BROTHER: Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
LINDA: Why in the h. Close to tears, she turns and with exaggerated care, puts the spoon down and gently puts Sunny in a chair. She starts to untie his shoes. Sunny stares at her while she keeps wiping her eyes.
HARRY: Let's give Dry Bones a call to see if he is coming or not. Okra likes to exaggerate, keep you waiting all Harry slowly gets to his feet and goes in the other room to use the phone. Linda watches him go. She is deep in thought. Babe Brother, attempting to cut the roast before it is ready, is pushed aside by Linda, who is almost out of control with Why don't you wait? Babe Brother, attempting to forcibly cut a piece of roast, slings Linda's arm away. His hand accidentally hits her in the eye. Linda grabs the fork, poised to strike, but gains control of herself She looks like a person who is on the verge of having a breakdown. She goes back to putting the shoes on Sunny. Babe Brother, feeling sorry, doesn't know what to do. He automatically picks up the fork and washes it off. Linda picks up Sunny.
LINDA: Why don't you wait? Babe Brother, attempting to forcibly cut a piece of roast, slings Linda's arm away. His hand accidentally hits her in the eye. Linda grabs the fork, poised to strike, but gains control of herself She looks like a person who is on the verge of having a breakdown. She goes back to putting the shoes on Sunny. Babe Brother, feeling sorry, doesn't know what to do. He automatically picks up the fork and washes it off. Linda picks up Sunny.
BABE BROTHER: You okay?
LINDA: I'm okay. Go back to your friends. Babe Brother closes the door and leaves Linda reading stories of Brer Rabbit to Sunny. She stops reading to look at him playing marbles on the bed. She smiles.
PREACHER: Sister, we've come to see how you were doing. We came to ask if we could pray over Gideon.
SUZIE: I put some Plummer Christian Leaves under his feet to draw the fever What else have you been giving him?
PREACHER: What else have you been giving him?
SUZIE: I crossed his stomach with cold oil and gave him some cow tea.
PREACHER: Suzie, I would think you would depend on prayer rather than these old fashion remedies. Let us read from the Bible. The Preacher opens his Bible and reads silently. The choir HUMS and begin to sway. Gideon's SNORING is very competitive. The choir becomes louder. Gideon starts to TALK in his sleep. Suzie is alarmed.
LADY: Something pleasant.
LADY: Put the river behind me. A large picture of the Mississippi appears behind the lady. It changes from a painted backdrop to a moving picture. There is a storm developing off in the distance. The SOUND of thunder is heard. The picture in the background then changes to a boy on a mule.
SUZIE: I don't know where that music is coming from.
SUNNY: I want my daddy.
JUNIOR: Boy, hush that noise and get in this house. Make haste.
SUNNY: I want my daddy; I told you.
JUNIOR: Rhonda, drag him in here. If you be nice, I will take you to Pat, Linda and Junior put the suitcases down.
PAT: Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
JUNIOR: I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth. Linda looks down, embarrassed.
PAT: Rhonda, take Sunny in the backyard. Take a bowl so you can pick some strawberries. Sunny will enjoy it. Rhonda and Sunny leave. Pat turns on Junior about talking bad about Babe Brother and Linda in front of Sunny.
PAT: You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother Something just took control of him. He stays out all night and comes home with a pocket full of money.
JUNIOR: Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother Something just took control of him. He stays out all night and comes home with a pocket full of money.
LINDA: Something just took control of him. He stays out all night and comes home with a pocket full of money.
PAT: It's probably Harry, but I hate to mention his name, because every time we say something about him something bad happens.
HARRY: Let us walk awhile. I grow weary when I sit still too long. Babe Brother's car stops in an orchard-like area.
HARRY: Give me your arm lest you fall. Harry has to help him stay on his feet. Babe Brother finds it necessary to take Harry's arm. Babe Brother stops and Harry walks a few more steps ahead and waits for Babe Brother. Just ahead sitting on a branch is a huge white owl camouflaged by tree branches.
BABE BROTHER: I could swear I heard my son call You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong. Babe Brother turns and starts hurrying back before Harry can object. He walks slowly after Babe Brother who is doubling the distance between himself and Harry as he runs through the orchard to his car. Harry stops and looks around.
HARRY: You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong. Babe Brother turns and starts hurrying back before Harry can object.

He walks slowly after Babe Brother who is doubling the distance between himself and Harry as he runs through the orchard to his car. Harry stops and looks around.
LINDA: I told Babe Brother that if Harry sets foot in our house again, I'm taking Sunny and leaving. Just as I said that, here come Harry and his old resurrected friends, hobbling up the steps.
JUNIOR: Is that how you got that black eye?
PAT: Don't ask that.
LINDA: No, this was an accident.
JUNIOR: It was unintentional.
LINDA: It was unintentional.
JUNIOR: Babe Brother reminds me of the story of the man who wanted to be sizable. He wanted to be tall but what he was really short on was brains. There was a time when people had moon fever were treated with leeches. The phone rings and Junior goes to pick it up. Linda's and Pat's attention is focused on the phone. Junior hands the phone to Linda.
LINDA: What do you want? No. Nothing happened to him. Sunny and Rhonda enter. Linda turns to look. Sunny's hands and face look bloody from eating strawberries. She puts the phone down and examines his dirty face. Pat brings Linda a wet towel.
MR. BAKER: What are you doing?
MRS. BAKER: Counting the gray hairs in your Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of I was just trying to make Where is Skip?
MR. BAKER: Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of I was just trying to make Where is Skip?
MRS. BAKER: I was just trying to make Where is Skip?
MR. BAKER: Where is Skip?
MRS. BAKER: He is in his pigeon cage.
MR. BAKER: I'm sorry he got those birds.
MRS. BAKER: You know the man next door is near Mr. Baker doesn't answer. He pauses for a moment of thought. Mrs. Baker sees that she is not going to get a response from her husband. She picks up an eyelet and Mr. Baker looks at her as if to say, keep your hands off. She gets the message and lays the eyelet back on the work bench.
MR. BAKER: Don't blow that thing in here. You blow that thing when I'm at work.
JUNIOR: Why doesn't he just park his car and come in and apologize?
JUNIOR: Roll down the window and let me talk to you. Babe Brother only stares at him. Junior gets more violent and starts to shake the car. Pat calls from the doorway.
PAT: Stop it Junior!
RHONDA: Mama, come see what Sunny did.
HARRY: How is he doing?
SUZIE: As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
HARRY: I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway. Harry helps Suzie to her feet.
OKRA: I brought you these greens and some salt meat.
SUZIE: That is very thoughtful of you. I haven't had time to tend to my garden like I should. Suzie takes the greens and puts them on the counter. She squeezes Okra's hand as a thank you. She pours him a cup of coffee. Okra eases down into the chair. He crosses his legs and starts massaging his feet. Suzie get herself a cup of coffee and sits opposite him. She stretches and tries to hold back a yawn. Okra looks at her in a slightly desirous way.
OKRA: You know Gideon and I are lodge brothers and it has always been a policy to take care of the wives if something happens to our brother.
SUZIE: You are very sweet, but Gideon has already taken care of everything in case something happens to him. He has a policy.
OKRA: If you become a widow, you will need someone around to fix the whatnots. We like for the widow to marry someone in the lodge. I know Gideon ain't gone yet, but there will be a lot of his old friends coming around to get in line. I just want you to consider this as a kind of a conditional proposal, to be first in line so to speak. Suzie keeps herself under control; she tries to find words to say. She stands up.
SUZIE: Excuse me. I have to go feed my She turns the fire out from under the coffee pot and exits the back door. Okra unties his shoes and begins to massage his feet.
HATTIE: You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
SUZIE: I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
HATTIE: Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
SUZIE: You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
HATTIE: Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
SUZIE: I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
HATTIE: He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
SUZIE: I can't accuse him just dry long
HATTIE: Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
SUZIE: What must I do?
HATTIE: If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
HARRY: Good afternoon, ladies.
SUZIE: Good afternoon to you. Harry waits for Hattie to respond but it is obvious that Hattie isn't about to speak to him.
HATTIE: I'm going to check on Gideon. Harry moves out of her way to let her go by. Hattie doesn't even give him a glance. Harry continues to look at her as she disappears into Gideon's room.
HARRY: As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
SUZIE: You must have done something to Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
HARRY: Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
SUZIE: Hattie is a different person now.
HARRY: I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
SUZIE: I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
HARRY: You invited me.
SUZIE: Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend? Harry takes his time in looking for an answer.
HARRY: Like that boy next door playing that his horn. If he was a friend, he would stop irritating people, but if he stops practicing, he wouldn't be perfect in what he does INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY Hattie enters Harry's room. She goes through his things. She reads one of his letters. As she walks over to the window reading his letter, she steps on the plate, cracking it.
SUZIE: I want you to leave. Harry looks sad and suddenly a lot older as if what she said has taken away some of his life.
HARRY: Okra, M.C. and Herman want to go back home with me. Suzie, I'm not a bad fellow; I just like to have a good time. M.C. is coming by to pick me up tonight. I'll come back to get my things. Well, I hope Gideon recovers. You know I have an extra picture of one of my sons that I would like for you to put with those baby pictures over your dresser. It's better than being in my dusty wallet with addresses and names of people who are no longer on this earth. Suzie takes the picture. She seems as if she has doubts about having asked Harry to leave.
OKRA: Why did you buy so much toilet I got that on the job when I was a janitor. They didn't pay me. Harry picks up an old cigar box that falls opens. Dice, shotgun shells, some spent .38 slugs and an old rusty knife, a crab apple switch, land on the floor. Harry picks up the Whose old piece of knife is this?
HARRY: Whose old piece of knife is this?
HERMAN: That was my brother's knife. Harry gives the knife to Babe Brother and signals him to put it in his pocket. The SOUND of the thunder has an unreal violence to it.
HARRY: I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
BABE BROTHER: This would be a bad time for me to We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra? Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up. What would you give to be rich? Babe Brother humps his shoulder. Babe Brother looks at his Had Moms and Pops given me my share of what was mine, I could have been rich by now. Linda and I had it all worked out. Harry wins the first hand.
HARRY: We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra? Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up. What would you give to be rich? Babe Brother humps his shoulder. Babe Brother looks at his Had Moms and Pops given me my share of what was mine, I could have been rich by now. Linda and I had it all worked out. Harry wins the first hand.
BABE BROTHER: Had Moms and Pops given me my share of what was mine, I could have been rich by now. Linda and I had it all worked out. Harry wins the first hand.
HARRY: I know your mind is on your wife but you should never treat a woman as an equal. You want to get your wife back, get another woman, one of those big hip women that will ride you till you sweat. Harry wins another hand. M.C. and Okra are still packing while Herman is eating Argo Starch.
HARRY: When one woman puts you out, you have another to take you in. You don't drive around without a spare tire, do you? The more mules you have hitched, the easier it is to Harry loses another hand and Babe Brother suddenly has a pile of money.
HARRY: Herman, let me borrow a few bucks. Herman stand over him with a roll of bills and peels off Bless you. Bless you. Herman is standing behind Babe Brother, SINGING to himself.
HERMAN: In the ground there is a hole and green grass growing around the hole. Now in the hole there is tree and green grass growing all around the tree. Now there is a hole in the ground, a tree in the hole and green grass growing around the Let me share something with you. Harry stops and thinks for a while.
HARRY: Let me share something with you. Harry stops and thinks for a while.
OKRA: These damn things are unloaded, ain't they?
HARRY: It's important to know the difference between the incoming fire and the outgoing fire. As Amos and Andy might say, "We is the outgoing fire." Come with us, son. We'll show you some steaming hot juke joints, steaming hot women.
BABE BROTHER: Let me go by the house first.
HARRY: We will wait for you as long as we can. I got to get my things from your mother's house. Babe Brother hurries out. M.C., Herman and Okra flop down in chairs and on the bed and look at their watches. Harry sits at the table tapping out a rhythm on the table and WHISTLING very softly to himself. Suddenly Harry sees that Babe Brother left the pile of money on the table. A look of concern comes over his face.
BABE BROTHER: I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
SUZIE: What for?
BABE BROTHER: I'm going back home with Harry.
SUZIE: I've heard some foolish things in my life.
BABE BROTHER: Harry is coming to pick me up.
SUZIE: Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the I'm busy.
BABE BROTHER: I'm busy.
SUZIE: Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
BABE BROTHER: Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
SUZIE: I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough. You sit right there with your no manners self.
JUNIOR: Where is Babe Brother?
SUZIE: Brother is in the kitchen.
JUNIOR: How come you didn't ask Babe Brother to help you?
SUZIE: He said he was busy. He is mad 'cause he wanted to get in the garage to get his things so he could go with Harry. Linda has a surprised look on her face.
JUNIOR: So he is busy?
JUNIOR: Why in the hell didn't you help I told her I would if she would give me time.
BABE BROTHER: I told her I would if she would give me time.
JUNIOR: I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
BABE BROTHER: You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
JUNIOR: That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
BABE BROTHER: I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
JUNIOR: I ought to break your damn neck.
BABE BROTHER: I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
JUNIOR: You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
BABE BROTHER: My name is Sam. Samuel. Babe Brother attempts to get up but Junior pushes him down.
JUNIOR: Sit down! Babe Brother hits Junior on the jaw, driving him backwards, causing the overhead lamp to sway violently.
PAT: Stop it! Stop it! Look what you are Babe Brother's eyes are rolled to the back. Junior's eyes are huge; he has an animal look on his face. The SOUND of struggling people breathing heavily is amplified. The pool of blood on the table grows larger. Junior slowly becomes aware of the blood and his body relaxes. He calmly releases the knife. Junior takes his mother's hand.
JUNIOR: Someone get some lard out of the ice box. Pat attempts to get the lard but pain in her stomach forces her to sit down. Linda gets the lard out and hands it to Junior. Babe Brother raises himself. The blood from Suzie's dripping from his head. Rhonda is trying to hold Sunny back. Junior holds his mother's hand under the faucet. It is a deep cut. The bleeding won't stop. Pat is sitting at the blood-stained table unable to move. She is PANTING, sweating, and holding her stomach. Linda is caught between trying to help Suzie and attending to Pat. Babe Brother helps to make a wad of cloth to press in her hand to Stop the bleeding.
LINDA: You are going to need some stitches. We better take her to the emergency hospital. Babe Brother is shamefully calm now and very humble.
BABE BROTHER: I'll drive her to the hospital.
JUNIOR: We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
LINDA: What about Pat?
PAT: I'm okay now. Suzie attempts to go see Gideon but Babe Brother and Junior turn her to the door. Going through the kitchen door, Junior intentionally turns his back to Babe Brother. Babe Brother stares at Junior's back as he walks ahead.
NURSE: What sort of emergency are you here I cut my hand.
SUZIE: I cut my hand.
NURSE: Let me take a look at it. Suzie puts her hand through the window. The Nurse stands up to get a better look. The Nurse takes the wad out of her hand. The bleeding has stopped. The Nurse takes a deep breath. The Nurse glances up to notice the blood stains on the back of Babe Brother head.
JUNIOR: The bleeding has stopped but it will need stitches. You will have to fill out this form. How will this be covered, insurance, cash or Don't worry about it. It will be paid. Just let her see a doctor.
NURSE: The bleeding has stopped but it will need stitches. You will have to fill out this form. How will this be covered, insurance, cash or Don't worry about it. It will be paid. Just let her see a doctor.
JUNIOR: Don't worry about it. It will be paid. Just let her see a doctor.
SUZIE: I have Medicare. The Nurse hands Suzie a form, but Babe Brother takes the form. The Nurse looks again at Babe Brother's head.
NURSE: Do you need to see the doctor too?
BABE BROTHER: No, just my mother. Babe Brother fills out the form with Suzie's help and hands the form back to the Nurse. They find a seat all together.
JUNIOR: Why is it so crowded?
NURSE: Well, it is Friday night and a full Junior whispers to Babe Brother. They both start to laugh. Suzie looks up and finds them in a fit of laughter. A faint smile appears on her face.
GIDEON: Suzie, I'm hungry.
GIDEON: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT ( RAIN ) Gideon opens the refrigerator and starts taking out bowls of food and placing them on the table. He puts on a pot of INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT ( RAIN ) ( LATER ) Gideon is busy eating almost everything in sight. A group of mystified and sleepy faces appear at the door. Pat, Linda, Rhonda and Sunny are all looking rather dumbfounded.

HARRY: I can't believe what I heard took INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY On seeing Suzie, Sunny jumps up, knocking the can of marbles over the kitchen floor. He runs to give Suzie a hug. Sunny wants to touch her bandaged hand, but Linda stops him.
SUZIE: How is Gideon doing?
RHONDA: He is asleep now, but he was up all night eating. As Suzie goes to Gideon's room, she comes face to face with Harry. She doesn't say anything.
HARRY: I came to pick up my things.
LINDA: You ought to go see how your father is doing and then wash that blood off you and change shirts. Babe Brother is surrounded by Linda and Sunny who has his eyes fixed on Harry. They move as one heading for the Harry seems a lot older. He sadly walks towards the kitchen with his coffee cup. LOW ANGLE SHOT: Harry is slowly walking towards the MARBLES that are scattered over the kitchen floor.
SUZIE: Gideon's only response is to SNORE louder.
PAT: How long is Harry going to hang Babe Brother is in a corner all by himself. He looks down when Pat asks the question about Harry. A loud CRASHING SOUND comes from the kitchen.
WHITE PARAMEDIC: There is nothing we can do for him. The Paramedics start to leave without the body.
JUNIOR: Well, aren't you going to take him with you?
ASIAN PARAMEDIC: If he had died in our care, we would be required to take him. Since we found him dead, you will have to wait for the county to pick him up.
JUNIOR: How long will that take?
WHITE PARAMEDIC: That would depend on how busy it is. I'm sorry.
MARSH: What happened?
JUNIOR: He slipped on some marbles that were on the floor. Then his heart gave out.
LINDA: ( to Sunny ) I told you to always put those marbles up and not to leave them just anywhere.
PAT: The poor thing is not to blame. Rhonda, take Sunny for a walk. Marsh hands Rhonda several dollars.
MARSH: Here, go around to the store and buy what you want.
HATTIE: Would anybody object if I take a look at him?
HERMAN: I don't think Harry would like it. Hattie goes over and pulls the blanket back. Okra, M.C. and Herman hurry over to take a quick glance. They huddle behind Hattie, peeping over her shoulder.
HATTIE: I never noticed how big his eyes INT. BATHROOM - EVENING Linda is helping Babe Brother wash Suzie's blood out of his hair. She dries his hair with a towel. Sonny hands Babe Brother a clean shirt, Gideon's shirt. He puts it on.
BABE BROTHER: Mister. Mister. Excuse me for cutting you off but we pay taxes too. We should not have to pay you to take a 24-hour lunch break. Babe Brother hands the phone to Linda.
LINDA: He doesn't know when he will be out this way again. Somebody downtown is going to hear about this.
PAT: I got white meat and I got dark meat. I know it sounds cruel but we have to eat. Gideon comes in walking very slowly, holding his plate out. Everyone is shocked. Gideon is completely unaware of the period that he has been sick.
GIDEON: What, are you having another party?
SUZIE: You better come sit down. You are still sick.
GIDEON: Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
JUNIOR: You have been out for almost three The Preacher gives him a pat on the back and shakes Gideon's We had long conversations with the Lord about you. Didn't we, Sister Suzie? I said we need him down here, Lord. Gideon smiles in appreciation. He pushes his plate out to Pat, indicating that he wants it filled with chicken. Gideon is about to bite into the chicken when he notices Harry's feet sticking out. He points with the chicken in his hand. He has a mystified look on his face.

He points with the chicken in his hand. He has a mystified look on his face.
OKRA: That's our friend Harry.
GIDEON: Not our Harry?
OKRA: I wish it wasn't. Gideon seems to weaken for a moment.
GIDEON: What happened to him?
HATTIE: He dropped dead.
HERMAN: Hattie, you can be so mean.
GIDEON: How long has he been dead?
SUZIE: Since this morning.
GIDEON: What happened to your hand?
SUZIE: I cut it on an old rusty knife. Gideon is deeply concerned.
GIDEON: What did you put on it?
SUZIE: It's healing now. Gideon looks over at his two sons as if to ask them about it.
GIDEON: I hope you will take care of your mother better than that when I'm Junior and Babe Brother both have their heads down. Linda and Sunny move closer to Babe Brother.
BABE BROTHER: How come you're not wearing my They're too big. Gideon stares at Babe Brother and then looks around towards When is the undertaker coming?
GIDEON: How come you're not wearing my They're too big. Gideon stares at Babe Brother and then looks around towards When is the undertaker coming?
BABE BROTHER: They're too big. Gideon stares at Babe Brother and then looks around towards When is the undertaker coming?
GIDEON: When is the undertaker coming?
LINDA: They can't say. I'll try calling them again. Hattie moves closer to Herman and speaks so only he can hear.
HATTIE: Why don't M.C. and you drag him to your house? Herman moves away with a look of disdain.
MARSH: Harry didn't have any relatives living, did he?
MARSH: Somebody has to take responsibility for him.
PAT: Why don't you look through his things to see if you can find a Okra, Marsh, Hattie, Herman, and M.C. go to Harry's room, leaving Suzie and Gideon sitting opposite each other with the door to the kitchen separating them. Junior, the Preacher and Pat are eating chicken. Linda is on the phone trying to get through to the morgue.
LINDA: How do you like that? They hung up in my face. I'll fix them. I'll show them just how mean I can get. She rapidly dials the number. There is a BUSY SIGNAL.
MARSH: These are letters to his son. Hattie reads the letters in a corner by herself. She stops reading for a moment.
HATTIE: I still don't know if I was right about Harry. She seems frustrated with herself not being able to come to terms about who was Harry.
BABE BROTHER: I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
LINDA: Like a veil has been lifted?
BABE BROTHER: It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
LINDA: Like muddy waters?
BABE BROTHER: It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
LINDA: You were in hell?
BABE BROTHER: I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
LINDA: Do you think you won?
BABE BROTHER: It was nip and tuck.
LINDA: And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br. Sam. I mean Samuel?
BABE BROTHER: I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there. Linda looks at Babe Brother for a length of time.
GIDEON: When are you boys going to fix that Soon as I rest a bit. I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
BABE BROTHER: Soon as I rest a bit. I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
GIDEON: Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen.
SUZIE: It feels like a storm has passed. Hattie read some of Harry's letters to a woman he had a child by. The child had died and he was writing to give her some comfort. Hattie didn't know that deep down at the bottom of Harry's hate, there was some love. The SOUND of Rodney's trumpet is heard but is no longer Did I ever tell you the story about the man who wanted to make his own mind up about heaven and hell? He didn't want nobody's opinion but his own. Suzie doesn't pay any attention; she is involved with her potted plant. Gideon looks over at the Preacher, who is still He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth.

SUZIE: I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
GIDEON: I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
SUZIE: I don't want to hear any tales about colored people.
GIDEON: But these are white people, anybody. The punch.
SUZIE: I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
GIDEON: It's only a tale. The RATTLING of pots and dishes starts suddenly. Harry's body starts to sway gently as if he were about to get up. Everyone is frozen. Babe Brother and Linda remain asleep. The rocking caused by the earthquake doesn't wake them. M.C., Herman, Okra and Hattie and Marsh enters the dining room. Harry's feet are seen in the kitchen still swaying.
M.C: Is that an earthquake?
HERMAN: It's something. Babe Brother wakes in a sweat and sits next to Linda like a child needing protection.
BABE BROTHER: I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
JUNIOR: What is it, noontime?
PREACHER: I wonder how they going to bury this man.
HATTIE: Plant him in Potter's Field. He doesn't need a marked grave.
HERMAN: Hattie, your true colors are unbearable. You got some mean ways. Don't worry about the boy getting a burial. He still has some friends left on this earth.
HATTIE: His winter has come and gone and I know right now he is answering for a lot of things. M.C., Okra and Herman move away from Hattie.
PREACHER: It is my job to pray for his soul and I would like to do that.
MAN: Hey boy, you still got that dead man in your house. Sunny and Rhonda don't respond. A middle-aged woman, VIRGINIA, one of Gideon's neighbors, passes Sunny and Rhonda, knocks on the screen door and goes in.
VIRGINIA: I know you all haven't had a chance to cook or do anything with that dead man in your kitchen. You must be starved to death. Some of your neighbors have got together and we set up a picnic table in my backyard with food and everything to feed all you all.
SUZIE: Virginia, that is so wonderful of you all!
MARSH: If the dead wagon comes, we ought to leave a note telling them we'll be down the street at a picnic. Gideon comes back in with Suzie, who is helping tie his tie. They all line up and file out the front door with Suzie and Gideon leading the way. Pat is holding her stomach with a thoughtful look on her face.
PAT: I think we better be ready. Junior looks concerned as he follows Pat out the door. Sunny follows Rhonda, who is still mad at him. Babe Brother and Linda are the last ones out. Babe Brother takes a long look in the direction of Harry as Linda pulls him out. She slams the door.
