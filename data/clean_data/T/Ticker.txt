RICE: Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
REILLY: Look who's talking, old man.
RICE: C'mon, it's a quiet night.
RICE: Next week we work the park.
REILLY: I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens.
RICE: You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens.
BAG LADY: A small gift, sir, for the Queen .
RICE: Here you go, your Highness.
BAG LADY: Thank you, officer.
REILLY: So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
RICE: Hell, I got a gold watch. it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
REILLY: You don't fish.
RICE: How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
REILLY: You outta the city. that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
RICE: One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
REILLY: No thanks. I got close but it never woulda They stop beside a dirty, beat-up Studebaker parked in the alley, climb in, Reilly behind the wheel.
RICE: Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
REILLY: What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
RICE: I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
REILLY: She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
RICE: What was it this time?
REILLY: She wanted to cook me breakfast.
RICE: We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
REILLY: Nah, let's just take a look-see.
REILLY: Ow! Son-of-a-bitch.
RICE: You okay?
REILLY: Yeah, just a nick .
RICE: Freeze! Police!
REILLY: ( to gunmen ) Drop it!
SWAN: Let her go.
EARRING: ( to Swan ) We gotta get outta here!
REILLY: ( to Swan ) Tell them to drop it - now!
SWAN: You have no idea how sorry you're going to be. Don't worry.
RICE: Don't talk.
REILLY: Don't talk.
RICE: Take your time. one day at a time, kid.
REILLY: It don't work-
RICE: ( grinning ) Ain't that a shit
HARRY: Hey, Reilly, Captain's looking for you.
WINTERS: Nothing so far.
PLUCHINSKY: Nothing so far.
WINTERS: What about the ballistics report?
PLUCHINSKY: Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
REILLY: Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
WINTERS: Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
REILLY: ( at a loss, sad ) Sir, I
REILLY: I want to work this.
PLUCHINSKY: You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally But sir
REILLY: But sir
WINTERS: You know the rules. You're off the street `til I.A.D. clears the investigation. Now go home and clean yourself up, get some rest.
HARRY: She won't talk. Look at this shit, no I.D., Reilly picks up a twisted plastic-wire bracelet.
PLUCHINSKY: What's that?
HARRY: Bracelet she was wearing.
REILLY: Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
PLUCHINSKY: Maybe she knows your old man.
WINTERS: Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
REILLY: I'll do it.
WINTERS: Okay, kid. Run this down to the Cave.
BEV: May I help you?
REILLY: I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
BEV: They're not here.
REILLY: Where are they?
BEV: And you are.?
REILLY: Officer Reilly, vice.
BEV: There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
REILLY: 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
BEV: 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
REILLY: Reilly sprints out. Bev tries to finish but he's gone.
REILLY: ( flashes badge ) Bomb Squad.
POOCH: Smell anything, Schnoz? Me, neither.
GLASS: Who the heck're you?
REILLY: You the Bomb Squad?
GLASS: We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still Reilly, Vice. I-
REILLY: ( flashes badge ) Reilly, Vice. I-
POOCH: Schnoz says it's loaded. Good boy, Pooch lowers Schnoz back to the ground throws him the red ball, and trots back to the van, climbs up inside and sits, Alright boys, look close. Let's assess.
GLASS: Alright boys, look close. Let's assess.
POOCH: Whadaya think, "boy" or "girl"?
GLASS: It's a "girl" !
POOCH: No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in T.J. and Pooch share a laugh as Reilly approaches.
REILLY: Who's in charge here?
POOCH: He is!
REILLY: Look, it's important.
REILLY: It's about this.
GLASS: Where did you get this?
REILLY: Off a girl's wrist. A suspect.
REILLY: High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
GLASS: High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
REILLY: What do you mean?
POOCH: Fire in the hole!
GLASS: Sorry about that. That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
REILLY: He grabs back the bracelet, turns to leave.
GLASS: Hey wait a minute-
POOCH: That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
EARRING: They're holding her downtown.
SWAN: What about the cop?
BEARD: If you'd let me waste him.
EARRING: What if she talks?
SWAN: She won't.
BEARD: I say we split town. Come back to this job when things cool. We've got other contracts - Denver, Seattle.
SWAN: I want her back and we do the job.
BEARD: I thought we agreed, the personal can't interfere with the professional.
EARRING: Besides, we're on a schedule and the cops won't let her go.
SWAN: Unless we make them.
EARRING: Earring stares uneasily. Swan and Beard look up, freeze. A pair of PATROL COPS are heading directly towards them.
REILLY: An OFFICER shouts from across the room, holding up a phone.
OFFICER: Captain, line one!
WINTERS: ( to Reilly ) I thought I told you
OFFICER: He says it's important, something about the Rice shooting.
WINTERS: 11/10/97 19.
SWAN'S VOICE: I said release the girl or alot of people are going to die.
WINTERS: Wait, what do you mean?
PLUCHINSKY: What the hell was that?
REILLY: A ticking bomb.
WINTERS: ( holds up bracelet ) It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
REILLY: ( holds up bracelet ) It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
PLUCHINSKY: It's a bluff. The guy's full of We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
WINTERS: We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
REILLY: I'll do it.
WINTERS: Goddamit, Reilly
REILLY: Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
WINTERS: I know you're anxious to get back but. just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
REILLY: Yes, sir.
POOCH: No, honey, I'm fine. Yeah, well, you're welcome. You deserve flowers more often.
GLASS: Bev, you're the greatest.
BEV: Hey, that's the guy-
REILLY: We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
GLASS: Alright, let's check it out.
REILLY: We can start in the area where the robbery Vice cop on a homicide?
REILLY: Captain assigned me to assist you.
POOCH: Assist? What the hell you know about tickers Easy, guys.
GLASS: Easy, guys.
REILLY: What're you talking about?
GLASS: When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
REILLY: We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
POOCH: ( to Glass ) What do you think?
GLASS: Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
POOCH: ( re: bracelet ) T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
GLASS: ( re: bracelet ) T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
SWAN: What time is it?
EARRING: Twenty after.
BEARD: Swan, it's no use. Look, we can still make Houston
SWAN: Shut up!
EARRING: Hey, beautiful, can I buy you some bangers and mash? Pint of Guiness?
KNOCKOUT: Fuck off, pal.
FIRE CHIEF: Eight dead, so far.
PLUCHINSKY: What're you doing here?
REILLY: You touch me again and
PLUCHINSKY: And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
WINTERS: What the hell's going on?
PLUCHINSKY: Son-of-a-bitch. my nose. This fuck-up is interfering with-
WINTERS: Reilly, what're you doing here?
REILLY: I thought I told you
WINTERS: I thought I told you
GLASS: Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner. Reilly looks at the Captain awkwardly.
WINTERS: Go ahead, kid.
PLUCHINSKY: I'm filing charges against that mother-
WINTERS: Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
REILLY: What was-? Why.?
GLASS: That cop who bought it. you didn't tell us he was your partner.
GLASS: Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
REILLY: This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, Now wait just a fucking-
GLASS: This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, Now wait just a fucking-
REILLY: Now wait just a fucking-
GLASS: Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's Reilly glares, tongue-tied, as they walk past the Bomb Squad van and Glass' Harley, enter the wreckage.
GLASS: By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Mike Reilly.
REILLY: Mike Reilly.
POOCH: That there's Schnoz, mascot and ace bomb sniffer. Say hi, Schnozzie.
POOCH: Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil .
REILLY: What kind of bomb was it?
REILLY: We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
GLASS: We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
REILLY: So you're the "Device Squad". and you defuse Treat. We treat devices.
GLASS: Treat. We treat devices.
REILLY: ( amused ) Anything else I should know?
GLASS: Don't push it, slick.
POOCH: I don't know.
POOCH: Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
GLASS: C4, plastic explosive.
POOCH: Hey, check this out?
GLASS: Lemme see that.
GLASS: Unlikely. Probably, cash register or Pooch and T.J. go back to searching.
REILLY: I'll get back to you.
WINTERS: Let's go, we gotta jump on him the second he calls again.
PLUCHINSKY: You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
REILLY: I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my Pluchinsky's face turns red with rage as.
OFFICER: Captain, it's him!
WINTERS: Winters here.
SWAN'S VOICE: Don't make me send another.
WINTERS: Look, we're prepared to talk, what do you want?
REILLY: Where's the girl? The one I brought in.
BOOKING OFFICER: Upstairs, interrogation.
BORED COP: Three hours. She's tough.
HARRY: Tough? Tough is "Fuck you, where's my lawyer?". This chick doesn't say boo.
REILLY: Any luck?
HARRY: Bupkiss. Sorry about Rice.
REILLY: Captain said I could give it a crack.
HARRY: She ain't no hooker. This is a murder She was my collar. Maybe I'll get lucky. But, if you got a problem with that, talk to the Captain.
REILLY: She was my collar. Maybe I'll get lucky. But, if you got a problem with that, talk to the Captain.
HARRY: I'll be in the can.
REILLY: You remember me.
REILLY: Let me be very clear about this. The police won't let you go. When your boyfriend realizes this, I have a feeling a lot of innocent people are going to die. Kids, families. I know you don't want that to She stares, eyes dark, barely registering any emotion at all. A flicker of fear, indecision. Her lips part, fighting it, then she looks away, letting the fear win. Reilly flushes with anger, frustration.
POOCH: We missed you, where'd you go?
POOCH: Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip
GLASS: I was wrong. this didn't come from any cash register.
POOCH: Whadaya mean?
GLASS: It's from an IRA.
POOCH: Oh shit.
REILLY: A what?
GLASS: I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
REILLY: She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices Only once, at Redstone.
GLASS: Only once, at Redstone.
REILLY: 11/10/97 37.
POOCH: Shit. We're fucked.
GLASS: Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
BEV: Stop it.
POOCH: Shut up, T.J.!
BEV: Be nice Pooch!
REILLY: All of you, shut the fuck up!
GLASS: Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
REILLY: Hey, look
GLASS: No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
REILLY: Oh yeah? Prove it.
GLASS: ( beat )
REILLY: The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
GLASS: Then let's go see what they missed.
GLASS: So what were they doing here?
REILLY: I don't know. You tell me?
GLASS: An abandoned machine shop. nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
REILLY: You mentioned something called Redstone.
GLASS: Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
REILLY: Cream of the crop, huh? You?
GLASS: ( nods ) Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices. second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
REILLY: Sounds like terrorist heaven.
GLASS: There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
REILLY: Just how easy is it to build a. device?
GLASS: With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
REILLY: Girl was here. The guy in charge was over there with one of his men, the other one was back there.
GLASS: Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
REILLY: Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
GLASS: No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever. and they love the Glass lays out flat on his stomach and searches deep under a machine, picks up a half-smoked cigarette butt with tweezers, pulls it out, kneels.
GLASS: This is where the van was parked.
REILLY: Then, it's gotta be here somewhere .
GLASS: Then, it's gotta be here somewhere .
REILLY: Look, it's a longshot.
GLASS: Glass pinches something with his tweezers, holds it up triumphantly. a used match.
REILLY: Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
GLASS: Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together .
POOCH: They make bowling balls out of vulcanized rubber .
BEV: They make bowling balls out of vulcanized rubber .
POOCH: Lane oil.
GLASS: ( beat, proud of his team ) A bowling alley.
REILLY: ( amazed ) You mean you just? . You keep a record of. matches?
GLASS: Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
POOCH: ( smirks at Reilly ) "Punks", huh?
GLASS: Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
BEV: Pooch, why don't you e-mail your buddies at Langley and on the other side of the pond, see if any IRAs been popping up lately?
GLASS: Pooch, why don't you e-mail your buddies at Langley and on the other side of the pond, see if any IRAs been popping up lately?
POOCH: You got it.
GLASS: ( to Reilly ) We work fast enough for you?
REILLY: T.J., what're you doing?
REILLY: Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
GLASS: How long are we going to stay?
REILLY: `Til we get a better lead.
POOCH: Unsolved bombings in the last year. Boston, New York, Philadelphia. but no real match
REILLY: Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not.
GLASS: Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not.
POOCH: Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not.
GLASS: Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
REILLY: What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be Well. it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
GLASS: Well. it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
REILLY: Well. it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
POOCH: I got a friend over at Scotland Yard who's gonna try and reach out to a undercover guy who would know if any of the rightwingers are circulating over here. Bev's following up on the briefcase manufacturers, too.
POOCH: How're you guys doing?
REILLY: Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
GLASS: It's a small fraternity, everyone knows everyone. I'm always recruiting. Pooch is ex- D.O.D., military expert. claymores, grenades. He played linebacker at Boston College, worked a K-9 unit - that led him to the Bomb Squad. great nose, lousy fingers, we try to keep him away from the tickers. T.J. is a heck of chemist, Texas A&M engineering degree. Found him in a Militia chat room - turns out we were both monitoring the same groups. Bev is the natural born hacker, we stole her from dispatch. She had the Cave reorganized and ultra-high-tech in two months. Captain has no idea how much hardware she's "found" for us.
REILLY: You guys seem pretty tight.
GLASS: We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
REILLY: Why do you do it?
GLASS: I don't know, it's strange. it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things.
REILLY: Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
REILLY: There he goes. He was here the whole time.
REILLY: Say, thanks for the back up
GLASS: He set one, the son-of-a.
REILLY: ( loudly ) You heard him, get the fuck away, it's a bomb!
GLASS: Alright. Let's assess.
TJ: Glass puts on his magnifying spectacles, starts to probe.
POOCH: Oh shit.
GLASS: Okay, I'm going in, nobody breathe.
REILLY: So cut both.
GLASS: One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
REILLY: Which one's which?
GLASS: I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
REILLY: No, I'm with you.
GLASS: ( smiles ) Is this a great job or what?
REILLY: ( at Glass ) Nothing. Nothing traceable.
INT BAR: Pooch and T.J. have the device on the ground a few feet away from the Earring's body. They delicately continue to take it apart so it can be transported safely. Schnoz sits nearby, watching. Pooch is on the phone with his wife.
POOCH: I don't know, honey. I'll see. No, everything's fine, it was nothing.
EXT STREET: Pooch and TJ exit the bar, moving to Glass and Reilly.
GLASS: Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
REILLY: Got work to do, don't we?
POOCH: In case you change your mind.
WINTERS: What's this?
REILLY: Report on the case so far.
WINTERS: You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
REILLY: Yes, sir.
WINTERS: But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad. you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
REPORTER: To recap, a gunman carrying what police described as a phony bomb was shot and killed less than an hour ago.
THE ROOM: Swan watches the TV report with Beard, eyes narrowing as he sees Reilly in the crowd behind the Reporter.
BEARD: She talked.
MEG: More coffee, T.J.?
MEG: Mr. Reilly?
REILLY: Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
POOCH: Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
TOMMY: Can Uncle Teej tuck us in?
JANIE: ( to Glass, Reilly ) Goodnight Uncle Charlie, goodnight Uncle Mike.
REILLY: Meg clears the dishes, Schnoz is asleep on the floor. Glass and Reilly are left alone. Reilly takes a sip of coffee, hand trembles ever so slightly.
GLASS: How long were you hooked?
REILLY: 11/10/97 59.
GLASS: You don't have to talk about it.
REILLY: Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
GLASS: Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
REILLY: I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
GLASS: Your partner?
REILLY: ( nods sadly ) I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
GLASS: Let me see.
REILLY: I terrible with mechanical things.
GLASS: No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
REILLY: It's working.
GLASS: Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
REILLY: Okay, hit it.
GLASS: We've created a monster.
GLASS: Any word?
POOCH: Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
REILLY: Don't bet on it.
REILLY: How's the print coming?
BEV: One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA. still waiting for Bev enters another command. the computer goes to work as she turns to Reilly.
REILLY: Bev enters another command. the computer goes to work as she turns to Reilly.
BEV: Coffee, Mike?
REILLY: No thanks, Bev.
BEV: Yes, sir. He's here. I'll tell him.
WINTERS: Yes . no, of course not but . yes, sir, I understand.
REILLY: Yes, sir.
WINTERS: She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
REILLY: I didn't. But I had to try.
WINTER: Reilly, I think I've shown that I'm a patient man. Rice was your biggest fan and I've tried to honor him by giving you some slack. But you are very close to running out of slack.
REILLY: Yes, sir.
WINTERS: I read your report. Impressive. I'd say it's got detective written all over it. But. you cross the line one more time. you're gone. Are we clear?
REILLY: Yes, sir.
HARRY: I'll be outside.
THE GIRL: THE GIRL ( MARY )
REILLY: THE GIRL ( MARY )
REILLY: But they weren't all insured.
MARY: ( slowly, ashamed ) It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us.We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
REILLY: Who is he?
MARY: Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Taylor's dead.
REILLY: Taylor's dead.
MARY: There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop. the Suncrest. Room 138.
REILLY: Thank you.
MARY: He's my brother.
REILLY: Then why tell me?
MARY: People are dying.
GLASS: Be right back.
REILLY: Be right back.
BAG LADY: No, of course not. well, thanks anyway. Here you go, Your Highness.
REILLY: No, of course not. well, thanks anyway. Here you go, Your Highness.
BAG LADY: On second thought, maybe I did.
BAG LADY: Lemme see. yeah, here it is, 11:18 this morning. Very disrespectful. He used to drive a van, but he got a new car. You want the license number?
REILLY: You're beautiful!
REILLY: We're back in business!
HARRY: Ran the license plate - car was rented early this morning from a Hertz office downtown.
PLUCHINSKY: Alex Swan - demolitions expert, trained at Redstone, dropped out, freelanced in the middle East for awhile, then disappeared, no criminal record. The other one, Leveau, is French Canadian, he's a mercenary, record in half a dozen countries.
WINTERS: Get out an APB, now!
HOME.": WINTERS ( cont. )
PLUCHINSKY: Yes, sir.
BEARD: We've got company.
REILLY: Glass, there they are. Pooch right in front of you, you got `em, you got `em.
POOCH: Oh. damn.
WINTERS: Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
REILLY: My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
WINTERS: ( ignoring Reilly ) Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
REILLY: I promised her she'd be safe.
WINTERS: It's our only option.
REILLY: It won't work, he'll know it's a trap.
WINTERS: Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
REILLY: I know.
WINTERS: You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
REILLY: Reilly stares, eyes wet, watching him disappear.
HARRY: It's him!
WINTERS: Winters here.
SWAN'S VOICE: You motherfuckers, you don't learn, do you?!
WINTERS: We're prepared to talk-
SWAN'S VOICE: Shut up! Shut up!
TRACER: SWAN'S VOICE
SWAN'S VOICE: You have exactly thirty minutes to release the girl where you found her.
TRACER: Twelve .
SWAN'S VOICE: Thirty minutes.
TRACER: Nine .
WINTERS: How do we know you'll keep your word?
WINTERS: ( to his men ) Okay, let's move!
PLUCHINSKY: Get out and go to the machine shop -
WINO: She's out of the bag.
TRUCK DRIVER: ( speaks into sleave ) Six. She's crossing to Main.
WINTERS: Seal the building! Let's move.
TRUCK DRIVER: ( into sleave ) We have contact. Black Camaro-
SWAN: You okay?
MARY: I know. I warned them.
SWAN: I know. I warned them.
MARY: What is that?
SWAN: He sets a dial to 10, pushes a button.
DEALER: C'mon, cowboy, you're next.
DEALER: Okay, what's it gonna be? I got China White, Snow Flake, Ivory Pearl.
DEALER: ( impatient ) Hey, asshole .
DEALER: Hey, I'm talking to you
SWAN: You hungry? We could get something to eat.
