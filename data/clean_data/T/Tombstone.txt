TOMBSTONE: An original screenplay Kevin Jarre ROLL PROLOGUE OVER MAIN TITLE: a collage of old photos, prints, etc., and silent live-action vignettes, all dark and heavily shadowed like a dimly-remembered dream. The first images show the opulence of the Gilded Age, the epic vistas of the west, cattle drives and cowtowns with all their A dashing FIGURE in a Prince Albert coat appears, long locks tumbling down his shoulders, twin Navy Colts thrust into a red sash at his waist, a tin star on his chest. Next we see him in action, downing 3 barroom opponents at once, pistols FLASHING around the room like a strobe light:
V.O. NARRATION: "The economic explosion following the Civil War created an unprecedented nation-wide market for beef. Previously worthless cattle running wild throughout Texas were gathered into herds And driven north to the railheads In Kansas. Fortunes were made as Cowtowns sprang up on the Prairies, wide-open centers of Commerce and vice, their streets Choked with heavily-armed young Men fresh from the cattle drives. In those days the correct term For a cowhand was 'drover'. 'Cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was originally an insult implying deviant sexuality and was rarely used. But these invading drovers were a wild breed for soon shootings and wholesale drunken riots became so frequent that ordinary citizens literally could not walk down the street. In fact at their height the cowtowns had higher murder rates than modern New York or Los Angeles and there Was no law but that of the gun."
V.O. NARRATION: "Straight-up at 75 yards or eye- to-eye at point-blank range, the greatest gunman of all time was an Illinois abolitionist farm boy named James Butler Hickok, better known as Wild Bill, the Prince of Pistoleers. But Wild Bill worked His trade on the side of justice And as marshal of cowtowns like Hays City and Abilene he became a Legend, the one man who stood Between law and chaos."
V.O. NARRATION: "Wild Bill's fame spread nation- wide but his end came quietly in the spring of '76 when a strange cross-eyed little drifter put a bullet through the back of his head, apparently for no other reason than he wanted to kill a "In Dodge City meanwhile, Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson were Becoming known as fast-guns.

V.O. NARRATION: "Earp and Masterson operated more like modern policemen, using teamwork and persuasion to keep order. Still, sometimes things got out of hand."

V.O. NARRATION: "John Henry 'Doc' Holliday was the son of an aristocratic, highly cultured southern family. Trained in Philadelphia, he had Embarked on a career as a society Dentist when he contracted Tuberculosis. Advised to practice In the west where it was thought The climate and clean air would Prolong his life, Doc soon Realized it was all only a matter Of time and gave up dentistry to Become a professional gambler and
V.O. NARRATION: "Others headed east. Bent on becoming an actress. Josephine Marcus defied her wealthy and Very proper San Francisco Jewish Family to run away with a Traveling theatrical company, Braving the perils of the Frontier on her own. Dangerous as This might seem, it was another Age and women were so rare, their Presence so cherished that they Could travel virtually anywhere In the west in perfect safety." "At about this time the Texas Rangers, having eliminated the Commanche threat, turned their Attention to the outlaw gangs Marauding along the Rio Grande, Cleaning up the border strip in 4 Years of hard riding. Those they Could not indict or convict the Rangers put down in their Black Book, letting it be known that They could either leave Texas or Face summary execution. This Resulted in the mass migration of The absolute dregs of the Texas Underworld to the most dangerous, Uncivilized part of the entire Country, the southeast corner of The Arizona Territory." "Harsh and inhospitable, savaged in turn by the Apache and Mexican bandits, this had always been an accursed place, a virtual hell on earth where it was thought life itself could never prosper, much less civilization. Then in 1879, a prospector named Ed Schiefflin set off alone into the Dragoon Mountains. Friends told him he Was crazy, that the only thing He'd find in this Godforsaken Place would be his tombstone. Instead he found silver, lots of It, and overnight the town of Tombstone sprang up. Mining Taking out millions in ore. Land Value shot sky-high and Speculators and gamblers and Opportunists of all nations Scrambled in by the thousands to Make Tombstone queen of the Boomtowns, so rich that the Latest Paris fashions, hard to Find even in the biggest cities, Were sold there by the wagonload From the makeshift storefronts."

V.O. NARRATION: "Meanwhile, the exile Texans had banded together to form the nucleaus of an organized gang. Seizing controp of the Surrounding countryside they Robbed stagecoaches at will while The big absentee business Interests employed them as tax Collectors and strongarm men. But The backbone of their trade Remained border rustling, Periodic raids into Mexico to Steal cattle while engaging in What was described as a virtual Orgy of murder and violence. The Raids became so frequent and so Bloody that the Mexican Government formally protested to U.S. President Chester A. Arthur, Prompting heated debate in Congress. General Sherman Declared that the only possible Way of bringing order was to send In the army but in the wake of Civil War Reconstruction federal Intervention in civilian affairs Was politically impossible." "With only some 100 members, the gang was an elite body of gunmen, known by the red silk sashes they wore around their waists. Fiercely proud of their Terrifying reputation and Answerable to no one, they were a Law unto themselves, finally Emerging as one of the earliest Examples in American history of Full-scale organized crime."

DELETED: EXT - SKELETON CANYON - NIGHT The full moon throws fantastic shadows across the high walls of the canyon as the Rurales ride through. At the bend the Captain halts them. The young one starts to speak but the Captain shushes him, peering into the darkness. A few beats But suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from the shadows all around them, blasting them from the saddle, each powder flash lighting up the canyon for an instant, freezing each victim in the moment of his death. Then, just as abruptly the firing stops, leaving only the Captain, the young Rurale, and a 3rd Rurale alive. Dazed and bloody, they struggle to their feet as 6 armed FIGURES emerge from the shadows, walking into the moonlight toward them. With broad-brim hats swept up in front, silk scarves and red sashes, high boots and silver- studded gunleather, they look like 17th century pirates. These are the Cowboys: OLD MAN CLANTON, the ageless, white- bearded leader; CURLY BILL BROCIUS, 2nd-in-command, smiling, bull-necked; IKE and BILLY CLANTON, the old man's sons; FLORENTINO, a Mexican half-breed; and JOHNNY RINGO, dark, Byronic, with an air of something very strange. The Old Man nods to Florentino:
CAPTAIN: Turn around! Fast! Now!
FLORENTINO: He will not kneel. He is proud.
CURLY BILL: So how'd you like our little Carry-on over at that rancho? Kinda hit the spot didn't it?

RINGO: You first.
TOM: Looks like you had a party!
CURLY BILL: Oh, we had a big time! The Old Man, Curly Bill, and Ringo rein up and look out at the sun rising magnificently from the desert floor. The Old man stretches his legs in the stirrups, taking out a whiskey Ain't that sweet? That's why I Stay out here. Thank you, God.
CURLY BILL: What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us? Didn't make No sense.
RINGO: He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."

FLY: ( comes up to Wyatt ) The McLaurys are both dead. Billy Clanton's just about gone. Guess we did our good deed for today.
WYATT: Guess we did our good deed for today.
DELETED: EXT - BOOT HILL - SUNSET Fireworks EXPLODE in the darkening sky as a cortege of 50 Cowboys in their finest parade down the street toward Boot Hill, the crude little grave yard, Curly Bill and Ringo in the lead, Ike right behind with the 3 coffins and a banner saying: "Murdered On The Streets Of Tombstone". As they take places at the gravesite Wyatt approaches Curly Bill.
WYATT: I'm sorry. If there was any other-
CURLY BILL: I know. Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike. Don't worry about it.
CURLY BILL: Don't worry about a thing

WYATT: Look, Mattie, I know you're-
MATTIE: You know nothing. What you don't Know would fill a book. Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most. You're never Yourself, you never relax. Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself. Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.

VIRGIL: Getting late. Guess I'll turn in.
WYATT: Bundle up, Virge. Cold out there.
MORGAN: That thunder's sure somethin'.
WYATT: That didn't sound like thunder.
WYATT: Virgil does an unsteady stutter-step, his face taking on a pleading, almost childlike look of panic. But as he turns his body toward Wyatt we suddenly see that his whole left side is in bloody shreds, his left arm dangling unnaturally by a few gory ribbons of flesh. His voice is a frightened sob:

CURLY BILL: Take Frank and finish it.
STILLWELL: That's Virgil with the women. But Where the hell's Wyatt?
O.S. VOICE: Right behind you, Stillwell.
WAGONMASTER: Rest of us're 3 months out of Independece but we're from Carthage, Illinois originally.
WYATT: Carthage, really? I'm from Monmouth.
WAGONMASTER: Another Illinois man! Practical Neighbors! Step down, Marshal. Have a feed.
WAGONMASTER: Ain't got law, ain't got nothin'. Only thing between us and the Animals. Always the way it goes, Though. Only way to down an Illinois man's from behind, the Dogs don't dare face 'em. Mr. Lincoln, Wild Bill, now your Brothers: Illinois men all and All downed from behind by dirty Dogs and Democrats. Guess an Ordinary man'd be out for Vengeance but I don't figure That'll answer here. It's a Reckoning you're after.
WYATT: If the Lord is my friend.
WAGONMASTER: Let not your heart be faint, let Your arm be steel-that's all you Need of the Lord.
WYATT: Know why you're here?
VERMILLION: Way ahead of you, Wyatt. You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan. Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
WYATT: They're nothing. They're nobody. I want the Cowboys. All of 'em. I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
JOHNSON: Are you out of your mind? What on Earth'd make us-
WYATT: ( takes out wad of bills ) I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
WYATT: Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served. That means we got the Cowboys without quarter. The Black flag, brother. No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
VERMILLION: ( to Johnson ) 500. Year's wages. And I never even saw a horse like that.
JOHNSON: You crazy? It can't be done.
MCMASTERS: It might be done. If we hit the Waterholes through the southern Dragoons, the Whetstones and Huachucas, we could take 'em on In pieces, run off their herds. Keep your money, I'll show you Where those waterholes are. Just Promise me you'll finish it. No Matter what happens you'll see it Through to the end. I'll have Your hand on that.
VERMILLION: We come through this in one Piece, can we keep the horses?
JOHNSON: Crapped out. Okay, we're in.
WYATT: The minute we start we'll be Going against local and county Law. If we fail the U.S. Government won't be able to lift A finger to help us. Nevertheless I want you to understand we carry The full force and authority of The law of this land.
WYATT: Raise your right hands. Do you Solemnly swear to uphold the laws And constitution of the United States of America and to protect her citizens to the best of your Ability, even at the cost of your Own life? Oh. All right. You know why I'm here. My Hypocrisy only goes so far.
DOC: Oh. All right. You know why I'm here. My Hypocrisy only goes so far.
DOC: You know why I'm here. My Hypocrisy only goes so far.
LUCINDA: Lucinda runs up to Wyatt, reaching up and tying a blue and gold silk scarf around his neck.
LUCINDA: Your colors.
WAGONMASTER: Good luck, boys. And give 'em hell!
LUCINDA'S SON: Wyatt Earp, the two-gun man, Whistling death and bloody Murder! Wyatt the widow-maker, Avenging and bright, purple Poison on horseback with Lightning in his eye and thunder In his heart! Wyatt and his he- Devils, holy terrors and true, Five black centaurs blowin' fire And quicksilver! Ride out and Charge and shoot and strike and Cleave and hack and thrust home! Don't let up and give no rest and Never call retreat till the last One's smashed and smote and Runnin' for cover. Best 'em all And break 'em up and bang their Heads together in a bunch and Give no quarter though they be Ten times ten thousand!
ILLINOIS MOTHER: What're you doing?
ILLINOIS FATHER: Someday he'll be able to say he Was there when Wyatt Earp rode Out to bring the law. All right, let's wring 'em out!
WYATT: All right, let's wring 'em out!
JOHNSON: Like flyin', son. Just like flyin'.
PONY DEAL: Maybe they smell a wolf.
SPENCE: ( turns to other Cowboy ) Go up there and take a look.
PONY DEAL: The pinto gallops riderless back over the ridge. The Cowboys exchange confused glances, all attention focused on the far end of the ridge. Then the five black horsemen ride out of the sun, gliding like apparitions up and over the near end of the ridge and bearing down on the unsuspecting camp with the speed of a flame. They are within a few yards of the fire when Johnny Barnes suddenly spots them and:
BARNES: Look out!
WYATT: United States Marshals! Reach! Say something witty. Hey, you can't come-
DOC: Say something witty. Hey, you can't come-
BARNES: Hey, you can't come-
WYATT: One more word and I'll blind you. Get over there!
PONY DEAL: ( to McMasters ) Hey brother, what're you doin'-
MCMASTERS: I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers. Move!
WYATT: All right, run 'em off.
SWILLING: Bastard! Stinkin' bastard! Like To eat you blood raw!
WYATT: All right, breed. Dig in.
DOC: It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
WYATT: ( faces Cowboys ) Felt his liver go on that last One. Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours. Florentino! He's getting away!
MCMASTERS: Florentino! He's getting away!
WYATT: Drop his horse.
FLORENTINO: I don't kill your brother! I Don't even know him. I was only Lookout. It was money, they give Me twelve dollars! It was money!
WYATT: A human life. Twelve dollars.
FLORENTINO: Wyatt FIRES, blasting Florentino to the ground. He advances, FIRING over and over, emptying his gun into him..
WYATT: Look at him. That's how you'll All end up if you don't get it Through your head: it's over, The Cowboys're finished. Forever. So tell the others and get out of The Territory 'cause next time I Leave no one alive. Understand? No one. You been warned. All right, burn it! Everything!
WYATT: Leave that trash where it lays.
VERMILLION: You know, we might just pull this off.
JOHNSON: Not so sure. Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in. Should've held out for more money.
WYATT: I know that cut. You mean there's A waterhole near there?
MCMASTERS: But this time they'll be ready.
WYATT: We'll see about that.
PONY DEAL: Keep your eyes open for Earp's Bunch. Swear to God, ain't gonna Get the drop on us this time.
1ST COWBOY: Riders up ahead! .four, five. It's them all right! They saw us. Here they come.
DOC: They saw us. Here they come.
WYATT: Wait. wait. steady.
WYATT: They whirl around and disappear into the cut. The Cowboys keep coming. Wyatt's group reaches the little trail leading up the wall of the cut he used to avoid Josephine. They clamber up the side of the cut at a bounding gallop, unseen, as moments later the Cowboys gallop by and continue through into the desert on the other side. Wyatt's group careens up and around the high mountain wall as if on a roller-coaster, following the tiny, narrow path at a breathtaking clip, the trail finally plunging them back into the draw behind the Cowboys. They speed up to the opposite mouth of the cut, drawing their pistols as the Cowboys gallop into the desert before them, unaware.
WYATT: Lay on!
PONY DEAL: The remaining Cowboys turn and dash into the desert. Wyatt Wyatt's group CHARGES, the thoroughbreds closing the distance in seconds. Vermillion stands in his stirrups, roaring like an animal as he PLUNGES into them, swinging his quirt like a saber and LASHING a Cowboy across the face, making him tumble to the earth and bounce over the rocks like a rag doll. McMasters closes with another, throwing an arm around him and JERKING him from the saddle, SNAPPING his neck. Doc overtakes a 3rd, jams his pistol into his face and FIRES point-blank, blackening his face with soot and BLOWING out the back of his head as he falls. Reins in his teeth, shotgun at his shoulder, Johnson comes up behind a 4th and FIRES. The Cowboy's head DISAPPEARS in a cloud of pink vapor, the body dropping like a stone.. Wyatt bears down on Pony Deal at a dead run. Pony Deal turns in the saddle and FIRES at him. We feel a surge of breathless exhilaration as Wyatt swings out of the saddle like a Commanche and ducks his body down against the side of his horse, hiding in its lee. Pony Deal turns for another shot only to see an apparently riderless horse overtake him. But in the next instant Wyatt darts around under his horse's neck and FIRES, blowing Pony Deal head-over-heels off the back of his horse. Wyatt bounds back into the saddle as McMasters rides by, drawing a bead with his rifle on the lone survivor, the 1st Cowboy. Only a few yards in front of them, he whips his horse frantically, trying to get away. McMasters is about to fire when Wyatt rides up, deflecting the shot. The Cowboy makes it over a rise and disappears.
WYATT: Come on!
MCMASTERS: What'd you do that for?
WYATT: So he can tell the story.
1ST COWBOY: Didn't make any sense. One minute We're chasin' 'em, next they're Right on top of us. We couldn't Stop 'em, they got everybody. Just everybody!
CURLY BILL: Easy now, it's only five men. Been havin' it their way 'cause They been surprising you. Hittin' The waterholes and that Judas McMasters is showin' 'em right Where they are. Pretty damn cute. But nobody's cute as me. Next up's Black Draw. But that Smart Wyatt'll say no, that's Where they'll expect us to hit, We'll hit the one after. Iron Springs. That's where they show Next. Only I'm gonna be there First. And throw a little party.
DOC: Don't touch me!
VERMILLION: He pulls back. Doc wraps himself in the blanket. After a
VERMILLION: You really look awful.
DOC: Not half as bad as I feel.
VERMILLION: Then why in hell're you doin' This? You ought to be in bed.
DOC: Wyatt Earp is my friend.
VERMILLION: Hell, I got lot's of friends.
DOC: ( turns, glares at him ) I don't.
JOHNSON: Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt. I don't know if He's gonna make it.
WYATT: There's no reasoning with him.
MCMASTERS: ( points to map ) Next waterhole's Black Draw. We Could be there by mid-morning.
WYATT: They're wise by now. Which is Next, Iron Springs? Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
MCMASTERS: There they are. No herd though.
WYATT: We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
MCMASTERS: Ambush! Get down!
JOHNSON: Hunched behind the logs on the opposite side with 15 more Cowboys, Curly Bill raises his head, grinning and shouting:
CURLY BILL: Hey, Wyatt! How the hell are you? Got some boys workin' around Those rocks behind you. Another Minute or two, gonna have you in A crossfire! How do you like that? He's right. They get set up in Them rocks it's the end for us. 'Course you could give yourselves up and we could have a party! Then what larks!
DOC: CURLY BILL CURLY BILL
CURLY BILL: Got some boys workin' around Those rocks behind you. Another Minute or two, gonna have you in A crossfire! How do you like that? He's right. They get set up in Them rocks it's the end for us. 'Course you could give yourselves up and we could have a party! Then what larks!
MCMASTERS: He's right. They get set up in Them rocks it's the end for us. 'Course you could give yourselves up and we could have a party! Then what larks!
CURLY BILL: 'Course you could give yourselves up and we could have a party! Then what larks!
VERMILLION: Ain't takin' me alive, damn it! Think of somethin' fast or we're cooked.
MCMASTERS: Think of somethin' fast or we're cooked.
WYATT: And now we can almost hear the ether RINGING in our ears as Wyatt takes his shotgun and, while the others look on in horror, rises to his feet.
JOHNSON: And now we can almost hear the ether RINGING in our ears as Wyatt takes his shotgun and, while the others look on in horror, rises to his feet.
WYATT: And now we can almost hear the ether RINGING in our ears as Wyatt takes his shotgun and, while the others look on in horror, rises to his feet.
DOC: Bullets WHIZ around him. Doc jumps up to grab him but a RICOCHET drives him back down. Wyatt advances quickly across the clearing, walking right into the teeth of their guns, Wyatt's clothes jerk and ripple as bullets pass through, but he just keeps coming. Seeing this, Curly Bill also stands, a weird, manic elation coming over him. He hoots and howls:
WYATT: Wyatt's clothes jerk and ripple as bullets pass through, but he just keeps coming. Seeing this, Curly Bill also stands, a weird, manic elation coming over him. He hoots and howls:
CURLY BILL: Look at that! Yeah! Come and get Some, boy!
WYATT: Curly Bill waves away his men's fire and walks toward Wyatt, 12 gauge shotgun in one hand, .45 in the other, BLASTING away.
CURLY BILL: Let me, let me, yeah! Die, you Die! Son of a bitch! Die!
WYATT: Curly Bill FIRES again. Wyatt's hat flies off. He FIRES again, digging a gash in Wyatt's boot-heel. Now Curly Bill takes dead aim with his .45 and-CLICK-it's empty. He tosses it aside. Suddenly a sharp wind gusts up, making the tails of Wyatt's duster swirl around him like a halo as he advances. Eyes wild with battle rage, Curly Bill quickly raises his He FIRES. Wyatt's coattails EVAPORATE into swirling shreds as he takes deliberate aim with his mighty 10 gauge, hissing through clenched teeth:
CURLY BILL: Die! Son of a bitch! Die!
WYATT: And with that, Wyatt lets go with BOTH BARRELS. Curly Bill's mid-section VAPORIZES, the huge double-charge of buckshot RIPPING HIM COMPLETELY IN HALF. The other Cowboys flinch as they're sprayed with flecks of blood and gore. Barnes
BARNES: Jesus Christ!
WYATT: Eyes burning like two twin hells, Wyatt pulls his Buntline and FIRES. Barnes doubles over. Wyatt FIRES again. Barnes drops. The others recoil, their faces looking as if they are living in a waking nightmare as Wyatt advances on them, STILL FIRING. Another goes down. Doc leaps from the rocks, gun in hand, and:
DOC: Come on!
WYATT: Beside himself, Doc helps Wyatt to a nearby rock, sitting him down and examining him, running his hands all over his body. The others FIRE at the Cowboys retreating on horseback.
DOC: Wyatt, my God! You're shot to pieces!
WYATT: Yeah, better run, you bastards!
VERMILLION: Yeah, better run, you bastards!
