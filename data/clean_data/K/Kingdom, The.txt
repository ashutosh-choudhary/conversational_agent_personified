THE KINGDOM: Written by
KEVIN FLEURY: This is my Fredricksburg house and my grandma Ruth playing with my skateboard ramp. It's a Tony Hawk jump ramp.
MICK: I forgot what I was going to say.
KEVIN FLEURY: This is me at my second birthday party with my mom and my dad. That's my cake.
MICK: Where's your gun?
LITTLE BOY: Yeah, where is your gun?
FLEURY: I'm assuming that there are no bad guys in this room. Isn't that right? I mean, are you guys good guys or bad guys?
GOOD GUYS!: Right. So why would I have brought my gun to a room full of good guys?
FLEURY: Right. So why would I have brought my gun to a room full of good guys?
MISS ROSS: What's that picture?
KEVIN FLEURY: This is me and my dad playing Battleship at my dad's apartment.
MICK: What is a battleship?
KEVIN FLEURY: ( abruptly ) My parents are divorced.
MISS ROSS: So, who's that in that picture up on top?
KEVIN FLEURY: That's my fish, his name is Jaws and he's a really mean fish.
KEVIN FLEURY: My mommy is a Think Tank worker and she is really, really smart. She went to two colleges and has three This is the day that my daddy says is the happiest day of his life.
KEVIN FLEURY: This is the day that my daddy says is the happiest day of his life.
MISS ROSS: Really. His happiest day! Can you tell us about that day, Mr. Fleury?
RONALD FLEURY: I sure can. That was December 4th and that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for this guy right here to come out of Kevin's mom's tummy. And we waited and waited but he wouldn't come and we kept waiting and finally the doctor said `OK.he's not gonna come out on his own so we got to go get him.' And well,
MISS ROSS: Go for it. So they take her and put her on a special bed and they give her some medicine so she doesn't feel any pain then they take out this tiny little knife and make a tiny little cut right here in her tummy.
MISS ROSS: Then what happened? Then the doctor put her hands way up into Kevin's mom's tummy. WAY IN! And then you know what they
LU LU: What did they do?
RONALD FLEURY: They started to pull and pull and pull. they had something in there and it started coming and they were pulling and the doctor all of the sudden said "STOP!"
DRIVER: How are you today, Sergeant?
HAYTHAM: Sun is shining. Wind is blowing. How bad can I be doing?
DRIVER: I like that, "Sun is shining."
WHITE MAN: GET DIRTY! STEP IT UP NOW! Ready for my knuckle-curve?
GET DIRTY!: Safe. Clapping and Hoots. The PITCHER: an older White Man in his middle forties visibly frustrated. A 25 year-old African- American Batter steps to the plate now. Pitcher turns to his The Batter just stays focused as the Pitcher tosses a high- lob. Batter smacks the ball a mile high, deep to left. The teammates of the plump-pink Boy on third:

RONALD FLEURY: Where exactly?
RONALD FLEURY: FRAN ( O.S. ) ( tears )
KEVIN FLEURY: Fleury smiles best he can at his Son. Into the phone:
RONALD FLEURY: FRAN ( O.S. )
RONALD FLEURY: Fran, I'm rollin' right now. Let me call you back: I gotta ring bells
RONALD FLEURY: Son, I gotta go to work.
KEVIN FLEURY: We're gonna do ceramics.
RONALD FLEURY: I gotta go to work.
KEVIN FLEURY: ( points to the phone ) Who was that?
RONALD FLEURY: Big Fran you remember him?
KEVIN FLEURY: ( beat, thinking ) Uncle Fran? Put peanuts in his Coke so he could drink and eat all at the same time?
RONALD FLEURY: ( smile ) Where he's from in South Carolina that's called fine-dining, Bud.
KEVIN FLEURY: What happened?
RONALD FLEURY: ( beat ) Something bad.
KEVIN: ( impression of his Dad ) `Lotta bad people out there.'
RONALD FLEURY: ( smiles, already homesick ) I love you.
KEVIN FLEURY: You gonna go see him?
RONALD FLEURY: I'm gonna try.
MISS ROSS: Where's your husband going?
LYLA FLEURY: Ex-husband, and God knows.

REX BURR: You gotta stand, Big Man.
FRANCIS MANNER: We need to get everyone back, then get all their-

FLEURY: Glenda, I want you to look at me.
CNN REPORTER: .1 hour ago: blasts in Saudi Arabia, in or around the `Al- Rahmah' western housing complex near Riyadh. More than 100 feared dead, including children. The Saudi Foreign Minister has released a statement calling this a `heinous act possibly committed by .homes to thousands of Westerners and other non-Saudis who work in the Kingdom, there have been several attacks on these compounds in the last five years. As such, they have become very tight in terms of security, with both the Saudi National Guard and police taking command.
BBC REPORTER: .homes to thousands of Westerners and other non-Saudis who work in the Kingdom, there have been several attacks on these compounds in the last five years. As such, they have become very tight in terms of security, with both the Saudi National Guard and police taking command.
MOMENT: Fleury enters, steps to a podium, opens his folder. 50 Agents seated lecture hall-style. Steam from fifth, sixth cups of coffee. Plasma screens behind show still-images of the crime cribbed from Al-Jazeera. Throughout the scene, Fleury constantly refers to a roster of his ERTs.
RONALD FLEURY: Numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+ injured. The target was a softball game. Rumor is the Killers wore Saudi police uniforms. Special Agent Fran Manner was
GRANT SYKES: From the craters, looks like they used a High Explosive. possibly military grade: can't fit that much TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4: they could get it. The third there, God knows.that crater looks like a plane dropped a 500-pounder.
RONALD FLEURY: Obviously a secondary blast after the initial devices used to lure first responders to the scene. Don't know anything about where or what it was yet.
GRANT SYKES: This is how they do it. I already know the answer, but any chance in Hell we get to go over there, use our hands?
RONALD FLEURY: If you already know the answer Adam, why ask the question?
SYKES: We're not seeing this kind of planning and execution anywhere else.these ain't hot-wired artillery shells waiting for Humvees to roll by. These hits are coordinated: planning, timing, and big, broad- daylight balls-
JANET MAYES: ( almost trance-studying Yeah, So. did they all happen during daylight?
AGENT #1: Yes. At least the first parts of the attacks.
JANET MAYES: We had two others.North of Riyadh and the oil thing. What was that?
ADAM LEAVITT: The Refinery. Ras Tenura Yeah, south of Jeddah. Same thing: daylight, suicide bombers. Right?
JANET MAYES: Yeah, south of Jeddah. Same thing: daylight, suicide bombers. Right?
ADAM LEAVITT: RONALD FLEURY ADAM LEAVITT
RONALD FLEURY: This is not new in concept. It is new in scope. It's bigger. Very sophisticated. Command and control was flawless. They found the largest kill zone they could and they did it. they did it by being Any rumors or confirmations of uniforms being used in the other two attacks?
ADAM LEAVITT: Any rumors or confirmations of uniforms being used in the other two attacks?
AGENT #1: ( from memory ) No. I know this is the first for That's `worst case scenario' if you're still asking for my stab, Sir. A crew who can build bombs this big, with this level of eyes- on control and detonation coordination. has access to Saudi uniforms now.I mean.Baby Jesus.
GRANT SYKES: That's `worst case scenario' if you're still asking for my stab, Sir. A crew who can build bombs this big, with this level of eyes- on control and detonation coordination. has access to Saudi uniforms now.I mean.Baby Jesus.
LEAVITT: Anyone take credit?
FLEURY: Abu Hamza. Saudi Al-Qaeda. Bin- Laden-wanna-be. We know he was in Afghanistan, then moved to Iraq. Now he seems to have come home. He's clearly becoming increasingly If it is Hamza, he's definitely turning up the volume over there.
ADAM LEAVITT: If it is Hamza, he's definitely turning up the volume over there.
JANET MAYES: They can't afford to appear as if they are losing any kind of control. They lose control over their country, their people.then they risk losing control over the oil. They won't let us in. No way.
RONALD FLEURY: From the State Department, one hour ago: `We are in agreement with the Saudi security assessment that any additional American presence on Kingdom soil represents reckless risk. Therefore it is the Secretary of State's position that only after the situation has been evaluated and contained, should the Federal Bureau of Investigation activate Rapid Deployment.' The National Security Advisor and the Attorney General agreed. I'm going to get us access. Keep your go bags hot. It's gonna come
ADAM LEAVITT: ( beat ) Well. I guess he's gonna go get us some access. ( beat ) How's he gonna do that?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: Killing those I saw responsible.
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: ( puzzled, angry ) I don't understand.
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: -that is not a crime-
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: It's not.
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: I do not.
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: I am not my brother.
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: I am NOT my brother!
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: General Malik in Haytham's face:
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: I sweat. I'll say it again because it is true. I need more uniforms because I must change during shifts.look at my shirts.
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: -then look at my jackets. Please. Permanent stains.no matter how many times they're cleaned.
HAYTHAM: I love my country.
HAYTHAM: I love my country.
DIRECTOR GRACE: Everyone's terrified, so nothing moves. Paralysis. You and your team aren't going anywhere. And this meeting is just a circle- jerk, Ronnie: Attorney General Young's going to go through the motions because protocol says we get an appeal. We'll be on record, but expect nothing more.
RONALD FLEURY: ( beat ) Yeah, sure. No problem.
DIRECTOR GRACE: ( re: Janet ) What about Agent Mayes?
RONALD FLEURY: Ask her.
DIRECTOR GRACE: ( to Janet ) What about you?
JANET MAYES: I'll be fine.
DIRECTOR GRACE: I apologize if we're late-
GIDEON YOUNG: They were early.
DIRECTOR GRACE: You know Special Agent Fleury?
GIDEON YOUNG: I do.
DIRECTOR GRACE: This is agent Janet Mayes, she's one of our Arabic experts.
GIDEON YOUNG: OK. The latest.
RONALD FLEURY: Two suicide bombers. Rumors they were dressed as Saudi Police. We believe this is the work of Saudi terrorist named Abu Hamza.
GIDEON YOUNG: Go on.
RONALD FLEURY: A Shooter crew served as distraction. After the initial attack there was a lull to allow Saudi Emergency Teams.and our own attaches.to collect. Then a secondary blast was triggered, aimed at those first responders. So they targeted families and rescuers with one attack. I think that's a clear signal that their definition of `Enemy' is My God.
MARICELLA CANAVESIO: My God.
GIDEON YOUNG: Let us never forget how cheap life is over there. Now.I have seven minutes before my next meeting, so who's talking first? You two digested the memo?
ELLIS LEACH: I'll go first if that's okay First, I'm sorry about Fran Manner.
DIRECTOR GRACE: As we are about Rex Burr.
ELLIS LEACH: I met with Prince Thamer at the Saudi embassy fifteen minutes after I heard this morning's news. After speaking with Thamer, I advised we withhold additional US personnel because a big part of the religious justification for these bombs is the presence of current US personnel. More boots on Saudi soil make an already combustible situation more so. I know that's not the answer you want, but.
MARICELLA CANAVESIO: My two cents: The Saudis haven't asked for FBI help. Sounds like they've done just the opposite. If we force the issue, that could further anger an utterly important ally that shares a 1000-mile long border with Iraq.
GIDEON YOUNG: ( to Grace and Fleury ) It's all rock-solid logic.
DIRECTOR GRACE: ( beat ) We would just like to be on record as saying we think we should go
GIDEON YOUNG: That's not going to happen
RONALD FLEURY: Sir, how would you imagine it looks viewed through an FBI agents eyes?
GIDEON YOUNG: Pardon me?
RONALD FLEURY: I'm interested in how you think this situation is viewed through our eyes.
GIDEON YOUNG: It's some variation on vengeance. When one of your own is killed, Agents lose their analytical powers - kind of a greatest strength, greatest weakness thing.
RONALD FLEURY: If I wanted vengeance, I'd have whispered `Rex Burr' into Ellis's ear right when we walked in.
MARICELLA CANAVESIO: What's the distinction?
RONALD FLEURY: To call this massacre an act of terrorism. that implies a specific political agenda. To me, these killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly sociopathic- more like Charles Manson than Osama Bin Laden.
JANET MAYES: ( beat, fuck it: Go ) Al Qaeda lost the first phase of this war, so a new, zero-sum phase has begun: if you won't join us, we'll let loose the truly talented Murderers. Abu Hamza. He will kill so many of you that the resulting humiliation of the Saudi Royal Family will cause an exodus, a rebellion, both. Because the Royal Family simply cannot protect you or yours any longer.
RONALD FLEURY: When she says talented, she's not talking about the walking-bombs who can sneak past any and all security, nor the hi-jackers tough enough to take an airliner. We're talking about the Man who teaches them how.
JANET MAYES: the operational commander who organizes, trains, plans, encourages. That is who we're If we don't get inside Saudi Arabia within 36 hours, there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for Al-Rahmah. None.
RONALD FLEURY: If we don't get inside Saudi Arabia within 36 hours, there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for Al-Rahmah. None.
ELLIS LEACH: Okay. I believe it all. So doesn't your team in that country represent the kind of target one of these `Masters' would die for? Trade ten of their own for one of you?
RONALD FLEURY: To not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying `uncle.'
GIDEON YOUNG: ( chuckle ) That was spirited. let's all thank God Special Agent Fleury doesn't make policy decisions. He'd turn the FBI into Patton's Third
DIRECTOR GRACE: ( to Fleury ) I see the look in your eyes. That look is trouble: old school, play ground shit, vengeance.
RONALD FLEURY: It's not vengeance.
DIRECTOR GRACE: It ain't justice. It's stronger. We've all been there. I have. Vengeance is always dirty, Ronnie.
RONALD FLEURY: I just can't sit this out. I can't watch this not get dealt with. Not Know what my high school football coach used to say to me?
DIRECTOR GRACE: RONALD FLEURY
RONALD FLEURY: "HIT SOMETHING." All night long, Coach Bailey would scream "HIT SOMETHING." Every play.
DIRECTOR GRACE: That's good coaching.
RONALD FLEURY: I'm fixing to go hit something, boss. You with me?
DIRECTOR GRACE: How you gonna do it?
RONALD FLEURY: The Saudis covet good PR as much as their Oil: 15 of 19 hijackers on 9- 11 means most Americans will never stop asking if that Saudi Oil is worth it. It's all about press.
DIRECTOR GRACE: Few more moves and it's Total War, Ronnie. The only time Treason is palatable is when it's done righteously and completely.
JANET MAYES: Oh, I'm in.Not a question. I'm definitely going.
RONALD FLEURY: What's your take?
ELAINE FLOWERS: Looks like every overthrow in history: once the guys with the guns are no longer trustworthy, the government's days are numbered.
RONALD FLEURY: White House call you with a spin?
ELAINE FLOWERS: You kidding? We don't talk since I broke the Vice President's guy cooking dirty intel on Iran. They hate me. What's up, Fleury?
RONALD FLEURY: How hard you gonna hit the Royal Family in your column tomorrow?
ELAINE FLOWERS: With a sledgehammer.
RONALD FLEURY: With the bombings? Or other What's "other" than the bombings?
ELAINE FLOWERS: What's "other" than the bombings?
RONALD FLEURY: I know you're tracking Al Haramain.
ELAINE FLOWERS: Is that what you want to talk about? Saudi officials making donations that end up. What? Blowing up trains in Paris? Buses in London?
RONALD FLEURY: Sometimes. Seems that just might We got some other stuff: Missing girls out of a Houston Four Seasons Hotel that was heavily populated by some "Saudi officials." Little
ELAINE FLOWERS: Murder.Hookers.Houston? Can I take some notes?
RONALD FLEURY: I'm not saying that.
ELAINE FLOWERS: Are you saying anything?
RONALD FLEURY: I need a favor.
ELAINE FLOWERS: I don't do favors, Ronnie.
RONALD FLEURY: When it's real and it will be real. I'll come to you with what we have first. It's yours. You call Thamer at the Embassy. Tell him that the FBI is getting real close to laying out some major Saudi VIP indictments relating to newly uncovered charity financing out of a Boston investment firm. We're gonna freeze a lot of Saudi cash and roll out some major Can I mention Houston?
ELAINE FLOWERS: RONALD FLEURY ELAINE FLOWERS
RONALD FLEURY: You call Thamer at the Embassy. Tell him that the FBI is getting real close to laying out some major Saudi VIP indictments relating to newly uncovered charity financing out of a Boston investment firm.

ELAINE FLOWERS: He won't.

RONALD FLEURY: Tell him that I'm not the nicest kid on the block.
ELAINE FLOWERS: That would be accurate.
RONALD FLEURY: I want fifteen minutes with him Wow. OK. And I get what?
ELAINE FLOWERS: Wow. OK. And I get what?
RONALD FLEURY: I come to you first. No one else.
ELAINE FLOWERS: What's really going on here, Ronnie? You going strong over Fran
RONALD FLEURY: I'm just trying to do my job, Elaine. That's it. Call Thamer.
ELAINE FLOWERS: I'll see what I can do.
RONALD FLEURY: Get back in.
RONALD FLEURY: Too many people we both know were at the bar. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness.
PRINCE THAMER: I had an interesting conversation with a reporter from the Post.
RONALD FLEURY: She can be a bit of an exaggerator. I'm sure things were somewhat over-stated. I see myself as friend of Saudi Arabia. I just need a little cooperation, that's What kind of cooperation??
PRINCE THAMER: What kind of cooperation??
RONALD FLEURY: Full cooperation: my Team cleared to land at Prince Sultan Air Base. Tomorrow. We want to help in a very muscular way, quickly.
PRINCE THAMER: Next month would be as soon as.
RONALD FLEURY: This goes one of two ways. First: The FBI with the White House go on the kind of aggressive PR "Saudi Royal Family Decaying Monarchy" bender that just can't help but hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care how many Chinese are lined up to buy the oil. You know it's gonna My family is not decaying-
PRINCE THAMER: My family is not decaying-
RONALD FLEURY: And then we bring the hammer down hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we got direct links from Riyadh - two wives donating ten million to three Arab-American cultural centers in Boston. Then what gets kind of not- funny is how some of that cash found its way to Jakarta and some Mosques that have these training camps built right next to them. It's kinda funny. you got little kids playing over here, and some not so little kids playing with guns over here. That's kinda odd.
PRINCE THAMER: You have no proof of this.
RONALD FLEURY: We're getting there, Sir. And I haven't even brought up the two girls still missing out of Houston. This is big. It is real. And I know you only care so much about public American opinion, Sir. But the story will be covered. Big. And this ain't the Metro section. It's above the fold, just below the date. Words like these get syndicated to papers like the Omaha World-Herald, The Terrell Tribune You ever been to Terrell, Texas?
PRINCE THAMER: What is your point?
RONALD FLEURY: Last I heard, 112 people lost their lives in your country. One of them was a good friend of mine. I want in and I want in immediately.
PRINCE THAMER: Define "immediately."
RONALD FLEURY: Right now immediately.
FLEURY: If your phone doesn't work international, you can borrow mine.
PRINCE THAMER: ( trying to maintain cool ) We cannot allow 100 agents-
RONALD FLEURY: -4. With a 25-man security detail-
PRINCE THAMER: -even 25 more armed Americans could spark rebellion-
RONALD FLEURY: That's too bad.
PRINCE THAMER: Saudi Security. That's non negotiable. You cannot bring guns into the Kingdom.
RONALD FLEURY: Men in Saudi Police uniforms are why we're talking now.
PRINCE THAMER: They would be hand picked.
RONALD FLEURY: Whose hands?
PRINCE THAMER: Fleury blinks.
FLEURY: If anything happens to me or my team. It's on you. Understood?
PRINCE THAMER: Cool it with the John Wayne, Mr.
RONALD FLEURY: -seven-day or work-week?
PRINCE THAMER: Work week. Five days. No guns.
HAYTHAM'S FATHER: What happened?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: You haven't heard about the attack?
HAYTHAM'S FATHER: I choose not to listen anymore. What happened to your face?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: ( beat ) An attack today.
HAYTHAM'S FATHER: Look at me.
ADAM LEAVITT: ( beat, re: Janet ) What was Fran Manner to her?
GRANT SYKES: He taught her how to shoot, she taught him most everything else. Celebrated graduation at the IHOP in-town until some Townie called Janet something.Something not very nice. Townie didn't see Fran coming outta the Head. But he definitely felt Fran's uppercut shatter his jaw.
ADAM LEAVITT: Fran didn't get bounced for that?
GRANT SYKES: SAC Fleury took care of him.
ADAM LEAVITT: GRANT SYKES
GRANT SYKES: If I knew how I'd be SAC Sykes. I do know the post in Riyadh was part of the deal Fleury cut to save Fran's career.
ADAM LEAVITT: ( beat ) What did SAC Fleury whisper in your ear this morning?
JANET MAYES: ( smart-ass smile ) `Grant's age is a liability.'
FLEURY: Thanks for volunteering.
LEAVITT: Actually, I didn't volunteer.
FLEURY: Thanks anyway.
LEAVITT: We're going to Riyadh?
FLEURY: State department said yes?

LEAVITT: Anybody said yes?
FLEURY: Not really.
LEAVITT: Are we bringing security?
FLEURY: Fleury walks onto the plane. Leaving the three on the tarmac.
LEAVITT: This is going to suck so bad.
ADAM LEAVITT: What can four people do in five days? Really?
GRANT SYKES: Aren't you the one who demanded to go this morning?
ADAM LEAVITT: I meant the FBI. I didn't mean
GRANT SYKES: JANET MAYES GRANT SYKES
JANET MAYES: I'll be looked at with what I can only describe as disdain, pretty much the entire time we're on the ground. kind of like South Go easy on my kin.
GRANT SYKES: Go easy on my kin.
JANET MAYES: It's a very confused culture. Extremely religious. Had nothing; wanted nothing. Sixty years ago, they hit oil. Simple religious men become trillionaires. a schizophrenic nation is born. The royal family, who we back, and everyone else.
GRANT SYKES: What's going on in there?
RONALD FLEURY: ( getting his bearings ) I'm good.
GRANT SYKES: Feels like you got a beast in there, Fleury.
RONALD FLEURY: ( beat ) I'm good
GRANT SYKES: "Good" is 6:00 am Sunday morning when your kid climbs into your bed, buries himself into you. sun's creeping through the windows - soft. Birds and wind-chimes. that's "good."
RONALD FLEURY: I'm OK.You don't think I'm OK?
GRANT SYKES: ( small smile ) I think you're not entirely clear right now. That's OK, but you got to know that. You want to go - we go. I got you, but you got to check yourself.
RONALD FLEURY: I'm checked.
GRANT SYKES: OK. I'm just checking that you
RONALD FLEURY: How we doing?

RONALD FLEURY: They gonna let us land?
PILOT #1: We've been talking to them about an hour or so. they know we're You don't mind my asking, but what the hell you all gonna be doing down there?

RONALD FLEURY: PILOT #1
PILOT #1: Hunting.? I think of hunting, I think quail in Tennessee, deer in Pennsylvania. What kind of hunting you all gonna do in Saudi?
RONALD FLEURY: Big Game hunting.
RONALD FLEURY: Heads on a swivel.
RONALD FLEURY: Special Agent Ronald Fleury.
JANET MAYES: We brought our own.
ADAM LEAVITT: Israeli stamp in my passport?
GRANT SYKES: And I usually just toss it on the kitchen table.

ADAM LEAVIIT: 110 miles per hour. How do you keep so calm? I mean, really? Is it breathing
JANET MAYES: RONALD FLEURY
RONALD FLEURY: If somebody was tailing us it'd be obvious. This is just standard operating speed.
US?: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
RONALD FLEURY: You don't know what you missed. you should have seen him play for our Chicago Bulls.
GRANT SYKES: You have portable lights on-scene?
GRANT SYKES: We only have seven days: we work around the clock.
GRANT SYKES: We're safe during the day?
ADAM LEAVITT: ( smartass ) I don't like camels.
RONALD FLEURY: Colonel, do you believe Abu Hamza was responsible for this attack?
RONALD FLEURY: Were Saudi Police involved in the We don't know that either.
RONALD FLEURY: Any word on what that third big blast was?
GRANT SYKES: You interviewed witnesses?
GRANT SYKES: Were any of the uniformed bombers
RONALD FLEURY: You don't know the source of the blast, don't know if your own Officers were involved, but you won't let us work nights?
DIRECTOR GRACE: Good afternoon, Sir.
GIDEON YOUNG: `Sunlight is indeed the most powerful disinfectant.
DIRECTOR GRACE: Senators? Then I'd change `outmoded' to `outdated,' `echelons' to `ranks' and what in God's name is `contretemps?' These guys aren't the best and brightest-
GIDEON YOUNG: -never take the Lord's name in vain in this office-
DIRECTOR GRACE: -but you can say `Fucking?'
GIDEON YOUNG: -you really want to bet?
DIRECTOR GRACE: I do.
JANET MAYES: That's one of the great horrors of television: Crime scene manipulation. They say a TV camera adds pounds to actresses. Isn't that what they say?
ADAM LEAVITT: Who's "they?"
JANET MAYES: That is what they say. Doesn't add to crime scenes. Television cameras shrink them. Misrepresent. No smells. Poor sound. Limited view. TV always makes them look smaller. You can't feel the hatred on
FLEURY: .heads on a swivel, people.
JANET MAYES: Janet notices the nasty marks around Haytham's right ear.
FLEURY: What time tomorrow morning?
RONALD FLEURY: What time is sunrise?
GRANT SYKES: That's against fire code.
JANET MAYES: They don't have fire codes. They don't have codes other than codes of war. They'll lock us in and dial up some kind of earth movers if they want to. You know that, Sykes. Dig a big hole and push us in. Fill it up and no one comes calling. You're in the jungle now, baby.
ADAM LEAVITT: ( smiling ) You alright, girl?
JANET MAYES: Watch it, boy.
ADAM LEAVITT: Just asking.

RONALD FLEURY: Hey. How are you? How's my boy?
LYLA FLEURY: We're just fine. How are you? Where are you?
RONALD FLEURY: I'm here. Lemme talk to my boy.
FLEURY: What you doing?
FLEURY: I'm missing you.
FLEURY: I'm in Saudi Arabia.
FLEURY: Yeah. I saw him.
FLEURY: Yeah. Yeah.he's still tall.
FLEURY: Yeah, buddy. I love you. Keep your eye on your mama. Be the man.
FLEURY: I'll call you tomorrow. I love you.
SCHMIDT: ( big smile ) You are in so much trouble.
FLEURY: Is that right?
SCHMIDT: For sure. I mean, I don't know how you did it. Nice work, but if you live through this, which I put at about fifty percent - if you do, your balls are gonna get stretched and beaten on. Dig that?
SCHMIDT: Nice pictures. You guys ready to go home now?
GRANT SYKES: Slow roll. gonna be like when you go deep sea fishing in Florida and you pay seven hundred bucks for the boat and you sit in the ocean for hours and the crew jumps around and screams and points and you think your constantly about to bag a Marlin but you never do and they keep pointing and jumping and-
FLEURY: Haytham walks off by himself, shaking off the shady Royal photo vibe, looking back at the Americans. From behind him:
POLICE OFFICER: You're willing to die to protect your enemy?
RONALD FLEURY: What did the Prince say?
RONALD FLEURY: What rules?
RONALD FLEURY: That's not accurate
ADAM LEAVITT: ( to Fleury ) How could they get more secure?
SYKES: Well, this is going well.
FLEURY: Saudi Slow Roll.
JANET MAYES: KINGDOM 8/18/06 63.
LEAVITT: How do you do that?
JANET MAYES: Don't say `good' again.
LEAVITT: Don't say `good' again.
JANET: Fleury with Sykes still standing in the same spot. Looks up: Al-Ghazi coming into the building. Fleury ready to vent until something surprises him: breathless, Al-Ghazi has broken a wide-sweat hustling back to the Americans. Fleury's face relaxes. He pulls a bottle of water out of a cooler, hands it to Al-Ghazi.
FLEURY: ( to Sykes, himself ) Of course we won't.
FLEURY: I would have thought your primary concern was investigating a crime.
SYKES: ( to Fleury ) I think it's one of those "something happens to us. his head comes off" kind of deals. ( to Al-Ghazi ) Is it one of those kind of deals,
FLEURY: So, if you're not running the investigation.who is? The National Guard's Military Police Brigade is conducting the investigation. My orders begin and end with your health.
ADAM LEAVITT: I thought the SANG were soldiers
RONALD FLEURY: Who is in charge of the investigation then?
RONALD FLEURY: To walk through? Are you kidding I am not.
RONALD FLEURY: Get him over here now and let's clarify this situation.
RONALD FLEURY: There sure as hell is! I don't know what kind of game you're playing but you got the wrong guy, Colonel Al-Ghazi! That was not the deal-
RONALD FLEURY: KINGDOM 8/18/06 66.
FLEURY: I'm guessing there are a bunch of Americans, Brits. Australians? Someone must have seen something. I'm sure they're just dying to talk to you guys, seeing as how the killers were wearing your uniforms. That must be a real confidence booster for them.
EARL: There's still a couple of hundred of us living on the compound.
RONALD FLEURY: Why Saudi Arabia?
EARL: Neither of us did anymore schooling than Electra High, Electra Texas.
RONALD FLEURY: Al-Ghazi sees Janine smile, squeeze Earl's hand tighter.
EARL: And the jobs here pay twice what you'd make in Midland or the Gulf a' Mexico. Plus the house is free.
JANINE RIPON: I call it combat pay. This place has gone Guns - Guns - Guns.
RONALD FLEURY: So has Everyone else now.
JANINE: My girlfriends in Texas spend their combat pay on diamonds. I spent mine on a safe room.
RONALD FLEURY: ( chuckles ) Two nights back. Can you start one second before you knew anything was We didn't really see anything. Just hit the ground and hustled to the safe room. Closed our eyes and prayed. It was so fast. So loud.
JANINE: We didn't really see anything. Just hit the ground and hustled to the safe room. Closed our eyes and prayed. It was so fast. So loud.
RONALD FLEURY: So you really didn't see anything.
MADDY: I hit the deck. Horrible.
JANINE: Not `til after. Just the screams
EARL: the kids. they were screaming. That got me out of the house. Those Which kids were those?
FLEURY: Which kids were those?
JANINE: The Jackson kids. Tracy Jackson next door was murdered looking out her window.front of her children. No safe room over there. Not even the Men that did this should die in front a' their
RONALD FLEURY: She live with her husband?
EARL: RONALD FLEURY ( beat )
RONALD FLEURY: ( beat ) If I'm facing your house, is the Jackson home to the right or left?
JANINE: Fleury looks out the window towards the Jackson house.
RONALD FLEURY: Mr. Aaron Jackson?
AARON JACKSON: ( re: Al-Ghazi ) Get him away from me-
RONALD FLEURY: -easy, Sir. He's a friend to us-
AARON JACKSON: -I don't know either one a' you.
RONALD FLEURY: I'm Special Agent Ronald Fleury of the FBI. This is Colonel Al-Ghazi with the Saudi State Police-
AARON JACKSON: -the Police: they attacked.
RONALD FLEURY: Can I come back?
AARON JACKSON: ( too loud )
WHY?: RONALD FLEURY
RONALD FLEURY: Your boys.
AARON JACKSON: When my wife's jaw was shot off in front of our sons? My sons who sat with her while she bled to death? Couldn't speak because she didn't have the bottom of her face and I wasn't home and my baby boys are destroyed for life and my five year- old had a box of band-aids in his hand when I finally got home?
RONALD FLEURY: .I won't pretend to know.
AARON JACKSON: Kill everyone that had something to do with this. Everyone related to them. Everyone who knew them. And all you'd be doing is their recruiting for them. It's an entire generation: not small and isolated like they say. But a generation that thinks what they did to my wife, to my children, is a "calling".
RONALD FLEURY: Up the street, there was a wreck, did you see any-
AARON JACKSON: -notice how it wouldn't take a lot to disguise your friend as a Mexican? Think he couldn't handle crossing our deserts? Look
RONALD FLEURY: AARON JACKSON ( explodes )
AARON JACKSON: ( explodes )
RONALD FLEURY: ( to Al-Ghazi ) Can we tour the compound? Can we please do that?
JANET MAYES: He or she almost made it.
FLEURY: That's what makes this a War.
ADAM LEAVITT: Hit a water main?
GRANT SYKES: ( eyes on Fleury ) Hole is the case. See, there's "evidence" down in that hole. You understand evidence? Little things that are "clues." Clues can be very helpful to a fella when he's trying to solve a crime.
GRANT SYKES: Glad to hear it. So can we get in
GRANT SYKES: Fleury is taking in the entire crime scene. He notices a four story building half a mile off the perimeter. He watches Al-Ghazi rip at a chunk of floorboard wedged into the mud, bag it himself, search for someone to give it too. Nobody. Sets it down. Stands, wipes his hands hard on his pants. Fleury could swear the dirt stains are intentional: trying to feel like he's doing something.
ADAM LEAVITT: ( to Fleury ) A little high.
FLEURY: ( to SANG, "Lower," in Watt-tee fuck ( alt: "Watt-tee hell." ) is his gun doing up so ( to Fleury ) This vehicle was stolen. Two drivers murdered. A team outside the blast-radius.shooting at anything. Everyone. ( beat ) Sergeant Haytham ended this part.
ADAM LEAVITT: Watt-tee fuck ( alt: "Watt-tee hell." ) is his gun doing up so This vehicle was stolen. Two drivers murdered. A team outside the blast-radius.shooting at anything. Everyone. Sergeant Haytham ended this part.
ADAM LEAVITT: ( to Al-Ghazi ) Are the Shooters in-custody-
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: So Sergeant Haytham speaks English.
FLEURY: Were any of these shooters your
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: Fleury's thinking, looking into the car. Searching the horizon, he spots a distant apartment building providing a view of the crime scene.
FLEURY: They got into the compound. Somehow.took control of this vehicle. I'm guessing they didn't politely ask whoever was in this car if they could take it for a little ride?
FLEURY: I understand that. Those men were your men
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: they were. They were Police.
FLEURY: I'm sorry.
JANET MAYES: Good news is that if he shoots you, he's gonna shoot you sitting on an American tank. with an American- made bullet. So, it's kind of "all in the family."
ADAM LEAVITT: How about we get into those American Suburbans. with their American A/C.
FLEURY: The car was parked here?
FLEURY: Backed in?
FLEURY: They were attacked from the front. Must have assumed the killers were fellow officers. Have any of these men been identified?
JANET MAYES: The same Mosque is enough to identify them, link them to a cell?
ADAM LEAVITT: KINGDOM 8/18/06 76.
JANET MAYES: Suweidi is a known militant stonghold. Al-Qaeda could recruit from storefronts.
FLEURY: Can we go to check out some of these surrounding buildings?
FLEURY: Seems reasonable that the Planner had to observe and based on Hamza's past history, it's consistent that he would want to video the attack. Is that true? Is that accurate?
RONALD FLEURY: Well, in order to video, in order to observe, you need a view.
FLEURY: That building sees all three crime
ADAM LEAVITT: -c'mon now. This is insane: we got enough security to invade Suweidi, let alone that building-
FLEURY: ( to Al-Ghazi, respectful ) Could you ask?
FLEURY: -time. I understand.
JANET MAYES: This is the kind of radical circumstance that could have seriously upped Shaq's free throw percentages. Take a man. Ship him off to Riyadh. No phones, constant threat of death, no girls, no hip hop. Nothing. just free throws. Shaq, he'd be shooting at least seventy percent. Lakers would still be together. Kobe and Shaq lovers
LEAVITT: Hey, Boss. check this out.
SANG OFFICER: This is unacceptable.
JANET MAYES: Tell me it didn't burst-tell me it didn't burst-
WHO FIRED?: That Soldier's hand goes up sheepish. Two men out of the Humvee's backseat break him down, face first in the dirt: cuff him, lock him in the vehicle.
AND WHY?: SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER ( standing, doubled over )
FLEURY: You've seen the images of the attack posted on the internet?
FLEURY: Look for yourself.
RONALD FLEURY: Formed the plan up here: saw everything he could hit. Way too pretty a' plan to have been fully hatched on just one visit. He came here a couple times.
FLEURY: I see.
RONALD FLEURY: ( refocusing ) Two big answers in two small minutes. Imagine if we had a couple days together.
RONALD FLEURY: And I imagine that will run until I had televisions delivered to your quarters to pass the downtime.
FLEURY: You want to tell her that?
ADAM LEAVITT: Big wall.
ADAM LEAVITT: How many Princes are there?
RONALD FLEURY: They all get palaces this big?
ADAM LEAVITT: Who pays for all this?
GRANT SYKES: General Motors, Ford, Chevrolet.
ADAM LEAVITT: Hey, man - I drive a Hybrid.
ADAM LEAVITT: ( to Grant: genuine worry ) What's a Raptor?
ADAM LEAVITT: KINGDOM 8/18/06 85.
RONALD FLEURY: I do.
RONALD FLEURY: I've seen that the man who planned the worst crime in your Kingdom's history is without a doubt Saudi.
GRANT SYKES: That was impressive.
RONALD FLEURY: Think it will work?
GRANT SYKES: Yeah. Maybe. I mean, you can only play the "I'm going to the press card" like three more times. So, They're paranoid and overly self- They aren't protecting anyone. There's no conspiracy. They're just terrified. Finally. The Saudis have finally seen the Monsters they helped create, because those Monsters have come home. And if Saudis don't catch Saudi Monsters, that's the end.
RONALD FLEURY: They're paranoid and overly self- They aren't protecting anyone. There's no conspiracy. They're just terrified. Finally. The Saudis have finally seen the Monsters they helped create, because those Monsters have come home. And if Saudis don't catch Saudi Monsters, that's the end.
DAMON SCHMIDT: They aren't protecting anyone. There's no conspiracy. They're just terrified. Finally. The Saudis have finally seen the Monsters they helped create, because those Monsters have come home. And if Saudis don't catch Saudi Monsters, that's the end.
GRANT SYKES: impressive. That's why they're making it hard on us, and that's why he wants to help `em turn the are falling down, they had satellite dishes bolted on?

DAMON SCHMIDT: RONALD FLEURY DAMON SCHMIDT
RONALD FLEURY: DAMON SCHMIDT
DAMON SCHMIDT: are falling down, they had satellite dishes bolted on?
RONALD FLEURY: DAMON SCHMIDT
DAMON SCHMIDT: Credit? If the Saudis cracked this Cell while these servants were pouring coffee, Al-Jazeera still leads the story with your Team.
RONALD FLEURY: DAMON SCHMIDT RONALD FLEURY
DAMON SCHMIDT: RONALD FLEURY
RONALD FLEURY: work of real Talent. The kind that doesn't stop until it's forced.
DAMON SCHMIDT: good intentions.
RONALD FLEURY: DAMON SCHMIDT ( genuine smile ) ( smile vanishing )
DAMON SCHMIDT: ( genuine smile ) Beats hell outta visa-stamping. ( smile vanishing )
RONALD FLEURY: By catching Abu Hamza.
DAMON SCHMIDT: Then here's to you. Let's bet: when this Colonel Al-Ghazi comes out, he's in-charge of the investigation -if so, you set me up on a date with Janet Mayes.
RONALD FLEURY: ( to Leavitt ) Do me a favor and tell Janet that she and Damon Schmidt got a date when he gets back to the States.
RONALD FLEURY: We should start with the dead They had no identification on them. Fingerprints and dental have come up empty.
RONALD FLEURY: Can we photograph all three of them? Couple hundred copies each.
RONALD FLEURY: Good. If it's OK with you, I'd like to suggest we split up as Sykes climbs down into the mud hole.
GRANT SYKES: ( from the crater ) Fellas, what we want to do is get this water out of here. see what's really going on. Understand?
GRANT SYKES: ( to the Saudis ) Got to get a little dirty, people. Crawl up in it. Make deep contact. You get that?
RONALD FLEURY: Have him pass these out to the compound security. See if anybody knows them.
RONALD FLEURY: Would you mind doing one more thing for me?
EARL: No, Sir.
RONALD FLEURY: Could you tell me if you recognize any of these men?
JANINE: A few moments, then:
EARL: I don't know any of them.
FLEURY: I'm just wondering. That chair out side. Looks like it gets a lot of wear. Looks comfortable.
EARL: That my mom's chair.
FLEURY: See, that's exactly what I was thinking. I'm guessing she spends a lot of time sitting outside?
EARL: All day.
FLEURY: She must pretty much see it all. She does.
EARL: She does.
FLEURY: Where is she?
EARL: She's sleeping.
FLEURY: Let's wake her up.
MADDY: I've seen him.
RONALD FLEURY: Maddy thinking.
MADDY: Like, a week ago. Twice I've seen him. Watering.With the garden crews. I remember he was wearing a Liza Minnelli T-shirt. I thought that was funny.
RONALD FLEURY: What about the others?
MADDY: ( closer examination ) No. Just him. I remember the T- shirt. I remember thinking it was What, the Liza Minelli shirt?
RONALD FLEURY: What, the Liza Minelli shirt?
MADDY: No. I do think Liza Minelli's gone odd, but that wasn't it.
RONALD FLEURY: What was odd?
MADDY: He was a Saudi. The gardener.
RONALD FLEURY: Saudis, like Americans, don't do manual labor. Blowing leaves is beneath them.
MADDY: Saudis, like Americans, don't do manual labor. Blowing leaves is beneath them.
RONALD FLEURY: ( to Maddy ) Thank you.
EARL: Who is he?
RONALD FLEURY: That's one of the many things we're trying to find out.
RUN!: Freaked, the aide about jumps out of his skin.starts 92A EXT. BLAST SIGHT - DAY 92A Sykes has a SAUDI WORK CREW digging in the hole, pulling out pieces of charred metal. He is slowly laying out the pieces and studying them like a puzzle, trying to figure out what the hell blew up.
RONALD FLEURY: ( beat ) How are your Sons?
AARON JACKSON: -what do you know about what my kids need? What they saw? What the rest of their lives might be like?
RONALD FLEURY: ( beat ) I thought maybe your Boys.without their Mom anymore.might ask you why sometime.
AARON JACKSON: ( beat ) Tomorrow it'll be somebody else's
RONALD FLEURY: Then tomorrow I'll come back.
RONALD FLEURY: We know where he lives?
RONALD FLEURY: You don't seem very excited.
RONALD FLEURY: COLONEL AL-GHAZI
SYKES: It's a gurney.
GRANT SYKES: Sykes slogs over. He drops to his knees, reaches his hand in, all the way to his shoulder, the side of his face to the water: void. Out of the crater, Sykes points to a Bobcat earth-mover, in Arabic:
HAYTHAM: You cannot touch any Muslims.
JANET: No problem. Can I still touch Of course.
HAYTHAM: Of course.
FLEURY: What's gas running a gallon out here, Al-Ghazi? Penny gallon?
RONALD FLEURY: A trillion reasons for our Leaders to hold hands another one hundred A trillion reasons to keep fighting. For both sides of this I think our oil has begun destroying more than it creates.
RONALD FLEURY: KINGDOM 8/18/06 99.
RONALD FLEURY: Yes, I do. Is your first name `Colonel?'
FLEURY: ( half joking to Al-Ghazi ) Feel like I'm back home in Detroit.
RONALD FLEURY: ( beat ) OK. Shouldn't we arrest him or shoot him or something?
RONALD FLEURY: This place is community service?
RONALD FLEURY: Why did he turn himself in?
RONALD FLEURY: ( through Al-Ghazi ) How does he know he slept soundly?
RONALD FLEURY: ( through Al-Ghazi ) Is that why you quit?
FLEURY: How do they get them?
FLEURY: Could Hamza get this equipment?
RONALD FLEURY: ( through Al-Ghazi ) How do we find him?
RONALD FLEURY: ( to Al-Ghazi ) Well, I think I get the `prayer' and `luck' parts.
GRANT SYKES: Whatever this is, it blasted-off like NASA.
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: Driven in at an angle. go
GRANT SYKES: `High-order explosion' doesn't do it justice: what's left a' this looks like it was put through a
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: ( to Sykes ) Hospital Identification. Ambulance identification.
GRANT SYKES: Do you know this hospital?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: GRANT SYKES
GRANT SYKES: Call it in.
RONALD FLEURY: COLONEL AL-GHAZI RONALD FLEURY ( focused; to Al-Ghazi )
RONALD FLEURY: ( focused; to Al-Ghazi ) What you got?
RONALD FLEURY: Al-Ghazi reaches for the photo of the dead shooter/attacker.
RONALD FLEURY: Where's Muaath?
GRANT SYKES: We never get to do anything fun.
JANET MAYES: Sykes, I'm guessing you don't even remember how to load your gun.
GRANT SYKES: That's not funny.
ADAM LEAVITT: She's not trying to be funny.
GRANT SYKES: I'm a very good shot.
JANET MAYES: I'm sure.
GRANT SYKES: Prints are on the other side.
RONALD FLEURY: Janet makes her way back. Immediately moves to the wounded SWAT Officer.
JANET MAYES: ( distracted ) Yeah. I pulled so much it's hard to remember it all.

JANET MAYES: KINGDOM 8/18/06 109.
RONALD FLEURY: ( calling back )
GRANT SYKES: Al-Ghazi dumps desk drawers: pictures of government-looking buildings, walled-compounds. Lays them out in rows, studying each. Leavitt appears, focuses on the C-4 immediately.
ADAM LEAVITT: ( beat ) The Coalition.
JANET MAYES: -the Prince's Convoy just showed.
RONALD FLEURY: This is bullshit. You know it. Meaningless. There's no leader here. These are kids. That's it.
JANET MAYES: We're out of here.
RONALD FLEURY: Yes, that's it. Smile for the cameras, body-bag some children. Wrap it up, but us out. I get I'm sorry.
RONALD FLEURY: You need water?
ADAM LEAVITT: You really ought not look at this.
DAMON SCHMIDT: ( pointing at the dead ) That fella got shot right through his God damn nipple.
JANET MAYES: Don't stare too long. It'll start living in your dreams.
DAMON SCHMIDT: No I know.
RONALD FLEURY: You do? How did you know we were here?
DAMON SCHMIDT: The Prince has Men at Al-Rahmah.
DAMON SCHMIDT: Ask him. 3 vehicles will stay behind when the Prince and Press leave. You'll convoy straight to BA flights into Dulles last minute fares come out of your budget, by-the-by. Tried to swing upgrades, but check at the counter.
RONALD FLEURY: -Ellis Leach?
DAMON SCHMIDT: You know him? He's gonna be put out to pasture: made an example of by the President to ensure all levels of government get tough on Terror. You won the hand on the River card.
RONALD FLEURY: We didn't win shit, Schmidt. These are teenagers. children with pictures that someone far senior has provided them.
DAMON SCHMIDT: -kidding me? You mean those are Terrorist targets? Holy Wow. Momma, don't let your children grow up to be cowboys. Just get ready to go home and revel in the fact that for the next few weeks your shit won't stink.
RONALD FLEURY: ( beat ) Yes, Sir. We're all here and healthy. I'm sitting next to their corpses but this may not be over. These don't feel like anything resembling senior leadership- ( beat ) -thank you Sir. I do.
RONALD FLEURY: ( to Al-Gahzi ) What do you think?
RONALD FLEURY: A beat.
GRANT SYKES: I'm thinking about going straight to Dan's, gonna order six PBRs-
JANET MAYES: ADAM LEAVITT
ADAM LEAVITT: Keep it real. You ever drink PBR, Any beer?
HAYTHAM: GRANT SYKES
GRANT SYKES: Any beer?
HAYTHAM: ( small smile ) Now.that's just unreasonable. Good Police work and problem drinking are like a chicken and egg thing: which enables the other?
GRANT SYKES: Now.that's just unreasonable. Good Police work and problem drinking are like a chicken and egg thing: which enables the other?
RONALD FLEURY: ( to Al-Ghazi ) Remember how we caught that cell?
RONALD FLEURY: Four hundred dollars. For four hundred dollars, he was caught. Stupidity. Catching the cell was easy. Just like this. The cell came
GRANT SYKES: I'm serious. Beer will open up your subconscious. Canned beer especially. Give you instincts they can't teach- Is he responding to the call? Dropped back.
RONALD FLEURY: ( looking back ) Is he responding to the call? Dropped back.
RONALD FLEURY: You whole?
ADAM LEAVITT: Think so-
RONALD FLEURY: WHAT THE-
JANET MAYES: ( panicked )
RONALD FLEURY: Trailing Suburban accelerates away now, as Janet struggles out. Haytham's 9 MM in-hand racked open: empty. Fleury steps away from the now black smoke pouring from the vehicle in the passenger seat of the trail Suburban, he sees the Officer that checked passports at Prince Sultan Air Base.

SERGEANT HAYTHAM: They're going to disappear.
RONALD FLEURY: ( back to his crew )
GET DOWN!: KINGDOM 8/18/06 119.
DOWN!: Fleury's view blocked by fleeing Saudis: just intermittent flashes of the Mercedes braking hard, massive dust cloud behind them, sliding toward the opening Fleury pre-sighted. Intermittent wild shots fired from the SUV, vaguely in our Fleury flips a switch on the left side of the rifle, just forward of the handle: full-auto. Takes a deep, measured Sniper's breath, eases the stock snug aimpoint up to his right eye, and without hesitation lets loose the entire clip perfectly: one heartbeat before the Mercedes hits the gap. The right side of the Mercedes shreds just as it appears. Fleury's clip gone in a flash, yet more rounds still hit the Mercedes: Al-Ghazi four feet away, firing his own salvo from a knee. Something bright red pops against the driver's side window now, the Mercedes rip-slides to a stop. Commotion inside. Wild, half-aimed shots back at us. Then it starts up again. Al-Ghazi bolts toward the line of stopped traffic. Searching for something big, empty, still running. Fleury right on his heels.
SYKES: Nobody's gonna hurt Leavitt but me.
THE SON: ( in Arabic, frantic )
MERCEDES DRIVER: ( Arabic ) He's been shot! BE READY.
PASSPORT OFFICER: NOW. HURRY.
RONALD FLEURY: BRAKES-REVERSE-TO THE RIGHT.
GRANT SYKES: -GET OUT OF-
FLEURY: MOB FORMING NEXT BLOCK!
DRIVER: Just as the 32 year-old nods yes, Leavitt explodes with his last bit of effort: kicks just enough to nudge the Camera, trying to knock it over. The 32 year-old gets his hands on it as it falls, almost catches it, slips out, smacks the ground, battery pops off. The Driver and Huge Man both begin hammering Adam.

RONALD FLEURY: Empties his clip into that vicinity: windows shatter, wood splinters. The grenade launcher recedes. Janet and Al-Ghazi start to run. The launcher fires from its new position.The trail suburban DETONATES. Al-Ghazi and Janet knocked flat on their asses for second and third times: dazed. Fleury searching: I know that Fuck with the RPG is reloading, how do I kill him. Drops the bag off his shoulders, pulls a grenade out, fires it as hard as he can: 40 yards on the fly. Bounces just on the third floor landing-

RONALD FLEURY: The 15 year-old steps to the doorway, pulls the trigger again: the cheap 9MM jams. Janet lifts up with her AK, aims it at the boy's chest.

If they ask if we've talked about this, the answer is unequivocally "No." OK? You did outstanding work over there. I'm proud of you. You hold your heads high.
RONALD FLEURY: Grace turns to leave. Fleury gets up to follow. They head down the hallway.
