FRIGHT NIGHT: Written by Tom Holland
FINAL DRAFT: Sep 6th, 1984
V: The CAMERA PAUSES TO STARE AT the Dandrige house, so dif- ferent in look and feel from all the other houses on the street. It's huge, almost forboding, its windows dark and vacant, its lawn overgrown and weed-infested, a home that has obviously been untended for a long time, unlived in and uncared for. However the "For Sale" on the lawn has a "Sold" sign just beneath it. The CAMERA PANS to the Brewster house next door, still SEARCHING for those voices. It's in sharp contrast to the Dandrige house, newly painted, its lawn neatly shorn, a house almost dwarfed in comparison to the Dandrige house, but a happy home, its windows lit and smiling out warmly at the night. The voices seem to be coming from the Brewster house, spe- cifically from a dark second-story window that is open to the night breeze.
5 OMITTED: 6 INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the window, past the billowing drapes to find itself staring at a TV, the flickering screen the only light in the room.
AMY: Charley, Peter Vincent's on.
CHARLEY: ( fumbling with the bra ) Forget Peter Vincent.
AMY: But you love him.
CHARLEY: I love you more Behind them, the station break segues into a commercial, a bunch of kids singing and dancing joyfully to a Coca-Cola commercial. On the floor, Charley finally gets Amy's bra undone. That's it for her; she twists away.
AMY: Charley, stop it. Be doesn't listen, going for her again, their finger fight- ing behind her back, hers trying to get the bra resnapped, his trying to keep it undone and get her blouse off at the same time. She suddenly pushes him away, really hard this Charley, I said stop it. Charley rolls over, leaping to his feet, frustrated as Jesus, give me a break, Amy. We've been going together almost a year and all I hear is "Charley, stop it!"' They stare at each other angrily, both of them breathing hard, their young hormones roiling inside them. Then they look away, not wanting to see the other's anger, staring at the TV for lack of any better place to look.
AMY: Charley, I said stop it. Charley rolls over, leaping to his feet, frustrated as Jesus, give me a break, Amy. We've been going together almost a year and all I hear is "Charley, stop it!"' They stare at each other angrily, both of them breathing hard, their young hormones roiling inside them. Then they look away, not wanting to see the other's anger, staring at the TV for lack of any better place to look.
CHARLEY: Jesus, give me a break, Amy. We've been going together almost a year and all I hear is "Charley, stop it!"' They stare at each other angrily, both of them breathing hard, their young hormones roiling inside them. Then they look away, not wanting to see the other's anger, staring at the TV for lack of any better place to look.
CHARLEY: I'm sorry, Amy. She rises, both of them standing by the open window, staring at each other.
AMY: Me, too. ( she puts a hand out, touching his arm ) I'm just scared, that's all. He nods understandingly, touched by her honesty and inno- cence, his basic decency winning out over his lust. Sud- denly she steps into his arms, kissing him as she never has before. She breaks, staring up into his face nervously.
AMY: ( SOFTLY )
CHARLEY: ( staring at her, stunned ) You mean it? She nods, stepping into his arms again, kissing him like he's never been kissed before, the two of them slowly turn- ing, Charley seeing the TV first with its grave digger scene, then the wall, and finally out the window over Amy's And he freezes. There, below in the side yard, he sees two shadowy figures carrying what looks very much like a coffin toward the storm doors to the Dandrige house next door. His mouth drops open as Amyâ¢slips out of his arms and onto the bed, completely unaware of what he's seeing. She starts to take off her blouse, Charley no longer looking at her, his gaze glued to the weird scene he's seeing out his As her blouse comes off, she lays back in the bed, looking up at him, waiting for him to join her.
AMY: Charley, I'm ready. He ignores her, grabbing his binoculars from his desk, whipping.them to his eyes and focusing in-on-the figures They're too dark to make out clearly, but they are JERRY DANDRIGE and BILLY COLE. An errant beam of moonlight hits the large, oblong box, and Charley gasps. It's a beautiful piece of work, huge, ornate, obviously incredibly old, and bound in brass. Amy stares at Charley with rising confusion and irritation.
J: 6 CONTINUED: ( 4 )
AMY: Charley, I said I'm ready.
CHARLEY: ( still glued to his
BINOCULARS ): Amy, you're not going to believe this, but there are two guys in the yard below. And I think they're carrying a ( glancing at the TV and seeing the very same scene ) Sure, and they're on the moors, Amy, I'm serious.
AMY: ( glancing at the TV and seeing the very same scene ) Sure, and they're on the moors, Amy, I'm serious.
CHARLEY: Amy, I'm serious.
AMY: So am I. Do you want to make love or Charley is still peering through the binoculars, the two figures below having gotten the storm doors open and now carrying the coffin into the basement of the house next Amy, quick, come-here, you've got to see this. All he hears is his bedroom door slamming shut. He whirls to find Amy gone. Tossing the binoculars on the bed,, he dives after her.
CHARLEY: Amy, quick, come-here, you've got to see this. All he hears is his bedroom door slamming shut. He whirls to find Amy gone. Tossing the binoculars on the bed,, he dives after her.
CHARLEY: 7 INT. PORTICO - STAIRWAY - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Charley hurries down the stairs after her.
AMY: 7 INT. PORTICO - STAIRWAY - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Charley hurries down the stairs after her.
CHARLEY: Okay, maybe it wasn't a coffin, but I did see two guys carrying something into that house
I: ch Rev'. 12/4/84 7.
AMY: ( HARDLY LISTENING )
T I: Amy steps into the living room, Charley following, the two of them trying to pull themselves together so Charley's mother won't notice what they've been doing 8 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT ( embarrassed as hell ) No, Mom, nothing like that.
JUDY: Have you two been having a lovers' ( embarrassed as hell ) No, Mom, nothing like that.
CHARLEY: ( embarrassed as hell ) No, Mom, nothing like that.
JUDY: Well, there's nothing wrong with ( pointing at the maga- zine in her lap ) Right here it says the divorce rate is 76% higher among couples who don't argue before marriage.
CHARLEY: Mom, we're in high school.
JUDY: Oh, yes, that's right. Well it never hurts to-plan ahead.
AMY: Yes, Mrs. Brewster.
AMY: Well, good night, Mrs. Brewster.
JUDY: Good night, Amy. And thanks for helping Charley.
AMY: Anytime. See you tomorrow, Charley. Be hardly hears her, staring out the window. Miffed again, Amy turns and stomps out of the room, the front DOOR heard SLAMMING behind her a moment later.
I: 8 CONTINUED:
JUDY: Charley, that wasn't very nice, not walking Amy to the front door.
CHARLEY: ( hardly hearing her ) Mom, there are people. next door.
JUDY: Oh, the new owner must.be moving in.
CHARLEY: What new owner?
JUDY I: Didn't I tell you? Bob Hopkins told me he finally sold the place.
I: To who?
CHARLEY: To who?
JUDY: I.d.on't know. Some fellow who fikes up houses, he said. Supposed to be attractive, too. Anyway I just hope whoever he is, he knows what he's getting into with that house. It's going to take a lot of work just to make it liveable And the CAMERA leaves them behind, SLOWLY PUSHING IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on the TV Judy was watching, their VOICES FADING out to be taken over by the newscaster dron- ing away on the screen.
KIN: FADE TO BLACK. FADE IN. ON : 9 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALL - DAY Kids are flooding out-of the classrooms, the BELL having just RUNG. Charley comes out of one of them, holding a test paper and looking none too happy about it.
CHARLEY: The bastard. Why didn't he tell us he was going to spring a pop quiz? Another kid comes out right behind him, holding a test paper with- a big A+ on it. Eis :name is EVIL ED THOMPSON and he's tall and thin with a terrible complexion and a personality to match.
EVIL ED: That's the point to a pop quiz, Brewster. To surprise you. Charley glances up at that moment to see Amy walking by, her head held high, and looking in every direction but his.
CHARLEY: Hey, Amy She keeps right on going, disappearing into the crowd. Evil Ed throws a look at Charley and cackles.
EVIL ED: What's wrong? She finally found out what you're really like?
CHARLEY: Buzz off, Evil.
EVIL ED: Call me anything you want. Only you're the one failing Algebra, not With another high pitched laugh, he walks off, leaving Charley staring after Amy miserably.
GIRL: Is this ninety-nine Oak?
CHARLEY: ( pointing to the
JUDY: Charley stops by the kitchen sink, staring out at the Dandrige house. as his mother goes back to fixing dinner.
CHARLEY: Mom, you seen the new guy next door No, but I did hear he's got a live-in carpenter. With my luck, he's probably gay.
JUDY: No, but I did hear he's got a live-in carpenter. With my luck, he's probably gay.
CHARLEY: ( SMILING SECRETLY )
JUDY: Why, what do you know that I- don't?
CHARLEY: Ah, nothing. Got to study. See you He cuts a beeline for the door, his mother staring after him disbelievingly as he disappears out the door.
JUDY: Study? You?
AMY: ( looking up at her,
CHARLEY: ( looking up at her,
STARTLED ): ( RECOVERING )
NIGHT: It was my fault, not yours.
AMY: It was my fault, not yours.
CHARLEY: ( REALLY STARTLED )
AMY: ( breaking into a big smile ) God, I'm so glad we're getting this straightened out.
LIKE: Over her shoulder he suddenly sees that the TV has gone to the local news, a picture of a girl who looks very much like the one he saw going into the Dandrige house the afternoon before on the screen. He is suddenly no longer listening or looking at Amy, his complete attention on the TV. She trails-off as she realizes she's lost his atten- tion, staring at him.
AMY: Charley, are-you listening to me? He gets up abruptly and walks away, leaving her sitting there staring after him. He stops'below the TV, staring up at it as the newscaster's voice runs over the picture of the girl.
EVIL ED: Know what I heard on the police band .last night?
CHARLEY: EVIL ED
EVIL ED: ( nodding at the TV ) That wasn't the only murder. It's the second in two days.
CHARLEY': ( staring at him ) You're sick. A voice suddenly comes from behind him.
CHARLEY: Morn, you've yot to get up. I can't believe what s happening next door.
JUDY: ( staring up as her son
SLEEPILY ): What, what are you talking about?
CHARLEY: He has fangs. The man who bought the house has fanas!
JUDY: Oh, Charley, I have to be at work at
SEVEN TOMORROW: He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM in the yard next door. He jumps to the window, peering out into the back of the Dandrige house just in time to see Billy Cole walking away from a shiny new black Cherokee Jeep, its back door left open. Charley whirls and dashes out of the room, leaving his mother staring after him.
JT1DT: 20 EXT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT He races down the corridor for the stairway landing.
CHARLEY: 20 EXT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT He races down the corridor for the stairway landing.
JERRY: Here, you forgot this. Billy one-hands it out of the air, turning back for the Jeep. Just then the back door to Charley's house bangs open, sending a shaft of light into the darkness. Judy Brewster stands there in the doorway, calling to her son.
JUDY: Dandrig.e and Billy Cole freeze, both of them turning to look at the back door to the Brewster house, inadvertently staring right at the clump of bushes where Charley.is hid Dandrige takes a step forward, his eyes probing the dark- ness as though he can actually see through the murky black- ness right to where Charley hides. Terrified, Charley suddenly leaps to his feet and races back into his own yard, disappearing through the back door with his mother. Billy steps forward as though to follow the boy. Jerry puts out a restraining hand, stopping him.
JUDY: Here, drink this..
JUDY: ( feeling his forehead for a fever ) Charley, how late did you stay up ( shoving her hand away ) iMom, I'm not sick. The guy did have `fangs and a bat did fly over my head .and then Jerry Dandrige stepped out of the shadows. You know what that means, don't you?
CHARLEY: ( shoving her hand away ) iMom, I'm not sick. The guy did have `fangs and a bat did fly over my head .and then Jerry Dandrige stepped out of the shadows. You know what that means, don't you?
JUDY: ( staring at him worriedly ) He's a vam_re!
CHARLEY: He's a vam_re!
JUDY: ( .staring at him
INCREDULOUSLY ): A what?
AMY: A what?
CHARLEY: ( frustrated as hell
AGAIN ): A vampire, damnit! Haven't you listened to anything I've said?
AMY: Charley, is this some kind of trick to get me 'back?
CHARLEY: ( turning toward the door in disgust ) i Forget it, L'm going to the police.
AMY: ( blocking his path ) Charley, you can't go to the police with a story like that. They'll lock you up.
CHARLEY: All right, then I won't tell them it's a vampire. But I sure as hell am going to tell them about the two women

CHARLEY: Be slams out the back door, leaving her staring after him, ) T worried sick.
LENNOX: You sure about this now? Charley nods emphatically and the cop turns toward the house, Charley following.
25 OMITTED: 27 INT. DANDRIGE HOUSE - PORTICO - STAIRWAY - DAY The KNOCK reverberates through the silent house. Nothing for several seconds; then the sound of someone walking down the hall from the kitchen. Billy Cole appears, stopping before the door, staring through the curtain at the dim outline of Charley and the Detective standing on the porch. He opens the door, staring at the boy and the cop.
BILLY: ( CONTINUED )
LT. LENNOX: Mr. Dandrige?
BILLY ': No, I'm his roommate,â¢Billy Cole.
LT. LENNOX: ( flashing his badge ) Lieutenant Lennox, homicide. Mind if we come in?
BILLY: No, not at all. He steps back from the door, allowing them to enter. The house is a mess of cardboard moving boxes and heavy Victorian furniture scattered everywhere, a number of the pieces still under white dust covers. Clocks line one wall, none of them working, all set at 6 p.m.
BILLY: Is there anything I can help you LIEUT. .LENNOX There was a murder last night. Charley lives'next door and thinks he saw the victim in this house.
LIEUT. .LENNOX: There was a murder last night. Charley lives'next door and thinks he saw the victim in this house.
BILLY: ( SEEMINGLY SHOCKED )
CHARLEY: That's a lie. ( nodding at Billy ) I saw him carry her body out in a plastic bag.
LIEUT. LENNOX: What do you say to that, Mr. Cole?
BILLY: ( RELIEVED )
BILLY: See. We're just in the process of moving in
CHARLEY,: The bag I saw had a body in it, not Did you actually see the body, No, but .
I: Did you actually see the body, No, but .
BILLY: Did you actually see the body, No, but .
CHARLEY: No, but .
BILLY: ( TO LENNOX )
LT. LENNOX: Okay, let's see 'em He takes a step to follow Billy out of the'room when Charley, increasingly desperate, stops him.
CHARLEY: Look, I can prove he's lying. Let's look in the basement instead.
LT. LENNOX: What's down there?
BILLY: ( turning and staring
BILLY: Obviously the boy's made a mistake,
OFFICER: ( bursting out with it ) A coffin, that's what's down there, a coffin. I saw them carry it in!
CHARLEY: ( bursting out with it ) A coffin, that's what's down there, a coffin. I saw them carry it in!

A: 30 CONTINUED:
CHARLEY: Lieutenant Lennox, please, listen to
ME: Lennox ignores him, ROARING away in a cloud of burning rubber. Charley stares after him, not knowing what to do He hears the PORCH DOOR of the Dandrige house OPEN behind him and whirls to find himself staring at Billy Cole, standing on the porch looking back at him, a toothpick in his mouth. There's something very unpleasant in the big man's eyes:- like murder. Charley slowly backs away from him toward his car, Cole's eyes following him.. Charley glances down at his wrist- watch.' It's four in the afternoon. He glances up at the sun overhead. It's beginning to sink, late afternoon and all that implies drawing nigh. He looks back at Billy Cole. The man is smiling at him now, reading his thoughts. Charley leaps into his car and takes off down the street.
CHARLEY: 32 ZNT. EVIL ED'S BEDROOM - DAY Evil Ed sits at his desk,. hand painting a monster model of a ghoul as Charley bursts through the door and skids to a halt before him, breathing hard. Evil's room is a veritable museum of horror, movie posters of Frankenstein and the Wolfman dotting the wall, the shelves full of monsters', models, the floor littered with horror comics. Evil glances up at Charley., obviously not happy about being And to what do I owe this dubious The vampire knows that I know about him. Or at least he will when he wakes up tonight.
EVIL ED: And to what do I owe this dubious The vampire knows that I know about him. Or at least he will when he wakes up tonight.
CHARLEY: The vampire knows that I know about him. Or at least he will when he wakes up tonight.
EVIL ED: What are you talking about?
EVIL ED: ( looking at him like
CHARLEY: Look, Evil, I haven't got time to explain. Just tell me what to do to .protect myself.
EVIL ED: ( going back to his
PAINTING ): Very funny, Brewster.
CHARLEY: I'm not kidding. Evil, please, just tell me what to do.
EVIL ED: Why should I help you? And don't call me that.
CHARLEY: ( digging money out of
EVIL ED: Far be it from me to turn down a fool's money. Where and when do you expect this vampire to attack?
CHARLEY: In my bedroom. Tonight. Evil Ed puts down his brush and pulls a dime store cross from his desk. He hands it to-Charley.
EVIL ED: Start with this. Of course, you have to have faith for it to work. Then get some wolfbane
CHARLEY: EVIL ED
EVIL ED: Forget it. Get some garlic, links of the stuff you can wear around your neck and hang from your window. If he comes for you,, that'll be the way. Then, of course, there's holy water. But you need a priest to say a blessing over it first. He goes back to his painting. Charley stares at him.
CHARLEY: That's all?
EVIL ED: 'I'm afraid so. Of course, they can change into wolves and bats at will and I don't know what you do about that. But your best protection right now is that a vampire can't enter your house without being invited by the rightful owner first.
CHARLEY: You sure about that?
EVIL ED: SMASH CUT TO: 36 INT. CHARLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Charley steps back to stare at his window, finished at last. Be's done the best he can, nailing-it shut, strewing it with garlic, his chest of drawers shoved in front of it, partially blocking. it.

A: 36 CONTINUED:
CHARLEY: Yeah, Mom
JUDY: Charley, this is.our next door neighbor, Jerry Dandrige. Charley freezes. Jerry Dandrige sits in the best chair, a drink in his hand, smiling at Charley. He's even better looking close up, almost blindingly beautiful, too much so There's something disturbing about it, as though such good looks have to cover up an inner putrefaction, some sort of hidden, sweet, sickly rot just beneath the perfect pale He rises, the smile widening as he sees the terror in Charley's eyes. He holds his hand out as Judy watches her son for his reaction.
JERRY: Hello, Charley. Charley just stares at him.
JUDY: Well, shake hands, Charley. There's no reason to be rude. Charley slowly crosses to Jerry and takes his hand, shaking it as one would the hand of a recently disinterred corpse. Judy.smiles, pleased with herself.
CHARLEY: What's he doing here?
JUDY: ( rising and smiling
CHARLEY: ( stone cold horrified ) You what?
JUDY: ( a bit taken aback by the intensity of her
JERRY: What's wrong, Charley? Afraid I'd never come over without being invited first? You're quite right. But, of course, now that I've been made welcome, I'll probably drop by quite a bit. His voice changes, suddenly charged with double meaning, his eyes burning into Charley.
JERRY: In fact, anytime I feel like it. ( changing tack, turn- ing back to Judy ) With your mother's kind permission, of course.
JUDY: ( TOTALLY ENRAPTURED WITH HIM )
JERRY: Right, Judy. Charley watches this scene, backing across the room, terri- fied. He suddenly hits an end table, knocking it with a crash to the floor. Judy looks at him. He's ghost white.
JUDY: Charley,. are you all right?
CHARLEY: ( his eyes on Jerry as he backs for the door ) Yeah, fine. I've just got to get back to my trigonometry, that's. all.
JERRY: Nice meeting you, Charley. ( his voice suddenly dripping with double
ENTENDRE ): See you soon. And unseen by Judy, he looks directly at Charley and winks at him. Charley whirls, bolting out of room and pounding up the stairway out of sight. Judy turns to Jerry.
JUDY: You know, our town really isn't'as boring as I make it sound. For instance, there's a dance at the church the first Friday of every month.
JERRY: ( BIG SMILE )
JUDY: ( BIG SMILE )
EVIL ED: CHARLEY ( V.O. ) The vampire is in the house. My idiot mother just invited him over for a drink.
EVIL ED: ( starting to laugh ) No shit?
CHARLEY: Ed, this is serious!
CHARLEY: Yeah, and I nailed my.window shut.
CHARLEY: You sure?
EVIL ED: Positive. Now good night. I've got some studying to do. He hangs up, returning to painting his monster model of the Ghoul, mumbling to himself.
EVIL ED: Fucking idiot.
JERRY: Now we wouldn't want to wake your mother, would we, Charley?
JERRY: You deserve to die, boy And he. begins to slowly choke Charley, suddenly stopping, staring into the boy's face.
JERRY: Of course, I could give you something I've never had. a choice. You forget abotrt me and I'll forget about you. What do you say, Charley?
JUDY: Charley, what happened?
CHARLEY: ( THINKING FAST )
JUDY: ( INSTANTLY CONCERNED )
JUDY: Now what's that? She takes a step for the window only to have Charley grab her, gently guiding her back toward her bedroom.
CHARLEY: Nothing, Mom. Just the raccoons in the garbage again. Why don't you go back to sleep. ,
JUDY: But what about your nightmare? Do you want a valium?
CHARLEY: I'm fine now, honest. Night.
JUDY: Well, I do needy sleep. I start the night shift tomorrow, you know.
CBARLEY: Yes, Nom, I know. Now, good night. He pushes her through her door into her bedroom, closing the door behind her and turning for his own room.
JERRY: I just destroyed your car, Charley. But-it's nothing compared to what I'm going to do to you tomorrow night. Be hangs up, slowly reaching out and drawing the shade.
CHARLEY: Get him, Peter,. get him
60 OMITTED: 61 EXT. STUDIO PARKING LOT - DAY Peter comes out of the studio dressed in his street clothes, moping toward his car, taking a cigarette from his cigarette case as he goes. Eels in his fifties, tall, saturnine, by nature very theatrical, but at this particular moment in time, also very depressed. Charley jumps out from hiding and hurries toward him.
CHARLEY: Hey, Mr. Vincent Peter ignores him, continuing to walk-toward his car as. Charley falls in beside him.
CHARLEY: Could I talk to you a minute? ( nothing from Peter ) Please, Mr. Vincent, it's terribly Peter, abruptly stopped, resigned to the fact that boy is not going to let him alone. He whips out a fountain pen.
PETER: All right, what do you want me to Pardon me?
CHARLEY: ( CONFUSED )
PETER: Well, you want my autograph, don't ._ .. No, sir. I was curious about what you said last night on TV. You know, about believing in vampires.
CHARLEY: No, sir. I was curious about what you said last night on TV. You know, about believing in vampires.
PETER: What about it?
CHARLEY: Were you serious?
PETER: Absolutely. Unfortunately none of your generation seems to be.
CHARLEY: What do you mean?
PETER: ( venting his frustra- tion on Charley ) That I have been fired because no one wants to see vampire killers anymore. Or vampires either. Apparently all they want are demented madmen running around in ski masks hacking up young Be starts for his car again, Charley falling in beside him.
CHARLEY: i believe in vampires.
PETER: ( HARDLY LISTENING )
CHARLEY: In fact I have one living next door. Would you help me kill him ? That stops Peter cold. He turns and stares at the boy.
PETER: Pardon me?
CHARLEY: You know the murder of that girl that happened yesterday?
PETER: ( CONTINUED ) 61 CONTINUED: ( 2 )
CHARLEY: Well, the'guy who lives next door did it and he's a vampire. A moment. Then Peter turns away angrily.
PETER: If this is your idea of a joke, I am not amused.
CHARLEY: ( GRABBING HIM )
CHARLEY: ( hurrying after him ) But, Mr. Vincent, I'm telling the
TRUTH: Peter stops before his car, on outrageous old clunker, and fishes out his keys.
CHARLEY: You just said you believe in
VAMPIRES: ( SHARPLY )
PETER: ( SHARPLY )
CHARLEY: Please, you have to listen to me. The vampire tried to kill me last night-and trashed mv car when he didn't succeed. He'll be coming back for me tonight and if I don't get help, he's going to kill me Peter shoves him aside,â¢hopping into his car, quickly lock- ing the door behind him, obviously terrified of Charley. As he starts the engine, Charley beats on the window.
CHARLEY: Mr. Vincent, you've got to believe

CHARLEY: Mr. Vincent He comes to a halt, realizing its useless, standing there .watching as Peter disappears out of the lot and down the 63 EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE - DAY Amy rides up on her moped just as Evil Ed starts.up the front walk toward Charley's house. She dismounts, looking at him.
62 OMITTED: 63 EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE - DAY Amy rides up on her moped just as Evil Ed starts.up the front walk toward Charley's house. She dismounts, looking at him.
AMY: What are you doing here?
EVIL ED: Me? What about you? I thought you just dumped him.
AMY: ( hurrying up the walk ) What I'm doing here is-none of your ( hurrying after her ) Aha, you do like him! He disappears into the house right behind her.
EVIL ED: ( hurrying after her ) Aha, you do like him! He disappears into the house right behind her.
AMY: Anybody home? No answer, nothing but silence. She and'Evil Ed exchange glances, then start up the steps.
EVIL ED: ( STARING AROUND )
CHARLEY: Self-defense. Not that I think I'll need it. He'll be dead before ( exchanging.: worried glances with Evil. Ed ) Who will be?
AMY: ( exchanging.: worried glances with Evil. Ed ) Who will be?
CHARLEY: Dandrige. I'm waiting for the guy he lives with to leave, then I'm doing to go next door, find his coffin, and pound this through his heart. He holds up the stake. Evil Ed and Amy look at it, hor- That's murder, Charley.
AMY: That's murder, Charley.
CHARLEY: ( looking back at her with total seriousness ) You can't murder a vampire, Amy. They're already dead, remember.
AMY: Charley, you're acting crazy.
CHARLEY: I don't have any choice, Amy. The police won't listen to me,.my mother thinks I'm crazy, you two, even Peter Vincent thinks I'm nuts.
AMY: ( SHOCKED AGAIN )
CHARLEY: ( NODDING )
CEARLEY: See. After he attacked me last night he went out and had his dinner. ( turning to stare out the window at the Dandrige house again ) No, I- don't have any choice. Somebody has to stop him. Hold.on, I need
ANOTHER STAKE: He rises and disappears out the door into the hall. Evil Ed turns to Amy, truly frightened for the first time. He whispers to her.
EVIL ED: What are we going to do? if we don't stop him he's actually going to try to kill this guy.
AMY: I know, I know
EVIL ED: I don't believe this. It's like Fright Night.
AMY: ( her eyes lighting up ) That's it!
AMY: We get Peter Vincent to prove to him that this Dandrige guy isn't a ( shocked by the
EVIL ED: ( shocked by the
SUGGESTION ): How are we going to do that?
AMY: I don't-know, but we better figure out a way if we don't want to be visiting Charley in jail. Charley enters from the hall, carrying another slat of wood to be sharpened. Evil Ed and Amy fall silent as he takes his seat by the window and goes back to his whittling.
AMY: ( nervously clearing her
THROAT ): Charley, .it's going to be dangerous doing into that house alone, isn't You're going to need all the help you can get, right? Somebody like Peter Vincent for instance.
CHARLEY: I told you, I already tried him.
AMY: Why not let us try before you do Why should he believe you anymore than he did me?
CHARLEY: Why should he believe you anymore than he did me?
AMY: Maybe we're better talkers.
CHARLEY: Fat chance.
AMY: What happens if you go into that house alone and he gets you? Who's going to stop him then?
EVIL ED: ( JOINING IN )

AMY: Could we talk to you for a moment, Mr. Vincent?

AMY: Please. It's terribly important. He stares at her and. sees the desperation in her eyes. He steps back, closing the door behind him, and following them into the room.
PETER: Now what' can I do for you? An autograph or an interview for your school newspaper?
AMY: I'm afraid this is much more. Oh, really?
PETER: ( FROWNING )
AMY: I know you're a very busy man, Mr. Vincent, but we're trying to save a boy's life.
PETER: ( HURUMPHING )
EVIL ED: ( STEPPING IN )

EVIL ED: ( GLEEFULLY )
PETER: Are you two serious? ( as Any nods ) My dear, your friend needs a psychiatrist, not'a vampire killer.
AMY: ( BEGGING )
PETER: I'm afraid not, my dear. ( nodding at an open suitcase on the bed ) You see, Hollywood beckons. I've been offered a starring role in a major movie. I've even had to quit Fright Night. So you see, I'm

PETER: I'll take it. ( sitting in a chair across from her, sud- denly all charm ) Now how are we going to cure your little friend of this delusion?
EVIL ED: I got it all figured out. We all go next door to the neighbor and you run some kind of vampire test on-him and pronounce-him human. Like in "Orgy of the Damned." You know, where you looked in the mirror and the guy didn't have a reflection and then you knew he was a vampire.
PETER: ( GETTING MISTY-EYED )

CHARLEY: Mr. Vincent, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this Peter slowly gets out of the car, stretching to his full height. He wears his vampire killer regalia, the Victorian suit, and carries a small leather satchel. There is some- thing truly majestic about him.. He looks down at Charley, laying it on. with a trowel.

CHARLEY: ( SHOCKED )
PETER: Yes. Which doesn't exactly strengthen your case, does it? Now, shall we go. He takes a step up the walk. Charley grabs his arm.
CHARLEY: But, Mr. Vincent, if I'm right and you prove he's a vampire, he'll kill us all right then and there.

PETER: ( OBVIOUSLY PLEASED )
JERRY: ( turning to Amy-and - Evil Ed ) And who might these two attractive people be?
PETER: ( doing the intros ) This is Ed Thompson and Amy Peterson.
JERRY: ( bending low over Amy's hand and kissing it ) ( looking up at Charley with a wicked smile ) Isn't that what vampires are supposed to do, Charley? Charley scowls at him. The others laugh. Jerry turns to the living room.
JERRY: Please, come in Be ushers Peter into the living room, Billy following. Amy and Evil Ed stare after Jerry, both totally captivated.

CHARLEY: Then it wasn't blessed!
PETER: ( HUFF ILY )
CHARLEY: If he's not a vampire, then have him touch this? Jerry stiffens, his face losing its color, but none of the others notice. They're all looking askance at Charley. Peter steps up to the boy.
PETER: Charley, you've already made a fool of yourself once. There's no reason to compound the error.
_ JERRY: Yes, Charley, you've already.caused your friends quite enough pain. ( his eyes burning into Charley, hammering the

AMY: ( her eyes beginning to glaze over ) I'd, I'd like that, Mr. Dandrige.
JERRY: Please, call me Jerry. Her face is beginning to stiffen, her eyes turning blank. Charley looks at her in sudden alarm, remembering the girl he saw through the window that night. He grabs Amy by the arm, tugging. her toward the door.

JERRY: Something wrong, Mr. Vincent? Peter hurriedly scoops up the case, trying to hide his shaking hands and keep the tremor out of his voice.
PETER: No, no, just my clumsiness. Come along, we must be going. Thank you again, Mr. Dandrige He ushers the teenagers out the front door as Jerry watches, puzzled by his sudden change in attitude.
CHARLEY: What's wrong with you?
PETER: He stops by his car, fumbling his keys-out of his pocket, hardly able to fit them into the lock with his trembling Then why are your hands shaking?
CHARLEY: Then why are your hands shaking?
PETER: ( his hands shaking worse than ever ) They're- not shaking. Be finally gets the door open, hurriedly sliding in behind the wheel, slamming the door behind them. Charley leans down, speaking through the partially open window.

CHARLEY: You saw something in there, didn't you, something that convinced you he was a vampire?
PETER: Will you be quiet.
CHARLEY: Is Jerry Dandrige a vampire or not?
PETER: ( struggling to get the car started ) No, of course not.

JERRY: Jerry turns away from the window, sits at the foot of the stairs.
BILLY: ( still at window ) Well, at least they'll never believe the kid now. Jerry glances down and sees a sliver of mirror from Peter's cracked cigarette case at his feet. He picks it up, examining it. He casts no reflection in it. He holds it up for Billy to see.
JERRY: ( RISING )
CHARLEY: ( turning to Amy and Evil Ed ) Well, at least you two heard him.
EVIL ED: Heard who?-
I: Peter Vincent. He said Dandrige had no reflection.
CHARLEY: Peter Vincent. He said Dandrige had no reflection.

CHARLEY: No way. We want people and lights, the more the better.
EVIL ED: Look, Brewster, vampires don't exist. Haven't you gotten that through your thick head yet?
CHARLEY: What if you're wrong, Evil? What if Dandrige is a vampire and he thinks you know it. Would you walk down that alley then? The hair on the back of Evil Ed's neck starts to stand on end. Then he denies it.
EVIL ED: Aw, fuck you, Brewster. He takes a step toward the alley. Charley grabs him.
CHARLEY: Ed, please, just stick with us.
EVIL ED: Forget it. You may be chickenshit, but I'm not. He disappears down the alley into the darkness. Amy and Charley stare after him. She turns to Charley.
AMY: What do we ' do?..
CHARLEY Â¢: Let him go. No vampire's gonna want hint anyway.. Probably give him blood They're about to turn away when a blood curdling SCREAM ECHOES out of the darkness of the alleyway. It's Evil Ed. Charley and Amy dash headlong into the alley after him.
CHARLEY: Where is he? Amy spots him laying crumpled against a wall.
AMY: Over here.
I: They dash to him, kneeling by his side. Evil Ed's eyes are closed, his breathing shallow. Charley tries to shake him Ed, Ed, are you all right? Nothing from Evil Ed. Charley looks at Amy.

CHARLEY: You asshole, you fucking asshole! Evil Ed rolls on the ground in hysterics, pointing at him, and laughing loudly.
EVIL ED: Ha, hah, really fooled you. ( climbing to his feet and dusting
CHARLEY: ( flushed with anger ) You'll get yours someday, Evil. He grabs Amy's hand and walks back down the alley toward the street and the lights. Evil Ed yells after him.
EVIL ED: ( MOCKINGLY )
EVIL ED: Charley, Amy, that you? He hears nothing but those FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER.and CLOSER. The fear starts to work at him, twisting up his gut and making his forehead sheen with sweat. He steps forward, yelling out with false bravery.
EVIL ED: If that's. you, it isn't working. I'm not scared! And then Jerry emerges out of the shadows, smiling at him. With a scream, Evil Ed turns and runs. bl Rev. 10/9/84 62.
EVIL ED: No, no The FOOTSTEPS SUDDENLY STOP. Nothing but silence. The seconds tick past. He takes a step away from the wall, peering into the darkness with something like hope, preying that maybe, just maybe, Dandrige has given up. A voice suddenly whispers in his ear, no more than an inch Hello, .Edward. Evil Ed turns with a scream to find Jerry standing right next to him. Almost insane with fear now, slobbering like a wounded animal, he backs away from the shadowy figure, hitting the corner and sliding to the cold pavement, almost curled up in a fetal ball, tears streaming from his eyes. Dandrige walks over to him, staring down with something like pity in his eyes.

JERRY: You have nothing to fear from me. ( in a voice like honey ) I understand what it's like, being different. Only they won't make fun of you anymore or beat you up. I'll see to that. All you have to do is take my hand. Evil Ed slowly looks up at him through his tear-stained eyes to see Jerry staring-down at him, his. hand outstretch- ed to.him, a slight smile on his face, gentle, seductive, Here, Edward, take my hand. Evil Ed looks down at the hand outstretched to him.
JERRY: Here, Edward, take my hand. Evil Ed looks down at the hand outstretched to him.
CHARLEY: How much further?
AMY: About ten minutes A DEATH RATTLE, long and-high-pitched, suddenly comes to them, ECHOING through the city streets, down alleyways and across apartment buildings, faint yet filled with so much terror it stops them in their tracks and leaves them staring fearfully about at the shadows.
CHARLEY: What was that?
AMY: Evil Ed messing around.
AMY: They start down the street again, Charley glancing nervously over his. shoulder in the direction of Evil Ed's Amy, what if Evil really was in Oh, come on, Charley, don't let him suck you in again All the street lights suddenly go out, plunging them into almost total blackness.

He's only ten feet away now, smiling as he approaches, both kids realizing it's hopeless to run at this point. Backing away, Charley and Amy cross the mouth of an alley. There's the CRASH OF A GARBAGE PAIL and Charley glances down the alley to see a dish washer from the club dumping garbage, the bright lights of the door into the kitchen shining like a beacon in the night. Charley grabs Amy's hand and jerks her down the alley after him as he races for the door.

EVIL ED: There's a vampire out here. Let me Peter slips the cross into his pocket and unlocks the door. Be pulls Evil Ed into the room, hurriedly locking and bar- ring the door behind him. Evil Ed has changed, and not for the better. His skin is more sallow, huge dark circles under his eyes, his lips bloodless, his collar pulled up tightly around his neck. Peter turns to him.
PETER: What are we going-to do?
EVIL ED: What are you going to do, not me. Peter stares at him as Evil Ed slowly reaches up and pulls down the collar of his shirt, revealing two small puncture marks on his throat. Peter's eyes widen in horror; Evil Ed's smile only grows wider.
EVIL ED: I used to admire you, you know that. Of course, that was before I found out what â¢a fake you were.
EVIL ED: Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer, indeed! He throws himself at Peter, grabbing him from behind and whirling him about, opening his mouth wide to sink his fangs into him. Peter straightens, grabbing the cross from his pocket and thrusting it directly into Evil Ed's face, slamming it into his forehead between his eyes. His skin sizzles and cracks, smoke rising, and Evil Ed backs away, bent over screaming in pain, his hands held to his face. He slowly looks up as Peter watches, frozen in horror. Evil Ed drops his hands from his face, revealing a smoking sign of the cross branded into his forehead. He stares at What have you done to me? He turns to look into the wall mirror, but there's no re- flection.for him to see. He whirls on Peter, screaming at him like the spoiled brat he is.

CHARLEY: C'mon; Mr, Vincent, answer, please, Unseen by either of them, Jerry Dandrige sweeps through the front door of the club, moving like a god among mere mor- tals, his eyes, now glowing a faint red, sweeping the crowd of dancers as he moves toward the dance floor.
CHARLEY: Answer me, damnit, answer me Behind him Amy stiffens, staring out onto the dance floor at the sea of people. Moving through the dancers like a golden god moving amid mere mortals walks Jerry Dandrige. The hot, colored lights of the dance floor highlight his hair, accentuating his gracefulness, making him seem even more beautiful than he is. He stops just at the edge of the floor and holds his hand out to Amy, the orgiastic dancing swirling on behind him, the pounding, SENSUAL BEAT OF THE FUNK ROCK washing over them both. His eyes burn into hers, willing her to come to Terrified, she turns back toward Charley. In that moment Jerry disappears from the mouth of the hallway, Amy turn- ing back just as she's about to grab Charley only to see he's gone. She stops, more intrigued than frightened, the image of that beautiful man holding out his hand to her sharp in her mind. She takes a step forward down the hall, continuing down the hall until she has a clear view of the dancers. Jerry's nowhere to be seen. Behind her., . Charley is just about to turn and glance. in the line.

CORE USER: Hey, watch out,.asshole! Charley glances down to see the table of users grouped around their mirror of white powder. He moves quickly away, searching for Amy. He stops by the wall of poseurs cruising everything that walks by, asking a girl that looks from behind as though she must be Amy's age.
CHARLEY: Pardon me, have you seen a girl,
OLDER WOMAN: Forget her, take me instead She reaches out to kiss Charley and he flees the crowd of flesh.watchers laughing at him as he goes. He moves along a wall of LESBIANS, stopping one, his des- peration growing.
CHARLEY: I'm looking for a girl
LESBIAN: So am I. Before Charley can recover a woman moves into her arms, Charley, shocked and disconcerted, backing away until he bumps to a halt against a heavy metal biker, the kind of guy who's into Twisted Sister. The parody of biker throws him to the floor for the insult, his friends, walking par- odies of bikers, laughing at Charley as he leaps to his feet and backs away into the crowd. He breaks free of the packed humanity, stopping on the stairs. It is at that moment that he catches a glimpse of Amy on the dance floor, dancing with Jerry. He hurries down the stairs and onto the floor. On the dance floor, Amy moves.with Jerry, their bodies locked together, slowly falling. into his eyes, dancing slower and slower with him until finally she has no will left of her own. She is "in love" with him. It is at that moment that she bends her head forward, laying it on his shoulder, exposing her neck to him, her eyes staring at the wall as they revolve around and around, Jerry bending down to kiss her neck, his mouth slowly opening. It is at that moment Amy sees her reflection in the mirrors mounted against one wall;.she is dancing alone. Shocked back to her senses, she goes rigid in Jerry's arms, trying to pull away from him, screaming as the music and the dancers stop.
'AMY: Across the dance floor, Charley hears her SCREAM and pushes his way through the sea of humanity, fighting his way to her side where she stands with Jerry, once again caught in his eyes, slowly losing her will. Charley grabs Jerry by the shoulder, trying to pull him away from Amy.
CHARLEY: Let her go! Jerry looks down at him, smiling, mocking him as Amy sways in his arms, her eyes locked on. his face.
JERRY: What's wrong, Charley? Jealous? He grinds his pelvis against.Amy, dry humping her in front of Charley. She throws her head back, her mouth opening in .something close to ecstasy, her eyes glazed, staring up at him with adoration, giving herself to him as she cocks her head to one side, exposing her tender young throat. Charley goes crazy.
CHARLEY: You filthy son-of-a-bitch ! He swings at him only to have Jerry release Amy, catching Charley's fist in the palm of his hand easily. Be stares down at the boy, smiling cruelly.
.JERRY: You shouldn't lose your temper, Charley. It isn't polite. He tightens his grip, slowly squeezing Charley's fist. You can almost hear the knuckle bones grinding as Charley's face'contorts in agony, driving him to his knees before Jerry. Charley looks up at him, tears of pain streaming down his face.
CHARLEY: ( gasping with pain ) You can't kill me here
JERRY: I don't want to kill you, Charley. I -want you to bring Peter Vincent to my house, just the two of you. That is if you ever want to see Amy again. He casually releases Charley, letting the boy drop to the floor as he disappears with Amy into the swirling mass of dancers. Charley leaps to his feet, ignoring the pain in his hand and plunges after them. Charley breaks free of the swirl near the bar, looking everywhere and not seeing either of them. Suddenly he's grabbed by a strong, pair of arms. He looks up to find himself staring into the face of a huge, black BOUNCER.
CHARLEY: ( DESPERATELY )
BOUNCER': Hey, Donny, this the one? Another huge bouncer, the one the cook talked to when Charley and Amy sneaked into the club, steps out of the whirl staring down at the boy.
DONNY: Yeah, its him.
CHARLEY: That's her, over there with that older
GUYF: C' mon . He cuts across the floor on a diagonal to intercept Jerry and Amy, the black bouncer dragging Charley after him in a steel 'grip. Jerry finally reaches the throng near the front door, starting to move through it with Amy when sud- denly the two bouncers and Charley block his way. Donny jerks Amy out of Jerry's hand, passing her to the black bouncer, nodding at her and Charley.

Donny jerks Amy out of Jerry's hand, passing her to the black bouncer, nodding at her and Charley.
DONNY: Get the two of them out of here. Jerry steps toward Amy, his face beginning to darken with rage, the MUSIC pulsating around them, people swirling by on all sides.
JERRY: She's mine Donny puts out his hand, stopping Jerry as the black bouncer drag's Charley and Amy toward the front door.
DONNY: You want chicken, man, you. go to some other club. Jerry snarls, his eyes beginning to glow, his hair slicking back slightly, the hint of fangs beginning to protrude over his upper lip as rage overtakes him. He raises his right hand, holding it out in.front of. the bouncer's face so the man can clearly see what is happening. The nails on the four fingers pop out, literally elongating several inches in front of the man's eyes, growing into razor sharp claws that sparkle in the overhead lights. The bouncer, terrified, screams for his'companion.
'DONNY: Hey, Leon, get back here! Toward the entrance to' the club, Leon releases Charley and Amy, hustling back toward his buddy. Charley grabs Amy,' pulling her toward the door.
CHARLEY: C'mon, quick But it's. too late already. Donny screams as the talons whistle through the air, tearing his throat out in one swipe, scattering blood everywhere, blinding several of the dancers swirling.by, hitting people drinking at the bar, a couple necking in a corner, blood flying everywhere. Jerry steps around the corpse as it topples backward over a table of coke users, the bouncer's dead eyes staring up at them. Leon dashes up, - lunging for Jerry. The vampire's hand snaps out, grabbing`him by the throat, squeezing, driving those claws deep into the man's neck, holding him like a chicken, enjoying a second of his death throes and then casually flinging him into the center of the floor, bringing the music and all the dancing to a shrieking halt as this new group of people stare at another dead body.
CHARLEY: Hold on to me Suddenly Jerry steps out in front of them and sweeps Amy away from. him, the crowd flowing around Charley and carry- ing him off in the opposite direction as he fights and screams to get back to her.
CHARLEY: But the sea of humanity is too much for him; it pushes him ,first away from and then toward the front door, leaving him no choice but to go with it or be trampled.
AMYL: But the sea of humanity is too much for him; it pushes him ,first away from and then toward the front door, leaving him no choice but to go with it or be trampled.

PETER: Who is it?
PETER: Are you one of them, too?
CHARLEY: What are you talking about? Peter thrusts his cross out through the crack.'
PETER: Here, grab this. Charley does as told. Peter peers at his hand. No smoke. He hurriedly slips the chain from the door and pulls the boy inside.
CHARLEY: What are you, doing?
PETER: You can't.
CHARLEY: You can't.
PETER: Wanna bet? Watch me. Peter closes the suitcase, hurrying for the door. Charley steps in front of him, blocking his path.
CHARLEY: Dandrige has Amy. He says he'll kill her unless we come to his house. Peter stops, staring at Charley, stunned. The blood drains from his face.
PETER: Oh, my God.
CHARLEY: ( grabbing the phone away from him ) No, they won't believe you. I've ch Rev. 12/4/84 78.
CHARLEY: ( QUIETLY )
PETER: I can't. I was paid to be there I know.
CHARLEY: I know.
PETER: And you still want me to help you?
CHARLEY: Yes. You're Peter Vincent, the Great Vampire Killer.
PETER: ( looking up at him,
FURIOUS ): That's a character in a movie, .Charley. That's not even my real name! ( repressing a sob ) And I'm terrified, I'm sorry, but I am.
CHARLEY: I can't do it alone, Peter. If you don't help, Amy's going to die. And me, too, probably. r ( nothing f om Peter ) Please, Peter.
PETER: I'm sorry, Charley.
CHARLEY: ( quietly, of ter a
MOMENT ): Yeah, me, too. He walks to the door, slipping quietly out of the apart- ment, leaving Peter staring miserable at the floor.
AMY: Where am I?
JERRY: Where you wanted to be. In He reaches out a hand to her; she cowers back.
AMY: Liar. Where's Charley?
JERRY: You don't really care. He hits play on the TAPE DECK. FUNK ROCK, hot and driving, snakes out of the speakers. He turns back to her, holding out his hand. She looks away, then glances up only to find herself trapped in his gaze. He starts.to weave his way across the floor toward her,. every move a suggestion, an invitation, all of it somehow hypnotic. She stares at him, fighting to break free. Finally she manages to turn her head away, staring at the floor, screaming at him.
AMY: Liarl I love him. It doesn't faze him; he just keeps moving to the beat, slowly, oh, so slowly, coming closer and closer to where she sits on the floor, his voice stroking her as he comes.
JERRY: Am I lying, Amy? He stops above her, leaning down, his voice a husky, post- coital whisper.
JERRY: Am I? And she's gone, his eyes drawing her in and swallowing her up, drowning her in their faint red glow. He holds out his hand to her. She slowly takes it and-he raises her up into his arms, moving in place to the MUSIC with her, smiling down as she stares up at him blindly. He gently pushes her head down on his shoulder, exposing her tender young neck. And then he slowly bends down, his mouth opening to expose those two, razor sharp fangs with their alabaster cast, slowly, delicately sliding them beneath her skin.
CHARLEY: ( TERRIFIED )
CEARLEY: ( GULPING )
PETER: ( pulling himself up to his full height ) I am serious. Ee drops to his knees, pulling an assortment of his movie props out of his leather bag.
PETER T: Let's see, stakes, hammer, crosses,
FLASHLIGHT: What about Billy Cole? What's going to stop him? Peter rises, holding up a pistol.
PETER: This. From Orgy of the Damned.
CHARLEY: What if he's not human? Bullets aren't going to stop him then.
PETER: He walks around during the day, doesn't he?
HOUSE ): Let's go. The two of them cross the street, heading toward the house which now seems to be staring at them, about to charge them. Charley glances at Peter.
CHARLEY: ( cutting him off ) Not now. But Peter isn't really paying attention to Charley. His eyes are on that malevolent looking house, the house looming larger and larger above him as they get closer and Peter begins to slow, his nerve draining away as the true- evilness of the. place begins to eat at him. He finally comes to a halt, staring at the house. Charley stops, looking. back.

CHARLEY: What's wrong?
PETER: ( quickly ). Nothing, nothing at all.
PETER: Are you crazy? Not through the front door. Let's go around to the back and sneak in The front door slowly swings open on creaking hinges, seemingly of its own accord. Peter and Charley turn to look at it, a dark gaping hole like an open mouth, ready to swallow them.
CHARLEY: Too late. Be starts moving up the porch toward the door. Peter moves with him, his gaze fixed on that gaping mouth of an open doorway, mumbling to himself as he goes.
PETER: I'm Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer. I'm They disappear into the house, Jerry Dandrige suddenly .stepping INTO FRAME, staring after them.
CHARLEY: This way. They start up the stairway.
CHARLEY': ( pausing and listening ) They start up the stairway. Peter grabs Charley again, digging his fingers into the boy's arms, listening hard.
PETER: Let's wait until dawn. He'll be in his coffin then. We'll have a better chance of getting Amy.
CHARLEY: Amy'll be dead by then, too. Now
COME ON: He turns to start up the stairs- only to have a voice come out of the darkness on the landing above. JERRY ( o.s. ) ( he steps forward into the light, looking
CHARLEY: Where's Amy?
JERRY: ( SMILING )
BY ME: He starts. down the steps. Peter whips out one of the crosses, thrusting it at the vampire.
PETER: ( in his vampire killer
VOICE ): Back, spawn of Satan.
JERRY: Oh, really? He reaches out, takes the cross. from Peter's hand and crumples it, contemptuously tossing. it aside. Be turns back to Peter.
JERRY: You have to have faith in order for it to work on me, Mr. Vincent. He starts down the stairs again, Peter backing away, terrified, his nerve completely gone now. Charley steps forward, staring up at Dandrige defiantly. He whips out his cross, thrusting it at the vampire.
CHARLEY: Jerry stops, staring at the cross. Charley starts up the stairs toward him, the cross held in front of him.
CHARLEY: Jerry backs up the stairs, away from the cross, disappearing into the darkness at the top of the landing. Charley glances back at Peter triumphantly.
BACK: Jerry backs up the stairs, away from the cross, disappearing into the darkness at the top of the landing. Charley glances back at Peter triumphantly.
CHARLEY: We're gonna make.it Billy Cole suddenly steps out of the darkness in front of him, rips the cross from the boy's hand and viciously backhands him across the face. With a scream, Charley smashes through the. stairway railing, plunging to the hallway floor below. He lands with a solid thud, lying there, groaning. Jerry steps in front of Billy, staring down at Peter on the stairway, smiling at him. Then he slowly starts down the stairs toward Peter. With a scream, the actor whirls, racing down the steps and out the front door.
PETER: Mrs. Brewster! No answer. He grabs the phone from the table and punches out a number, speaking hurriedly into it.
PETER: Hello, operator, get me the police. No response, not even a dial tone. He holds the phone up only to see the cord has been ripped from the wall. His eyes widen in horror, his gaze snapping back up the Mrs. Brewster He plunges up the stairs.
A: yl Rev. 11/23/84 85..

WALLS: Be reaches out, turning her over on the bed to face him. only it isn't Judy; it's Evil Ed, wearing one of her wigs.
EVIL ED: I know. I did it. He grins up at Peter as he.-slowly rises, the wig slipping from his head, his features already transformed subtly into those of a vampire, the hair slicked back on his head, his face elongated, two huge white fangs slashing over his lower lip. Peter staggers back, staring at him in horror.
PETER: Where's Charley's mother?
EVIL ED: She's working nights apparently. She left - a note for Charley. ( holding out the crumpled note as he takes a step
EVIL ED: I'M SORRY
I'M SORRY: He dies, Peter staring down at him, sorrow struck by the waste and horridness of it all..
JERRY: You wanted her, there she is. Charley glances to his side, sees Amy lying there, and crawls to her. He gently turns her toward'him.
CHARLEY: His words die on his lips. Amy's eyes are clenched shut, her face drenched with sweat, her entire body trembling. Jerry .watches his horrified reaction, smiling.
AMY: His words die on his lips. Amy's eyes are clenched shut, her face drenched with sweat, her entire body trembling. Jerry .watches his horrified reaction, smiling.

CHARLEY: ( staring up at him
WILDLY ): What have you done to her?
JERRY ': Nothing much. I just bit her a little bit, that's all. Jerry just stares-at him silently, leaving no room for the boy to disbelieve him. Charley suddenly leaps for him, furious with rage.
CHARLEY: You bastard! .Jerry casually knocks him aside, flinging him through the air against the far wall with his incredible strength. Charley crumples to the floor, stunned. Jerry walks over to him and drops a wooden stake at his feet.
JERRY: ( Charley stares at
CHARLEY: 133 EXT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT Dandrige pauses halfway down the stairs, listening to the agony in Charley's voice as the scream dies away. He smiles, then continues to walk down the stairs.
PETER: 137 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
CHARLEY: ( in a whisper ) PETER ( o.s. ) I'm going to have to break the door down. Make as much noise as you can. Charley turns to the wall, beating on it and yelling for all he's worth.
CHARLEY: Help, let me out!
JERRY: I think she just opened her eyes.
PETER: Quick, grab her and let's get out of
CHARLEY: We can't. Look. He falls to his knees beside Amy and rolls her over for Peter to see. She is still covered with sweat and trembling even more violently now. Her upper lip slips back revealing lengthening fangs, just the beginning of

BILLY: Something wrong? '
JERRY: Yes. We have a visitor. He puts down his shovel, heading for the stairs, Billy following him.
CHARLEY: Is it too late to save her?
PETER: Not if we kill Dandrige before dawn.'
CHARLEY: Are you sure?
PETER: So far everything's just like in the movies. We'll just have to keep on And the CAMERA STOPS outside the bedroom window, watch- ing as Charley grabs the stake Dandrige dropped on the floor, and heads for. the door.
CHARLEY: Let's go 142 INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - STAIRWAY - NIGHT They come out of the bedroom and start. down the steps only to find themselves facing Billy Cole coming up the other way. They freeze. as Billy stops, a slow smile sliding across his grim features.
I: They come out of the bedroom and start. down the steps only to find themselves facing Billy Cole coming up the other way. They freeze. as Billy stops, a slow smile sliding across his grim features.
BILLY: Well, what do we have here? He starts up the steps. Peter :pulls a pistol, one of the props from his apartment, from-his pocket.
PETER: Stop or I'll shoot. Billy stops, still smiling at him,. their eyes locked for what seems like an eternity. Then Billy starts up the stairs toward him again. Peter points the gun at Billy with trembling hands.
PETER: I mean it. Don't force me to
SHOOT: Billy reaches out his huge hands for Peter's throat. Peter FIRES, the bullet punching a neat hole through Billy's forehead. The large man freezes, his eyes rolling back in his skull. Be stands there for a moment and then tumbles backward down the stairs, landing with a CRASH at the bottom. Suddenly there is the SOUND OF APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS on the balcony above. Peter and Charley whirl, staring up at the landing above them. A second later Jerry Dandrige steps out of the shadows. With a smile he starts down the stairs toward them. Charley steps forward, thrusting his cross up at Dandrige.
STOPS: Dandrige freezes, his face darkening with fury. Charley starts up the steps, Peter close behind him.
CHARLEY: Come on, we have him Dandrige's gaze snaps past Charley's shoulder, down into the shadows at the bottom of the stairs where Billy's body lies, his eyes glowing as they burn into the corpse for a moment before shifting back to Charley and Peter. He smiles at the boy.
JERRY: Do you? He steps back into Amy's room, disappearing from sight. Peter looks at Charley.
CHARLEY: What did he mean?
PETER: Nothing. He's just bluffing. Charley continues up the stairs-slowly, the cross held out in front of him, Peter hugging his back. Behind them, down at the foot of the stairs,,Billy slowly sits up. Peter and Charley continue climbing, their gazes fixed ahead. Behind them Billy stands and starts to walk up the stairs toward them, the first STEP he hits GROANING under his heavy Charley and Peter freeze, turning to look back. They see the huge man coming up the stairs toward them, a thin trail of blood leaking from the bullet hole in his forehead. Peter whips his pistol out with trembling hands and UNLOADS THE ENTIRE REVOLVER into the man, casting a pale of gunsmoke in front of him and Charley, obscuring their view of the stairway below. Suddenly Billy Cole appears through the thick cloud, back- ing them up the stairs. Peter stumbles, falling backward, .unable to rise in time. Billy leans down, grabbing him and jerking him into the air like a ragdoll.,. about to fling him over the ballustrade to the floor far below. Charley suddenly leaps forward, slamming his stake into the creature's heart.
CHARLEY: Billy Cole freezes, his eyes widening. Be drops Peter crashing to the steps and staggers back, grabbing the rail for support, hanging there below Peter and Charley for what seems an eternity, the stake protruding from his heart.. As the two watch in horror, Cole's face slowly begins to dissolve, skin putrefying and slipping away, revealing the grinning skull beneath, the process of dissolution acceler- ating as the seconds tick past. Suddenly the legs turn to bone and.what remains of the body, no more than a skeleton in clothes now, tumbles backward down the stairs with a clatter, to land with a crash on the floor below, bones rolling in-every direction across the portico. They stare down the stairs at his ( in a hoarse whisper ) Be wasn't human.
CHARLEY: ( in a hoarse whisper ) Be wasn't human.
PETER: No, he, certainly wasn't. Peter scrambles to his feet, he'and Charley backing hurriedly up the stairs, terrified by what they've seen. i 143 INT. AMY'S ROOM - NIGHT open window, left that way by Dandrige when he entered and left. Charley ignores it, hurrying to Amy, and kneeling by her side. He gently turns her over to expose lengthening bicuspids as Peter sticks his head out the window. Her irises are now more red than before, signaling the trans- ition she is making from the living to the walking dead.
CHARLEY: Peter ducks in just as Jerry's about to strike.
CHARLEY: She's worse. C'mon, we're running out of time The two men rush out of the room.
CHARLEY: Where is he? The CAMERA BEGINS TO DRIFT up the side of the house toward the attic window above. Rev. 11/26/84 9 2A.
PETER: He's in the attic. They rush to the attic door, the two men disappearing up the dark stairs.
CHARLEY: Well, he was here The beam moves on, only to suddenly stop on a large chest shoved in a corner.
PETER: There, his-coffin. Both of them approach, staring down at the long chest. Peter hands the flashlight to Charley, pulling a stake from his pocket, a hammer from his belt. He raises the stake in the air, the hammer ready. He nods at the coffin.
PETER: Open i t. Charley throws his shoulder against the lid, heaving. The lid opens with a GROAN, Peter about to stab down only to find it empty.
CHARLEY: ( almost in despair )
A: gr Rev. 11/26/84 94.
PETER: Well, now we know where he is.
CHARLEY: Yeah, but what's he doing up there?
JERRY: Amy, awake, I command you to awake!
JERRY'S VOICE: Now show me how much you love me, Amy, kill them both! She rises and moves like a zombie messenger of death toward the door to the hallway and the attic above.
CHARLEY: I'm going up there. He heads for the open window at the far end of the attic nearest the stairs.
PETER: He-takes a step after the boy, but he's too late. Charley is already out the window.
CHARLEY: He-takes a step after the boy, but he's too late. Charley is already out the window.
CHARLEY: ( SHOUTING BACK )
PETER: Where the hell is he? And in the window directly behind his back, Jerry rises up out of the dark, no more than a few feet away, only 'a thin pane of glass separating Peter from his clawed hand. He raises it to strike through the glass at Peter just as .Charley slides in the open window at the far end from the roof and sees Jerry in the window behind Peter.. He screams Peter, behind you! Peter whirls, holding up his cross and as quickly as he appeared from the night, Jerry slips back into it, leaving Peter staring at the window, terrified at the close call as Charley reaches his' side.
CHARLEY: Peter, behind you! Peter whirls, holding up his cross and as quickly as he appeared from the night, Jerry slips back into it, leaving Peter staring at the window, terrified at the close call as Charley reaches his' side.
CHARLEY: You okay?
CHARLEY: ( GRABBING HIM )
AMY: ( GRABBING HIM )
PETER: ( GRABBING HIM )
CHARLEY: Oh, my God Suddenly they hear Dandrige cruelly laughing at them from the floor below, laughing like this is the best joke he's ever heard..
CHARLEY: He's downstairs now Amy suddenly launches herself at Charley, seizing.him by the throat and throwing him to the floor, landing on top of him. He grabs her by the shoulders, holding her back as she tries to plunge her fangs into his neck. Peter steps up behind her, a stake raised in his hands, about to plunge it into her back. Charley screams up at him.
CHARLEY: Peter shifts his grip on the stake, holding it like a club, and brings it slamming down on her back. She collapses un- conscious on top of Charley. He shoves her off, climbing to his feet, and turning toward the staircase to the floor Come on
CHARLEY: Come on
PETER: You take downstairs, I'll take up
HERE: Charley plunges down the stairs to the portico below as Peter disappears into the bedroom, searching for Dandrige.
PETER: Charley comes running down the hall, stopping at the bottom of the stairs, staring up at Peter..
CHARLEY: What is it?
PETER: ( sighing in relief ) I thought I heard something.
IS: Rev. 11/26/84 98.
CHARLEY: The CAMERA PASSES Jerry's bedroom window, catching a glimpse of Peter on the balcony just as he replies to I don't know. Just my nerves, I 151F INT. HOUSE - SECOND-FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT Behind Peter there is suddenly a POUNDING at the attic door. Its Amy, trying to get out. Peter stares wor- riedly at the attic door as the POUNDING from within be- comes more VIOLENT. Suddenly ALL THE CLOCKS on the wall below GO OFF, signaling that it's 6 a.m., dawn, time for Jerry to go to bed. Peter takes his eyes off the clocks as the LAST CHIME DIES, looking at Charley over the Balustrade.

PETER: Keep searching for him. Se's got to be close. It's almost dawn. Charley heads back down the hallway toward the basement as above on the landing, Peter stares around, about to try another door when suddenly the huge stained glass window directly behind and above him bursts apart in an EXPLOSION OF SHATTERING GLASS and Jerry Dandrige plunges in from the outside, landing in a crouch before Peter. He rises as the. older man backs away. Charley rushes down the hail back into the portico, brought by the sound of the crash. He's about to start up the stairs when Dandrige turns and stares down at him. Charley ignores him, starting up the stairs. Peter speaks to him, never taking his gaze from Dandrige.
PETER: Stay there, Charley Charley freezes, staring up at the vampire and the man above, watching, waiting. Dandrige's gaze bores into So. Just the two of us at last.
JERRY: So. Just the two of us at last.
PETER: ( SMILING THINLY )
JERRY: ( SMILING THINLY )
PETER: Look over your shoulder. Dandrige cranes his neck to see the rising dawn through the open window, the sun beginning to glint its golden rays even as he stares at it. He turns back to Peter, roaring with fury.
JERRY: Peter picks up his stake and dives for the vampire, Dandrige is too quick for him. He throws himself off the landing, tucking his body into a somersault as he hurls through the air toward the portico floor below, turning into a whirling ball of spinning flesh only to suddenly emerge- from it no longer a man, but now an enormous bat. The' bat straightens in midair above the portico and zooms down the hallway, smashing into Charley chest high, blowing him off his feet as his claws rake the boy, sending two bloody furrows down his chest as the bat whips past him and disappears down the hallway into the darkness.
PETER: Are you all right?
CHARLEY: Amy begins POUNDING AT THE ATTIC DOOR. above again. The two men look up as it begins to splinter.
PETER: Quick, he's in the basement. He helps the boy. down the hall, the two of them disappear- ing through the basement door. A second later the attic DOOR above RIPS FROM ITS HINGES, CRASHING to the floor. Amy steps out of the attic, her eyes sightless, a stake grasped in her hand.' She walks like an automaton down the stairway toward the portico below..
PETER: Quick, his coffin has to be here
SOMEWHERE: They race down the aisle continuing to rip dust covers away only to discover a line of mirrors, several of them obviously removed from pieces in the house above. They stop, staring at them.
CHARLEY: Well, now we know what he did with the mirrors The DOOR to the stairway- CREAKS open behind them, lost somewhere in the dark. Peter whirls, looking back the way they just came.
PETER: What was that?
.CHARLEY: ( MOVING AWAY )
PETER: But Charley has disappeared into the darkness before Peter can stop him. Charley appears down the row of antiques, stopping at the foot of the stairs and staring up at.the basement door above. It is partially open, allowing just a sliver of light into the darkness. He calls out, clutching his stake Who's there Amy appears out of the darkness behind him, slowly. approaching; her face deathly white, her lips blood red, her eyes almost glowing in the dark. He hears her at the last second, whirling to face her with a gasp. She reads the fear on his face and smiles sadly, reaching out a hand to him.

AMY: Don't be frightened, Charley. She takes a step closer and he steps away. Amy stops, staring at him; then she slowly begins to advance on him, unbuttoning her blouse, her voi ce a husky, purring whisper.
AMY: Charley, I love you ( he backs away; she keeps coming closer, exposing more and more of her body ) What's wrong, Charley, don't you want me anymore? He suddenly breaks her spell, coming to his senses and whip ping out his cross, thrusting it. in her face. She whirls away with a snarl, burying her face in her hands, softly beginning to weep.
AMY: It's not my fault, Charley. You promised you wouldn't let him get me, you promised.

CHARLEY: She whirls, huge fangs flashing, dripping hungry saliva, and dives for his exposed throat. He whips the cross up, but'not in time, her forearm smashing into his wrist, sending the cross whirling away into the darkness. Amy straightens, smiling at him, the. huge fangs sparkling in the light from the open doorway above. -

PETER: Charley, I found it Back at the other end of the room, Charley is backing away from Amy as she slowly stalks him, the stake she picked up in the attic-in her hands. Charley yells back at Peter.
CHARLEY: Get it open! She suddenly leaps for him, .stabbing with the stake only to miss him by inches, sending it plunging through the back of a chair with her growing strength, shattering it against the stone wall behind the chair. She turns on Charley, empty-handed now, continuing.to stalk him. Before-the dais, Peter stifles his revulsion of the rats and leaps forward, rushing to the side of the coffin and fumbling with the clasps only to discover they're locked. he cries out again..
PETER: He'_s locked it somehow from the He grabs a hammer from his pocket and starts pounding at the clasps, trying to free them while at the side of the room Charley continues to back away from Amy, calling back.
CHARLEY: He goes to dodge Amy when she leaps forward, shoving a bureau across his path, blocking his escape. She smiles at him, continuing to back him into a corner.

I: Back at the dais, Peter breaks the last clasp, throws the coffin lid open, sees Jerry resting beneath him, the king vampire's eyes closed. He fumbles a spare stake from his belt, pressing it to the creature's heart, about to slam it home with the hammer when suddenly behind him Charley crashes INTO VIEW on the floor, Amy fixed to his back, rising over his, struggling to sink her fangs in his neck. Peter whirls at the NOISE, momentarily distracted. In the coffin, Jerry's eyes snap open, fixing on Peter. With a snarl he sits right up in the coffin behind Peter, the man turning back only to find himself face to face with the enraged vampire. Jerry opens his mouth, about to kill him when Peter slams it home, missing his heart and impaling his shoulder. The old -actor falls back as the vampire rises out of his coffin, the stake protruding from his shoulder, Amy stopping in her struggle to kill Charley, both she and the boy staring.up at the huge vampire looming over all three. With superhuman deliberation, Dandrige pulls the stake from his chest and hurls it away. It smashes into a far wall, splintering a window, sending a thin ray of light into the room. Dandrige turns on Peter, his face con- vulsed with hatred. He leaps for him, smashing him into a wall, about to sink his fangs into Peter's neck as Charley watches.
CHARLEY: ( SCREAMING}
( SCREAMING}: He desperately leaps around Amy, reaching for the blackout curtain covering the window at the back of the.dais. - She jumps after him, grabbing him just as his fingers close around the curtain. She pulls him to the floor, her mouth open, about to sink her fangs in him as the drape comes with him, tearing from the window and sending a huge bolt of sunlight streaming into the dank room.

JERRY: N000000 - ! As Peter and Charley watch unable to tear their eyes. away, the vampire's body suddenly EXPLODES in a whooshing ball of flame that incinerates him instantly, leaving nothing behind but the ECHOING SCREAM of a soul finally going to Amy rolls off of Charley moaning. He turns to her.
CHARLEY: She slowly opens her eyes, the girl he knew staring back at him, her fangs gone. She throws herself in his arms, weeping softly. He holds her close, staring across the room at Peter who sits beside the coffin, wiping Dandrige's. blood from his face and mouth with his handkerchief, nothing but silence in the room now, the sun shining mer- rily through the window, only a few wisps of charcoal floating lazily through the air to remind any of them what just happened.
