DICKY: ( jumps in front of Micky ) Don't hurt ya hands, we got a fight next week! ( turns to the drunk ) - What you say to my bruthah? What you say to me? OTHER BARTENDER plunks down the drunk's drinks.

DICKY: Ray! Sugah Ray! Ovah heah! Sugar Ray doesn't respond to Dicky. He's talking to the ESPN camera, still looks young, handsome, not a mark on him.
DICKY: We gotta talk latah!
MICKY: Dicky, listen to me. I can't lose again. Look at that guy.
DICKY: Holy shit. [rubs Micky's neck]

MICKY: He did not just get off his fuckin' couch.
DICKY: Look at me, Mick, don't look away.
DICKY: You can't go back to fightin' scared, you gotta hit back like you know you can and I know you can. I don't care who that guy is, you're Micky Ward. Micky nods, but we see he's scared; it's not a fair fight.
DICKY: - Button it up, Ed. If you can't stop the bleedin', we'll fuckin' sue ya. .Ed Aliano smiles, sticks swabs up Micky's nose to stop the bleeding, get everything cleaned out. . .Dicky pours water into Micky's mouth. Micky swishes it around, spits it out.
DICKY: You okay?
MICKY: ( looks up at his brother; knows he can't win )
DICKY: What're you doin' out there? You feel like fightin' or what? You gotta jab and move. Don't stand in front of this guy, keep 'im off ya, jab and move - ( shows him, jabbing the air, moving back & forth ) Jab and move. What are you ascared of? You're fightin' scared again! Micky just nods.
DICKY: We nevah shoulda fought that guy. Forget about it. Alice, HBO's waitin' for us. Sugah Ray's out there! C'mon you come too, Mick. Dicky heads back out. Alice looks at Micky, pats his cheek and follows after Dicky, leaving Micky sitting alone on the trainer's table.
DICKY: RAAAAAAAY! Hey, Ray, The bodyguard stops him. Sugar Ray sees Dicky and waves him over.. .Dicky smiles, missing teeth. The HBO cameraman following after him. Sugar Ray shakes Dicky's hand.
