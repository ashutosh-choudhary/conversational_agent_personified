BLACK SCREEN: A desert wind moans sadly. From somewhere within the wind comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters singing "My Favorite Things." A series of sepia images of anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after another on the screen. In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen. A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing: TITLE: "He who makes a beast of himself The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!: A red Chevy convertible THE RED SHARK wipes the black EXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred miles an hour. THE STONES' "Sympathy For the Devil" blares.

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!: DUKE ( V/O )
GONZO: What are you yelling about?
DUKE: Never mind. It's your turn to drive.
BAT?: EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY IN THE RED SHARK GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a lousy driver.
RADIO NEWS: An overdose of heroin was listed as the official cause of death for pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby whose body was found stuffed in a refrigerator last week.
GONZO: "One toke over the line, sweet One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
DUKE: ( muttering to himself ) One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
GONZO: Let's give that boy a lift.
DUKE: We can't stop here - this is bat
HITCHHIKER: Hot damn! I never rode in a convertible before!
DUKE: Is that right? Well, I guess you're about ready, eh?
GONZO: We're your friends. We're not like the others.
DUKE: ( hissing sharply ) No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
DUKE: ( out loud to himself ) Jesus! Did I say that?
GONZO: ( reassuringly to HITCHHIKER ) It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
DUKE: ( roaring over the road noise )
PROBABLY UNDERSTAND: The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.
DUKE: ( yells )
DUKE: That's good. Because I want you to have all the background. This is a very ominous assignment with overtones of extreme personal danger. I'm a Doctor of Journalism! This is important, goddamnit! This is a true story!.
GONZO: ( screams ) Keep your hands off my fucking neck!
DUKE: ( to HITCHHIKER ) I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you Hell, no!
HITCHHIKER: Hell, no!
DUKE: I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one? How about some ether?
HITCHHIKER: Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills
DUKE: Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills
DUKE: I'm telling you, the Salazar story is getting too complicated. The weasels have started closing in.
DWARF: Perhaps this is the call you've been waiting for all this time,
DUKE: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
DWARF: That was headquarters. They want me to go to Las Vegas at once and make contact with a Portuguese photographer named Lacerda. He'll have the details. All I have to do is check into my sound proof suite and he'll seek me out.
GONZO: God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts. This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you and we'll have to arm Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
DUKE: Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
DUKE: I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
GONZO: Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
DUKE: The Mint 400! The richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune- buggies in the history of organized a fantastic spectacle in honor of some fatback grossero who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel in the heart of downtown Vegas. at least that's what the press release says.
DUKE: We're going to have to drum it up on our own. Pure Gonzo Journalism.
GONZO: O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes. I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking Don't take any guff from these Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
DUKE: Don't take any guff from these Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
GONZO: We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
DUKE: We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
AGENT: Say. uh. you fellas are going to be careful with this car, aren't Of course.
DUKE: Of course.
AGENT: Well, good god! You just backed over that two foot concrete abutment and you didn't even slow down! Forty-five in reverse! And you barely missed the pump!
DUKE: No harm done. I always test the transmission that way. The rear end. For stress factors.
AGENT: Say. Are you fellows drinking?
DUKE: Not me. We're responsible people.
GONZO: There's another worrier. He's probably all cranked up on speed.
DUKE: .and we're chock full of that!
GONZO: Damn right!
DUKE: My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
GONZO: My heart!
DUKE: The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
DUKE: Don't worry, this man has a bad heart. Angina Pectoris. But we have a cure for it.
GONZO: ( suddenly flailing his naked arms at the sky ) Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
DUKE: ( turns up music to full volume ) You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
GONZO: ( laughing uncontrollably ) What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need ( to HITCHHIKER ) Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. ( he begins laughing )
DUKE: ( to HITCHHIKER ) Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. ( he begins laughing )
GONZO: ( to the HITCHHIKER ) The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off and you know what that means, right?
DUKE: And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
HITCHHIKER: Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
DUKE: ( yells ) Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
GONZO: Good riddance. That boy made me nervous. Did you see his eyes? Jesus, this is good medicine.
DUKE: ( suddenly clambering into the front seat ) Move over!! We have to get out of California before that kid finds a It was absolutely imperative that we get to the Mint Hotel before the deadline for press registration. Otherwise, we might have to pay for our suite.
GONZO: Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
DUKE: God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
GONZO: ( waving his .357 Magnum at Duke ) You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
DUKE: You whore!
GONZO: Here chew this. It's your half of the acid.
DUKE: How long do I have?
GONZO: Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
DUKE: I need this, right?
ATTENDANT: I'll remember your face.
EXPLODES!: HI THERE. MY NAME. AH, RAOUL DUKE. ON. ON THAT LIST, THAT'S FOR SURE. FREE LUNCH, FINAL WISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE. WHY NOT? I HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I REALIZE OF COURSE.

GONZO: I can handle this. This man has a bad heart, but I have plenty of medicine. My name is Dr. Gonzo. Prepare our suite at once. We'll be in the bar.
GONZO: ( to the bartender ) Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side. ( opens the envelope ) Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
DUKE: DUKE ( V/O )
DUKE: Order some golf shoes. Otherwise, we'll never get out of this place alive. It's impossible to walk in this muck no footing at all.
GONZO: If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
GONZO: I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to. He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
DUKE: But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
GONZO: ( downs his drink gets up ) That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the No, no. Don't leave me!
DUKE: No, no. Don't leave me!

GONZO: Look, you've got to stop this talk about snakes and leeches and lizards and that stuff. It's making me sick!
DUKE: What are you talking about?
GONZO: You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there.
DUKE: Oh my God! Who's that?! Duke? I'm Lacerda your photographer. Got your press passes? Good, good. Too bad you missed the bikes checking in. My, what a sight!
LACERDA: Duke? I'm Lacerda your photographer. Got your press passes? Good, good. Too bad you missed the bikes checking in. My, what a sight!
LACERDA: Husquavarnas. Yamahas. Kawaskis. Maicos. Pursang. Swedish Fireballs. Couple of Triumphs, here and there a CZ. All very fast. What a race it's gonna be.
LACERDA: Well, we start at dawn. Get a good night's sleep. I know I will.
DUKE: ( weakly ) That's good.
GONZO: I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
DUKE: ( even weaker ) They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
GONZO: Turn that shit off!
DUKE: See."Kill the body and the head will die". the Frazier/Ali fight.
MAGAZINE REPORTER: A proper end to the 60's. Ali beaten by a human hamburger!
DUKE: And both Kennedy's murdered by

VOICE OFF: Group 2!
VOICE OFF: Group 3!
DUKE: A middle-aged HOODLUM in a T-shirt booms up to the bar.
HOODLUM: God damn! What day is this More like Sunday.
DUKE: More like Sunday.
HOODLUM: Hah! That's a bitch, ain't it? Last night I was home in Long Beach and somebody said they were runnin' the Mint 400 today, so I says to my old lady, "Man, I'm goin'." So she gives me a lot of crap about it, so I start slappin' her around, and the next thing you know two guys I never seen before are beating me Group 4!
VOICE OFF: Group 4!
HOODLUM: Then they gave me ten bucks, put me on a bus, and when I woke up here I was in downtown Vegas, and for a minute all I could think was, "O Jesus, who's divorcing me this time?" But then I remembered, by God! I was here for the Mint 400. And, man, I tell you, it's wonderful to be here. Just wonderful to be here with you people.
MAGAZINE REPORTER: Senzaman wassyneeds!

BATTLE HYMN: ".As we go marching on When I reach my final campground, that land beyond the sun, And the Great Commander asks me." [What did he ask you, Rusty?] "Did you fight or did you run?"
BATTLE HYMN: ( continuing ) [And what did you tell them, "We responded to their rifle fire with everything we had."
DUKE: Beats me. We're just good patriotic Americans like yourself.
DUKE: The sporting press. We're friendlies. Hired geeks.
DUKE: If you want a good chase, you should get after that skunk from CBS News up ahead in the black jeep. He's the man responsible for that book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.
HOT DAMN!: DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2
DUKE: Take me back to the pits.
LACERDA: No, no we have to go on. We need total coverage.
DUKE: You're fired.
DUKE: Turn up the radio! Turn up the tape machine! Roll the windows down. Let's taste this cool desert wind! Aaah, yes! This is what it's all about!
GONZO: How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty-nine cent hotdogs.
DUKE: Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
GONZO: To do the job, of course. Here we go. a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
GONZO: As your attorney I advise you to drive over to the Tropicana and pick up on Guy Lombardo. He's in the Blue Room with his Royal
DUKE: Why what?
GONZO: Why what?
DUKE: Why should I pay out my hard-earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse. I don't know about you, but in my line of business it's important to be Hep.
DOORMAN #1: What the hell are you doing?!
DOORMAN #2: You can't park here!
DUKE: Why not? Is this not a reasonable place to park?
GONZO: We want this car parked! We drove all the way from L.A. for this show. We're friends of Debbie's.
DUKE: Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
GONZO: What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
GONZO: Goddamnit, we drove all the way from L.A.
GONZO: Fuck seats! We're old friends of Debbie's. I used to romp with her.
GONZO: Jesus creeping shit!
DUKE: ( tears streaming ) Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
GONZO: ( in hysteria ) We wandered into a fucking time
DUKE: ( in hysteria ) We wandered into a fucking time
GONZO: What's this?.
GONZO: That scum.
GONZO: SCUM! I know where you live! I'll find you and burn down your fucking
DUKE: This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
GONZO: Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
DUKE: ( mumbling ) Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!. Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born. Born?
GONZO: Get sheep over side. women and children to armored car. orders from Captain Zeep.
FAIRGROUND BARKER: Stand in front of this fantastic machine, my friend. For just 99 cents your likeness will appear 200 hundred feet tall on a screen above downtown Las Vegas.
FAIRGROUND BARKER: 99 cents more for a voice message. Say whatever you want, fella. They'll hear you, don't worry about that. Remember, you'll be 200 feet Step right up! Shoot the pasties off the nipples of this ten-foot bull-dyke and win a cotton candy
ANOTHER BARKER: Step right up! Shoot the pasties off the nipples of this ten-foot bull-dyke and win a cotton candy
GONZO: I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
DUKE: Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
GONZO: That's what gives me The Fear.
DUKE: Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
GONZO: Please, don't tell me those things. Not now. This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
DUKE: Not much. Why?
GONZO: I have to go.
DUKE: Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
GO?: Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
GONZO: Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
DUKE: Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
GONZO: No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
DUKE: OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
GONZO: Can we make it?
DUKE: That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
GONZO: I want to leave fast.
DUKE: OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk.
GONZO: ( suddenly to waitress ) Do they pay you to screw that bear?
WAITRESS: He's just kidding. Come on, Doc lets go downstairs and gamble. When does this thing stop?
DUKE: He's just kidding. Come on, Doc lets go downstairs and gamble. When does this thing stop?
GONZO: When does this thing stop?
DUKE: It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
DUKE: Don't move you'll come around.
DUKE: You fell. Let's go.
GONZO: Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
DUKE: Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
GONZO: Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
DUKE: ( turning him in the opposite direction ) Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do. trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
DUKE: Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
GONZO: ( in an extended fall ) You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
GONZO: Those bastards have changed the lock on us. They probably searched the room. Jesus, we're finished!
GONZO: Bolt everything! Use all chains!
GONZO: Where did this one come from?
DUKE: That's Lacerda's room.
GONZO: Yeah. I thought we might need it.
DUKE: What for?
GONZO: Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
DUKE: No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
GONZO: Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
DUKE: He told me he was turning in early. That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
GONZO: That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
DUKE: ( laughing ) That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
GONZO: That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
DUKE: Where'd you get that knife?
GONZO: Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
DUKE: What limes?
GONZO: They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
GONZO: That dirty toad bastard! I knew I should have taken him out when I had the chance. Now he has her.
GONZO: Class? What the fuck do you mean?
GONZO: Use me?
GONZO: ( suddenly shouting ) I ride the BIG ONES! The really BIG fuckers!
DUKE: The Vincent Black Shadow. We're with the Factory Team.
TV CAMERAMAN: GONZO stills becomes dangerous zeros in on the TV CAMERAMAN groin to groin.
GONZO: Wait a minute, pardon me lady, but I think there's some kind of ignorant chicken-sucker in this car who needs his face cut open. You cheap honky faggots! Which one of you wants to get cut?!
GONZO: Spooked! They were spooked! Like rats in a death cage!
GONZO: Goddamn. It's serious now. That girl understood. She fell in love with me.
GONZO: Let's go up there and castrate that
GONZO: ( squinting suspiciously ) Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
DUKE: ( backing slowly towards the door ) Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
MAGAZINE REPORTER: Las Vegas at dawn. The racers are still asleep, the dust is still on the desert, fifty thousand dollars in prize money, slumbers darkly in the office safe at Del Webb's fabulous Mint Hotel.
DUKE: You bastards!
DUKE: You ate ALL THIS ACID?
DUKE: ( turning down the volume ) You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
GONZO: Music! Turn it up. Put that tape What tape?
DUKE: What tape?
GONZO: Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
DUKE: You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
GONZO: I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
DUKE: OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
GONZO: ( coolly ) Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
DUKE: How about a check?
GONZO: Whatever's right.
DUKE: Shit, he's killing himself!
GONZO: ( snarling ) I want that fucking radio!
DUKE: Don't touch it! Get back in that Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING
GONZO: Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING
DUKE: Not me. It would blast you through the wall stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
GONZO: BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
DUKE: Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
GONZO: Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
DUKE: Okay. You're right. This is probably the only solution. Let me make sure I have it all lined up. You want me to throw this thing into the tub when "WHITE RABBIT" peaks. Is that it?
GONZO: Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do Are you ready?
DUKE: Are you ready?
DUKE: MACE! YOU WANT THIS?
GONZO: You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
DUKE: ( laughs ) Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty-five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves.
GONZO: You cheap honky sonofabitch.
DUKE: Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the The cops?
GONZO: The cops?
DUKE: There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
GONZO: ( mumbles ) Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing
DUKE: ( menaces him with the MACE ) Get back in that tub. Eat some reds and try to calm down. Smoke some grass, shoot some smack shit, do whatever you have to do, but let me get some rest.
GONZO: Hell, yes. You really need some sleep. You have to work. Goddamn. What a bummer. Try to rest. Don't let me keep you up.
MUSICIAN: What's the trouble?
DUKE: ( also in slow-motion ) Well, all this white stuff on my sleeve is LSD.
BELL BOY: Room service!
DUKE: ( muttering to himself ) How would Horatio Alger have handled this situation?
CLERK'S VOICE: MR. DUKE!
MR. DUKE!: DUKE freezes.
CLERK'S VOICE: Mr. Duke! We've been looking for The game was up! They had me.
DUKE: ( to himself ) Well, why not? Many fine books have been written in prison.
CLERK: ( thrusts out a TELEGRAM ) This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. does that make sense?
DUKE: ( barely able to speak ) Yes. It makes sense.
CLERK: I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to
DUKE: He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to
CLERK: What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
DUKE: You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes especially with Dr. Gonzo.
CLERK: Tell me. When will the doctor be Awake? What do you mean?
DUKE: ( tenses ) Awake? What do you mean?
CLERK: ( uncomfortably ) Well. the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts. put them on a personal basis. just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
DUKE: Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
CLERK: But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
DUKE: Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
CLERK: There's no hurry! The race is over!
DUKE: ( taking off ) Not for me.
CLERK: Let's have lunch!
DUKE: EXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY DUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.
DUKE: Do me one last favor Lord: just give me five more high-speed hours before you bring the hammer down; just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off of this horrible desert.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Just what the FUCK did you think you were doing?!
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: May I see your license.
DUKE: Of course, officer.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Could I have that, please?
DUKE: Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: You realize.
DUKE: Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: That's a strange attitude.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: You know I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
DUKE: A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you. for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area. your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
DUKE: How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
DUKE: I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Excellent seafood. With a mind like yours, you'll probably want to try the land-crab. Try the Majestic
DUKE: Great Jesus, it's him.
DUKE: They've nailed me! I'm trapped in some stinking desert crossroads called Baker. I don't have much time. The fuckers are closing in. They'll hunt me down like a beast!
GONZO: Who? You sound a little paranoid.
DUKE: You bastard! I need a lawyer What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
GONZO: What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
DUKE: What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the
GONZO: You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the
GONZO'S VOICE: You brainless scumbag! You're supposed to be covering the National District Attorney's conference! I made all the reservations. rented a white Cadillac convertible. the whole thing is arranged! What the hell are you doing out there in the middle of the fucking desert?
DUKE: Never mind. It's all a big joke. I'm actually sitting beside the pool at the Flamingo. I'm talking from a portable phone. Some dwarf brought it out from the casino. I have total credit! Can you grasp Don't come anywhere near this place! Foreigners aren't welcome here!
POLICE CHIEF: What do you mean I'm too late to register? I'm a police chief. From Michigan. Look, fella, I told I have a postcard here that says I have reservations in this hotel.
CLERK: ( prissily ) I'm sorry, sir. You're on the "late list." Your reservations were transferred to the. ah. Moonlight Motel, which is out on Paradise Boulevard.
POLICE CHIEF: I've already paid for my goddamn It's actually a very fine place of lodging and only sixteen blocks from here, with its own pool and.
CLERK: It's actually a very fine place of lodging and only sixteen blocks from here, with its own pool and.
POLICE CHIEF: You dirty little faggot! Call the manager! I'm tired of listening to this dogshit!
CLERK: ( solicitously ) I'm so sorry, sir. May I call you a cab?
CLERK: ( IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION ) Listen, you fuzzy little shithead I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross- section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
DUKE: Say. I hate to interrupt, but I wonder if maybe I could just sort of slide through and get out of your way. Name's Raoul Duke Raoul Duke. My attorney made the
CLERK: Certainly, Mr. Duke!
DUKE: My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
DUKE: Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
CLERK: Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
DUKE: Well, thank you.
DUKE: Ah, home at last!
DUKE: You degenerate pig!
GONZO: It can't be helped. This is Lucy. You knowlike "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
GONZO: Lucy! Lucy, be cool, goddamnit! Remember what happened at the airport! No more of that, okay?
GONZO: Lucy. this is my client. This is Mr. Duke, the famous journalist. He's paying for this suite, Lucy. He's on our side.
GONZO: Mr. Duke is my friend. He loves
GONZO: Lucy paints portraits of Barbra I drew these from TV.
LUCY: I drew these from TV.
GONZO: Fantastic. She came all the way down here from Montana just to give these portraits to Barbra. We're going over to the Americana Hotel tonight to meet her backstage.
DUKE: Well, I guess they brought the car round by now. LET'S GET THE STUFF
GONZO: Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF. Now, we'll be right back. Don't answer the phone if it rings.
LUCY: ( makes one-fingered Jesus freak sign ) God bless.
DUKE: WELL? What are your plans?
GONZO: ( struggling to focus ) Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid. ( he shrugs ) You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized. she's a religious freak. Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
DUKE: ( struggling to focus ) Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid. ( he shrugs ) You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized. she's a religious freak. Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
GONZO: ( struggling to focus ) Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid. ( he shrugs ) You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized. she's a religious freak. Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
DUKE: Well. It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
GONZO: Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
DUKE: She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her. Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
GONZO: Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
DUKE: It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
GONZO: NO! Stop talking like that.
DUKE: I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
GONZO: You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
DUKE: In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
GONZO: NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
DUKE: You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consensual Sodomy. She's got to go. Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help somebody these days.
GONZO: Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help somebody these days.
GONZO: We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
DUKE: What?. What kind of goddamn monster are you?
GONZO: It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely
DUKE: INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET DUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.
DUKE: Hotel Americana? I need a reservation. For my niece. Listen, I need her treated very gently. She's an artist, and might seem a trifle highstrung. Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
GONZO: Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
GONZO: Well that's that. Take off slowly. Don't attract attention.
GONZO: I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
DUKE: That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
GONZO: As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
DUKE: Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
GONZO: Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red
DUKE: Come on, we're going to be late.
GONZO: This goddamn mescaline. Why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure? Maybe mix it up with Rolaids or something.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: ( crackling and booming over the lousy sound system ) On behalf of the prosecuting attorneys of this county, I welcome you to the Third National DA's Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.
GONZO: ( lowers his voice ) I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
DUKE: They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
GONZO: Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
DUKE: Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
GONZO: This is a fucking nightmare.
DUKE: Right. Sure as hell some dope- dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand

DR. BLUMQUIST: We must come to terms with the Drug Culture in the country. country.
GONZO: ( whispers ) What the fuck are these people talking about? You'd have to be crazy on acid to think a joint looked like a goddamn cockroach!
DR. BLUMQUIST: Now, there are four states of being in the cannabis, or marijuana, society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and Square. The square is seldom if ever cool. He is not "with it," that is, he doesn't know "what's happening." But if he manages to figure it out, he moves up a notch to "hip."
DR. BLUMQUIST: I really don't know, but at her age, if she did smoke grass, she'd have one hell of a trip!
GONZO: I know a hell of a lot better ways to waste my time than listening to this bullshit.
GONZO: Fuck you! I have to get out! I don't belong here!

GONZO: You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
DA: They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
GONZO: They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.

DUKE: Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old. with a lot of people watching, too! What happened? What did they do to Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
DA: What happened? What did they do to Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
GONZO: Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
DA: ( DA ad-libs a summation of the crime ) And nobody did anything?
DUKE: What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
GONZO: They just ran back out into Death Valley you know, where Manson turned up.
DUKE: Like big lizards.
GONZO: . and every one of them stacked Yeh, naked!. except for the They were all veterans.

GONZO: Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
DA: A major!
GONZO: We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
DA: Naw! Not a major.
GONZO: He wanted the pineal gland.
DA: That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
GONZO: That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
DUKE: Usually, it's whole families. During the night. Most of them don't even wake up until they feel their heads going and then, of course, it's too late.
WAITRESS: Are you guys with the police convention upstairs?
DA: We sure are, Miss.
WAITRESS: I thought so. I never heard that kind of talk around here before. Jesus Christ! How do you guys stand that kind of work?
GONZO: ( grinning ) We like it. It's groovy.
DUKE: What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
GONZO: Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
DA: ( whacks his fist on the bar ) Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much. But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
GONZO: ( with a conspiratorial nod ) You're going to need to take the bull by the horns go to the mat with this scum.
DA: What do you mean by that?
GONZO: You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
DUKE: Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
DA: ( stupefied )
WHAT?: Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
GONZO: Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
DUKE: We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
DA: ( recovering slightly ) Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
DUKE: Dobermans don't talk.
DA: Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
GONZO: Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
DUKE: They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
DA: God almighty! I don't think I should tell my wife about this. She'd never understand. You know how women are.
DUKE: Just be thankful your heart is young and strong.
DUKE: What's the message? My light is Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
DUKE: Holy shit!
DUKE: Lucy called.
GONZO: The telephone rings. DUKE answers.
CLERK: Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago. I thought I should call again, because I was wondering.
DUKE: ( hand over the PHONE ) What was that crazy bitch said to ( screams ) There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
WHAT?: ( hand over the PHONE ) What was that crazy bitch said to ( screams ) There's a war on, man! People are being killed!

TELEVISION!: CLERK ( V/O )
DUKE: Tell me. What do you want?
DUKE: Crying? Why was she crying?
DUKE: Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully. this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
DUKE: Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
DUKE: Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
GONZO: Good work. They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
DUKE: ( slowly, carefully ) Lucy is looking for you.
GONZO: ( laughing ) No, she's looking for you.
DUKE: She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself. I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
GONZO: She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself. I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?

GONZO: OK, goddamnit!. Look. I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
DUKE: It's gone too far.
GONZO: Relax. Let me handle this. You'd make a piss-poor lawyer. .Room 1600, please. As your attorney, I advise you not to worry. Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
DUKE: What is this?
GONZO: You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer.
DUKE: ( into PHONE ) Hi, Lucy? Yeah, it's me. I got your message.what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget. what? No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out.
GONZO: ( into PHONE ) Hi, Lucy? Yeah, it's me. I got your message.what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget. what? No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out.
GONZO: ( to PHONE ) But here's the problem. That bastard cashed a bad check downstairs and gave you as a reference. They'll be looking for both of you. Yeah, I know, but you can't judge a book by its cover, Lucy. Some people are just basically rotten. Anyway, the last thing you want to do is call this hotel again; they'll trace the call and put you straight behind bars. no, I'm moving to the Tropicana right away. I have to go, they've got the phone tapped. Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but it's all over now. OH MY GOD!
GONZO: Well. That's that. She's probably stuffing herself down the incinerator about now. That's the last we should be hearing from Lucy. Where's the opium?
DUKE: Where'd you get this?
GONZO: Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
DUKE: Jesus. what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
GONZO: I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
GONZO: Yeah, they nailed this guy for child molesting. He swore he didn't do it. "Why should I fuck with children?" he says. "They're too small." Christ, werewolf is entitled to legal counsel. I didn't dare turn the creep down. He might have picked up a letter opener and gone after my pineal Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
DUKE: Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
GONZO: Some of what?
DUKE: ( spitting words ) Extract of pineal!
GONZO: ( STARING AT DUKE WITH A STRANGE SMILE ) Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
GONZO: Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two . grow claws. bleeding warts.
DUKE: . grow claws. bleeding warts.
GONZO: . grow claws. bleeding warts.
DUKE: . then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your

DUKE: DUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY at the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM. His heels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED,
GONZO: you'd go blind. your body would turn to wax. they'd have to put you in a wheelbarrow and.
GONZO: Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
DUKE: FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
GONZO: Jesus, that stuff got right on top of you, didn't it.
DUKE: Maybe you could just. shove me into the pool, or something.
GONZO: If I put you in the pool right now, you'd sink like a goddamn stone. You took too much. Jesus, look at your face, you're about to explode.
GONZO: Don't try and fight it, or you'll get brain bubbles. Strokes, aneurysms. You'll just wither up and die.

GONZO: Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
MAID: No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
DUKE: Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
MAID: No! I swear I'm not!
GONZO: ( long pause ) In that case, maybe she can help.
MAID: Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
DUKE: So do we, lady.
GONZO: ( helping her up ) I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
DUKE: Do you think you can handle it?
MAID: One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
GONZO: One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
MAID: You'd pay me for that?
DUKE: You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
MAID: Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
GONZO: Alright, Alice. you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
DUKE: Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
MAID: Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
GONZO: You and a lot of other people.
DUKE: The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
MAID: I fear nothing.
GONZO: Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
MAID: Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened.
