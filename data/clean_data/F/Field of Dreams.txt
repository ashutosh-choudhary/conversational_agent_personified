DISSOLVE TO: 2 THE CORNFIELD - DUSK It is dusk on a spring evening. The sky is a robin's-egg blue, and the wind is soft as a day-old chick. Ray Kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice like that of a public address announcer speaks to him.
THE VOICE: 'If you build it, he will come.' Ray looks up and around, but sees nothing that could be the source of this sound. All around him are empty fields. He stands quietly for a few moments, then goes back to 'If you build it, he will come.' Ray jerks his head in all directions to see where this voice is coming from, but again, he sees nothing unusual just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet away, the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three sides. On the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where Annie and Karin sit, sipping lemonade and dreaming.

RAY: Just now. Like an announcement. Annie confers briefly with Karin, then calls back to Ray.
ANNIE: We didn't hear anything.
RAY: Ray thinks for a second, then shakes it off, trying to dislodge that thought from his mind, and gets back to work.
THE VOICE: 'If you build it, he will come.' Again, he bolts upright and looks around. Again, he sees nothing. This is beginning to bug him. He calls:
RAY: Okay, you must've heard that.
ANNIE: Sorry. Come on. Dinner. Annie leads Karin inside.
RAY: Was there like a sound truck on the highway, or something?

ANNIE: Nope. You really hearing voices?
RAY: Just one.
ANNIE: Ah. God?
RAY: More like a. . .ballpark announcer. Annie shoots him an "Are you kidding?" look. Ray responds with a shrug. They sit down to eat.
ANNIE: What'd it say?
RAY: 'If you build. it, he will come.'
ANNIE: If you build what, who will come?
RAY: ( SHRUGS )
ANNIE: Ooh, I hate it when that happens.
RAY: Me too.
CUT TO: 6 RAY AND ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT They are snuggled together, asleep. All is quiet. Then:
THE VOICE: 'If you build it, he will come.' Ray's eyes pop open. He looks at Annie, who does not stir. Without moving, he looks around the room. There is no one there. Very quietly, he crosses to the window and looks out. He whispers out toward the cornfield:
RAY: Build what? For who?
CONTINUED: 6 CONTINUED 6
ANNIE: It's okay, honey, I'm just-talking to the cornfield. He sighs and goes back to bed. Annie cuddles up to him. Her eyes are closed, but Ray's eyes remain open. He is puzzled and concerned.

CUT TO: 7 TELEVISION SCREEN
L: ittle Karin is watching Harvey while she eats her breakfast. Ray enters, looking like he had very little sleep, and promptly turns the TV set off.
KARIN: Why'd you do that? It was funny.
RAY: Trust me, Karin, it's not funny. The man is sick. He's very sick. Annie enters, putting on her coat.
ANNIE: Karin, if you're finished, get your coat and school bag. Let's go. Karin bolts from the table.
RAY: Uh honey, I'll take her today. I'v-e got some errands in town.
ANNIE: Far out. She takes off her coat and kisses Ray as he takes-the car keys and heads outside. Annie sits at the kitchen table.

CUT TO: 9 EXT. IOWA CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY 9 Ray's car pulls up, Karin runs out and Ray drives off.
CUT TO: 10 INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY 10 Ray is plugged into some weird-looking contraption, having his hearing examined. Then the Doctor shines a penlight into his eyes, shrugs, and starts putting his gear away.
DOCTOR: Well, I can't find anything wrong. I could recommend a shrink, but hey, people hear things all the time. I heard a voice once. I was still living with my parents, 'then. They worked in the circus, so I was raised in the circus, and I was training to be a clown. This one day, I'm putting on my little red nose and I hear a voice, tells me to go to medical school. Here I am. Ray is not sure if he should ignore this or run.
CUT TO: 11 FARM SUPPLY STORE - DAY 11 Farmers are loading up with seed, fertilizer, and other farmer stuff. This is the kind of place where people also linger to exchange gossip, swap lies, and pass the time. Ray is off to one side, chewing the fat with an old-timer.

RAY: In all those years, did you ever.
RAY: ( QUICKLY )
CASHIER: ( calls from her
RAY: No! No, I'm not. Really. But the people still stare. Ray addresses them.
RAY: Noises! That darn tractor, it's. ( forces a nervous
LAUGH ): Well, I'll just get some 3-in-1 oil, that should.
CUT TO: 12 RAY'S FARM - DAY 12 Ray is out in the fields again, hard at work. A breeze picks up. He stops fora moment, cocks an ear and looks around. All he sees are the empty fields. Insects make the only sounds. He goes back to work. Then:
THE VOICE: 'If you build it, he will come.'
CONTINUED: 12 CONTINUED 12
RAY: All right, who are you, and what the hell do you want from me?!? All he hears is a faraway echo.
THE VOICE: 'If you build it, he will come.' This is serious. Ray shakes his head and repeats the words to himself.
RAY: If you build it. As he thinks about these words,,some unexplained impulse causes Ray to turn his head deliberately toward a portion of the cornfield between him and the house.
FLASH CUT: 13 A BASEBALL FIELD L3 For the briefest of moments, the dreamlike image of a baseball field at night, illuminated by floodlights, flares in over the lawn. Standing on the edge of the field, is the figure of a man with his back to us. Before we can see anything else, the image disappears.
RAY: . he will come'.
FLASH CUT: i5 THE MAN AND THE FIELD 1 5 The dream image flares in again, this time closer to the man. He stands in the middle distance, silhouetted by the lights, and we see he is wearing a uniform of some kind. He starts to turn slowly towards us, but before we can see his face, the image disappears.
RAY: .he will come.
FLASH CUT: 17 THE MAN
18 RAY: Wheels are turning inside his head. He is trying to figure all this out. In the distance, a bell is ringing. He looks O.S.
ANNIE: Yo, Ray! Food!
ANNIE: Hiya, cutie. Ray climbs up the steps, accepts her kiss, and instead of following her into the house, pulls her down with him onto the swing. He takes-her hand and looks into her eyes.

THE: family is eating dinner. Ray seems lostin thought.
ANNIE: Hey, you don't suppose this could be like an acid flashback, do you?
RAY: I never took acid.
ANNIE: Maybe you will someday, and it's a flash Annie, there's more.
RAY: Annie, there's more.
ANNIE: You're subscribing to the Enquirer.

RAY: CUT TO
CUT TO: 23 INT. KARIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Ray and Annie are putting little Karin to bed.
ANNIE: Boy, I thought my family was crazy, but this.this is the craziest thing I've ever heard.
RAY: I know. It's totally nuts.
ANNIE: I mean, Shoeless Joe, he's.
RAY: ( NODS )
ANNIE: And he's the one they suspended, right?
ANNIE: He still dead?
RAY: Far as I know.
CUT TO: 24 INT.'BATHROOM - NIGHT Ray and Annie in their pajamas, brushing their teeth, getting ready for bed.
ANNIE: You know what amazes me? No one could ever get you to believe in astrology, or ESP, or reincarnation, or heaven, or any of that stuff. But this.I think this shows real personal growth, Ray.
RAY: Thank you. Annie smiles, but sees that Ray is troubled. She hugs him.
ANNIE: Oh, sweetie. I hope you know that even though I make jokes, I'm going to visit you every month wherever they put you. He offers her a weak smile and exits.
CUT TO: 25 INT. RAY AND'ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT It is dark. For a few seconds it is quiet. Then:
RAY: Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing?
ANNIE: If I did, I'd forgotten it. Ray sits up in the dark.
RAY: I always felt cheated I never got to see him play. He was supposed to be so graceful, and agile. So to actually get to see him play again.to let him play again, to right an old wrong. He shakes his head in wonder just to think of it. Annie turns on the light.
ANNIE: Wait a minute, Bosco. Are you actually thinking of doing this?
CONTINUED: 25 CONTINUED ( THEN )
25 CONTINUED: ( THEN )
RAY: ( THEN )
ANNIE: What's your father got to do with this? Ray tries to picture his father in his mind. He speaks softly, but the words obviously have a great deal of meaning for him.
RAY: I never forgave him for getting old. By the time he'was as old as I am now, he was ancient. He must have had dreams, but he never did anything about them. For all I know, he may have even heard voices, too, but he sure didn't listen to them. The man never did one spontaneous thing in all the years I knew him. Annie, I'm scared that that's what growing up means. I'm afraid of that happening to me. And something tells me this may be my last chance to do something about it. ( looks at her ) I want to build that field. Do you think I'm crazy? She looks at him with great understanding.
ANNIE: He smiles wanly. She touches his face lovingly.
ANNIE: I also think that if you feel you really have to do this. then you should do it. They hold each other's gaze, and Ray cannot remember when he has loved her so much. He takes her in his arms. Outside their window, the field of corn lies waiting.
CUT TO: 26 THE CORNFIELD - DAY Stalks of corn wave slowly in the breeze. A bee buzzes near one. The light is yellow. Suddenly, the stalks bend violently to the ground as Ray's tractor plows them under.
RAY: Ty Cobb called him the greatest left fielder of all time. His glove was called 'the place where triples go to
RAY: I mean if he was supposed to be throwing it, how do you explain the fact he hit 375 for the series and didn't commit one error? Huh?
KARIN: I can't.
CONTINUED: 34 CONTINUED 34, Twelve hits, including the series' only home run. And they said he was trying to lose!
RAY: Twelve hits, including the series' only home run. And they said he was trying to lose!
KARIN: It's ridiculous.
CASHIER: That's 855 dollars, sixty-four cents. From O.S., we hear oooh. Ray turns and notices for the first time that a crowd of spectators employees and customers has been watching him and whispering among themselves. They look at him as if he had two heads. Ray turns his attention back to writing a check for his purchases. He deadpans to Annie:
RAY: We'd better notify Mars to send us more Remlak won't like that.
ANNIE: ( EQUALLY DEADPAN )
RAY: That's his problem. And tell him to make it in Earth dollars this time. Ray hands over the check to the open-mouthed cashier.
RAY: Thank you. Have a nice day. Ray and Annie turn and leave with Karin. The farmers watch, obviously trying hard to figure this one out.
CUT TO: 35 BUILDING THE OUTFIELD WALL - DAY 35 Ray hammers the braces that will support the outfield wall. Karin hands him nails from a bag she wears around her neck.
CONTINUED: 35 CONTINUED 35
KARIN: Then what happened?
RAY: The Commissioner of Baseball suspended eight of the players including the great Shoeless Joe Jackson for life.
KARIN: What's suspend?
RAY: They never let him play the game again. They continue to work in silence.
CUT TO: 37 INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE I 7 Ray writes a check for his purchases: bats, balls, bases pitcher's rubber, home plate, etc. He appears slightly annoyed that once again, he is being stared at by all the uniformed employees of the store. He turns to catch the Store Owner staring at him the most intently.
RAY: What. What!
STORE OWNER: You're the fella that plowed under your corn and built a baseball diamond, Yeah. What about it?
RAY: Yeah. What about it?
STORE OWNER: ( shakes his hand ) Greatest damn thing I ever heard. The other employees beam their agreement.
RAY: At these prices, I'm not surprised.
CONTINUED: 37 CONTINUED
37 CONTINUED: He wheels his shopping cart of sporting goods out through a gauntlet of approving salesmen. They smile and pat him on the back. Ray cannot decide if they're crazier than he Thank you.thank you.
RAY: Thank you.thank you.
CUT TO: 38 THE LIGHT STANDARD - NIGHT 38 Atop the aluminum-painted poles, an array of store-bought floodlights switch on, flaring against the blue-black sky. In this sharp white light the grass glows parrot green, cool as mint, soft as a cashmere blanket. Annie and Karin watch as Ray puts down the clean white bases, which pick up the light like little moons on a cold, clear night.
RAY: My father said he saw him years later playing under a made-up name in some tenth-rate league in Carolina. He'd put on fifty pounds, and the spring was gone from his step, but he could still hit. Dad used to say no one could hit like Shoeless Joe. Ray is smiling wistfully.
ANNIE: That's the first time I've ever seen you smile as you mentioned your father. Ray considers that.
KARIN: How come?
ANNIE: Come on, you. Bed time. Annie hoists Karin on her shoulders with a grunt, and the three climb their way down the bleachers. Ray's hand steadies Annie as she takes one of the steps.
RAY: Moonl ight butters the Iowa night. They walk along the side of the field, and Ray stops. He looks at the field.
CONTINUED: 38 CONTINUED 38
RAY: I have just created something totally That's what I like about it.
ANNIE: That's what I like about it.
RAY: Am I completely nuts?
ANNIE: Not completely. She looks out over the baseball field.
ANNIE: It's a good baseball field, Ray.
RAY: It is kinda pretty, isn't it? Annie smiles at him and carries Karin inside. Ray steps onto the porch and flicks the switch shutting off the floodlights over the field.
CUT TO: 39 RAY AND ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 39 Annie opens her eyes and sees Ray not beside her in bed, but in th window seat, looking out at the empty field. Barely awake, she gets out of bed, shuffles to his side and curls up against him.
ANNIE: Any sign?
RAY: Something's going to happen out there. I can feel it. Annie lowers her head against his chest and goes back to sleep. Outside, the trees are fully leafed.
DISSOLVE TO: 40 RAY'S BASEBALL FIELD - OCTOBER 40 The trees are almost bare now, and there's a Halloween pumpkin in the front window of the house. The cornstalks

DISSOLVE TO: 41 THE BASEBALL FIELD - LATE DECEMBER 41 it is covered with snow.
DISSOLVE TO: 43 SPRINGTIME - DAY A baby robin tries to pull a worm out of the around. Inside the house, Annie is doing spring cleaning. She looks out the window to see:
45 ANNIE: just watches him.
CUT TO: 46 TV SCREEN 46
KARIN: Daddy, what's a southpaw?
CONTINUED: 47 CONTINUED
47 CONTINUED: A left-handed pitcher.
RAY: A left-handed pitcher.
ANNIE: Well, given how much less acreage we have for corn, I'd say we'll probably .almost break even.
RAY: We've spent all our savings on that KARIN ( O.S. ) Just a minute, Karin.
ANNIE: We've spent all our savings on that KARIN ( O.S. ) Just a minute, Karin.
RAY: Just a minute, Karin.
ANNIE: ( SADLY )
RAY: ( a little testy ) In a minute, Karin.
ANNIE: We'll put up some coffee. You go ahead. Ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda. The night sky seems close enough to touch.
53 RAY: walks through the swirling ground mist toward the field.
55 RAY: Ray's mouth is dry. He reaches home plate and picks up one of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls. The back of his neck tingles. Then, he picks up one of the balls.
RAY: How's the field play?
THE MAN: It's good. The ball bounces true. Ray smiles with pride. He tosses up another ball, gives it his best swing, and is thrilled to see he has actually lofted one into the air. But into center field. The Man sprints across the outfield, and makes a lovely catch in short center. Instead of throwing the ball in, the Man runs it in, loping toward home plate. Ray's heart thumps.
RAY: The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel its weight.
RAY: Ray Kinsella.
THE MAN: Joe Jackson. Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken. It is Shoeless Joe Jackson after all, who stands not five feet away from him, trying out all the bats now. Ray isn't quite sure if he should talk, or ask questions, or just stand there. Finally, he can't help himself.
RAY: I bet its good to be playing again, It was like having part of me amputated.
SHOELESS JOE: It was like having part of me amputated.
CONTINUED: 58 CONTINUED
58 CONTINUED: Joe looks over at Ray, now, his dark eyes evincing the pain his steady voice tries to conceal.
SHOELESS JOE: I've heard that old man wake up and scratch itchy legs that've been dust for fifty years. That was me. I'd wake up in the night with the smell of the ballpark in my nose and the cool of the grass on my feet. The thrill of the He has found the bat he likes.
SHOELESS JOE: Can you pitch?
RAY: ( WITH FALSE MODESTY )
MODESTY ): Yeah, I'm not bad. Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls. Ray can barely contain his excitement as he races to the mound. He stands on the rubber and faces Joe at the plate.
RAY: Don't we need a catcher?
SHOELESS JOE: Not if you can get it near the plate, we don't. Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during which he says aloud to himself:
RAY: I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson. He makes a pitch. It's not a very good one, and Joe has to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful. He drives the ball against the fence. Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch. Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball.
RAY: See if you can hit my curve. °He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear.
CONTINUED: 58 CONTINUED ( 2 ) 58
RAY: Yes, he can hit the curve.
SHOELESS JOE: Stick with fast balls, kid.
RAY: You bet. Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down the third base line. Then a smoker down the first base line. Ray is mightily impressed.
RAY: SHOELESS JOE
SHOELESS JOE: Damn, this feels good. Put it right here, huh? Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches it reasonably close to that spot. Jackson hits it out of the park, and beams. Ray brightens up with remembrance.
RAY: Right, you were a low ball hitter.
SHOELESS JOE: Oh man, I did love this game. You know, I'd have played for food money. it was the game, the sounds, the smells. You ever held a glove or a ball to your Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound.
RAY: SHOELESS JOE
SHOELESS JOE: And it was riding the trains from town to town. And the hotels with brass spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds in the rooms. And it was the crowd getting to their feet when the ball was hit deep. Shoot, I'd have played for The sound of a screen door turns their. attention to the house. Annie and Karin are coming out to them.
RAY: My family. Jackson nods and then points to the floodlights.

SHOELESS JOE: What's with the lights?
RAY: "All the stadiums have them now except Wrigley Field.
SHOELESS JOE: Makes it harder to see the ball.
RAY: The owners found that more people could attend night games.
SHOELESS JOE: ( SHAKES HEAD )
RAY: Mr. Jackson: my wife Annie, my daughter Joe. Ma'm.
SHOELESS JOE: Joe. Ma'm.
KARIN: Are you a ghost? Ray and Annie are instantly embarrassed, and try to cover with forced, nervous laughter.
RAY: ( to Shoeless Joe ) She's just kidding.
SHOELESS JOE: It's okay.
SHOELESS JOE: Then I guess I'm real.
ANNIE: Would you like to come inside'?
CONTINUED: 58 CONTINUED ( 4 ) 58 SHOELESS JOE
SHOELESS JOE: Uh, thanks, but.I don't think I can. Ray and Annie look at Joe for a moment, not quite understanding the ground rules here. Joe senses their discomfort and changes the subject.
SHOELESS JOE: Hey, can I come back again?
RAY: Yeah. I built this for you.
SHOELESS JOE: There are others, you know. There were eight of us. It'd sure mean a lot to Oh man, anytime. They're all welcome Joe looks out over the field in eager anticipation of the good times to come.
RAY: Oh man, anytime. They're all welcome Joe looks out over the field in eager anticipation of the good times to come.
SHOELESS JOE: Thank you, Ray. I appreciate it. See you later, huh?
RAY: Yeah. See you later.
KARIN: Say it ain't so, Joe! Joe laughs and walks to the outfield. Annie puts her arm around Ray and snuggles her head against his chest. Nearby, brook water splashes softly in the darkness, a frog shrills, and fireflies dazzle the night. Joe is in the outfield grass now, walking toward a door cut into the fence.
ANNIE: Where's he going?
RAY: ( SMILING )
ANNIE: Since when is there a door in the fence?

MARK: How could you plow under your major What's a crop? Karin enters breathlessly.
RAY: ( TO ANNIE )
KARIN: Daddy, the baseball game is on. Ray beams. Karin returns the smile and reaches her arms out to be picked up. She scissors her legs around her father at belt level, hugging his neck.
RAY: Excuse us. He exits, carrying Karin. Mark shakes his head.
MARK: I don't believe this guy. I'm trying to bail him out and he goes off to watch Annie stifles a laugh.

ANNIE: Kidding. I'm kidding! Her family has no sense of humor about this whatsoever.
ANNIE: I think we need more cheese. She goes into the kitchen, and when she has rounded the corner, she raises her eyes to heaven and mutters:
ANNIE: 60 THE FIELD 6 0
RAY: Watch Joe. Watch his feet as the pitcher gets the sign and starts to pitch. A good left fielder knows what pitch is coming, and he can tell from the.angle of the bat where the ball's going to be hit. At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls, takes five loping strides toward the fence, turns again', reaches up, and the ball smacks into his glove. Karin cheers. One of the players good-naturedly boos.

MARK: I thought you two were going to watch some game.
RAY: Oh, I guess it's not really a game. It's more like a practice. Mark looks at his wife and Mother with concern. Ray doesn't understand this reaction.
RAY: See, there's only eight of them, so they can't play a real game.
MARK: Eight of what? Ray points to the noisy players on the field.
RAY: Now, Mother and Dee look as if they're about to go into mourning. Mark kneels next to Karin.

Some of the articles include: "Where is Terence Mann Now That We Really Need Him?". ."20 Rumors About America's Greatest Living Ex-Writer" . and , "Terence Mann: Still Ignoring Us After All These Years ". The photographs show Mann to be a large black man with gentle eyes.
RAY: By the early Seventies, the guy decides people have become either too extremist or too apathetic to listen to him. So he stops writing books. He starts writing poetry. About whales and stuff. Then, he starts fooling around with a home computer, and gets hooked. Know what he does now? Annie shakes her head no.
RAY: He writes software for interactive children's videos. They teach kids how to resolve conflicts peacefully. What an amazing guy..

ANNIE: Mmm. Some kind of team sport?
RAY: Annie, he was a baseball fanatic! Listen to this: He finds a page and reads from it:

Lunatic drivers abound. We are not in Iowa anymore.

He enters an open hallway in which he sees the door to the storefront, as well as stairs to the apartments above it. There are half-a-dozen mail boxes on the wall. Ray checks the names. He smiles.
84 RAY: Ray turns to the storefront door. Instead of a buzzer there is a long wire with a weight on its end hanging from a hole at the top of the door. Next to the wire is a handwritten note taped to the door, which reads: "You better have a goddamn good reason for ringing this bell." Ray laughs. This guy is great. He pulls on the wire. On the other side of the door, a bell rings. Ray has to struggle to control his nervousness. He takes a breath. He hears footsteps inside, approaching the door. He cannot help but smile with delight at the thought of meeting one of his cultural heroes. The door opens. Terence Mann is menacingly huge. He glares at Ray and roars:
MANN: Who the fuck are you???- Ray is momentarily taken aback, but he figures maybe the guy is joking, so he just smiles and plunges ahead.
RAY: Sir, my name is Ray Kinsella, and it's a great pleasure 'Co finally - The door slams in his face. It takes Ray a few seconds to realize the interview is over. He rings the bell again. The door opens. Mann°s large frame fills it.

Looking around the old ballpark, they see only about twenty or thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice; a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage as one player hits to several others in the field. A few sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts. Ray and Mann stop at the first row, right behind the Red Sox on-deck circle, lean on the railing and talk.
RAY: It could be 1912 out there, for all this place has changed. Babe Ruth stood on that very mound as a pitcher long before anyone knew he could hit home runs. Same mound.

RAY: You'll think I'm crazy.
MANN: I already think you're crazy. What did it say? After a little thought, Ray smiles sadly.
RAY: It said 'The man's done enough. Leave him alone.' Ray puts the car in gear, makes a wide turn, and starts to head back up the street. But he stops short when Mann's form looks out of the darkness into the glare of the Ray does not know why Mann is blocking his path. Or why he appears tense, almost frightened.

After Virginia, Minnesota, all the land is scarred. Above the town the mines sit like sand-colored bunkers in the cliffs,- stern and silent. Near Chisholm, the land is getting ever weirder. It looks like a pasture rooted and rerooted by giant hogs. It has been split and gutted; greenery has grown back, but at weird and unnatural angles. But as they swing into town; the highway divides and they cross a beautiful and tranquil lake, so smooth and shiny it might be a scene painted on a glass plate. A sign reads

VEDA: .'And there were times when children could not afford eyeglasses or milk, or clothing. Yet no child was ever denied these essentials, because in the background, there was always Doctor Graham. Without any fanfare or publicity, the glasses or the milk or the ticket to the ball game found their way into the child's pocket.'
MANN: You wrote that.
VEDA: The day he died.

SMOKER: 'Cept he was always, I mean always, losing them. Stores 'round town would just lean his umbrella somewhere near the door, and if anybody asked, they'd just say 'Oh, that's Doc's umbrella'.

RAY: That's very nice of you.
MOTEL MANAGER: Well, it's funny. It's like all these memories we have of Doc had gone to sleep and sunk way down inside us. But once you started asking about him, and started us talking about him, why they swum back up to the surface again. Ray smiles.

He nods at an elderly man who passes him on the street. He passes a darkened house and notices there is a sign of some kind in its unlit front window. He takes another two or three steps before he has, to stop to take a better look at the sign.
114 RAY: is puzzled. He turns and looks at the theatre marquee.
116 RAY: frowns. He says the word to himself.
RAY: Ray now looks at the car parked nearest to him.
RAY: Doctor Graham? Slowly, the man stops and turns back to face Ray. Ray starts to trot to him.
ELDERLY MAN: Who's that?
RAY: My name is Ray Kinsella. I'm from Iowa. Are you Moonlight Graham? The old man narrows his bright eyes to see Ray more No one's called me 'Moonlight' Graham for fifty years.
DOC GRAHAM: No one's called me 'Moonlight' Graham for fifty years.
RAY: Well, I've come.
HIMSELF ): . a very long way to see you.
DOC GRAHAM: Funny. I couldn't sleep tonight. Usually, I sleep like a baby. So I told Alicia I was going to take a walk.
RAY: Mind if i join you? I'd like to talk to you. Doc nods and they start to walk.
DOC GRAHAM: Let's go to the high school. We can sit in my office. What do. you want to talk Well, first of all, how'd you get to be called 'Moonlight'?
RAY: Well, first of all, how'd you get to be called 'Moonlight'?
DOC GRAHAM: 'Cause of a night like this, long ago. I'd just gotten to the minors, and I went out to the ballpark.
CONTINUED: 121 CONTINUED
121 CONTINUED: DOC GRAHAM ( Cont'd} There's nothing as peaceful as a ballpark at night. Like a church.
RAY: Yeah, I know what you mean.
DOC GRAHAM: Anyway, I fell asleep. Next morning, they found me in the on-deck circle, all curled up like a baby. Someone called me 'Moonlight,' and it stuck.
RAY: When you got to the majors, you played only one inning of one game. What happened in that inning?
DOC GRAHAM: It was the last day of the season. Bottom of the eighth, and we were way ahead. I'd been up with the club for most of a month, but hadn't seen any action. Just then old John McGraw points a bony finger at me and says 'Right field.' Well sir, I jumped up like I was sitting on a spring, grabbed my glove, and ran out onto the field. They reach a varnished door with an opaque glass inset, and enter. Doc Graham's office.
RAY: Did you get to make a play? Doc takes a sheet of paper off his desk, expertly rips an inch or so off the corner with his teeth, and begins Nope. They never hit the ball out of the infield. Ray chuckles, but then flinches as Doc shoots his little spitball towards him.

DOC GRAHAM: Nope. They never hit the ball out of the infield. Ray chuckles, but then flinches as Doc shoots his little spitball towards him.
DOC GRAHAM: Heads up. It hits the back of the sofa a few feet from Ray, and hangs there, like a white fly.
RAY: I was warned about you.
DOC GRAHAM: Anyway, one inning later the game was over, and so was I.
RAY: And what was that like?
DOC GRAHAM: It was like coming this close to your dreams, and then watching them brush past you like a stranger in a crowd. Ray nods, and a look of understanding begins to appear on his face. He looks out the window, focused on faraway.
DOC GRAHAM: Except, at the time, you don't think much of it. Hardly anybody recognizes the most significant moment of their life when they're happening. Back then I just figured there'd be plenty more days. I didn't know that would be the only one. Doc Graham notices that Ray is looking very serious.
DOC GRAHAM: Now, let me ask you a question, Ray Kinsella. What makes that half-inning so interesting that you come all the way from Iowa to ask me about it sixty-five years later? Ray chooses his words carefully.
CONTINUED: 124 CONTINUED ( 2 ) 124
RAY: I didn't really know till just now. But I think it's to ask you if you could do anything you wanted to.if you could have a wish.
DOC GRAHAM: Doc nods. his understanding. He smiles wryly, takes a new piece of paper, and bites off a little section.
DOC GRAHAM: And are you the kind of man who could grant me that wish?
RAY: I don't know. I'm just asking. Doc leans his left elbow on the desk and rubs his forehead thoughtfully with a palm, as if it were an eraser that could erase the years and take him back to 1929 and the Polo Grounds in New York.
DOC GRAHAM: I never got to bat in the major leagues. I'd have liked the chance just once to stare down a big league pitcher. Stare him down and then just as he goes into the windup wink! Make him wonder if I know something he doesn't. That's what I wish for. The chance to squint my eyes when the sky is so blue it hurts to look at it, and to feel the 'tingle that runs up your arms when you connect dead-on. The chance to run the bases, stretch a double to a triple, and flop race-first into third, wrapping my arm around the bag. That's my wish, Ray Kinsella. that's my wish. Ray begins to smile. Graham is staring intently at him.
DOC GRAHAM: Is there enough magic floating around in the night out there for you to make that wish come true?
RAY: What would you do if I said 'Yes'?
DOC GRAHAM: I think I might actually believe you.
CONTINUED: 124 CONTINUED ( 3 )
RAY: There is a place where things like that happen. And if you want to go there, I can take you. Doc's eyes start to glisten, and he offers an embarrassed smile as he wipes away a tear.
DOC GRAHAM: If it means leaving Chisholm. He shakes his head.no. Ray is surprised.
RAY: I understand, but I think you're supposed to come with us.
DOC GRAHAM: This is my most special place in the world, Ray. Once a place touches you like this, the wind never blows so cold again. You feel for it like it was your child. I can't leave here. Ray cannot believe the man won't leave Chisholm for his But your wish.
RAY: But your wish.
DOC GRAHAM: It'll stay one. I was born here, lived here, and I'll die here. That's okay. I'll have no regrets.
RAY: But sixty-five years ago for five minutes you came this close. ( holds up two
FINGERS ): It would kill some men to get that close to their dream and never touch it. They'd consider it a tragedy.
DOC GRAHAM: Son.if I'd only gotten to be a doctor for five minutes. .now that would have been a tragedy. Those words fill up the room, and Ray sinks back against the couch.

RAY: And then I figured maybe we're not supposed to take him with us. So now I don't know why the hell we were supposed to come here.

RAY: He never made it as ball player, so he tried to get his son to make it for him. By the time I was ten, playing baseball got to be like eating vegetables or taking out the garbage, so when I was fourteen, I started to refuse. Can you believe that?

RAY: Archie Graham now wearing a Giant's uniform drops one of the two bats he has been swinging in the on-deck circle, and advances on the plate, slashing the air with a brand-new bat the color of vanilla ice cream. He plants himself in the batter's b.ox, then cocks the bat, the top end of it trembling as if he were stirring something, and waits for the pitch.' The pitcher looks in for his signs. Archie stares back. As the pitcher goes into his windup, Archie winks at him. There is a moment of confusion and then anger on the pitcher's face, and when the ball speeds to the plate it is aimed right at Archie's head. He dives out of the way and hits the dirt hard. The Catcher chuckles through his Good thing for you that wasn't his Archie digs in again at the plate, but backs up just a little. Now his look to the pitcher is one of Come on, let's see your fastball. The pitcher smiles, winds up and throws. Very fast. And right at Archie's chin. Again, he has to dive out of the way. This time, however, he gets right up and immediately appeals to the Umpire.

UMPIRE: Sure. Watch out-you don't get killed. Both benches laugh at that. Archie holds up his hands to call time, and steps out of the batter's box. The on-deck batter, Mel Ott, comes over.

OTT: Okay, kid, first two were high and tight, where do you think the next one's going to be?
ARCHIE: Either-low and away, or in my ear.
OTT: He don't want to load the bases. Look for low and away. Archie nods and starts to walk back to the plate.
OTT: But watch out for 'in your ear.' Archie takes his place in the batter's box again. He still looks determined, but a little less cocky. The next pitch is a curve that looks as if it's heading right for him. But he holds his ground, and when the ball breaks down and away, he steps in, snaps the bat forward, and hits it. The ball sails in a high arc to right center. The center fielder backs up a couple of steps, lopes a few strides to his left, and makes the catch. Archie is out, but the runner on third tags up and scores. As Archie curls across the diamond from the first baseline to the Giants' bench, he hears cheering. In the stands, Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are giving him a standing ovation. In return, he touches the brim of his cap, a ballplayer's cool response to adulation.

ARCHIE: Good night, kid. Ray, Karin, Annie and Mann watch Archie jog towards the rest of the players. When he reaches the fence, he turns back to them.
MANN: Good night, kid. Ray, Karin, Annie and Mann watch Archie jog towards the rest of the players. When he reaches the fence, he turns back to them.
ARCHIE: Mr. Kinsella? Ray turns toward him. Archie looks as if he knows more than he's saying.
ARCHIE: Thank you for bringing me here. I couldn't have wished for anything more. Ray recognizes there may be more behind those words than just a teenager's pleasure. But he decides not to ask any I know. You're welcome. Archie runs through the door in the fence and vanishes.
RAY: I know. You're welcome. Archie runs through the door in the fence and vanishes.
CUT TO: 135 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING Mann and Karin eat their country breakfasts at one and of the table, while at the other end, Annie and Ray sit in front of the bank books, ledgers, and the sheaf of bills puffed up around the paper spike.
ANNIE: Once we fell behind in the payments, the full amount of the mortgage became due.
CONTINUED: 135 CONTINUED
135 CONTINUED: And they own the paper, so they have the legal right to foreclose.
RAY: And they own the paper, so they have the legal right to foreclose.
ANNIE: Unless we sell.
RAY: Either way we lose the farm. Maybe we can make it a condition of the sale that they keep the field up.
ANNIE: Forget it. They're buying up single farms all around us, make it one big farm. First thing they'll do is plow under your field. Ray just sits there, letting that sink in.
CUT TO: 136 EXT. FARM - DAY Ray and Mann walking.
MANN: I don't have a lot of money, Ray, but maybe I could pitch in a little.
RAY: Fine. You can put in twenty bucks for That's not what I meant. Maybe the reason you were supposed to find me was so I could help you with this.
MANN: That's not what I meant. Maybe the reason you were supposed to find me was so I could help you with this.
RAY: More likely it's that you're supposed to start writing again. About this.
MANN: Don't change the subject.
RAY: You promise to publish and I'll let you chip in from your royalties. Mann's expression suddenly turns to one of indignation.
CONTINUED: 136 CONTINUED
136 CONTINUED: One thing has nothing to do with the I'm not sure I agree with that.
MANN: One thing has nothing to do with the I'm not sure I agree with that.
RAY: I'm not sure I agree with that.
MANN: You're not only stubborn, you're stupid.
RAY: That I won't argue with. Annie emerges from the house and calls to Ray.
ANNIE: Honey, that was Mark. He's coming tonight. He needs a decision tonight.
CUT TO: 137 THE GAME
ANNIE: Everything is so perfect here.
RAY: Whatever I have to do to save this place, I'll do.
ANNIE: I know. Suddenly, Ray snaps his head to the side, as one does to pick up a-distant sound.
RAY: He's here. They look and see Mark's car heading up the gravel lane. He parks the car at the edge of the field, and the game stops as he walks right across it, completely mindless of the players. Since he doesn't see any of them, a few actually have to move out of his way. He approaches the bottom of the bleachers.
RAY: You're interrupting the game, . Mark.
CONTINUED: 137 CONTINUED
137 CONTINUED: Mark shakes his head sadly at the thought that these otherwise sensible relations have lost their minds.
MARK: Ray, it's time'to put away our little fantasies and come down to earth.
RAY: It's not a fantasy, Mark. They're real. Mark obviously do.esn't see anyone on the field.
MARK: ( EMPHATICALLY )
RAY: Shoeless Joe Jackson. The White Sox. The Giants.
MARK: And who's that? Babe Ruth? Ray smiles, savoring the moment.
RAY: As a matter of fact, it's Terence Mann.
MARK: Ah, how do you? I'm Michael Jackson.
RAY: I'm not selling you my home.
MARK: You have no money, you've got a stack of bills to choke a pig, and come fall, you've got no crop to sell. But I have a deal to offer you that will allow you to stay on this land. This has Ray's attention. Mark climbs the bleachers to stand closer to him.
KARIN: Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm. But no one pays her any attention. All eyes are on Mark.
CONTINUED: 137 CONTINUED ( 2 )
MARK: Let us buy you out, and we'll leave the house. You can live in it rent free as long as you want.
RAY: What about the baseball field?
MARK: Do you realize what this land is worth?
RAY: Over $2200 an acre.
MARK: Then you must realize we cannot keep a useless baseball diamond in the middle of rich farmland.
RAY: No deal, Mark. We're staying.
KARIN: We don't have to go.
MARK: ( EXPLODES )
KARIN: Daddy, we don't have to sell the farm.
MARK: Karin, please!
RAY: They all turn to Karin.
KARIN: People will come.
RAY: What people, sweetheart?
CONTINUED: 137 CONTINUED ( 3 )
KARIN: From all over. They'll just decide to take a vacation, see, and they'll come to Iowa City, and they'll think it's really boring, so they'll take a drive. And they'll drive down our road, and they'll see the lights and they'll think it's really pretty. Ray, Annie, and Mann listen with wonder, to this vision.
KARIN: So, the people in the cars? They'll drive up and they'll want to pay us, like buying a ticket. Mark looks at them all as if they're crazy.
MARK: You're not listening to this seriously, are you?
ANNIE: Why would anybody pay money to come Karin looks at her Uncle mark as if he were a simpleton.
MARK: Why would anybody pay money to come Karin looks at her Uncle mark as if he were a simpleton.
KARIN: To watch the game. And it'll be just like when they were little kids a long time ago, and it was summertime, and they'll watch the game and .remember what it was like. Ray and Annie couldn't be prouder of their daughter than they are right now.
MARK: What the hell is she talking about?
ANNIE: She's talking about people seeing their memories. touching their past.
RAY: ( NODS )
CONTINUED: 137 CONTINUED ( 4 )
ANNIE: It'll be like one of those tiny, French restaurants that have no sign. You find it by instinct. They'll be drawn.
MARK: Okay, this is all fascinating, but the fact remains that you don't have the money to bring the mortgage up to date, so you still have to sell. I'm sorry, but you have no choice. He produces a document and hands it to Ray with a pen. Ray looks at it. He doesn't know what to do.
MANN: Ray looks at Mann.
138 MANN: - 1.38 speaks now as he has not spoken for many years: as Terence Mann, master of words, spellbinder.
MANN: People will come, Ray. They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom. They'll turn up your driveway, not knowing for sure why they're doing it, and arrive at your door, innocent as children, longing for the past. 'Of course we won't mind if you look around,' you'll say. 'It's only twenty dollars per person.' And they'll pass over the money without even looking at it. For it is money they have, and peace they lack.
139 MARK: pushes the papers. forward.
MARK: Just sign the papers, Ray.
140 MANN: is not one to give up.
CONTINUED: 140 CONTINUED
140 CONTINUED: They'll walk out to the bleachers and sit in shirtsleeves in the perfect evening, or they'll find they have reserved seats somewhere in the grandstand or along one of the baselines wherever they sat when they were children and cheered their heroes. They'll watch the game, and it will be as if they'd dipped themselves in magic waters. The memories will be so thick they'll have to brush them away from their faces.

141 MASTER: Spellbound, Ray has put the papers down. Mark picks them up again. He is battling Mann for Ray's attention.
MARK: Listen to me. Tomorrow morning, when the bank opens, they will foreclose.
MANN: People will come, Ray.
MARK: You're broke, Ray. Sell now or lose The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has rolled by like an`army of steamrollers. It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this ° game. it's a piece of our past. It reminds us of all that once was good. And that could be again. People will come. People will most definitely come. Mann has moved everyone ( but Mark ) with the beauty of his words, and the passion in his.voice. Behind him, the assembled ballplayers respectfully applaud.

MARK: Ray. You will lose everything and you will be evicted. Ray looks at the paper with dread. He looks at Shoeless Joe and the players. He looks at his family. Then he turns back to Mark. It's decision time.
RAY: I'm not signing. Mark shakes his head sadly. Annie hugs Ray. The players breathe a great sigh of relief. Mann smiles.
MANN: Ray looks up at Mann, who, with a gentle tilt of the head, directs Ray's attention to the house. Ray looks behind him toward the house.
RAY: ( SING-SONG )
NARK: Who's here?
CONTINUED: 143 CONTINUED
143 CONTINUED: ( with an edge ) You don't see those cars? All those Don't do this, you son of a bitch! There's no cars, no people.
RAY: ( with an edge ) You don't see those cars? All those Don't do this, you son of a bitch! There's no cars, no people.
MARK: Don't do this, you son of a bitch! There's no cars, no people.
KARIN: Uncle Mark, I can see them.
ANNIE: We all can.
MARK: You're crazy. You're all bat-shit Watch your language, Mark.
RAY: Watch your language, Mark.
MARK: You build a baseball field in the middle of nowhere, you sit around here and stare at nothing -
KARIN: It's not nothing. Mark grabs Karin's arm and pulls her to her feet as if she were "Exhibit A."
MARK: And you've turned your daughter into a goddamn moron!
RAY: Get your hands off her. Ray rises threateningly, and Mark turns toward him. In so doing, he twists little Karin off balance.
MARK: I'm trying to help you, goddamnit! In that split second, they hear a strangled gasp, and see Karin falling forward from the top row of the bleachers.
RA Y: 144 KARIN
144 KARIN: Her hot dog flies off, the bun and wiener separating in midair. One small sandal bounces end over end and lands at the foot of the bleacher. It takes forever for her body to come down with a sickening thud on the hard green boards of one of the bottom rows.
MARK: Oh my God, I'm sorry.Annie.I didn't mean to. Karin is unconscious, and seems to be fighting for breath. Ray and Annie's eyes meet in anguish.
ANNIE: Should we move her?
RAY: Get the car.
146 ANNIE: springs for the house. The tourists by their cars watch Is there a doctor? A nurse? Any of They sadly shake their heads no. Annie races inside.
ANNIE: Is there a doctor? A nurse? Any of They sadly shake their heads no. Annie races inside.
MANN: How long?
RA Y: Its a twenty-minute drive. Mann winces. He knows that could be fatal. Ray kneels by Karin. Her nose and one side of her face have been scraped by the fall. Blood starts to trickle from her nose, across her cheek and down her neck. She is becoming bluer and her cough is faint, as though she is in another room.
CONTINUED: 147 CONTINUED
147 CONTINUED: Mark takes off his $300 pale-green velvet corduroy jacket and is wordlessly holding it out to Ray. Ray takes the jacket and covers Karin gently. Karin is getting paler, bluer, and her breathing more strained and distant.
RAY: Then, without reason, Ray slowly turns toward the field. The White Sox stand near him by the fence, the Giants stay around their bench. All except one: young Archie Graham.
149 BLEACHERS: Annie has pulled the car over and honks. Ray holds up his hand to her to wait. His eyes are on young Archie Graham.
DOC GRAHAM: What have we got here?
RAY: She fell. Doc kneels beside her and instantly knows what is wrong.
DOC GRAHAM: This child's choking to death.
CONTINUED: 151 CONTINUED
151 CONTINUED: He picks her up with one hand under her shoulders and the other under her knees, seats himself on the bleachers, and turns her face down. Supporting her chest with one hand, he delivers a series of sharp blows between her shoulder blades with the heel of his other hand. Annie honks again. Ray waves her to him. Mark cannot believe what he is seeing. Suddenly, Karin's diaphragm expands as she sucks in air. Doc reaches around and pries her mouth open, releasing a sizable piece of hog dog and bun. As he turns her over, we can see the blueness disappearing from her face as she continues to breathe deeply. Doc peels back each eyelid in turn, stares at the pupil for a few seconds, and lets the eye close.
DCC GRAHAM: She's okay. I don't think the fall really hurt her, just the dog in her throat. She'll be coming around in a minute or two.
RAY: ( SIGHS DEEPLY )
DOC GRAHAM: No, son. Thank you. It just now sinking for Ray what-Doc Graham has sacrificed to save the child. Ray looks to the field, and then back at the Doctor.
RAY: 'Oh, my God, you can't go back.
DOC GRAHAM: It's okay.

ANNIE: There's hope for you yet, Mark.

HAPPY FELSCH: Good work, Doc.
EDDIE CICOTTE: Way to go, Doc.
DOC GRAHAM: Thanks, boys. Win one for me, someday, will you? He passes them.
SHOELESS JOE: Hev rookie! Doc Graham turns.
SHOELESS JOE: You were good. Only now do Doc Graham's eyes shine with tears. He smiles, and disappears through the door.
SHOELESS JOE: We're gonna call it a night. We'll see you tomorrow.
RAY: 154 CONTINUED
CONTINUED: 154 CONTINUED
154 CONTINUED: Good night. Joe starts to trot off the field, then he stops and turns back to the bleachers.
MANN: Good night. Joe starts to trot off the field, then he stops and turns back to the bleachers.
SHOELESS JOE: Hey! You wanna come with us? Ray's jaw drops.
RAY: You mean it?
SHOELESS JOE: Not you. ( points to Mann ) Come with you?
RAY: Come with you?
MANN: Come with you?
SHOELESS JOE: Out there.
MANN: What is out there?
SHOELESS JOE: Come find out.
RAY: Wait a second. Why him? Shoeless Joe and the other players wait for Mann to join them, ignoring Ray's question.
RAY: I built this field! You wouldn't be here if it weren't for me.
MANN: Ray, for God's sake, I'm unattached. You've got a family. This takes Ray down a peg or two.
RAY: But I want to know what's out there! I want to see it!
CONTINUED: 154 CONTINUED ( 2 )
MANN: There's a reason they chose me, just as there was a reason they chose you to find me.
RAY: Oh yeah? Why?
MANN: Because, you big jerk, I gave that What interview?
RAY: What interview?
MANN: The one about Ebbets Field. The one that charged you up and sent you all the way to Boston to find me.
RAY: Then you lied to me.
MANN: You were kidnapping me at the time, you asshole! Think of it, Ray: maybe there's an Ebbets Field still floating around out there somewhere. And maybe I'll get to sit in the stands, and watch a twenty-year-old kid with a smooth face and kinky hair try out for the 1948 ( to Shoeless Joe ) So I do all the work, and all I get is to see everybody else's dreams come true. Is that it?
RAY: ( to Shoeless Joe ) So I do all the work, and all I get is to see everybody else's dreams come true. Is that it?
SHOELESS JOE: What are you saying, Ray?
RAY: I'm saying I'm happy for you, and I'm happy for him, but after all this what's in it L for me?
SHOELESS JOE: Is that why you did this? For-you?
MANN: There's something out there for me, Ray. And what a story it'll make: a man being able to touch the perfect dream.

RAY: Then you'll write about it?
MANN: You bet I will. Annie walks Karin over. Ray bends down to Karin's face.
RAY: How you feeling, honey?

RAY: We're keeping this field.
ANNIE: You bet your ass we are. Ray realizes Shoeless Joe is staring at him, with a shit-eating grin on his face.
RAY: Shoeless Joe just keeps smiling.
RAY: What're you grinning at, you ghost?
SHOELESS JOE: 'If you build it. He nods toward where the catcher is taking off his gear at home plate.
SHOELESS JOE: ' .he will come.' Ray looks at the Catcher. The hairs on the back of his neck begin to stand up.
RAY: Oh, my God.
ANNIE: What is it?
RAY: Its my father.
RAY: Say it ain't so,- Joe.
SHOELESS JOE: I'm afraid it is, kid. The Catcher is now walking toward Ray.

RAY: It was you.
SHOELESS JOE: No, Ray. It was you. Shoeless joe winks and walks away, disappearing through the door in the outfield fence.
RAY: My God, I only saw him later, when he was worn down by life. Look at him. The young Catcher has reached the outfield grass. Ray walks down to the edge of the outfield.

RAY: He has his whole life in front of him, and I'm not even a glint in his eye. What do I say to him?
ANNIE: Introduce him to his granddaughter. Ray cannot believe how wonderful Annie is. The Catcher has reached the edge of the field, and now stands before Ray and Annie.
CATCHER: Hi, I just wanted to thank you folks for putting up the field and letting us play here. I'm John Kinsella. They shake his hand.

RAY: You catch a good game.
JOHN: Thank you. It's so beautiful here. Its like-well for me, it's like a dream come true. Ray cannot speak. He nods.

JOHN: Heaven's where dreams come true.
165 RAY: looks toward the house and sees his wife and daughter on the veranda, a moon bright as butter silvering the night above them. He smiles. He finally understands. He turns back to John and nods.

Ray tosses him the ball, picks up a glove lying there, and puts it on. They throw the ball back and forth. And as we pull up higher and higher we see a father and son bathed by white floodlights and car headlights. on the silent, satiny green of a baseball diamond at the edge of a cornfield.
