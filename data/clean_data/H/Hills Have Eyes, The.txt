ETHEL: My crazy husband absolutely had to see the desert.

DOUG: Piece of shit! Why couldn't we fly like normal people?
LYNN: Relax Doug, please. It's their silver anniversary and they're so happy you're here.

DOUG: Maybe I shouldn't have even come.
LYNN: Doug, please stop. I never ask you for anything, OK? ( she looks at the baby ) Well see how happy you are when Catherine comes along on our 25th She walks out.
DOUG: ( TO HIMSELF )
LYNN: If you want to use the restroom, it's now or never. Bobby removes his headphones and pushes Brenda.
BOBBY: Wake up, lard ass.
BRENDA: Bobby, come look at this. Bobby joins her.
BOBBY: You two make a perfect pair. Bobby turns to a rusty car and unzips to urinate.
BRENDA: Don't pee there.
BOBBY: Why not?
BRENDA: ( pointing to a small
BOBBY: God, what do you care? Bobby re-zips and heads towards the small wooden outhouse while Brenda plays with the baby pig.
BRENDA: Piggy, piggy, piggy.
DOUG: ( to the old man ) Excuse me sir, do you have a phone I can use? I can't get a signal around here and. Big Bob interrupts.
BIG BOB: Give. the phone a rest, Bukowski!
DOUG: Sorry Bob, "duty calls".
LYNN: Honey, you haven't put that phone down since we left.
DOUG: This is why I don't go on vacation. They're lost without me.
BIG BOB: Stop being at everyone's beck and call, Bukowski. You're the boss, .I'm sure all that important business can wait till next week. Doug gives up. He kisses Lynn and takes the baby from her.
ETHEL: .I'm sure all that important business can wait till next week. Doug gives up. He kisses Lynn and takes the baby from her.
LYNN: ( TO DOUG )
BOBBY: What the hell Brenda! The eye goes away. He re-zips looking outside. Nobody. When he exits, Brenda appears on the other side.
BRENDA: 15 EXT. GAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 15 Doug sits on the porch giving the baby her bottle. The old gas station attendant checks the oil and the water. ,Ethel joins him, holding a road map.
ETHEL: How far are we from 1-88?
ETHEL: I told you we should have gone through Santa Fe. You never listen to me.
BIG BOB: Doesn't bother me. I had night patrol for almost fifteen years.
BIG BOB: ( with a smile ) Not anymore. Thank God!

BIG BOB: I'm starting a private security The old man turns to Doug-
DOUG: Who me? No way. I'm in A beat.
DOUG: Everybody's gotta have a cell OLD GAS ATTENDANT Well you won't find any customers around here.
DOUG: No kidding. As the old man closes the hood, a familiar sound returns-
ETHEL: YOU HEAR THAT BRENDA? DON'T DRINK THE WATER! Big Bob walks to the old man.
THE WATER!: Big Bob walks to the old man.
BIG BOB: What do -I owe you? The old man looks at the gas pump.
DOUG: Let me pay, Bob.
BIG BOB: ( OFFENDED )
DOUG: That's not what I meant.
LYNN: ( NOT CONVINCED )
LYNN: Sorry, our dog got out.She won't stay put. A car horn breaks the silence.
LYNN: ( YELLING OUTSIDE )
I'M COMING!: The old man lets her pass with the dog, watching her WITH SUSPICION- Has she seen the contents of the bag?
BIG BOB: Let's go! KNOCK KNOCK The old man knocks on the window. Big Bob opens-
ETHEL: He's right, Bob.
BIG BOB: I'm fully aware of the driving OLD GAS ATTENDANT Have a safe trip. Big Bob smiles back and starts the engine.
BIG BOB: Everyone ready?
BIG BOB: Thanks for the tip.
DOUG: ( cleaning his glasses ) I tried for an hour but I couldn't get it cold in here. CLICK- the light turns on and the A/C starts.
BOBBY: ( PROUDLY )
DOUG: How do you know all this stuff?
BOBBY: I don't know.
DOUG: Well, at least we can breathe now.
BOBBY: I thought you stopped smoking?
DOUG: ( lighting it with a
SMILE ): Fuck her!
BOBBY: ( TEASING ) ( PLAYING BACK )
DOUG: ( PLAYING BACK )
BOBBY: ( after a pause ) It's cool that you came with us. It's a drag when it's just us and our parents.
DOUG: Hey, I like seeing your parents. Bobby is surprised.
BRENDA: Neither do we, Dad. On the road, the Lizard continues carving a dusty path.
ETHEL: Don't drive so fast Bob, you might lose the camper.
BRENDA: ( TO HERSELF )
ETHEL: Hey. Watch your mouth, young ( to her husband ) Will you please back me up here?
LYNN: ( calming things down ) Relax, Mom. We're all just tired.
BRENDA: You grew up in the 60's. How can you be so uptight?! Still driving, Big Bob turns to his daughters-
BIG BOB: ( SLYLY )
ETHEL: ( PLAYFULLY )
BIG BOB: She remembers.
LYNN: Doug? Bobby? Are you alright? Bobby opens the door releasing the barking dogs.
BOBBY: Don't worry, we're fine.
DOUG: ( STILL SHAKEN )
LYNN: She's fine. Mom has her.
DOUG: I knew this wasn't gonna be safe for the baby.
LYNN: The heat must have caused a blow Are you all right?
DOUG: Are you all right?
LYNN: I think so. Just a little shaken Bobby walks around the car evaluating the damage- The SUV tires are shredded - the rims buried into the ground.
BOBBY: Holy shit!
DOUG: 97% nationwide coverage, and we have to find ourselves in that
HORIZON ): Your father wanted to see the I hope he's enjoying himself. On his knees, by the SUV tires, Big Bob inspects under the vehicle. Not only are the tires flattened, but the front axel has buckled from hitting the rocks.

DOUG: I hope he's enjoying himself. On his knees, by the SUV tires, Big Bob inspects under the vehicle. Not only are the tires flattened, but the front axel has buckled from hitting the rocks.
BIG BOB: ( TO ETHEL )
ETHEL: Oh, so now it's my fault? Doug joins them.
DOUG: So what's the damage, General?
BIG BOB: The damn axel is broken.
DOUG: Can we fix it?
BIG BOB: With what? The frame is completely twisted. Give me your phone, I'm gonna call a tow truck.
DOUG: I already tried. I'm not getting a Can we use the C/B?
ETHEL: Can we use the C/B?
BIG BOB: That old thing? Give it a try, but this is mining country. Whatever metal is left in those hills will probably scramble the signal.
DOUG: What are we going to do? Without answering, Big Bob gets back on his feet, wipes his hands and grabs a bottle of water from the car. After a long
BIG BOB: We're going to walk, that's what.
DOUG: Walk?! But we're miles from
BIG BOB: ( cutting him off ) So we wait here for someone to drive by? Have you seen a car in the last three hours?!

BOBBY: I saw a documentary on The Discovery channel about desert snakes. If you get bit, you'll die in twenty minutes. Big Bob reaches into the glove compartment pulling out a 9mm and an extra clip. He hands it to his son.
BIG BOB: ( with a big smile ) I'd like to see how they stack up against this. Ethel brings her husband's jacket and helps him put it on.
ETHEL: Some things never change.
BIG BOB: ( loading his weapon ) I'll take my bullets over your prayers any day.
BOBBY: You think we'll see scorpions and Big.Bob grabs his son by the shoulders, proud. They look like two kids getting ready to play Cowboys and Indians. Bobby calls out to Doug, offering the gun-
DOUG: ( SMILING )
BOBBY: Come on, just one shot, it makes you feel kinda powerful. Big Bob answers for Doug-
BIG BOB: Leave him alone son. Doug is a liberal, he wouldn't touch a gun. Obviously, the two men disagree. Behind the trailer, Brenda sits on a lounge chair in her bra revealing a sexy body. She applies suntan lotion ready to kill some time. Behind her sunglasses, she observes the silent desert looking like Paris Hilton. Lynn exits the trailer and joins her.
LYNN: Catherine just fell asleep. How are you holding up?
BRENDA: ( IRONICALLY )
LYNN: Yeah, this is a total drag, especially with a baby.
BRENDA: I don't care what they say, next year, I'm going to Cancun with my friends. No more "family trips" for We're not going to have many more trips like this together. As for Cancun, you're gonna have to find a C'mon, with all the money your husband makes, you could at least buy me a plane ticket.
LYNN: We're not going to have many more trips like this together. As for Cancun, you're gonna have to find a C'mon, with all the money your husband makes, you could at least buy me a plane ticket.
BRENDA: C'mon, with all the money your husband makes, you could at least buy me a plane ticket.
BRENDA: ( imitating her sister ) "Right away, honey." Without turning around, Lynn gives her sister the finger. Brenda smiles with satisfaction.
DOUG: I'll keep walking north. This road's gotta lead somewhere. Lynn comes around with the jacket and sees Big Bob and Bobby both holding guns.
LYNN: What are you going to do with It's always good to be prepared. Are you taking a gun too? Big Bob answers for him.
BIG BOB: It's always good to be prepared. Are you taking a gun too? Big Bob answers for him.
LYNN: ( TO DOUG )
BIG BOB: We've only got two and it's better if you guys have one here. You never know.
LYNN: Are you sure you're going to be Lynn puts a fisherman's hat on Doug to protect him from the sun and kisses him tenderly.
BIG BOB: If you don't find any help in six or seven miles come back. I'll go to the gas station.
ETHEL: It's almost 3, you'll never be back before sunset.
BIG BOB: It's only about ten miles from here. I'll borrow that crazy old man's truck and use his phone if he has one. Don't worry. I'll be back with a tow truck before Can I go with Doug?
BOBBY: Can I go with Doug?
BIG BOB: No. Stay here with your mother and And you, don't tease your brother, he's in charge now. Holding the gun, Bobby winks at his sister who continues to Yeah, right. Ethel remains silent and worried.
BRENDA: Yeah, right. Ethel remains silent and worried.
ETHEL: We should pray before you go-
BRENDA: Oh please!
ETHEL: Is it really too much to ask? ( turning to her husband ) Bob finally agrees, and like a good family man, he gathers them around. Brenda slips on her shirt and joins them.
BRENDA: ( GRUMPILY )
LYNN: Hey, little princess. Who doesn't want to sleep anymore? The baby looks at her mother, appeased.
ETHEL: You shouldn't go from the bottle to the breast. At her age she should get used to one or the other.
LYNN: Mom, thanks for the advice, but she's my baby. Vexed, Ethel remains quiet.
BRENDA: I can already see the headlines: "Family found dead in New Mexico This place isn't so bad. At least the air is fresh.
ETHEL: This place isn't so bad. At least the air is fresh.
BRENDA: I think it stinks.
LYNN: Better than Cleveland.
BRENDA: Anything's better than Cleveland!
ETHEL: ( after a beat ) Maybe it was my fault we had this Please, Mom. Nothing can stop Dad when he thinks he's found a shortcut. Remember when we ran out of gas on the "shortcut" to the Great Lakes? How old was I? 12, 13?
LYNN: Please, Mom. Nothing can stop Dad when he thinks he's found a shortcut. Remember when we ran out of gas on the "shortcut" to the Great Lakes? How old was I? 12, 13?
ETHEL: This family has certainly seen its share of adventures.
BRENDA: If we had just stayed on the main road we'd already be in Yeah-what I'd do for a shower and a margarita.
LYNN: Yeah-what I'd do for a shower and a margarita.
BRENDA: The beach.
LYNN: A real bed. Bobby sits down at the table.
BOBBY: Has anybody seen my grey sweatshirt? It was in the car. I've looked everywhere.
BRENDA: I didn't touch your smelly Beast has been pulling on his chain nonstop, while Beauty cries softly from inside the trailer.
LYNN: Why are the dogs so excited?
ETHEL: Probably some rattlesnakes not far You know how Freud would've interpreted your obsession with rattlesnakes Mom? Ethel throws her kitchen towel at him. They laugh. A beat, then Ethel becomes sentimental.
BOBBY: ( JOKINGLY )
ETHEL: Brenda's going off to college. And then, next year, it's Bobby's turn. The house is going to feel so empty. Lynn grabs her mother's hand-
BRENDA: That makes one of us. They glare at her as she opens the door.
BOBBY: Brenda, the dogs! Too late. Beauty runs out in the direction of the hills Bobby drops his plate and gives chase.
ETHEL: ( YELLING )
BOBBY: At the bottom of the hill, the rocks are too jagged for him to continue running. He slows down and begins moving past the first set of rocks. With much more agility, Beauty climbs quickly towards the top, disappearing behind some rocks.
BEAUTY!: At the bottom of the hill, the rocks are too jagged for him to continue running. He slows down and begins moving past the first set of rocks. With much more agility, Beauty climbs quickly towards the top, disappearing behind some rocks.
BEAUTY? BEAUTY?: Nothing. Only sharp rocks stand before him.
ETHEL: BOB-BY?! BOB-BY!? Overcome with worry, she turns to her two daughters.
LYNN: I don't know, Mom.
ETHEL: She couldn't have gone that far. Brenda notices the revolver on the table. Bobby is unarmed.
BOBBY: Beauty? Beauty? Bobby moves cautiously. He picks up a big stone for protection- A dangerous animal could be hiding behind any corner. A SHADOW PASSES BEHIND HIM.. Bobby doesn't notice. Anaaaaaau - A swift sound of breathing breaks the silence. Bobby spins around, ready to strike.
YOUNG GIRL: Ru. Ruby. Ruby.
BOBBY: What are you doing here Ruby? Where are your parents? My family needs help. We had an accident. Ruby repeats her name mechanically as if she doesn't understand the questions.
RUBY: ( in a low voice ) Ru. Ruby. Ruby. Bobby gets closer.
BOBBY: I heard you, Ruby. Are you here Ruby won't answer.
RUBY: That's right, have you seen her?
BOBBY: That's right, have you seen her?
RUBY: Ruby.. _Ruby is Beauty. The last sentence makes her laugh. A STRANGE AGONIZING
BOBBY: Have you seen her? Ruby looks down. She knows something.
RUBY: ( SOFTLY )
BOBBY: Ruby, come back! Once more, Bobby is alone in the labyrinth. On the other side, he finds a trail of blood as if a body had been dragged on the rocks. The bloody trail is still fresh and disappears behind another set of rocks a few feet away. Bobby hesitates, unsure of what he might find. As soon as he's around the outcropping to the other side Bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks. Before him, on the ground, is Beauty. Dead. Disemboweled. Bobby drops to his knees, disbelieving, his face turning white. He touches the animal's head as if to convince himself that this nightmare can't be possible at all. Beauty's face is locked in a grimace of horrible pain and shock. And. the animal is missing its front right leg. DRIP. DRIP. DRIP. DROPS OF BLOOD fall on Bobby's hand - ABOVE HIM, PERCHED ON A ROCK, A FIGURE OBSERVES HIM. A man with an impressive build crouches like a monkey. He wears old clothes covered with dust, and a DERBY HAT on his head. Binoculars hang around his neck.
BEAUTY'S LEG!: Terrified, Bobby runs away. Goggle laughs from his rock. Bobby jumps down the hill. From the summit, Goggle continues feasting. A few yards away, Ruby's slender silhouette slides between the rocks. Goggle stops eating, sees Ruby, and throws her the remains. Ruby looks at the half-eaten leg in disgust, and pushes it away.
DOUG: ".All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray. I've been for a walk on a winter's day. I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A. California After hours of walking down this road, his face shows signs of fatigue.
BRENDA: BOBBY! BOB-BY! Inside the camper, Ethel watches the sun set in the horizon. She cradles the baby in her arms. Brenda joins Lynn and throws some firewood into the flames.
LYNN: Keep it together Brenda, Mom is already worried enough. The fire will help Bobby find his way back.
BRENDA: What if he doesn't come back? Maybe he's hurt. Maybe there was an He and Beauty will find their way back together. Lynn hugs her sister.
LYNN: He and Beauty will find their way back together. Lynn hugs her sister.
BRENDA: Bobby was only wearing a t-shirt when he left.
LYNN: I know.
BIG BOB: HELLO! ANYONE HERE?! No answer. He knocks on the door.
BIG BOB: Somebody home? Hello? Big Bob pushes the last door leading to the back room. His hand feels for the light switch. CLICK - an old lamp comes on in the corner. He finds a wall mounted phone and picks up the receiver. No tone.
MINES": "Military destroys miner's town." The old man's family was. one of those families whose genetic lineage was forever changed by the nuclear fallout. Big Bob is shocked, never believing such a thing was A COUPLE OF MORE RECENT ARTICLES MENTION PEOPLE DISAPPEARING IN THE REGION. BIG BOB ( CONT'D ) You son of a bitch. Worried for his own family, he grabs the keys and walks out. From the bedroom window, we see him running to the pick-up 44 INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 44 Big Bob slams the door, starts the engine and turns on the The headlights shine on the outhouse. The wooden outhouse door slams back and forth in the wind. Something blocks it from shutting completely-

BIG BOB: ( MOVING SLOWLY )
MISTER!: The old man seems mad.
BOB ): My wife. She didn't want to leave .she wouldn't move to town even when the state police ordered us to. The kids grew up in the mines. Like animals. ( smiling through his

BIG BOB: BANG! - THE OLD MAN'S BRAINS SPLATTER IN THE OUTHOUSE. Suddenly, VOICES coming from different directions echo around Daddy. Daddy.Daaaddyyy.Daddy.. THE VOICES ARE HORRIFIC AND TERRIFYING. Big Bob backs up pointing his gun in their direction.
FREEZE!: BANG! - THE OLD MAN'S BRAINS SPLATTER IN THE OUTHOUSE. Suddenly, VOICES coming from different directions echo around Daddy. Daddy.Daaaddyyy.Daddy.. THE VOICES ARE HORRIFIC AND TERRIFYING. Big Bob backs up pointing his gun in their direction.
VOICES: Daddy. Daddy.Daaaddyyy.Daddy.. THE VOICES ARE HORRIFIC AND TERRIFYING. Big Bob backs up pointing his gun in their direction.

BIG BOB: Who's there? Show yourself! The voices become louder and louder, omnipresent.
VOICES: Daddy.. Daddy. Big Bob walks backwards to the truck, and trips on the Wide eyed, he stands and throws himself on the car door.
VOICE: ( CALMLY )
ETHEL: ( into the mic ) Hello.Hello. Can somebody hear me? Please answer if you hear me. No answer. The radio goes silent. Lynn joins her, holding the How's it going?
LYNN: How's it going?
ETHEL: I heard something. She fiddles with the radio.
LYNN: ( in the mic ) Mayday .mayday. This is a distress call. Do you copy? Still nothing.
LYNN: Mayday. . .We're stranded in the desert, we need help.mayday. Suddenly, the light on the C/B turns green and static can be heard. Ethel grabs her daughter's hand, hopeful that someone may have heard them. A second later, HEAVY BREATHING is heard over the radio. The light turns off. The two women look at each other in What was that?
ETHEL: It sounded like an animal. Lynn stands up worried.
LYNN: If animals start answering our radio calls, we're really fucked!
ETHEL: Watch your language!
LYNN: Give it a rest, Mom. We have more important things to worry about. She walks out.
ETHEL: Lynn, wait. Ethel stays alone with the baby.
LYNN: No answer.
BRENDA?!: In the distance, we see Brenda looking for her brother.
BRENDA: BOBBY? BOBBY? With a flashlight in one hand, the gun in the other, and a blanket over her shoulders, Brenda moves through the night.
BOBBY? BOBBY?: With a flashlight in one hand, the gun in the other, and a blanket over her shoulders, Brenda moves through the night.
BRENDA: I'm here! I'll be back in a minute. The flashlight partially lights the desert as she disappears into the night.
ETHEL: You're lucky Brenda found you. Imagine if you had to spend the whole night out there in the cold. Bobby winces from the pain.
BRENDA: Don't worry, Beauty will come back when she's hungry. Bobby doesn't answer. He keeps the truth to himself, not wanting to worry his family.
BOBBY: Have you tried the radio?
ETHEL: It doesn't work.
LYNN: We heard something. Some sort of Bobby lifts his head.
BOBBY: What do you mean?
LYNN: It was really weird, right mom?
ETHEL: ( minimizing the incident ) I'm sure it was just static.
LYNN: Mom, it sounded like a perverted crank call.
BRENDA: ( JOKING )
BOBBY: ( to the others ) His mother and two sisters are surprised by his agitated What's wrong with you? Footsteps. Someone approaches.
BRENDA: What's wrong with you? Footsteps. Someone approaches.
BOBBY: ( stern but soft ) I want you guys to stay in here. Brenda?! You hear me? Gun in hand, he opens the door- Bobby is about to shoot when a figure emerges from the dark. IT'S DOUG, holding as much as he could carry from the car What the fuck are you doing? Don't point that thing at me. Bobby lowers the weapon.
DOUG: What the fuck are you doing? Don't point that thing at me. Bobby lowers the weapon.
BOBBY: I didn't know it was you.
DOUG: Who else would it be?! Bobby is interrupted by Brenda who sees Doug from the window.
BRENDA: Doug's back!
DOUG: Hey girls! Quickly, Lynn exits the trailer and jumps into her husband's arms. They kiss. Doug sets down all of his findings.
POLE ): Look at this, it's brand new!
LYNN: What are you going to do with a fishing pole in the desert? You didn't you find anybody?
DOUG: No. The road just stops there. I hope your dad has better luck. Is there anything to eat? I'm Let's go, it's freezing out here. Doug follows Lynn inside the trailer.
LYNN: Let's go, it's freezing out here. Doug follows Lynn inside the trailer.
ETHEL: Looks like we're camping out tonight. How's your head? Bobby doesn't answer.
BOBBY: Nothing, Mom.
ETHEL: Are you sure?
BOBBY: I'll feel a lot better when dad gets back.
ETHEL: Me too, honey. Come inside. You've already spent enough time in the cold for one day, don't you think?
LYNN: Don't close the door, we're leaving in a second!
BOBBY: ( WORRIED )
DOUG: I'm tired, I really need to rest for an hour or so.
BOBBY: We can squeeze in here. You'll be more comfortable.
DOUG: You want us to sleep on the floor?! her to bed. Bobby takes him aside.
BOBBY: ( QUIETLY )
DOUG: Bobby hesitates to talk.
LYNN: I'm almost ready.
DOUG: Listen. I'm sure your dad will be back soon. He's "Big Bob". It's gonna take more than a few snakes in the dark to stop him, right?
BRENDA: Can I listen to your iPod? Bobby is still focused on the door.
BOBBY: Can I borrow your iPod?
BRENDA: Can I borrow your iPod?
BOBBY: ( DISTANT )
DOUG: Ow, Ow. Yeah right there. Perfect. God, I feel like I crossed New Mexico on foot. Amused, Lynn squeezes his legs a bit harder. She moves up to his love handles.
LYNN: A little work out can't be all that bad for these guys, right? Doug laughs and giggles.
DOUG: Stop! Stop, you're tickling me! Lynn continues with more fervor.
LYNN: I love you.
DOUG: I love you too. They start making out.
BOBBY: He grabs the gun and exits the trailer, leaving the door 64 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 64 Bobby moves into the night. Beast is still barking somewhere in the dark. As he passes the SUV, he overhears the moaning and heavy breathing coming from inside. His flashlight moves over the desert terrain and the occasional bush. He calls out to his dog, trying not to wake Beast? Come on, boy. You hear me! Come on now. Bobby moves further from the trailer towards the barking.
BOBBY: Beast? Come on, boy. You hear me! Come on now. Bobby moves further from the trailer towards the barking.
BUSHES!: Bobby shines the light on the bush and approaches- Nothing. It must have been his imagination. The barking becomes a ferocious growl.
BOBBY: Doug! Doug! Caught red-handed, Lynn dresses and Doug pulls up his pants.
DOUG: Damanit! What is it now?
LYNN: ( through the window ) What do you want, Bobby?
BOBBY: Come on, open up! Lynn opens the back window giving him a dirty look.
LYNN: This had better be important. Bobby is too scared to keep the truth hidden. He regains his calm before talking.
BOBBY: Something's going on around here. We're not alone. Exasperated, Lynn takes a deep breath, not taking him I know this sounds weird, but there are people living in those hills.
LYNN: Bobby. We're in the middle of nowhere. Believe me, no one could survive out here!
BOBBY: I saw them. And Beauty.
DOUG: Beauty what?
BOBBY: They cut out her insides.
LYNN: What are you talking about?
BOBBY: Her guts were all over the place. He struggles to talk.
DOUG: Calm down Bobby, OK? Let's go check it out together. Lynn, stay right 67 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 67 From the window, we can see Bobby and Doug walking to the In the back room, Pluto hears them, grabs his walkie-talkie
PLUTO: 68 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 68 AT THAT MOMENT, an explosion takes place a few hundred yards away from the trailer. The flames climb into the air lighting the surrounding rocky SOMEONE SCREAMS. Doug and Bobby turn around.
ETHEL: IT'S BOB! IT'S BOB! Doug tries to hold her back, but she is determined to get to 69 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 69 Doug runs into the trailer grabbing a fire extinguisher and some blankets. In the panic, he fails to see Brenda restrained by Pluto.
DOUG: ( PANICKED )
LIZARD: ( with a smile ) You gotta be a man to do that. Pluto is outraged and tries to stand up. He wants to talk but no words come out. JUST GRUNTS AND GROWLS. Lizard savagely hits him several times. Behind them, terrified, Brenda watches helplessly as they Lizard puts his foot on Pluto's face, pinning him to the ground, and then points the gun to his head.
ETHEL: No..No.. It's not possible. That's not Bob. That's not my Bob. She grabs Doug by his shirt trying to convince him.
DOUG: Take your mother away from here! With her eyes fixed on her father, Lynn walks her mother In Bobby's eyes, sadness has been replaced by hatred. Full of rage, the youngster grabs the gun and walks away.

DOUG: Come back here, Bobby! Bobby disappears into the night. Doug covers Big Bob's face with a blanket.
LYNN: Oh my god! Lynn runs inside leaving her mother alone.
LIZARD: ( EVIL )
LYNN: ( PANTING )
BOBBY: Come on Doug! They're in the They both take off running.
LIZARD: Take it. Pluto obeys. Lizard grabs Brenda by the hair and pulls her out of the trailer.
LIZARD: I'll come back for ya. Lizard disappears into the night. Brenda lays on the ground trembling and crying. Doug arrives at the trailer, while Bobby aims the 9mm at the BANG! BANG! BANG! It's too late. They're gone. Bobby runs to his traumatized sister laying on the ground. He holds her in his arms, trying to calm her down. Doug approaches the open door. He notices bloody hand prints along the side of the trailer home- One of the attackers has been hurt.
DOUG: ( SOFTLY )
BOBBY: ( PANICKED ) BOBBY ( CONT'D )
ETHEL: This camper's so small. No matter how much you clean, it's always a Doug nods in silence.
DOUG: Not yet.
ETHEL: Did everyone go to bed?
DOUG: Yes, Brenda is here and Bobby is in the kitchen. At the other end, Bobby turns away, crying. Brenda looks away as well.
ETHEL: ( short of breath ) Is Lynn sleeping? Doug holds back the tears.
DOUG: ( after a beat ) Do you need anything? Ethel finds it more and more difficult to talk.
ETHEL: Look in the closet Doug, I'm sure I have another blanket. I'm so cold. Doug tucks one of the blankets around her.
DOUG: ( REASSURING )
ETHEL: You've always been so sweet. I understand why Lynn loves you so She raises her arm to caress his face. Her hand falls on the bed. Lifeless. Brenda screams, bursting into tears.
BOBBY: ( DETERMINED )
DOUG: DON'T BE STUPID! WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE, DO YOU HEAR ME? Fine. You stay here. I'm going after them. Doug gets between Bobby and the door, preventing the kid from Let me go!
BOBBY: Fine. You stay here. I'm going after them. Doug gets between Bobby and the door, preventing the kid from Let me go!
DOUG: You want to die, too?
BOBBY: I don't care. Doug drags him in front of his mother's body.
DOUG: Look! Look at what they did to your mother. Look at what they did to your sister. He slams Bobby against the door.
BOBBY: Think about what? They have Catherine, Doug. Doug remains silent.
DOUG: ( ENRAGED )
FUCKING MOUTH!: A MUFFLED SOUND COMES FROM OUTSIDE! They all freeze. Doug releases Bobby and immediately turns off the light. Plunged in darkness, Brenda panics again-
BRENDA: No.. No. don't turn it off!
CAMPFIRE!: BRENDA ( CONT'D ) ( TERRIFIED )
DOUG: Get ready Bobby.. Doug opens the door and jumps out ready to fight. From beneath the trailer, someone observes him. Doug bends down and discovers- GOGGLE'S SEVERED ARM. In its hand, the walkie-talkie still RADIO ( O.S. ) "Goggle? Goggle?" Doug grabs the radio. It's dripping with blood. Bobby is about to join him when Doug signals-
DOUG: The dog jumps into Doug's arms and begins licking his face. Bobby can't believe it, his dog has returned. Radio static comes back on the walkie. Bobby picks it up-
BOBBY: Good boy.. That's a good dog.
DOUG: ( in the radio )
BOBBY: I don't know, half a clip?
BRENDA: Mayday. Mayday. We need help ..Mayday. Mayday. can anybody hear me? Something has gone off in her eyes. She is absent, no longer living, just surviving. Doug is about to leave, taking with him anything from the trailer which might be useful.
BOBBY: Let me go with you.
DOUG: No, you stay here with your sister and stay by the radio. Somebody's bound to hear us. Brenda continues her distress call.
BRENDA: Mayday.mayday. Can anybody hear The sun'll be up soon. One of them is hurt, I'm going to follow his trail through the hills. Bobby pulls out the 9mm gun and hands it to him.
DOUG: ( TO BOBBY )
BOBBY: What about you?
DOUG: Don't worry about me, I'll take Beast sits at his feet ready to go. Doug straps the walkie- talkie over his shoulder.
BOBBY: ( CONTINUED ) 87 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 87
DOUG: I. I didn't mean what I said. Doug hugs him like a brother. Before walking out, he bends down to Lynn's body and kisses her one last time on the mouth.
BOBBY: I. I didn't mean what I said. Doug hugs him like a brother. Before walking out, he bends down to Lynn's body and kisses her one last time on the mouth.
DOUG: I'm going to find.our baby my love.I promise.
DOUG: ( to the dog ) I told you to stop smoking. Doug sets a different frequency on his radio-
DOUG: I followed the blood, I'm in front of a mine!
BOBBY: Yeah. Good luck, Doug. He puts the walkie away and takes out the flashlight.
DOUG: ( TO BEAST )
DOUG: Come on. You can't be serious. Then light goes. completely off, leaving Doug in darkness. Scratch! - He lights a match. Holding the tiny flame, Doug continues down the tunnel until he arrives at another fork. He can no longer see the blood A SHAPE SLIDES SWIFTLY BEHIND HIM! ( to Beast, meaning
HIMSELF ): Just stay calm, boy. A gust of air kills the match. He immediately lights another- Again, THE DRAFT SNUFFS IT OUT. He turns around, looking for the source of the air, and notices a reflection of light at the end of the tunnel. He moves towards the reflection.
DOUG: ( ENTHUSIASTIC )
BRENDA: Maybe somebody heard our calls..
BOBBY: Nobody's going to find us Brenda, even with that smoke.Nobody's coming._.. You heard what Doug said-We're alone now, just you and me. Let them come, I'm waiting for them. Now, Bobby stretches the nylon wire from the fishing pole around each stake. He sets the fishing pole next to the trailer, rigging to it one of Catherine's TOY SHAKERS- An improvised alarm system.
DOUG: Find her, Beast, find Catherine. With his nose to the ground, the dog pulls Doug straight Doug walks away through the streets, pulled by the dog. On the outskirts of town, we discover a fence buried in the sand. On it, an old metallic sign reads-
HIS FOREHEAD!: Doug approaches terrified.
DOUG: Where's my baby! Where's Big Brain does not answer.
BIG BRAIN: ( MURMURING )
DOUG: Where is she then? ANSWER ME! He raises the bat.
BIG BRAIN: ( weak and asthmatic ) .I don't know where she is. I never leave this place. Big Brain moves away from the window wheeling himself to the couch. His hands are thin and pale, like a child's.
DOUG: What signs?!
BIG BRAIN: ( SMILING )
DOUG: What the hell are you saying?!
BIG BRAIN: ( weak and asthmatic ) You people settled on our lands, you destroyed our homes, destroyed our silver mines. . .You 'ye made us what we've become! One day my father went into town begging for your help, and you know what the doctors did? They sterilized him like a dog! You thought that in the desert no one would see anything, or say anything, but the hills. The hills never forget.
BOOM.BOOM.B000M!: I don't know what you're talking about. All I want is my daughter. Big Brain remains silent.
DOUG: I don't know what you're talking about. All I want is my daughter. Big Brain remains silent.
BIG BRAIN: Maybe a trailer? Yeah, a pretty trailer, just like yours.
DOUG: Where are the others? Where is my Big brain starts laughing a high pitched sound.
BIG BRAIN: IT'S BREAKFAST TIME! At the same moment-
DOUG!: Doug loses his bat but slides away before the axe comes swinging down. Desperate, he picks up the bat and uses it as a shield. The axe splits it in half. Doug throws himself at Pluto plunging the splintered bat into his abdomen. The sharp piece of wood enters Pluto's stomach. Completely out of his mind, Pluto removes the piece of wood from his abdomen and beats Doug in the face with it, sending him across the room. Pluto lowers his head, charging Doug like a bull. Doug crashes into one of the walls. He can't even take a breath before the giant grabs him by the leg like a rag doll and throws him through a wall. Doug falls to the ground in the living room. Wounded and exhausted, he is also defenseless. He has lost his glasses. Not far away, Big Brain savors the spectacle. The giant walks to him spinning the axe in his hand like a His foot crushes Doug's glasses on the floor. The axe swings through the air. Doug jumps out of the way.
DOUG: Please, I'm begging you. Don't kill me.
PLUTO: ( making fun of him ) Loook at-t hiiis fa-ace. Loook at- at hiiis fa-ace. Even the frozen faces of the test dummies seem to mock him.
BIG BRAIN: The baby. the baby is in the last house on the left.
BIG BRAIN: Lizard. Kill the baby.
LIZARD: Get out of the way Ruby.
DOUG: He goes to the crib and discovers a plastic doll.
SMALL VOICE: ( INNOCENT )
DOUG: 112 INT. LIZARD'S HOUSE - DAY 112 Lizard lifts the machete and removes the blanket-
CATHERINE!: 112 INT. LIZARD'S HOUSE - DAY 112 Lizard lifts the machete and removes the blanket-
STATION!: Ruby made the swap before Lizard entered the kitchen. The piglet runs off oinking.
LIZARD: Enraged, Lizard sticks the machete into the table.
RUUUBY!: Enraged, Lizard sticks the machete into the table.
DOUG: 115 EXT./INT. 1950 CAR - DAY 115 Under the fake car, in between the seats, Beast finds a hole big enough to fit his nose. The animal forces his way through, scratching at the floor until he finally fits his body through the hole and out of the car. The dog runs down Main Street.
BRENDA: I don't.see anybody. What's Bobby and Brenda leave their hiding place. They move, back to back, cautious.
BOBBY: ( LOW VOICE )
WINDOW!: ( CONTINUED ) 116 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 116
BRENDA: Further ahead, on the ground, a tumbleweed is stuck on the fishing wire, moving it in the wind.
BOBBY: ( TO BRENDA )
BRENDA?!: Terrorized, Brenda backs up to the trailer, while her brother, with a determined look on his face, walks to the 117 INT. TRAILER - DAY 117 Brenda returns to the trailer where two propane tanks have been brought out from under the sink. Through the window, she watches her brother get further out.
LIZARD: Ruby.Ruby! You come back here right now. You hear me, you little The road on the edge comes to a dead end. Ruby is stuck, the only way out is to climb. Without using her hands, she attempts to ascend. It's close to impossible.
DOUG: My baby .My little princess. It's me, it's daddy. He kisses the baby and hugs her tightly, elated. Ruby is moved. She smiles when suddenly her face freezes-
BANG!: At the last second, Ruby jumps on Lizard changing the direction of the blast. They both fall off the mountain into the emptiness. Their bodies plunge a hundred feet down, splattering on the rocks RUBY HAS SACRIFICED HER OWN LIFE TO SAVE DOUG AND THE BABY. 130 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 130 One of the FAMILY PHOTOS of the carters posing with their dogs is slowly burning away in the flames. Pieces of the trailer still burn in the middle of the desert. Surrounded by debris, Papa Jupiter's body is impaled.on a darkened metal siding. Still alive but entirely burnt, his skin is raw and unrecognizable. With every breath, blood spits from his mouth. Facing this post atomic creature, Bobby hesitates to take it out of its misery. Brenda comes to his side-
BRENDA: Come on, Bobby. Let's get out of Bobby's face has changed. He is no longer the innocent kid of just a few hours ago. His eyes are now filled with rage and a determination to survive and succeed no matter what. Brenda and Bobby walk away from the burning trailer. On the other side of the smoke, they see-
