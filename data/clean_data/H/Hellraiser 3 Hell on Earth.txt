JOEY: Wait! I'm a reporter! Tell me where he was .
JOEY: Hold on. Hold on, please. I need talk to you.

JOEY: Under the Underground? What's that? Where is .
THE DOCTOR: - is on the floor, as if flung there by some powerful force. The fibrillator pads are still in his hands and his expression is awe-struck and disbelieving.
THE NURSE: - is cowering behind a mobile tray of surgical instruments, muttering to herself and making the gesture of the cross.
DOCTOR: Who's that? Get her out of here!
BRAD: ( over )

TWO BIMBOS: - giggle, purse their lips, shake their heads.
JOEY: - catches sight of a blonde figure moving across the dance floor and pushes through the crowd to follow. She taps the figure's arm but, as it turns, she realizes it is a man  some 70's revivalist GLITTER-ROCKER. He looks quizzically at her.

CUT TO: INT. BEDROOM, JOEY'S APARTMENT NIGHT Joey jerks upright in bed as the ringing continues. Confused and disoriented, her eyes fly around her darkened bedroom as if she's trying to understand where she is and what is happening.

TERRI: But I don't know anything! Really. I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street. He .
JOEY: Did you know him?
TERRI: No. I'd seen him in there a few times before. He was just a punk. I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief. He must've taken it from the statue.
JOEY: Taken what?
TERRI: The thing! He was lying there in the street, moaning. But he pointed at it
JOEY: Wait a minute. He was already . wounded . when you found him?

VARIOUS ANGLES: - showing the chaos all around the kitchen: Spilled flour on work surfaces; Egg-shells on the linoleum; A knocked-over glass of orange juice, the juice soaking into a piece of kitchen roll; Coffee as black and thick as a mix of Indian ink and CUT TO WIDE Joey, in her dressing-gown, stands in the doorway with a shocked expression on her face.
TERRI: I figured I'd make breakfast.

JOEY: How have you . ?
TERRI: Guys. Sometimes friends. Mostly guys.
DIFFERENT ANGLE: - as Terri walks on, pausing by the shelves of books.
TERRI: Wow. Lotta books. You read all these?
JOEY: No. I buy them to impress people. Of course I've read them.
TERRI: Cool. I read a book once. It was like all these people discovering who they used to be. You know, like reincarnation? It was really good. You ever read that?
JOEY: I don't think so. But it's a fascinating subject. Did you .
TERRI: Great view! Great view! Look at this!
JOEY: Actually, I'm pretty familiar with the view .
JOEY: ( off )
TERRI: ( looking to right and pointing ) Who's that?
JOEY: I don't know his name . I saw the whole story. A wounded bird was on his roof. I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it. I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't. Its pain spoke directly to him. He picked it up. Nursed it. Fed it. And it got better. Everyday he'd watch the pigeon. Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away. Didn't look back. But he heard the sound of its And he still sits there?
TERRI: And he still sits there?
JOEY: Every day.
TERRI: Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
JOEY: No. He knows it won't. It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
TERRI: Bullshit! He should've kept it. It'd live longer! It's dangerous out there! People get hurt!
JOEY: What? I wasn't talking about . I . Do you want to stay? You want to stay here for a while?
JOEY: OK. OK. It's a done deal. But look  you have to help me. I've got to solve this thing. I've got to know what's going on.
TERRI: But I don't know what's going on.
JOEY: Maybe not. But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
TERRI: Yeah. I found it. I knew held like it and I figured .
JOEY: Woah. Wait a minute. Who? The kid?
TERRI: No. JP. My last boyfriend? He like owns the club. You know? You were there? He bought the statue.
JOEY: That you found. What do you mean you found it?
TERRI: I was downtown looking for a . a friend. A guy I know. Anyway, there was this store. Like real old? Lotsa weird shit in there. I saw this statue. Pillar. Thing. I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
JOEY: Would you know this store again?
TERRI: Sure. Why?
JOEY: It's Saturday morning. Let's go
JOEY: Jesus. Are you sure this is the street?
TERRI: Yeah. Happening, isn't it?
JOEY: What on earth were you doing down here?
JOEY: Buying some drugs, alright?
TERRI: Buying some drugs, alright?
JOEY: Oh, Terri .
TERRI: For somebody else, alright? Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.

TERRI: Lady, will you shut the fuck up and give her a break.
MAMA: Quite a mouth. So what's the problem? You tell me. You I like.
JOEY: Thank you. This came off a . statue? A pillar. We wondered if you knew anything about the piece. About where it came from.
MAMA: Oh . yeah. Yeah. That thing. Ugly. Real ugly. I sold that?
MAMA: Never mind. I'm glad it's gone. Made the store feel strange. Who'd make such a thing?
JOEY: Fine. Fine. But can you tell us anything about it?
MAMA: It was part of a job-lot. Some loony- bin they shut down. Unclaimed stuff.
JOEY: What else came with it? Anything still Sure. Just papers, photos. Stuff nobody'd ever want.
MAMA: Sure. Just papers, photos. Stuff nobody'd ever want.
JOEY: Can we see?
MAMA: You gonna buy?
JOEY: I don't know. Maybe.
MAMA: Right at the back there. Middle shelves. Coupla folders. Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
JOEY: Terri, check out the other folder.
TERRI: What am I looking for?
JOEY: God knows. Anything. Contacts. Clues.
TERRI: Jesus. You're gonna pay her for this shit? It's like fucking business papers for God's sake!
ON JOEY: The next photo is that of a beautiful young woman. Joey flips it over. Gummed on the back is a type-written slip that says
ON BOX: The sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard OFF and then FADES as something strange begins to happen.
JOEY: ( softly )
TERRI: Joey . ?
JOEY: ( still staring at Box ) Help me pick 'em up, Terri. I think the lady just made a sale.
JOEY: Yeah . yeah . yeah . No, it's important that I speak to . What? No, don't . ( a beat ) Put. Me. On. Hold. You. Stupid. Bitch.

SANDY: Oh come on. There're lots of girls here who look better than .
JP: Don't do that! Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it.

SANDY: If it bothers you, just say so.
JP: It doesn't bother me. I'm just not Oh. Like I'm not an interesting person.

PINHEAD: What did you see? The same as I. Appetite sated. Desire indulged. You saw the working of the world in
JP: That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.

JP: Good. So did I. And that's all .
PINHEAD: Good. So did I. And that's all .
JP: No! No. It's not the same . I . No. What you did . it was . evil.
PINHEAD: How uncomfortable that word must feel on your lips. Evil. Good. There is no Good, Monroe. There is no Evil. There is only the flesh and the patterns to which we can submit it. You will help me to .
JP: No. No no no. No fuckin' way. I'm gone .
PINHEAD: ( off ) Another offering?
PINHEAD: I'm touched . That is the gun you used to kill your parents?
PINHEAD: I understand. Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional. What else could you do?
JP: Fuck you!
PINHEAD: Thank you. Now, shall we talk sensibly?
PINHEAD: Don't flee from yourself. If you have a quality, let it define you. Cultivate it. It is you. By helping me, you will help yourse.
JP: What!? What are you talking about? Why should I help you?
PINHEAD: Because you want to. You've always wanted to. Look at your pictures. Look at your sculptures. Look at those tawdry representations and then . Imagine. Imagine a world of the body as canvas. The body as clay. Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
JP: What are you?
PINHEAD: A dark star rising. I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed. A friend relieved me of that inconvenience. Now I'm free. Born again of Blood and Desire.
JP: Hey, that's what makes the world go
PINHEAD: You see, we're not so dissimilar.
JP: But how in God's name .
PINHEAD: God? My God was diamond and black light. And I was his Dark Pope. All that is changed. A terrible beauty is born. With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
JP: How do we start?

JOEY: ( softly ) Alright . Let's see what we got here.
KIRSTY: ( on video ) I don't know what the Box is. But I know what it does. I . ( looks up to side ) I've said all this before. Do you . ( blinks, nods, as if listening. Looks back to camera ) I saw it open. I opened it. I saw what came out. I don't know what else to call them. Demons. Demons live in the box. Or come through the box from somewhere else. It's a gateway to Hell. Or the South Bronx. ( smiles ruefully at her own joke. Looks up to side as if chastised for kidding around. Nods. Continues ) I know you don't believe me. I know what it sounds like. But what else . Jesus, talk to Ronson, talk to the other cops. They saw the house. They saw my . my father .
KIRSTY: ( on video ) Solving the puzzle means opening the box. Opening the box means opening doors. And there are some doors you don't want to open. And it may be metaphorical to you, Doctor, but you haven't had some blue-faced bastard come at you with hooks and chains. It isn't delusion, it isn't psychosis. It's reality. It's reality. ( Pause. Long drag on the cigarette? ) Maybe not this reality . but there are others. I've seen them.

TERRI: You're apologizing?
JP: Hey, it has been known. C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy. I have regrets. I'd like to put things right. Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Well . of course I have. I've thought. I've . Oh, JP, you were so horrible. You really hurt me .

KIRSTY: ( Looks to side ) Again? ( Shrugs. Looks back at camera ) The box. I don't know where it came from. I don't know who made it or why. I only know what it does. It hurts. It hurts. ( Looks off to side as if listening. ) How? ( Looks back ) I don't know. It kind of opens itself. Your fingers move. You learn. It wants to open, that's the thing. And it knows when you want to open it. And it helps. And it opens. And then they come. The Cenobites. The demons.

CUT TO: INT. JOEY'S BEDROOM NIGHT Joey sitting up in bed, eyes wide, still screaming.
JOEY: The cry cuts off abruptly as Joey realizes where she is.
JOEY: Is somebody here? Is somebody here!? Terri . ?
JOEY: What . What's going on? What's
ELLIOTT: You have to help me, Joey.
BLACKNESS: A CLICK is heard OFF and the room is lit, REVEALING JP by the door, his finger by the light-switch. He smiles into the room and walks in, looking behind as Terri hesitates by the door.
JP: Come on in.
JP: Not a good neighborhood. People disappear. ( a beat ) Feel like home? It's just like you left it.
TERRI: Not quite. This wasn't here.
JP: No. But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it. You found a real treasure for me, Terri. I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
TERRI: Yeah . yeah, it looks different.
JP: Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up. Put her heart and soul into it.
TERRI: A girl? Anyone I should know?
JP: Not now, no. I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
TERRI: Yeah right. Look .
JP: Terri, listen. ( a beat ) Why don't you come here and kiss me? I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right? Is it going to happen? Isn't it going to happen? Let's get it out of the way. See how we feel. Then we can relax. Talk. You know.
TERRI: I don't think so. Not yet. I'm not ready yet.
JP: Sure. Sure. I understand. It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
JP: That's terrible. What a bitch. She was obviously just using you, Terri. Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
TERRI: No. It isn't . she wouldn't . It's like I must have done something wrong, you know? Freaked her out. Just fucked up something good again.
JP: Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me. You know that. It was my fault, babe, it really was. And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now. I hate to see you in pain like this.
TERRI: Yes! God, yes. I . I just want to hug you. To hold you. To tell you it's
JP: Yes! God, yes. I . I just want to hug you. To hold you. To tell you it's
JP: No. No, sweetheart, you come to me. It's not fair. I come over there. You know. We're on the bed. I just . 'cos you know how much you excite me. God, just looking at you. You're so beautiful. I come over there and I'd just want to touch you. Feel you. Kiss you. And that isn't what this is about. C'mon, babe, come to daddy. Let me make it better.
TERRI: No . Wait a .
EVERYTHING ERUPTS!: JP, smiling mask wiped off, leaps at Terri.
PINHEAD: Bring her to me, boy!
WIDER ANGLE: Terri - safely feet away from the pillar - stands, shaking and breathless, eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this creature from nightmare.
PINHEAD: Wait! Why run? Where to? Do you know where you are?
TERRI: I'm . I'm .
PINHEAD: You're at the door of dreams. And you can open it.
TERRI: What are you talking about?
PINHEAD: There are two keys in this room. On is in the pocket of this fool. You could take it out without me reaching you. ( a beat ) Probably. And you could use it to let yourself back in to the world you know. The world you've always known; banal, hopeless, dreamless.
TERRI: And . like . the other?
PINHEAD: The other is the key to dreams. To a world of black miracles and dark wonder. Another life of unknown pleasures. It's yours. Complete the pattern. Solve the puzzle. Turn the key.
TERRI: Where is it?
PINHEAD: It's lying bleeding at your feet.
JP: ( delerious. Ad-lib ) Unhhh . Terri . what . no .
JP: ( screaming ) No! Terri! Please! I didn't mean to..!!
PINHEAD: I have such sights to show you.
WIDER ANGLE: Pinhead, fully-fleshed and incarnate, stands in the room. At his feet are the dry husk that was JP and the steaming, hissing remnants of the pillar like a pool of black toxic oil.
JOEY: How .. ?
DIFFERENT ANGLE: Formal, classical framing from a low angle - Joey and radio in foreground, big picture window and its closed drapes in the Joey kneels up in front of the table.
ENGLISH VOICE: . and the King has sent a personal message of sympathy to the parents of those brave men who .
FRENCH VOICE: L'Oiseau chante avec ses doigts. Deux
ELLIOTT: Joey. Look out your window.
JOEY: Tell me . Tell me . Hello?
JOEY: I'm seven floors up . I'm seven floors up! I can't .
JOEY: Now what? I'm here. Now what? I just walked into madness for you. Talk!
JOEY: Great. That's just great! You bring me here. You freeze up on me. And now there's no way out. I've had dates like you before. I .
JOEY'S POV: At the far end of the Quonset Hut, behind Elliott, a door has creaked open an inch or two.
JOEY: Thanks. I think.
JOEY: What's going on? Is this a dream?
ELLIOTT: Joey. How kind of you to come.
JOEY: Wait . wait. You . you have to help me. I don't understand. Am I dreaming You have to help me. You will understand. And no, you're not dreaming. Do you know where we are?
ELLIOTT: You have to help me. You will understand. And no, you're not dreaming. Do you know where we are?
JOEY: It's . I don't know. First World War, Correct. The fields of France. And many dead flowers . Oh. Forgive me. My name was Spenser. Elliott Spenser.
ELLIOTT: Correct. The fields of France. And many dead flowers . Oh. Forgive me. My name was Spenser. Elliott Spenser.
JOEY: Joey Summerskill.
ELLIOTT: Well done. Brave girl. You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
JOEY: Captain Spenser. Elliott. I . What the Hell is going on?
ELLIOTT: Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey. And we have to stop it. I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true. Will you walk with me a while?
ELLIOTT: There were days in this war, days right on top of each other, when the newly dead were numbered in the tens of thousands. They called it the war to end all wars. Though it didn't. You know that. There were more wars. More dead. Your father's war. Your dream search for your father led you here. To me. Joey, we need to talk.
ELLIOTT: The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently. This is me a few years later. We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921. I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see. So many dead. For us God, too, fell at Flanders. We adjusted to the loss. And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further. I went further. I thought I was a lost soul. But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
JOEY: And what is . this frozen moment?
ELLIOTT: The cusp of my life. What I was, what I am, what I will be . past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision. I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
JOEY: And what did you discover?
ELLIOTT: Something bad.
JOEY: And why are you back? Why are we here?
ELLIOTT: Because something worse is coming.
JOEY: Kirsty Cotton. Yes. But . if your soul was freed, why are you back?
ELLIOTT: Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws. The protocol of Hell. The Box had to be opened to let me out. The truly innocent were safe. That's no longer true. The shell of the beast has been fleshed. What I was is out there, Joey. In your world. Unbound. What will he do? What does he want?
JOEY: What will he do? What does he want?
ELLIOTT: He'll do what he does best. But he'll do it unfettered. He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human What can we do?
JOEY: What can we do?
ELLIOTT: I like you, Joey. You ask all the right questions. There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
JOEY: I don't know .
ELLIOTT: Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another. You're stronger than you think.
JOEY: Then tell me what to do.
ELLIOTT: This is his first night on Earth. He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back. He has to destroy So where is it?
JOEY: So where is it?
ELLIOTT: Your apartment.
JOEY: Wha .. ?
ELLIOTT: The Box, Joey. He wants the Box.
CROWD: ( ad-lib ) Oh My God .
FADE OUT: FADE IN

ELDER COP: Get your head outta your stinkin' ass and look at me, boy.

ELDER COP: I have the distinct impression I told you to fuckoff. Unless I miss my guess, you've just disobeyed an officer of the
PINHEAD: I am the Law.
ELDER COP: You're one butt-ugly son of a bitch and you're about to dead meat.
PINHEAD: I am the son of eternal night and you are about to discover pain has no
YOUNGER COP: Oh shh .
ELDER COP: No. No. No. No. No. No.
PINHEAD: Curb your tongue.
JOEY: But I have to see him! I'm his friend!
PARAMEDIC: Lady, trust me! You really don't want to go .
JOEY: No! NO!!
PRIEST: ( calling down aisle ) Is there anyone there? Hello?
PRIEST'S POV: To the Priest, it's an image of nightmarish blasphemy. Even to us heathens, it's pretty shocking;
PRIEST: How dare you!
PINHEAD: I am the Way.
PRIEST: You'll burn in Hell for this!
PINHEAD: Burn? What a limited imagination.
PINHEAD: This is my body. This is my blood. Happy are they who come to my supper.
BLACKNESS: INT/EXT JOEY'S CAR/CITY STREETS NIGHT Joey is driving again. And this time she's not even stopping at red lights. She steams across junctions, leaving cars swerving and horns honking in her wake.
JOEY: ( appalled ) Oh God .
JOEY: Having fun en route, you bastard.
JOEY: Oh shit .
JOEY: Thanks to the miracles of trick photography, the remnants suddenly come back together and reassemble themselves into the Box which sits there intact on the floor.
PINHEAD: Thanks to the miracles of trick photography, the remnants suddenly come back together and reassemble themselves into the Box which sits there intact on the floor.
PINHEAD: The Box can't be destroyed. Like pain or the poor, it is always with us. But as long as I have it, no-one can open it. Now come here and die. You have friends in Hell waiting to greet you.
JOEY: You'll have to come and get me, you ugly Spirited. Good. I'll enjoy making you bleed. I'll enjoy making you enjoy it.
PINHEAD: Spirited. Good. I'll enjoy making you bleed. I'll enjoy making you enjoy it.
SIDELONG ANGLE: - shows his arm entering the shattered window and also shows the night-time cityscape beyond the window. What it doesn't show is the front of the monster's arm. That's somewhere else.
CUT TO: INT. QUONSET HUT CLOSE on Pinhead's arm, still clutching at the air.
PINHEAD: ( furious rage ) Joey! Back to the wall, quickly!
ELLIOTT: Joey! Back to the wall, quickly!
JOEY: Elliott! No! What about you?! Where will you be?!
ELLIOTT: Back with the damned. No more hope of heaven. But I drag this monster back with me!
PINHEAD: You stupid interfering foo . AAAAAH!
SEATED OFFICER: The essences of Pinhead and Elliott - drawn from their bodies as sweeping, glowing, spitting arcs of BLUE LIGHT - crackle in the air of the Hut like a miniature electrical storm .
JOEY: Elliott? . Elliott? . You can't hear me, can you? It's 1921. I'm not really here .
JOEY: ( SCREAMS!!!! )
PINHEAD: Oh, no kiss of welcome after 70 years?
PINHEAD: This will be so good, Joey. You loved him, didn't you? I can feel him inside, weeping for you. He can watch through the centuries as we discover the things that make you whimper.
PINHEAD: You never met, did you? This was JP Have you seen what they did to me? Have you seen what they did? You interfering little whore!
JP CENOBITE: Have you seen what they did to me? Have you seen what they did? You interfering little whore!
JOEY: Terri? Oh no! NO!! TERRI!!
TERRI CENOBITE: Oh, go on. Have one. Fuck it. You think you're going to live forever?
JOEY: Wanna light, you bitch?!
PINHEAD: His hands are raised palms out. He's stopped advancing.
PINHEAD: You can send me back. But why? I can help you, Joey. I can give you what you You'll never know what I want .
JOEY: You'll never know what I want .
PINHEAD: Respect. Power. You and I can put your name on the World's lips, your face on it's screens .
