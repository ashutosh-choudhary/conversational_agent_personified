MGM LOGO: DISSOLVE TO:
ADAM: You know it. I'm gonna bang all sorts of chicks this weekend!
LILY: That's not the answer I was looking Sorry, honey. Adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss. She shows him some PHOTOS.
ADAM: Sorry, honey. Adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss. She shows him some PHOTOS.
LILY: Look what I found.
ADAM: Check out that young stud. Can you believe he's about to get married? Lily and Adam look through more PHOTOS of a YOUNG ADAM ( 17 ) partying at a SKI RESORT with his FRIENDS: In full 80s SKI GEAR on a mountain. Eating PIZZA at "Papa Enzo's," stuffing their faces. Drinking BEERS at the "Brew Haus," an awesome pub. In the HOT TUB with SIX GIRLS. Adam snatches the last photo from her.
LILY: Adam, you didn't know me yet. As Adam goes back to packing, Lily leafs through some more of the photos. She stops at one and her EXPRESSION CHANGES.
ADAM: I'm not sure.
LILY: Lily shows Adam another PHOTO: YOUNG ADAM with his arm around the SKI BUNNY, who looks like she was ambushed for the photo.
ADAM: Oh! Jennie.
LILY: Who's Jennie?
ADAM: She's nobody. Ski instructor. ( off her look ) You didn't know me yet. Lily still looks at him a little hard.
LILY: Do you still think of her?
ADAM: Of course not! I think of you. As Adam goes to EMBRACE her:
LILY: Hold on. Lily goes into the CLOSET.
ADAM: She comes out a moment later with a CARDBOARD BOX, which she empties onto the BED. About FIFTY PORNO MAGAZINES spill out, ranging from TITS MONTHLY to BLACK ASS.
LILY: Explain this. From ADAM'S POV, we see the brochure: A ski brochure featuring Jennie on the cover.
ADAM: OK! You caught me! I occasionally. reminisce. about Jennie O'Keefe!
LILY: That's gross.
ADAM: ( without missing a beat ) About two hours ago when you were on the phone with your mother.
LILY: Jesus. Tell me how I'm supposed to let you go to your bachelor party and not be a basket case?
ADAM: What are you so worried about?
LILY: I'm worried that you're still thinking about this girl.
ADAM: Baby, the girl in that picture was nothing more than a crush. I could never get her and there's no possibility I'll ever be with her. She was a total stranger. Lily gets a CURIOUS LOOK on her face.
LILY: So. you're into strangers?
ADAM: Well not the creepy "your mom was in an accident, now come with me" kind. But yeah, the hot lady in the supermarket kind of stranger. You have to admit - it's kinda hot.
LILY: So you're saying if you and I didn't know each other, it would be pretty hot if we fooled around?
ADAM: You kidding me? It would be fucking incredible.
LILY: Oh I'm all alone in this big house. Cheerleading camp just ended and I need to get out of these sweaty ADAM ( O.S. ) Love where you're going with this, baby! Keep it up! She unbuttons her pants and SLIDES DOWN HER JEANS.
LILY: Mmmm. My panties are so tight against my firm naked body.
LILY: Are you gonna let me do this?
LILY: It feels so good to be so naked. I hope no one can see me. Just then a BLACK MAN ( late 30s, handsome, J Crew ) saunters through the bedroom door, holding a coffee and all riled up.
BLACK MAN: OK, so this asshole in front of me at the donut place is WHOA! Lily covers up and SCREAMS.
LILY: Get out of here!! He SPILLS the coffee on his hands and their rug as he turns.
BLACK MAN: Fuck! Ow! I'm sorry. I'll clean it up. That's gonna stain, though.
LILY: Just leave! He heads for the door, just as: Adam comes in, wearing a MAILMAN hat and NOTHING ELSE.
ADAM: Special delivery for Jesus The black man doesn't know which way to look. He covers his eyes and drips coffee, as he blindly steps toward the door.
BLACK MAN: ( NOT LOOKING )
LILY: I can't wait for you to come back and marry me. Wow, that's crazy. Adam looks almost like it just hit him.
ADAM: ( REALIZATION )
LILY: Tell me again I have nothing to worry about.
ADAM: Babe, look at Nick. In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio.
LILY: OK. Have an awesome bachelor party. Not too awesome. ( hands him bag ) I got you something. Adam looks in the bag.
ADAM: Sandwich. Thanks. He puts it in his BACKPACK. She looks like she was expecting a different reaction, but she lets it go. He kisses her.
LILY: Let me see your phone. He takes it out.
ADAM: I told you, I'll call you when She snatches it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as she pockets the phone.
LILY: Despite my anxiety, I'm not gonna be one of those women who wants an update every ten minutes. Even though I do want an update every ten minutes. Adam smiles. Lily looks a bit trepidatious.
ADAM: You should. I'm a lame-o.
LILY: Well at least you're a cute lame-o. Lily leans in and they NUZZLE their noses together in a disgusting display of affection. A FLASH goes off. From the car, Nick holds up his iPhone.
NICK: I'm more than willing to forget about earlier, but this shit's going on Facebook.
NICK: I have no idea what Facebook is. My phone has a button that says Send To Facebook. I've been sending shit there for months. Adam looks out the window, smiling.
ADAM: I'm so psyched about this weekend!
NICK: Ditto, buddy. I'm gonna help you make up for all the good times you missed when you were being a responsible member of society.
ADAM: You're a good friend. I'm sorry for putting my career and self sufficiency above bowling night.
NICK: This trip represents everything awesome about being a dude.
ADAM: Live the dream.
NICK: Best of all, we don't have to answer to anyone. Nick's PHONE rings and he answers it with his built-in BLUETOOTH. His phone voice is a little more "sensitive."
NICK: The whole damn chain.
ADAM: This looks like a place where people die. Mostly from murder. A BALD, miserable-looking GUY in his late 30s ( LOU ) exits a room, carrying TWO SHOPPING BAGS. He gets in the back seat. Adam looks happy to see him.
LOU: Yes, I'm living in a transient motel. Let's get that purple elephant out of the room.
ADAM: Dude, it looks nice.
LOU: Thank you. I hate your guts.
ADAM: ( re: the bags ) What'd you bring?
LOU: All my belongings.
NICK: So you're sorta like a bum now, In a sense.
LOU: In a sense.
LOU: Our system is fucked, gentlemen. You tell me how a whore wife can fuck some black dude - no offense - and still take her cuckold of a husband for all he's got.
NICK: Why would I take offense to that?
LOU: It's offensive.
NICK: Because he's black?
LOU: And because he's fucking my wife. And because you're black. And because of all the oversensitive horrible garbage. you know what? Forget no offense. Just offense. Are you offended?
NICK: Not really.
LOU: Then shut the fuck up.
ADAM: She's got a hell of an attorney.
LOU: Yes and thank you so very much for giving her the referral.
ADAM: She told me it was for a friend.
NICK: So. what? Your wife likes black dick now?
LOU: I'm gonna slaughter you in your sleep tonight.
ADAM: ( turns to Lou, genuine ) Thanks for coming, man.
LOU: Oh, Adam's stupid brother's coming? Boo! Drive away before he gets in the car!
ADAM: Be nice. I know Jacob's kind of a douche, but I'm trying to be closer to him since Mom died. Jacob gets in the back next to Lou.
LOU: ( VERY INSINCERE )
JACOB: You look dirty and you smell bad.
LOU: You look gay and you smell like a basket of fancy soaps. Advantage How is that to your advantage?
JACOB: How is that to your advantage?
ADAM: He's not gay. He's just. what are you again?
JACOB: You have sex with trains?
LOU: You have sex with trains?
JACOB: For your information, I fuck chicks. Hot ones.
LOU: For your information, you fuck dudes. Gay ones.
JACOB: Yeah, well at least I'm young and my life's full of potential. I hear you're homeless now?
LOU: ( to Nick and Adam ) You told him?!
ADAM: Will you two please shake hands and make up? We're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Jacob distractedly TEXTS on his phone.
JACOB: Yeah, about that. Why aren't we going to Aspen? Vermont's lame.
ADAM: It's gonna be fun.
JACOB: Yeah, whatever. And with that, the guys travel in silence for a few moments, the lifeblood drained from the car. Finally.
LOU: I've gotta take a shit.
LOU: That was an ugly experience.
NICK: I don't wanna hear about it.
LOU: In a few years, when I'm dying of an exotic disease that causes my penis to bleed until it falls off, someone remember to tell the hospital to check out the filthy crapper at the Albany Rest Stop. It's the AIDS monkey of toilets. The guys put down their sandwiches.
ADAM: Thank you.
LOU: I don't know how you're doing it, man. I mean, Laurie's hot, don't get me wrong.
ADAM: ( CORRECTING )
LOU: Right. Lily. But one vagina? That's the sacrifice. Jacob nods, agreeing with Lou's concern.
ADAM: That's the sacrifice. Jacob nods, agreeing with Lou's concern.
JACOB: And you're OK with that? I don't know your sexual history, but you sure you got it out of your system?
ADAM: I did OK for myself.
LOU: He didn't do that well for himself.
NICK: Yeah, isn't Lily your fourth?
ADAM: Fifth. Thank you.
JACOB: So you're averaging like one girl every eight years.
ADAM: Assuming I got laid when I was That would be awesome. Adam gives Lou a distasteful look.
LOU: That would be awesome. Adam gives Lou a distasteful look.
ADAM: I'm fine. Maybe some cold feet, but that's normal. Thank you everyone for your concern.
JACOB: Just looking out for you. That's what brothers do, right? They look out for each other?
ADAM: ( takes a moment ) Is this about something else?
JACOB: Forget it.
ADAM: No, let's do this. I'm sorry I wasn't around when you were growing up, OK? I was in college. And then I was working. Dad left. Someone had to take responsibility.
LOU: ( TO LOU )
ADAM: ( TO LOU )
JACOB: I said forget it.
NICK: Guys, come on. Let's move past it. This is gonna be a fun weekend.
JACOB: I still say Vermont sucks.
LOU: You're confusing Vermont with yourself. This weekend is going to be incredible and you will not ruin it for me.
ADAM: ( softens, to Jacob ) You might like it. Havenhurst is pretty awesome. Jacob shrugs, but Lou gets excited.
LOU: Fuck yeah it is! We're gonna ski the trail and bone some tail!
ADAM: ( LAUGHS )
LOU: Fuck that. You'll bone your own.
ADAM: No I won't.
LOU: Adam, trust me. Biggest mistake of my life - not fucking a whore at my bachelor party.
NICK: That's the biggest mistake of your Fuck yeah. And he's not making that same mistake.
LOU: Fuck yeah. And he's not making that same mistake.
ADAM: Uh. I'm not having sex with anyone this weekend. Lou looks at Adam, trying to figure things out.
LOU: Ohhhh. I gotcha.
ADAM: I'm not having sex this weekend. Without the winking.
LOU: ( WINKING )
ADAM: I'm pretty sure you don't.
NICK: Gentlemen. welcome to Havenhurst.
ADAM: EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - AFTERNOON The car winds through the main thoroughfare. Rather than a quaint ski town, this place resembles a suburban nightmare, with STRIP MALLS and CHAIN RESTAURANTS. It's the exact opposite of the fun town we saw in Adam's photos.
JACOB: so this is the coolest town ever?
ADAM: Oh man. The Brew Haus is a PF Lou notices a TGI Friday's, with a sign advertising a "Hannah Montana 3-D Experience!" He looks utterly disgusted.
LOU: I don't even have the heart to tell you what I just fucking saw. But say goodbye to Papa Enzo's. This town sucks.
NICK: What the fuck is going on? The car climbs a twisty part of the road.
JACOB: Pink Paradise. Best strip club The car rounds the corner and a SIGN comes into view. The beginning reads "Pink."
ADAM: Pink Paradise. Best strip club The car rounds the corner and a SIGN comes into view. The beginning reads "Pink."
NICK: Yes! It lives! The car continues to climb and the whole sign comes into view: "Pinkberry."
LOU: I wanna die.
JACOB: ( OBLIVIOUS )
LOU: ( TO NICK )
ADAM: I'm not playing drinking games with my grandma.
NICK: OK so the place skews a little older. Let's check in. We're not spending our time inside anyway.
PHIL: ( CURT )
LOU: This guy's a dick.
NICK: No, fuck that.
SHH: No, fuck that.
LOU: No, fuck that.
JACOB: Captain America.
LOU: Go fuck yourself. Phil finally drops their bags at their room and then:
PHIL: I'm ready to be tipped.
LOU: ( SELF UNAWARE )
NICK: Gentlemen. in this room lies the beginning of our awesome weekend.
JACOB: Or a continuation of everything that's sucked so far.
LOU: Yeah, I bet it's gonna be lame as shit in there. The furniture probably smells like mold.
JACOB: I say we go to Foxwoods.
LOU: I actually kinda like that idea.
ADAM: Everyone looks at Adam.
ADAM: ( SHRUGS )
JACOB: What the hell is with this place?
LOU: It's like a Stephen King novel, except not as cool.
NICK: We'll feel a lot better once we hit the slopes.
LOU: Thank. God.
ADAM: At least some things never change.
JACOB: What's the big deal about a hot Shame on you.
ADAM: Shame on you.
NICK: There's plenty of time for tubbin'. Let's ski.
JACOB: ( re: their outfits ) When's the last time you guys actually went skiing?
ADAM: It's been a few years.
NICK: I think we look good.
JACOB: Then you're an idiot.
NICK: All right, we race down the mountain. Loser buys first round. Premium shit only.
JACOB: You gonna be all right?
NICK: What does that mean?
JACOB: I dunno - do black dudes ski?
NICK: Of course black dudes ski. Aren't I wearing skis?
JACOB: I'm just not sure you're You're calling me an Uncle Tom?
NICK: You're calling me an Uncle Tom?
JACOB: I don't even know what that means.
NICK: It means black dudes ski. ( pulls down goggles ) Catch ya at the bottom. Nick takes off and. gets about 15 FEET, before he hits a GRASSY PATCH and falls over.
LOU: Black dudes don't ski.
ADAM: ( MOCK YELLING )
ADAM: ( SYMPATHETIC ) ( CLAPS HANDS )
NICK: ( CLAPS HANDS )
AIDEN: You fellas look like you can handle some spice. I'm gonna knock it up a bit. throw some chili sauce in there. oh yeah, there it is. This is gonna knock your socks off.
NICK: Thank you. The waiter walks away and Nick RAISES HIS GLASS in a toast.
JACOB: To my brother, I say thank you for including me. I promise to try to make the most of it. The guys look confused at the backhanded graciousness.
ADAM: Thanks for coming, man. It means a lot to me. Jacob nods halfheartedly.
NICK: To Adam!
GUYS: To Adam! The guys hug and clink glasses and excitedly CHATTER. Just then, a MANAGER appears at the table and CLEARS HIS THROAT.
MANAGER: Gentlemen. You're going to have to keep it down.
NICK: Come on, man. It's our friend's bachelor party. We're just trying to roast him a little bit.
MANAGER: Well if you like roasts, I suggest the roast peking duck. It's out of this world and as I'm sure Aiden has told you, he can make it quite The guys look bothered.
LOU: This kung pau chicken pairs very nicely with the 97 cab. Very impressive choice, Nick.
NICK: Thank you.
LOU: Also, this is the worst bachelor party I've ever been to. Everyone puts down their forks, cathartically fed up.
JACOB: Totally agree.
ADAM: Nick, look. You had great intentions. No one's blaming you.
LOU: I'm blaming him.
JACOB: I'm totally blaming him. I didn't even want to go skiing.
NICK: OK I'll admit this trip is not off to the best start. But we're due for a victory! Nick thinks and actually gets an idea. He SNAPS his fingers.
ADAM: Lou gets up and throws down his napkin.
LOU: Why did we even bother with dinner? Adam and Nick get up too.
JACOB: Guys, I'm still hungry.
LOU: Quiet, men are talking. Aiden approaches.
AIDEN: Get you guys some to-go boxes?
LOU: I would like you to die. And then I would like you to leave. Aiden walks away, freaked out. Lou turns back to the guys.
LOU: Oh my god. The water is perfect.
JACOB: I really don't see the appeal. It's like a glorified bath.
NICK: Jacob. Son. The hot tub is the whole thing! You ski all day. Then you hit the town, get trashed, and lure some fine ladies back to the lodge for some good old fashioned tubbin'. Nick CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back.
JACOB: Fuck it. Jacob strips down and gets in. As he submerges, he actually starts to loosen up a bit and smiles.
LOU: I'm not convinced this is anything more than a bath, but it's nice.
JACOB: I'm not convinced this is anything more than a bath, but it's nice.
NICK: Hit him with some bubbles.
ADAM: Coming right up. Adam CRANKS A KNOB. As the BUBBLES comes to life, we begin a TUBBIN' MONTAGE over Reel 2 Real's "I Like to Move It."
NICK: Oh my god, I wanna die.
JACOB: I need a vitamin water. Adam reaches in his backpack, taking out two choices.
ADAM: Red Bull or Fresca? Jacob takes the Fresca, as Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS.
LOU: That fucking bear got me good.
ADAM: Yeah he did.
LOU: But we showed him, didn't we?
ADAM: If by showing him, you mean we laughed and he got bored and wandered off into the woods with your sneakers, then yeah, we got him good.
LOU: Fuck yeah. Lou picks up Adam's half-eaten sandwich and takes a BITE.
ADAM: You just puked.
LOU: That's why I'm eating your sandwich. I'm fucking starving.
NICK: Guys, look. Their gaze turns to the MOUNTAIN PEAK, on which is a fresh LAYER OF POWDER. It looks like perfect skiing conditions.
ADAM: Let's do it!
JACOB: What is this, a shitty car club? The guys COMPLETELY MISS the BILLBOARDS ACROSS THE STREET: "Coming soon: the most spaced-out Mel Brooks film yet!
SPACEBALLS!": A surfing MAX HEADROOM with a CAN OF COKE and the tag: "Catch the Wave!" A bull terrier named SPUDS MCKENZIE parking with some HOT BABES and a shitload of BUD LIGHT.
ADAM: Well this place has improved. In the lift line, Lou passes a GUY wearing a BIG HEADBAND.
LOU: Really, asshole?
ADAM: I'm really glad we stayed. It's gonna be good to get away for a couple of days.
NICK: Believe me I know.
ADAM: I love her. But you guys are right. I'm gonna be with her for the rest of my life.
NICK: ( NODS )
ADAM: It gets easier, right? No offense, but watching you talk with Courtney-
NICK: You're gonna be fine. You'll settle in, get the premium cable package - the usual deal. Adam nods.
ADAM: Sorry, I lost myself there.
NICK: Sorry, I lost myself there.
NICK: That is a lot of cocaine.
ADAM: I feel like we're in Scarface. Only with skiing.
NICK: I'm gonna pass.
ADAM: ( DECLINES )
ADAM: DUDE IN SUNGLASSES Yeah, dipstick. You narcs? You Miami Vice? Which one's Crockett? Which one's CROCKETT?!
ADAM: I'm Crockett, obviously!
NICK: We're not spazzes. The dude extends the coke once more.
NICK: Adam, you gotta chill. You just did one line.
ADAM: I've never ridden the horse before.
NICK: You're not riding the horse. The horse is heroin. Adam can't stop moving and fidgeting.
ADAM: I don't know what kind of animal I'm riding, but it's the best animal of all time. I feel great! Adam uses his SKI POLES to push off the top of the mountain and he goes FLYING DOWN THE SLOPE.
NICK: Adam! Jesus.
ON ADAM: He zips along, never changing course or slowing. He BARELY MISSES a few TREES. But he can't stop himself before
ADAM: What a rush! He notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up.
ADAM: ( MIND BLOWN )
JENNIE: Do I know you? He stares at her, not believing what he's seeing. He still looks loopy from the coke. Just then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered hair, striped-jumpsuited guy ( BLAINE ) SKIS UP and GRABS ADAM.
BLAINE: I'm gonna serve you a knuckle sandwich, airhead.
JENNIE: I think so.
BLAINE: Your lift ticket's been revoked. Blaine throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends.
ADAM: ( a la Lethal Weapon 2 ) Diplomatic immunity. Blaine looks confused, as Adam RIPS Blaine's lift ticket, but he ends up RIPPING BLAINE'S JACKET too.
BLAINE: You're dead meat, scumbag. Just then, SNOW POWDER flies in Blaine's face. Blaine lets go of Adam, as Jacob snowboards up and stops short, coming to his brother's side.
JACOB: There you are! My brother's had a few too many triple Venti nonfat lattes if you know what I mean. ( genuine, to Adam ) Are you OK? Adam nods. Blaine looks confused. CHAZ and TAD look enamored with Jacob.
CHAZ: Dude, they let you bring a skateboard on the mountain?
JACOB: It's a snowboard. You know - no Genius! Man, not to get all fag on you, but I'm digging your fresh threads, bro. Adam and Blaine look equally confused with what's going on. Jacob takes the compliment well, like he deserves it.
TAD: Genius! Man, not to get all fag on you, but I'm digging your fresh threads, bro. Adam and Blaine look equally confused with what's going on. Jacob takes the compliment well, like he deserves it.
JACOB: Thank you. It's mostly North Face. A little EMS.
CHAZ: Whatever it is, it works.
TAD: Totally. What are you doing with this boner? You should be skiing with us. Like permanently. Blaine looks really annoyed with his friends.
BLAINE: I mean, that's if Blaine thinks it's cool and everything. Blaine takes a deep breath, annoyed.
TAD: I mean, that's if Blaine thinks it's cool and everything. Blaine takes a deep breath, annoyed.
BLAINE: ( TO JACOB )
CHAZ: ( EAGER )
ADAM: You look JUST like this girl. I had the biggest crush on her Blaine grabs the bag out of Adam's hand and SHOVES ADAM away.
BLAINE: This is mine now. Adam looks at Blaine angrily, but Jacob holds him back.
JACOB: Come on. Let's just go. Jacob ushers Adam off the slope, as Blaine shoulders the bag.
ADAM: What is going on? Lou strolls up to the guys, with his arms around TWO HOT CHICKS. He looks elated.
LOU: Guys! I'm so glad you're here. I want to introduce you to Michelle and Sandy. These lovely ladies are having a roller skating party next weekend and no offense, but fuck your wedding I'm totally coming back. By the way. Lou rolls out a ZIPLOCK BAG full of cocaine.
JACOB: Has anyone else noticed that things around here are weird as shit? Adam and Nick nod. Lou shakes his head.
LOU: Don't you ruin this. If you wake me from this dream, I'll kill you.
ADAM: ( IGNORING LOU )
JACOB: I have no idea, but look. Jacob turns up the VOLUME on the TV. The NEWS airs.
NICK: I'm ruined!
LOU: ( with genuine emotion ) We're in 1971.
ADAM: ( CORRECTING HIM )
JACOB: What are we gonna do? I have plans next weekend.
ADAM: We all have plans. It's my fucking Now hold on, we don't know for sure that we're in 1987. The TV shows a ( real ) COMMERCIAL for the COMMODORE 64 computer, with a JINGLE that SINGS: "Are you keeping up with the Commodore, 'cause the Commodore's keeping up with you."
NICK: Now hold on, we don't know for sure that we're in 1987. The TV shows a ( real ) COMMERCIAL for the COMMODORE 64 computer, with a JINGLE that SINGS: "Are you keeping up with the Commodore, 'cause the Commodore's keeping up with you."
ADAM: What the FUCK is going on?! Nick stands up and calmly takes charge.
NICK: Everyone relax. I think I know what's happened. And when we're done discussing it, we're all gonna feel a lot better. Everyone looks to Nick, who seems to have the answer.
ADAM: This happens?
NICK: Yes. And the best thing for us to do is to stay put. The universe will eventually reverse itself and work out this little glitch. Nick sits down, looking satisfied in his know-it-all-ness.
ADAM: This is a big glitch.
JACOB: Yeah, you're an idiot. Black holes are in space. Not at a ski resort.
LOU: ( HOPEFUL )
JACOB: No, we traveled through time. We're not invisible. Lou looks upset.
LOU: ( under his breath ) I'm still gonna do it.
ADAM: Guys, ignoring the ridiculousness of how we got here for a moment
NICK: Black hole.
ADAM: How are we supposed to get back? For a moment, everyone sits and absorbs the question. Then:
LOU: We find a scientist.
LOU: This Dukakis guy seems like he might be the real deal. An affable MAN IN A SUIT approaches.
NICK: We're waiting for a scientist.
LOU: Where's your white coat?
SCIENTIST: I'm not that kind of scientist.
LOU: This is bullshit! I told you
ADAM: Wait a minute. Just tell him.
NICK: OK. You tell him, Adam.
ADAM: Sir, we.
SCIENTIST: Nothing's too ridiculous in the name of science.
JACOB: We're from the future.
SCIENTIST: Get the fuck out of here.
ADAM: That went well. Lou starts walking off by himself.
NICK: ( TO LOU )
LOU: Five o'clock. Happy hour. The guys look at him, confused.
ADAM: Well, maybe one drink. Just to INT. BREW HAUS - HAPPY HOUR SPLASH! A WET T-SHIRT CONTEST is underway on a STAGE. Whitesnake on the juke, PAC MAN on the tables, and cheap beers in the mugs - this is an amazing brew pub. Our guys sit in the back, wearing PINE VALLEY LODGE shirts. There are MANY EMPTIES on the table and they look VERY DRUNK. In a roped-off area in the corner, a cocky YOUNGER PHIL ( the one-armed bellhop ) wields a CHAINSAW that he uses to carve an ICE SCULPTURE, impressing the bar crowd. He has BOTH ARMS.
NICK: Holy shit. It's that bellhop.
JACOB: Should we warn him?
ADAM: ( COVERS EYES )
LOU: Fuck that guy. ON THE STAGE, TWO GIRLS compete for wettest t-shirt. They both decide that NO T-SHIRT is the wettest option.
NICK: God bless our country.
ADAM: ( in a daze ) We're in 1987.
JACOB: You can stop saying that. I don't think it's making a difference.
ADAM: Seriously, we have to get back. ( kinda losing it ) We seriously have to get back! The guys subdue Adam, as a BIG-HAIRED WAITRESS brings drinks.
WAITRESS: Here ya go, guys. Three Buds, one Bartles and James. The guys all stare at her like she's a museum artifact.
NICK: Hey, if it's available, I'm ordering it. I always wanted one of these when I was little. The waitress puts down the CHECK. Jacob picks it up, realizing something.
JACOB: ( to the waitress ) Can you give us a second? She walks away, as Jacob turns to the guys.
NICK: I've got an idea. As Nick gets up and approaches the businessmen, Adam looks around the room and by the bar, he spots
ADAM: I still can't believe it's really She's aged remarkably well.
LOU: She's aged remarkably well.
ADAM: I should go talk to her. To apologize, of course. You know, nothing inappropriate.
LOU: Adam GETS UP. He slowly makes his way over across the room. Jennie is talking to TWO OTHER GIRLS as Adam approaches. He lurks near them like a creep. Jennie eventually notices him, as he keeps stealing glances. She doesn't look happy.
JENNIE: ( TO ADAM )
ADAM: No, no. No ass kicking. I just wanted to say I'm sorry about earlier. I lost control of the old skis there.
JENNIE: When did you take my class?
ADAM: Certainly not when I was a kid! I mean, that would make no sense! Adam tries to recover.
JENNIE: Yeah, OK. Have a good night. Jennie starts to walk away with her friends.
ADAM: ( TOO FRIENDLY )
JENNIE'S FRIEND: ( quietly, to Adam ) Are you with that guy over there? She discretely points out Jacob.
ADAM: Yeah, he's my brother. She takes Adam's PALM and writes something on it.
JENNIE'S FRIEND: There's a party later tonight at this address. Make sure he comes with you. He's way boss! Adam walks back to his friends.
JACOB: How'd it go? He shows them his palm.
ADAM: We got invited to a party later.
LOU: sweet! What are we gonna do until How about figure out how the hell to get back to the present day? Nick walks back to the table and SLAMS down a pile of CASH.
ADAM: How about figure out how the hell to get back to the present day? Nick walks back to the table and SLAMS down a pile of CASH.
NICK: We're millionaires!
LOU: We're millionaires!
NICK: Close. It's a thousand bucks.
ADAM: Where did you get that money? Nick points out the Japanese Businessmen.
NICK: ( PROUDLY )
JACOB: That was NOT a good idea!
LOU: I agree. You left so much money on the table. It's a fucking iPod! You could've gotten a LOT more!
JACOB: That's not what I
ADAM: ( looking at watch ) Fellas, we are not making progress and we're losing time.
NICK: Adam, don't worry. Time's not moving forward in the future.
JACOB: Uh, yeah it is. Lest we forget the lessons learned from Bill and Ted.
NICK: Well then I give you Back to the That's not fair. You can't go right to Back to the Future.
JACOB: That's not fair. You can't go right to Back to the Future.
NICK: Why not?
JACOB: Back to the Future had a time Well so did Bill and Ted.
NICK: Well so did Bill and Ted.
ADAM: ( REALIZES )
NICK: Adam, all we did is get drunk in the hot tub. Everyone's EYES GO WIDE.
LOU: ( puts it together ) A hot tub time machine.
ADAM: Here goes nothing! They simultaneously DOWN their drinks. Nothing happens. Like the chimps in 2001, each of them begins FIDDLING WITH KNOBS and PUSHING ON LIGHTS, trying to find the magic button. After a few moments:
NICK: Well, it was worth a shot. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal other PEOPLE in the tub. A GUY AND GIRL make out, two STONERS pass a joint, and one TOPLESS CHICK just chills out.
LOU: ( stares at girl ) I love this place. As Lou pours himself another, Adam starts to lose it again.
ADAM: Guys, we're running out of ideas I mean we tried the scientist, the tub what the fuck do we do next? Lou DOWNS ANOTHER SHOT and gets a crazy look in his eye.
LOU: I know what we do next.
LOU: Rental car agency fucked us! There's no flux capacitor. Lou pulls Jacob over and straps him in the driver's seat, before walking around to the passenger side.
LOU: Go light on the clutch. I don't wanna lose our deposit. Jacob starts the car.
ADAM: ( SOBERING SLIGHTLY )
LOU: Oh shit, they found me! I don't know how but they found me!
JACOB: Hey Lou?
LOU: ( VERY CALM )
JACOB: ( VERY CALM )
LOU: ( NODS )
ADAM: So do you think we should run away?
LOU: I wonder if we'll still be here for our court appearance.
ADAM: If we're still here in four months, I will happily go to jail, because I'll be fucked anyway. A GUY walks out of the bathroom, wearing only a TOWEL. He looks startled.
TOWEL GUY: Who the hell are you dweebs?! Lou is up IN A FLASH. He IMMEDIATELY DECKS THE GUY OUT COLD and PUMMELS HIM on the floor! The others pull him off.
NICK: Jesus Christ, what the hell, Lou?!
LOU: I have no tolerance for intruders.
NICK: This is probably his room! We're not registered here in 87. Lou thinks for a moment and looks a "little" sorry.
LOU: I'm still pretty OK with it.
ADAM: You have a problem.
LOU: Just help me put him outside.
ADAM: ( AWKWARDLY )
DUDE #1: So you guys wanna fuck with him or The dudes take custody of the passed out TOWEL GUY and continue on down the hall, as our guys go back inside.
ADAM: So you guys wanna fuck with him or The dudes take custody of the passed out TOWEL GUY and continue on down the hall, as our guys go back inside.
DUDE #2: The dudes take custody of the passed out TOWEL GUY and continue on down the hall, as our guys go back inside.
NICK: Let's just go to sleep. We'll figure everything out in the morning. It's pretty late. Jacob checks his watch, rolling his eyes.
JACOB: It's 8:45. The other guys look at their watches, surprised.
NICK: Why am I so wiped out?
JACOB: Because you're old and lame?
LOU: Yeah, fuck that, we're going to that party!
ADAM: We are not going to the party.
LOU: Hear me out. Lou paces around the room like Patton addressing the troops.
ADAM: Did we go to the same school? Lou turns and addresses Adam directly.
LOU: The point is you haven't even met your wife yet! She can't fault you ago! Even if 23 years ago somehow ends up being tonight! Adam starts listening a little more closely, as some of Lou's logic actually makes "some" sense.
ADAM: ( CONFUSED )
LOU: Close enough. We'll talk some more at the party.
ADAM: This sweater makes me look like a jerkof f .
LOU: ( BREATHES DEEPLY )
NICK: Was this like an 80s thing?
LOU: If he doesn't lose that arm soon, I'm gonna take it from him myself. With that, Lou wanders off toward another room, leering at and groping girls as he goes.
ADAM: ( RE: LOU )
TAD: Hey, glad you could make it!
ADAM: ( ANNOYED )
CHAZ: Hey man, no hard feelings, all right? If your bro says you're cool, then we're cool. Tad puts his arm around Jacob and leads him into the party.
TAD: There's some people I want you to meet. By the way, bodacious hair. Incredibly chic.
JACOB: ( FLATTERED )
TAD: Whoa. Product. You're blowing my mind right now. Did you spend time in Europe?
CHAZ: Don't tell me. Prague. Do you want some coke?
JACOB: Do you have Coke Zero?
TAD: Ah, a conscientious objector. I like that. Gotta stay sharp.
NICK: These will be ready in 15 minutes.
PARTY CHICK: ( putting it together ) So it's like jello. With vodka.
NICK: Mmm hmm. You get drunk while you enjoy a delicious gelatin snack.
PARTY CHICK: How come no one ever thought of this before?
NICK: Don't know. I just invented it. Party chick looks into his eyes, dreamily.
PARTY CHICK: I appreciate you.
NICK: ( way too heartfelt ) I love you.
JACOB: He did a bunch of drugs and went on a rant about how much he resents Ace of Base.
ADAM: That band's from the 90s.
JACOB: I know. He made me borrow Tad's video camera. He wants to document the performance and sue the band for infringement when we get back. Adam sees Tad and Chaz behaving like cocks across the room, making hot girls drink too much.
ADAM: ( re: Tad and Chaz ) So, you like these guys?
JACOB: They're rich, popular, and they shower me with compliments. They're pretty much the best friends I've ever had.
CROWD: Phil! Phil! Phil! Like a zen master, Phil reaches out and GRABS A FAN BLADE, stopping the fan WITHOUT INJURY. Everyone celebrates!
NICK'S CROWD: Nick! Nick! Nick! He finishes the last of the beer, and the crowd celebrates.
PARTY GUY: This guy should be in charge of I should.
NICK: I should.
SANDY: Truth or dare? Lou confers with Michelle before answering.
LOU: Sandy and Jacob confer, figuring out the dare. Lou meets Jacob's eyes he smiles, knowing Jacob has his back.
SANDY: OK, we dare Lou to put a Twizzler up his ass. Lou stands up and angrily points at Jacob.
LOU: You son of a bitch! Have you ever played this game before? It's supposed to be awesome! Lou nevertheless grabs a TWIZZLER from the snack bowl and shoves it down the back of his pants. His face contorts uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of tears.
MICHELLE: Your turn! Truth or dare? Before Sandy can even confer with Jacob:
JACOB: ( SMILES )
LOU: ( grumbling to Michelle ) I don't care. Whatever. This is not the point of the game.
MICHELLE: OK, each of you has to tell your darkest, most personal secret. Lou crosses his arms and shakes his head.
JACOB: Oh wow, all right. Let me think. I've never told anyone this, but I was afraid of scary movies until I was 18. I even ran out of the theater a couple of times.
SANDY: Oh you poor thing! Come here. She takes Jacob's head to her chest and strokes it gently. Lou makes a jerk-off gesture.
MICHELLE: Come on! You have to!
SANDY: OK, but you can't laugh.
LOU: ( WHO CARES )
SANDY: So this one time me and my friend Lori took a train to Baltimore. It was the summer and we wanted to party, but we had no money. So Lori found this businessman who was also looking for a good time and told him that we'd give him a half and half for seventy-five dollars. You know a suck and fuck. Lou and Jacob look shocked with the MATTER OF FACT storytelling. Michelle smiles. She's heard it before.
MICHELLE: ( GIGGLING )
LOU: Fuck you, your turn.
JACOB: That's the gay ear, you know. As Adam looks STRAIGHT AHEAD He sees Jennie all by herself, browsing the hosts' CASSETTE TAPE COLLECTION. Adam takes a moment to check himself. Then he reaches for his DRINK and GULPS THE WHOLE THING, before getting up and WALKING OVER to her, catching her off guard.
ADAM: So I lied to you earlier. I wasn't here for a power tool convention. Jennie instinctively looks around for her friends.
JENNIE: I know. You don't look like you could handle power tools.
ADAM: The truth is, Jennie, I've always liked you. But I've never really known you. I really wasn't supposed to meet you again.
JENNIE: Who are you?! Adam shrugs, indicating he might as well tell her.
ADAM: I came here from the future. She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners.
JENNIE: Let me guess. You want to beam me up to your spaceship built for two? Or maybe you're wondering if these are astronaut pants?
ADAM: Astronaut pants?
JENNIE: Because my ass is out of this world? Give me a break, spaz. I've heard them all. She turns away. Adam goes after her.
ADAM: No! No spaceship. No astronaut pants. Just regular time travel. With normal pants.
JENNIE: OK, what's the punch line? An ARM comes from behind and CHOKES ADAM. It's Blaine.
BLAINE: I thought I told you to stay off my mountain, partner!
JENNIE: Blaine, stop!
BLAINE: You talking to my girl? Huh? I can't hear you. Adam fights to breathe, as Blaine chokes him harder.
JENNIE: Blaine, that's enough! Let him go! He can't breathe! Blaine doesn't stop. He smiles like an asshole.
BLAINE: Can't breathe? Is that right? Can you breathe, partner? What's that? I can't hear you. Just tell me you can't breathe and I'll stop. Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs.
JENNIE: Screw you, Blaine! Jennie gets up. She grabs Adam's arm and YANKS HIM along with her, as she storms away.
SANDY: It's from a box. There's lots!
LOU: Mmm. Fantastic.
LOU: You're gonna fuck her!
JACOB: I'm not gonna have sex with her. She killed a guy!
LOU: That guy was undesirable. You heard her. It was about the money.
JACOB: Great, so she's a prostitute. I'm not sleeping with a hooker either.
LOU: She's not a hooker. She's a girl who did what she had to do to make a few bucks. ( tries new tactic ) Listen, she's probably awesome in She probably has a hairy vagina.
JACOB: She probably has a hairy vagina.
LOU: Jacob looks confused.
JACOB: I'm not having this conversation. It's pointless. I don't have a Perfect! Me neither! No one here uses condoms. It's like heaven. Only with a lot more coke. Lou takes his COKE out of his pocket and SNORTS a bunch.
LOU: Perfect! Me neither! No one here uses condoms. It's like heaven. Only with a lot more coke. Lou takes his COKE out of his pocket and SNORTS a bunch.
JACOB: Like a fucking madman? He slaps Jacob's arms.
LOU: Rock and roll. Lou exits the bathroom and calls out to the girls.
ADAM: Oooh, Atlantic Avenue. That's gonna cost you.
JENNIE: How much?
ADAM: I'll tell ya what. Adam moves her token up a few squares and makes a show of looking over his shoulder, as if someone might see.
JENNIE: I'm sorry I called you those names.
ADAM: Hey, it's cool. I was being creepy and spazzy.
JENNIE: You're still not gonna tell me how you know me?
ADAM: I'm from the future.
JENNIE: Fine, let's just drop it. I'm glad you're feeling better. Blaine had no right to hit you.
ADAM: What are you doing with a douche like him anyway? You're so much better than that.
JENNIE: Yeah, well guys like you come to visit. Guys like him live here.
ADAM: So if I lived here, I'd have a For a moment, Jennie is thrown off. She's about to say something, but checks herself. Instead she nervously stands.
JENNIE: I'm gonna get going. Adam stands up with her.
ADAM: ( SURPRISED )
JENNIE: ( SMILES )
LOU: Stop talking to me! Despite the fact that this looks like very good sex it is very bad sex for Jacob.
JACOB: Stop talking to me! Despite the fact that this looks like very good sex it is very bad sex for Jacob.
ADAM: He looks over and sees Nick SNORING in the other bed.
JENNIE: I thought about what you said and you're right. I should be with I didn't necessarily say that.
ADAM: I didn't necessarily say that.
JENNIE: I want you, Adam! She RIPS OPEN her lingerie, revealing her AWESOME HEAVING
ADAM: Oh my god! She kisses him again and they start to go at it. Just then
ADAM: So you do like her better than me?
LILY: So you do like her better than me?
ADAM: No, she just Adam looks to where Jennie just was, but now the bed is covered with PHOTOS OF JENNIE. There's also a LARGE BOX OF TISSUES and some HAND LOTION.
LILY: What's wrong with my vagina, Adam?
ADAM: Nothing's wrong with it. It's In the next bed, Nick rolls over and wakes up.
NICK: It's a beautiful vagina. Among the prettiest I've ever seen.
ADAM: Stay out of it, Nick!
LILY: Would it be so bad to spend the rest of your life with my vagina?
ADAM: No. It wouldn't at all. Lily turns and walks out the door.
ADAM: ( GROGGY MUMBLING )
ADAM: Who are you talking to? Nick looks at Adam and covers the receiver.
NICK: What do you mean "Courtney?" Adam picks up ANOTHER PHONE.
ADAM: What do you mean "Courtney?" Adam picks up ANOTHER PHONE.
ADAM: Get off the phone!! But Nick is down the rabbit hole.
NICK: OK, so that may have been bad.
ADAM: What were you thinking? The DOOR OPENS and Lou strolls in, looking quite fresh.
LOU: Guess who re-popped his 80s cherry? This guy! He points at himself in a celebratory manner, as behind him The Towel Guy whose room this is comes RUNNING UP.
TOWEL GUY: Hey, get the hell out of my room! In one move, Lou catches him inside the room, closes the door with his foot, and puts the guy in a HEAD LOCK. He then converts it into a SLEEPER HOLD, putting the guy to sleep.
NICK: Oh, we're going to jail.
LOU: Help me put him in the closet.
ADAM: Has anyone seen Jacob?
LOU: He's grabbing drinks with Tad and Chaz. Which is what we should do. We'll start at the Brew Haus and do a three drink crawl up the street Adam gets more fed up than ever.
ADAM: Guys! I refuse to accept that we're stuck in 1987! Maybe you're loving it, Lou. But you don't get it. Nick's insane, Jacob's become a bigger douche than before, and I need to get back for my goddamn rehearsal dinner? Which is Adam. I know I don't look like I understand, but I do. You have a beautiful fiancee who means more to you than anything in the world. And if you could, you'd literally travel across time for her.
LOU: ( CALMLY )
ADAM: I get it, man. Life is about these moments. Moments where a regular Joe becomes a hero. Moments where you dig deep and find the motivation. the courage. the guts to do what's right and what's necessary. It's moments like Lou suddenly notices some COCAINE on the edge of the tub.
LOU: I get it, man. Life is about these moments. Moments where a regular Joe becomes a hero. Moments where you dig deep and find the motivation. the courage. the guts to do what's right and what's necessary. It's moments like Lou suddenly notices some COCAINE on the edge of the tub.
ADAM: Maybe we have to learn something?
NICK: What do you mean?
ADAM: You know, like Groundhog Day. We have to learn the meaning of life or some shit. Just then, a KITTEN licking a PUDDLE on the base of the tub JUMPS in the hot tub and VANISHES IN A BRIGHT LIGHT! For a moment, everyone is quiet.
LOU: ( FREAKED OUT )
NICK: I saw it too. The guys run over to the tub. The bubbles are on low, but there's NOTHING IN IT.
ADAM: It didn't explode. It vanished. It went back. to the present.
LOU: This is the present.
ADAM: Our old present.
NICK: So it is the tub! Lou POINTS at something.
LOU: The HOT TUB IS NOT PLUGGED IN, and yet it's clearly running.
ADAM: OK. You guys know what to do.
ADAM: This isn't working.
LOU: Maybe these aren't the right Adam points at him in a "now you're thinking" way.
ADAM: We'll split up. Get as many different cats as you can. Let's all meet back here in an hour.
LOU: You can count on me!
RICK: Hate to tell ya, pal. Browns are gonna lose by 3 in overtime.
LOU: Hate to tell ya, pal. Browns are gonna lose by 3 in overtime.
RICK: Eat shit and die, scumbag. I've got ten large on this game.
LOU: Not only that, but I bet you Elway's gonna throw a touchdown with 37 seconds left.
RICK: Fat chance, pal. Elway's done nothing all day.
LOU: Care to make it interesting?
RICK: Who the hell are you? Lou thinks about the question for a moment.
LOU: Name's Musselman. Hank Musselman. I've got a cool name, huh?
RICK: It's a good name. What did you have in mind, Musselman?
LOU: I win your wife gives me a blowjob. A classy one. For the first time, Candace looks less than bored. She does a bad job of feigning disinterest.
RICK: All right, buddy, fuck off.
LOU: You win you can kill me. Any way you want. Knife, gun, torch, sword. I'll even make a video exonerating you.
RICK: Yeah, right.
LOU: I'm serious. You look like a man who has everything. Except the license to kill. Care to gamble? Rick looks at Lou long and hard. Lou doesn't flinch.
RICK: 37 seconds?
LOU: You have a deal. As Rick and Lou shake hands, Candace makes a show of looking Don't worry, babe. This yahoo's made a wager he can't possibly win. Lou picks up another HANDFUL of bar snacks. He puts them in his mouth and shows it to Rick.
RICK: You have a deal. As Rick and Lou shake hands, Candace makes a show of looking Don't worry, babe. This yahoo's made a wager he can't possibly win. Lou picks up another HANDFUL of bar snacks. He puts them in his mouth and shows it to Rick.
LOU: ( MOUTH FULL )
NICK: Oh, sorry man.
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN: Oh, it's a very nice toy.
NICK: If you like that, I've got a phone back at the lodge that will knock your socks off.
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN: I wish I could see it. But I am on my way to a very important business Oh yeah? More important than My associates and I are co- financing a. how do you say it. supermarket business.
NICK: Oh yeah? More important than My associates and I are co- financing a. how do you say it. supermarket business.
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN: My associates and I are co- financing a. how do you say it. supermarket business.
NICK: ( SUSPICIOUS ) JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN: Yes! Boston! We leave tonight.
NICK: You're gonna franchise out the Gelman's Mom and Pop!
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN: Yes! How do you know this? Nick puts his arm around the guy and walks down the street.
NICK: Walk with me a minute. Let me tell you about some companies you should really be looking into.
CHAZ: You really are a gas, Jacob. Tad and I think you're the cat's Thanks. I like you guys, too. A THIRD DOUCHEBAG arrives and gives a SECRET HANDSHAKE to Tad and Chaz. He drops off a PILL BOTTLE. This is GEOFFREY ( pronounced JOFF-rey ).
JACOB: Thanks. I like you guys, too. A THIRD DOUCHEBAG arrives and gives a SECRET HANDSHAKE to Tad and Chaz. He drops off a PILL BOTTLE. This is GEOFFREY ( pronounced JOFF-rey ).
GEOFFREY: Geoffrey, please meet Jacob. Excuse his Jewish name. He really quite exceeds it. Jacob looks confused by that, as Geoffrey shakes his hand.
TAD: Geoffrey, please meet Jacob. Excuse his Jewish name. He really quite exceeds it. Jacob looks confused by that, as Geoffrey shakes his hand.
GEOFFREY: Jacob, would you like some too? He offers a pill bottle.
JACOB: What is it?
CHAZ: Rohypnol. Geoffrey's father is a pharmacist, but we don't hold that against him.
JACOB: You slip it to a chick who won't go to third. Give it an hour and you'll be rounding home.
TAD: You slip it to a chick who won't go to third. Give it an hour and you'll be rounding home.
JACOB: ( SURPRISED )
GEOFFREY: ( LAUGHS )
JACOB: These are roofies!
CHAZ: Roofies. I like that!
TAD: Yeah, it takes the clinical name right out of it. It sounds so fresh, chicks might even take it Hey, can we use that? Jacob looks beside himself.
ADAM: I got regular cats. I figured maybe the kitten was a fluke. Nick takes the box out of his hands and puts it down.
NICK: Come here. He leads Adam near the tub, where Lou points at something.
LOU: What am I looking at? It's some kind of stain.
ADAM: What am I looking at? It's some kind of stain.
LOU: Smell it.
ADAM: I'm not smelling it.
LOU: ( NODS ENCOURAGINGLY )
ADAM: What is that?
NICK: Red Bull.
ADAM: So you're telling me that Red Bull plus hot tub equals time travel?
LOU: ( NODS PROUDLY )
ADAM: Who the fuck is Hank Musselman?
NICK: There was just enough Red Bull for the kitten. Not nearly enough for a human. It's a weight distribution thing.
ADAM: How did you even figure this out?
LOU: Scientific method.
NICK: He bet me 20 dollars I wouldn't lick the stain.
LOU: I thought it was some guy's jizz.
ADAM: What's wrong with you?
LOU: It worked, didn't it?
NICK: Yeah, except one little problem. There's no Red Bull in 1987. For a moment, they're all bummed again. Then Adam gets an encouraged look on his face.
ADAM: Yes there is! Come on! Adam heads for the door, as Lou and Nick follow.
JENNIE: ( CONCERNED )
ADAM: Why would you do that?! Behind Adam, Nick looks at the group of TEENS and his eyes almost BUG OUT. He elbows Lou.
NICK: ( whispers, teeth clenched ) Lou looks to where Nick is looking: YOUNG ADAM, YOUNG NICK, and YOUNG LOU wait with other kids for Jennie to return to their lesson.
LOU: Holy shit! Lou immediately approaches the kids, even as Nick tries to hold him back.
NICK: ( TEETH CLENCHED )
YOUNG LOU: What the hell do you want, old man? Lou PUNCHES his YOUNGER SELF in the face. Young Nick and Young Adam are freaked out, as is regular Nick. Adam doesn't notice, as he's arguing with Jennie.
LOU: Herschel and Evelyn aren't gonna do a damn thing. They're losers.
YOUNG LOU: How do you know my parents?
LOU: Listen to me. Start putting minoxidil on your scalp. Tonight. Then, when Propecia comes on the market, start taking it. Every day. Hair is important.
YOUNG LOU: I don't give a shit about hair.
LOU: You will! ( leans in, quietly ) Or I'll tell everyone about how you jerked off to that issue of It was confusing! There were naked people and it had "girl" in the Hey, you don't have to justify to me, pal.
YOUNG LOU: ( QUIETLY )
LOU: Hey, you don't have to justify to me, pal.
YOUNG LOU: ( FREAKED OUT )
LOU: I'm God.
JENNIE: Fine. You wanna see Blaine? It's your funeral. He's in the warehouse at the end of Lawrence. Good luck.
LOU: Moment of truth. Lou takes off his hat and feels his scalp - no hair.
JACOB: Hey guys!
ADAM: I thought you were with douche Yeah I was. But it turned out those guys are date rapists.
JACOB: Yeah I was. But it turned out those guys are date rapists.
ADAM: Adam, where are we going? Adam gets a look of determination again.
NICK: Adam, where are we going? Adam gets a look of determination again.
ADAM: To get my bag. We get that, we have the Red Bull, and our ticket Yes! The race is on!
LOU: Yes! The race is on!
ADAM: What race?
LOU: Duh, it's 1987? We're at a ski Disputes like these are settled with a downhill ski race. Usually at dawn. It's the law.
ADAM: You're an idiot.
BLAINE: Welcome to my lair.
ADAM: You live here?
NICK: Yeah, this is kind of a shitty place to live.
BLAINE: I don't live here. Adam approaches Blaine, trying to speak maturely.
ADAM: Look. Blaine. I think we got off on the wrong foot. You have some issue with me.
BLAINE: You get blown by my girl? I'll say that's one hell of an issue.
LOU: Whoa! You got blown?!
ADAM: She didn't blow me. She lied to you to make you jealous. I'm not trying to steal Jennie. I just wanna get my bag.
BLAINE: Oh, your bag. I was wondering when you'd come around for that. Tad holds up the BACKPACK over by the crates.
ADAM: Yeah, I'll just take it and get out of your way.
BLAINE: You will? Adam EXTENDS HIS HAND.
ADAM: Whattya say? Can we work this out like gentlemen? Blaine PULLS A KNIFE. Tad and Chaz also PULL KNIVES.
NICK: What is this town's obsession with How about I work this out like. a Just then, LIGHT SPILLS INTO THE DARK WAREHOUSE. A GUY in a polo shirt stands in a dooorway.
BLAINE: ( MENACING )
JACOB: You guys are posers! You're not better than me!
TAD: Jacob, I wish you hadn't seen us like this. Adam stands near Blaine, who helps a WOMAN.
BLAINE: ( TO WOMAN )
ADAM: Listen asshole! I want my bag!
BLAINE: ( TO WOMAN )
LOU: See? I told you!
ADAM: ( TO BLAINE )
BLAINE: Then I guess you don't want your See you at dawn.
ADAM: Your girlfriend sucks one hell of a mean dick. Adam makes a SLURPING SOUND and Blaine fumes.
NICK: What are we gonna do?
LOU: That chick blew you?!
ADAM: ( INTENSE )
JACOB: Just stick to the plan and you're gonna be fine. Adam looks at Jacob seriously for a moment.
ADAM: Jacob, I'm sorry for not always being the big brother I should've been. I was away at college, Mom gave you my Sega - there were a whole host of issues. Jacob nods and speaks genuinely to Adam too.
JACOB: I know. I'm sorry too. I put a few things before my family and took my guilt out on you. ( puts it together ) I guess it was an inevitable I'd end up part of a roofie ring. Adam smiles and extends his hand.
ADAM: Jacob takes Adam's hand and helps him to his feet.
JACOB: They EMBRACE. Lou looks disgusted.
LOU: Blaine and his goons approach from below. Adam puts on his game face.
ADAM: I didn't think you guys would show.
BLAINE: This was my idea.
ADAM: It's gonna make my victory taste all the more sweeter. Like a Peach A what?
BLAINE: A what?
ADAM: You'll see. Blaine actually looks rattled, as the two men get lined up. Adam is on a SNOWBOARD.
BLAINE: What's that?
ADAM: You're not afraid of getting beat by a guy on a skateboard, are you?
BLAINE: I've seen you in action. You're reckless and terrible.
ADAM: Reckless and terrible's my middle name. Because I feel the need. ( pulls on goggles ) for speed! Chaz holds out his arm as a starting line.
CHAZ: 3, 2, 1. GO! Blaine takes off down the mountain like a professional skiier, which he pretty much is. Adam looks toward Jacob, who demonstrates the proper CROUCH. Adam slowly picks up speed, starting at about one mile per hour. Blaine looks back and can't believe how easily he's gonna coast to victory.
ADAM: Here goes nothing. Instead of weaving back and forth, Adam just stays in the crouch, PICKING UP SPEED. He recklessly PASSES BLAINE, despite the many TREES and OBSTACLES on the course. He BEARS DOWN AND TRAVELS LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING! Blaine finds the guts to alter his STYLE, skiing more recklessly too. He begins catching up to Adam. Blaine skis up next to Adam - they're both going full force.
BLAINE: You can't beat me! I was born on this mountain!
ADAM: I was born in a hospital like a normal baby! Adam bends down and picks up even more speed, NARROWLY MISSING trees and rocks. Blaine tries to keep up. Adam has the finish line in his sights, when he rolls the dice once too often. His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a rock and Adam TUMBLES TO THE GROUND.
PHIL: Ahhhh! My arm!!!
LOU: EXT. MOUNTAIN - RACE - DAY As Adam tumbles on the ground, Blaine smiles, thinking he has the victory in the bag. But instead of stopping, Adam picks up speed, as he TUMBLES LIMB OVER LIMB, like a snowball going down the mountain. With 50 YARDS to go, Blaine bears down and tries to catch Adam. It's gonna be close. At the FINISH LINE, Adam's CRUMPLED BODY passes the line first. Blaine pulls up, pissed off to lose the race. Adam's momentum carries him forward another 50 yards, where he SMASHES INTO A DECK and finally comes to a stop.
NICK: You did it, man.
ADAM: Ah, it was nothing. I just fell down the mountain.
NICK: It was a beautiful fall. Lou goes into Adam's backpack and pulls out the SANDWICH, which he begins unwrapping.
ADAM: ( DISGUSTED )
LOU: Chicken parm. It's my favorite.
ADAM: Chicken parm? Adam takes the sandwich from Lou. He looks at it closely.
JACOB: Adam, what is it?
NICK: That sandwich was special, huh?
ADAM: You could say that. You could also say it gave me horrible diarrhea.
ADAM: Don't you see? This is more than a sandwich. It represents all that shit. All that puke.
LOU: Keep the sandwich.
JACOB: This is disgusting.
ADAM: She gave me this as a reminder of her love.
LOU: Do you have any stories about these chips or can I eat them?
JENNIE: There you are!
ADAM: Jennie! What are you doing here?
JENNIE: Making good on a rumor. Jennie STANDS UP in the tub and she's TOPLESS. Adam DROPS THE SANDWICH, shocked.
ADAM: Jennie continues talking, shamelessly exposing herself.
JENNIE: When I saw you win that race against Blaine, everything changed for me. I realize now that I deserve more. I deserve a winner.
ADAM: Yeah, I. can't. She covers up, embarrassed.
JENNIE: Oh my god. I missed my No, I'm not sure there ever was an opportunity. Jennie, you're terrific. You've brought me so many moments of joy, you'll never know. But I shouldn't have given you the wrong idea. Jennie looks sad and vulnerable, as Adam talks.
ADAM: No, I'm not sure there ever was an opportunity. Jennie, you're terrific. You've brought me so many moments of joy, you'll never know. But I shouldn't have given you the wrong idea. Jennie looks sad and vulnerable, as Adam talks.
JENNIE: ( EMOTIONAL )
ADAM: I know you would.
NICK: We don't have to go yet, Adam. Things are just getting fun.
JACOB: And we can do whatever we want without any real consequences. That's a lot to give up.
ADAM: ( NODS )
JACOB: Where's the Red Bull?
ADAM: I don't want Jennie.
BLAINE: That's funny. I don't want this soda, either. Blaine smiles like an asshole. Adam's face goes desperate, as Blaine OPENS THE CAN and DRINKS THE WHOLE THING.
ADAM: Adam runs at Blaine and tackles him to the ground. On the ground, Adam BEATS THE LIVING HELL out of Blaine, messing up his face. It makes the Jared Leto scene from Fight Club look tame. Eventually, Adam's friends pull him off. Adam crawls to the Red Bull can and it's empty.
LOU: Holy shit! You may have killed this guy! No wait. wait. I've got a pulse. Eh, so much for that. Nick puts his hand on Adam's shoulder.
NICK: I'm sorry man. I'm really sorry.
ADAM: The Red Bull's gone. He fucked us.
JACOB: Not necessarily. Everyone looks toward Jacob.
NICK: It's worth a shot.
ADAM: Come on, Lou.
LOU: Nah, I'll take a rain check.
NICK: What are you talking about?
LOU: Listen, your lives at home sound all beautiful and happy with your barbecues and swimming pools and "oh, that sandwich reminds of some gay shit I did one time." Adam and Nick don't look thrilled to be reduced to this.
ADAM: Yeah, no, I get it. Lou goes around and gives them all hugs.
NICK: Makes perfect sense, man. Lou squeezes Jacob's shoulder.
LOU: I don't hate you as much as I used ( a little emotional ) I hate you a little less also. Lou LIFTS BLAINE'S LIMP BODY.
JACOB: ( a little emotional ) I hate you a little less also. Lou LIFTS BLAINE'S LIMP BODY.
ADAM: OK, whenever you're ready, Lou.
LOU: One small step for man! One giant asshole puking in a hot tub! Here goes nothing! Lou does the HEIMLICH MANEUVER on Blaine. It takes ONE. TWO. THREE THRUSTS until Blaine PUKES IN THE TUB! For a second, it's just a BIG SPLASH of VOMIT and nothing else.
NICK: OK, well maybe if we A BRIGHT FLASH CONSUMES THE SCREEN! And when it dies down, we see Adam, Nick, Jacob ( and the floating puke ) in the hot tub where we left them. Only Lou is missing.
ADAM: What happened? Did it work?
NICK: I didn't feel anything.
JACOB: ( DISAPPOINTED )
NICK: Dammit. Even the deck furniture's the same. We fucking blew it. It didn't work.
ADAM: Where's Lou?
NICK: Oh, the face, eh? I was curious how you'd react.
LOU: Oh, the face, eh? I was curious how you'd react.
ADAM: You're damn right it's me.
LOU: You're damn right it's me.
ADAM: What happened?
LOU: You just traveled 23 years in three seconds. Took me 23 years. It's good to see you guys!
JACOB: We're back? It all looks the same.
LOU: It better! You know how much I pay the groundspeople around here? A lot. But that's all right, I'm fucking loaded. Look at all this. Everyone looks confused.
ADAM: Will you fill in some of the blanks for me, please?
LOU: I'll give you the short version, because time is of the essence. First of all, to settle an old bet, time most definitely has been moving forward. It is exactly three days since you've arrived here in beautiful Havenhurst. Jacob looks at Nick.
JACOB: Told you.
LOU: Secondly, I'm filthy rich. Made sports bets. Sued Ace of Base. I own most of V ermont. ( MORE )
ADAM: Wait, fuck, Lou what time is it?
LOU: Way ahead of you, Adam. You have 2 hours to get to New Jersey in time for your rehearsal dinner.
ADAM: ( DISAPPOINTED )
LOU: Not even a little bit. I have a helicopter waiting in the parking lot and a private jet on my airfield five minutes away. The guys look stunned.
LOU: By the way, Adam, I hope you don't mind. Right after you left, I fucked Jennie silly.
ADAM: Why would she have sex with you?
LOU: You get the big time assist. All that talk of her finding the right guy who's willing to give up everything? Made her wetter than a log flume.
ADAM: Good to hear.
NICK: Lou, I gotta ask you something.
LOU: Time travel paradox.
NICK: Exactly. Aren't there now two of you living here in 2010?
LOU: Think really hard about that one. What happened to me when I was 19? Nick shrugs. He looks at Adam. Suddenly, both their eyes nearly pop out of their skulls.
NICK: No way.
ADAM: You went missing and were never Yeah, you're gonna have some lingering memories of both Wait a minute, what happened to. you know. Other Lou.
LOU: Yeah, you're gonna have some lingering memories of both Wait a minute, what happened to. you know. Other Lou.
ADAM: Wait a minute, what happened to. you know. Other Lou.
LOU: You don't wanna know.
ADAM: The kid sucked, OK? He couldn't take even a little bit of direction. Pretty soon I realized that having two versions of the same dude walking around as cool as that sounds didn't make very much sense to me.
LOU: The kid sucked, OK? He couldn't take even a little bit of direction. Pretty soon I realized that having two versions of the same dude walking around as cool as that sounds didn't make very much sense to me.
NICK: So I took care of the problem.
OK?: So I took care of the problem.
LOU: So I took care of the problem.
NICK: What did you do?
LOU: I had to do it.
ADAM: What did you do?
LOU: I killed myself.
ADAM: Jesus Christ.
LOU: Yeah, it was really some existential shit. I mean, here I am committing homicide and I'm actually committing suicide.
NICK: How could you?
LOU: It was easy actually. For a minute, I thought I might be dealing with that whole Timecop thing. You know, the same matter can't occupy the same space at the same time bullshit and we both go poof? Especially after that whole nose thing. But no, it was just a murder. I didn't suffer.
ADAM: I don't wanna hear any more.
LOU: It was strangulation.
ADAM: I don't wanna hear any more! They sit in horrified silence for a bit.
LOU: You'll have to introduce me when we get there. Your families won't know me. Although I'm sure they're huge fans.
NICK: This makes no sense at all.
LILY: Don't you ever let me take your phone again!
ADAM: ( COY )
LILY: ( TEARFUL )
ADAM: You're the one. Lily notices Adam's on CRUTCHES.
LILY: Oh my god, what happened?
LOU: I was partaking in a little ski adventure and I mistakenly wandered into your fiance's path. His broken leg is my broken heart. My most humble apologies. Lou scrapes and bows and regally kisses Lily's hand. She looks genuinely flattered. Lou gets up and whispers to Adam.
NICK: I was thinking we'd invite Adam and Lily over for dinner when they get back from their honeymoon. That's. if it's OK with you?
COURTNEY: Why wouldn't it be OK with me? That sounds nice.
NICK: So. how are your parents?
COURTNEY: Still working hard. I really wish they could retire already, but it's tough competing with the big chains. I mean, they just have the one store.
JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN: ( IN JAPANESE )
NICK: ( SMILES )
ADAM: This is why we shouldn't have sold that iPod. Adam puts his hand through Jacob, who speaks with purpose.
JACOB: This is why we shouldn't have sold that iPod. Adam puts his hand through Jacob, who speaks with purpose.
ADAM: What does that mean for us?
JACOB: Pretty much nothing for us personally. We just get cooler phones and iPods and shit.
ADAM: Oh. Great! Jacob CLICKS OFF and disappears, as Lily approaches. Adam can't help but beam from ear to ear.
LILY: I know you were only gone for a couple days, but I missed you so Adam takes her hand.
ADAM: Come on, let's get out of here. We have unfinished business. Lily smiles. She gets into it.
LILY: It's about time. OK, what's the How about you're the woman I love and I'm the man of your dreams?
ADAM: ( GENUINE )
LILY: OK, you're a nurse and a snake bit my penis.
ADAM: OK, you're a nurse and a snake bit my penis.
LILY: Done and done. They bolt for the door and we
LOU: So you're friends with the bride?
BEAUTIFUL GIRL: Can you keep a secret? I'm actually kinda crashing the party.
LOU: Naughty girl. You're secret's safe with me.
BEAUTIFUL GIRL: I'm just in town for a couple of nights. I'm actually looking for my father. We've never met.
LOU: I'm from here. Maybe I know him.
BEAUTIFUL GIRL: His name is Hank Musselman. For a moment, Lou's expression FREEZES. He blinks. Then
LOU: No, never heard of him. He goes back to MAKING OUT WITH HER and we:
