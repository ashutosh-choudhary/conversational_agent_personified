GORDON: But I knew Harvey Dent. I was.his friend. And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did. Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his I believed in Harvey Dent. And we FADE TO BLACK.
CIA MAN: Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA. Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a He wasn't alone. CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr. You don't get to bring friends.
DRIVER: He wasn't alone. CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr. You don't get to bring friends.
CIA MAN: You don't get to bring friends.
DR. PAVEL: ( SHAKEN )
DRIVER: Don't worry, no charge for them.
CIA MAN: Why would I want them?
DRIVER: They were trying to grab your prize. ( Smiles. ) They work for the mercenary. The masked man.
CIA MAN: ( EXCITED )
CIA MAN: Get 'em on board - I'll call it in.
CIA MAN: What are you doing in the middle of my operation?
CIA MAN: FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON MY AIRCRAFT! ( Cocks weapon. )
PAVEL?!: Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet.
CIA MAN: HE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO TRY NEXT?! The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door.
TRY NEXT?!: The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door.
CIA MAN: TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE WEAR THE MASK?! The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the man's hood - he cocks the gun.nothing.
CIA MAN: LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN! THIRD PRISONER ( O.S. ) Or he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of an aeroplane. CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.
CIA MAN: Wiseguy, huh? At least you can talk. Who are you?
THIRD PRISONER: We are nothing. We are the dirt beneath your feet. And no one cared who I was until I put on the CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.
BANE: Who we are does not matter. What matters is our plan.
CIA MAN: ( FASCINATED )
BANE: It would be extremely painful.
CIA MAN: You're a big guy -
BANE: For you.
CIA MAN: ( UNNERVED )
BANE: Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours. We had to know what he told you about us.
DR. PAVEL: Nothing! I said nothing!
CIA MAN: Why not just ask him?
BANE: He would not have told us.
CIA MAN: You have methods.
BANE: Him, I need healthy. You present no such problem. CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass tone is rising. The Sergeant looks out the window.
SERGEANT: CIA MAN
CIA MAN: Well congratulations, you got yourselves caught. What's the next step of your master plan?
BANE: Crashing this plane.
BANE: ( RISING )
BANE: Friend. They expect one of us in the wreckage. The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm.
BANE: ( NODS )
BANE: Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.
BANE: That comes later. Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr. Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport, and we -
MAYOR: This city has seen a historic turnaround. No city is without crime. But this city is without organized crime because the Dent Act gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob. Now people are talking about repealing the Dent Act. And to them I say.not on my watch. Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up. I want to thank the Wayne Foundation for hosting this event. I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight, but I'm sure he's with us in spirit. High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching.
CONGRESSMAN: Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things? Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley, cuts in.
GORDON: Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things? Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley, cuts in.
CONGRESSMAN: Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things? Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley, cuts in.
FOLEY: No one has. Not in years.
CONGRESSMAN: Sweetheart, not so fast with the ( turns, tight smile ) Shrimp balls? The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.
MAID: ( turns, tight smile ) Shrimp balls? The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.
CONGRESSMAN: Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech? We're gonna be here all night.
GORDON: Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't so simple, Congressman.
GORDON: The truth.? INSERT CUT: Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens Gordon's son with a handgun.
CONGRESSMAN: Thank Christ for that.
GORDON: Maybe right now all you need to know is that there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act. These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now, all I should say about Harvey Dent's death is this.it has not been for nothing. The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion. People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches The second shift reports in?
GORDON: The second shift reports in?
FOLEY: On your desk. But you should put in some more time with the Mayor -
GORDON: That's your department. Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.
CONGRESSMAN: Anyone shown him the crime stats?
FOLEY: He goes by his gut, and it continues to bother him, whatever the numbers.
CONGRESSMAN: Must be popular with the wife.
FOLEY: Not really. She took the kids and moved to Cleveland.
CONGRESSMAN: He'll have plenty of time for visits. Mayor's dumping him in the Really? He's a hero.
FOLEY: Really? He's a hero.
CONGRESSMAN: War hero. This is peacetime. Stay smart, the job's yours.
MAID 2: They say he never leaves the East I heard he had an accident - that he's disfigured. The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has died. Alfred has entered the kitchen.
MAID 3: I heard he had an accident - that he's disfigured. The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has died. Alfred has entered the kitchen.
ALFRED: Mr. Till, why are your people using the main stairs? Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen.
ALFRED: Where's Mrs. Bolton?
MAID: She's up at the bar, sir. Can I Alfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray.
ALFRED: The East drawing room. Unlock the door, place the tray on the table, lock the door again. Nothing more.
ALFRED: I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've tried. He won't see you.
MIRANDA: It's important, Mr. Pennyworth. Her accent is European. Hard to place.
ALFRED: Mr. Wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial MALE VOICE ( O.S. ) Don't take it personally, Miranda. They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett.
DAGGETT: Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in there with eight-inch nails, peeing into Mason jars. ( To Alfred. ) Good of you to let me on the grounds.
ALFRED: The Dent Act is about all Gotham. Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate, always a pleasure. Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.
DAGGETT: Why waste your time talking to the man who threw away your investment on some save-the-world vanity project? He can't help you get your money back. But I can.
MIRANDA: I could try explaining that a save-the-world project, vain or not, is worth investing in, whatever the return. I could try, Mr. Daggett, but you understand only money and the power you think it buys, so why waste my time, She walks away. Daggett watches her go.
MAID: I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne. It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it? Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.
MAID: Although you don't have the long nails. ( Nervous laugh. ) Or facial She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.
WAYNE: Is that what they say about me?
MAID: It's just that.nobody sees you. Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.
WAYNE: That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother. It can't be the same one - her pearls are in this safe - He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the bureau, revealing a safe door. - which the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable. .which swings open with an awkward creak.
MAID: Oops. No one told me it was The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.
WAYNE: I'm afraid I can't let you take She smiles at him. Moves towards him.
MAID: Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any more than I would beat up a She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down. Of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made. The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window. Goodnight, Mr. Wayne. She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace. He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder.
MAID: Can I have a ride? The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily.
CONGRESSMAN: You read my mind.
ALFRED: Miss Tate was asking to see you She's very persistent.
WAYNE: She's very persistent.
ALFRED: And quite lovely, in case you were I wasn't.
WAYNE: I wasn't.
ALFRED: What are you doing?
WAYNE: Examining print dust. We've been And this is your idea of raising the alarm?
ALFRED: And this is your idea of raising the alarm?
WAYNE: ( SHRUGS )
ALFRED: One of the maids, perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house.
WAYNE: One of the maids, perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house.
ALFRED: Perhaps you should learn to make your own bed, then. Why are you dusting for prints?
WAYNE: I'm not. She was.
BLAKE: I didn't want to bother you up here, but they're looking for you.
GORDON: What's the problem, son?
BLAKE: Congressman Gilly's wife's been calling. He hasn't made it home from the Wayne Foundation event.
GORDON: That's a job for the police?
BLAKE: Sir, I've been a cop for a year and I've only logged half a dozen arrests. When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned 'em good. Pretty soon we'll be chasing overdue library books. Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.
BLAKE: But here you are. Like we're still at war.
GORDON: Old habits.
BLAKE: Or instinct.
GORDON: What's your name, son?
BLAKE: Blake, sir.
GORDON: You have something you want to ask me, Officer Blake?
BLAKE: It's that night. This night, eight years ago. The night Dent died.
GORDON: What about it?
BLAKE: The last confirmed sighting of the Batman. He murders those people, takes out two SWAT teams, breaks Dent's neck.then just vanishes?
GORDON: I'm not hearing a question, son. Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon.
BLAKE: Don't you want to know who we was? Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes his fingers across its rusted shell.
GORDON: I know exactly who he was. ( Turns to Blake. ) He was Batman. Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs.
ALFRED: Master Wayne? Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply.
ALFRED: You haven't been down here in a long time.
WAYNE: Just trying to find out more about our jewel thief. I ran her prints from the photos she handled - Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery - but she was wearing someone else's fingerprints. She's good.
ALFRED: She may be. But we have the trace on the necklace.
WAYNE: We do, so I cross-referenced the address she went back to with police data on high-end Wayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears. Selina Kyle. The databases are full of close calls, tips from fences.
WAYNE: She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet.
ALFRED: We should send the police before she fences the pearls.
WAYNE: She won't. She likes them too much. And they weren't what she was What was she after?
ALFRED: What was she after?
WAYNE: My fingerprints. There was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe. Gives you a good pull, and it's untraceable.
ALFRED: Fascinating. Maybe you should exchange notes over coffee.
WAYNE: Now you're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?
ALFRED: At this point, sir, I would set you up with a chimpanzee if I thought it would bring you back into the There's nothing out there for me.
WAYNE: There's nothing out there for me.
ALFRED: And that's the problem. You hung up the cape and cowl, but never moved on. You won't get out there and find a life. Find someone -
WAYNE: ( BITTER )
ALFRED: I know. And then you lost them. That's part of living, sir. But you're not living - you're waiting. Hoping for things to go bad again. Wayne says nothing. Remember when you left Gotham? Before all this. Before Batman. Seven years you were gone. Seven years I waited. Hoping that you wouldn't come back. Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding. Every year I took my holiday. I'd go to Florence. There's a café by the Arno. Any fine evening I would sit there and order a Fernet INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a café sipping his drink. I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine that one day I'd look across the tables, and see you. Sitting there with your wife. Perhaps some kids. You wouldn't say anything to me, or me to you, but we'd both know.that you'd made it. That you were happy. INSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks closer, hopeful. But they are strangers. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I knew there was nothing there for you but pain and tragedy, and I wanted more for you than that. I still do. Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats.
DWP MAN: They wash up a couple times a month. More when in gets colder - homeless sheltering in the tunnels. We had to pull him to clear the basin, but other than that we didn't touch him.
ROSS: Name's Jimmy. He's at St. Swithin's. ( Off look. ) The boys home where I.I coach some ball.
BLAKE: Name's Jimmy. He's at St. Swithin's. ( Off look. ) The boys home where I.I coach some ball.
FATHER REILLY: Jimmy hadn't been here for months.
BLAKE: FATHER REILLY
FATHER REILLY: You know why, Blake - he aged out. We don't have the resources to keep boys on after sixteen -
BLAKE: The Wayne Foundation gives money for that -
FATHER REILLY: Not for two years now.
BLAKE: He has a brother here, right?
FATHER REILLY: Mark. I'll tell him.
BLAKE: I'd like to, if that's okay.
BLAKE: I'm sorry. Mark nods slowly. Staring straight ahead.
BLAKE: What was he doing in the tunnels?
MARK: Lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out. Say you can live down there. Say there's work down there.
BLAKE: What kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers?
MARK: More than you can find up here, I Blake considers this. Troubled.
STRYVER: You brought a date?
SELINA: I like having someone around to open doors for me. Selina glances around. Things scattered throughout the bar. Jumpy. Selina hands an envelope to Stryver.
SELINA: Right hand. No partials. Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers.
STRYVER: Very nice. He pockets the envelope.
SELINA: Not so fast, handsome. You got something for me?
STRYVER: Oh, yes. Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door. Another Thug joins them at the table. Selina smiles.
SELINA: I don't know what you're going to do with Mr. Wayne's prints.but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb. As Stryver checks the envelope again -
SELINA: You don't count so good, huh?
STRYVER: I count fine. The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head.
STRYVER: In fact, I'm counting to ten right Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She Okay, okay - She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.
SELINA: Okay, okay - She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.
SELINA: My friend is waiting outside. Just hit 'send'. Stryver looks at the phone. Hits 'send'. Selina sizes up her options. A knock on the door. Second Thug hides his gun. The door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.
JEN: Place is a little dead.
SELINA: ( takes envelope, tense ) It'll liven up in a minute, trust Everything okay?
JEN: Everything okay?
SELINA: Great. Catch you later. Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.
SELINA: It would've been a lot easier to just give me what we agreed.
STRYVER: We can't have loose ends. And even in that dress, no one's going to miss you.
SELINA: No. But my friend over there.? Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of nuts at the bar - he looks familiar.
SELINA: Every cop in the city's missing Across the bar, the TV on mute -
STRYVER: Cute. But they're not gonna be looking in a place like this.
SELINA: I don't know. You did just use his cell phone. Stryver glances down at the cell phone as - SCREECH - the Thugs look out the window at cop cars and SWAT units descending on the bar. Stryver glances at the window and - SMASH - Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs
SWAT: It's alright, Miss. Just stay down
SELINA: Keep some pressure on that, She adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar. Moves for the door.
CONGRESSMAN: ( WEAK )
SELINA: There's a man in there - he's It's okay, Miss. It's okay. Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a SWAT truck. He heads into the bar, weapon drawn. Selina slips behind the truck and into the night.
BLAKE: It's okay, Miss. It's okay. Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a SWAT truck. He heads into the bar, weapon drawn. Selina slips behind the truck and into the night.
BLAKE: ( INTO RADIO )
GORDON: He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover, Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT.
GORDON: You three, down with me. You two, head down to cover the next exit -
SWAT: Where -?
GORDON: Get the DWP down here, now! Gordon starts climbing down the ladder.
COP: Where's the DWP guy?
BLAKE: They went down there?
FOLEY: ( shaking his head ) And Gordon took SWAT in after them.
BLAKE: Come on, we gotta get down there -
COP: That was a gas explosion, kid -
BLAKE: Gas? This is a sewer!
FOLEY: No one goes in there till we know what's down there.
BLAKE: We know what's down there, sir. The Police Commissioner!
FOLEY: Somebody get the hothead out of here. And get me a DWP guy! Blake backs off. Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car.
THUG 1: This one's alive. ( Looks closer. ) Jesus. It's the Police What do we do?
THUG 2: What do we do?
THUG 1: Take him to Bane. The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels. As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon between two waterfalls, into -
BANE: Why are you here? The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.
THUG 1: Answer him! Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.
BANE: I'm asking you.
THUG 1: It's the Police Commissioner.
BANE: And you brought him down here?
THUG 2: We didn't know what to do. We -
BANE: You panicked. And your weakness costs three lives.
THUG 1: No, he's alone - Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack. Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2.
BANE: Search him. Then I will kill you. The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet, gun.and the folded papers of the speech he did not read. Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at the papers. Unfolds them. As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out.
THUG 2: He's dead. Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers.
BANE: Then show me his body.
THUG 2: That water runs to any one of the outflows - we'd never find him. Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary.
BANE: Give me your GPS. Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.
BANE: Follow him.
THUG 2: Follow him? Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead Track him. Make sure both bodies will not be found. Then brick up the south tunnel.
BANE: Track him. Make sure both bodies will not be found. Then brick up the south tunnel.
BLAKE: I need to see Bruce Wayne.
ALFRED: I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take unscheduled calls. Even from police And if I go get a warrant, in the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder? Would that still count as INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER Blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous. Wayne enters.
BLAKE: And if I go get a warrant, in the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder? Would that still count as INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER Blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous. Wayne enters.
WAYNE: What can I do for you, officer?
BLAKE: Commissioner Gordon's been shot.
WAYNE: I'm sorry to hear that -
BLAKE: He chased a gunman down into the sewers. When I pulled him out he was babbling about an underground army. A masked man called 'Bane'.
WAYNE: Shouldn't you be telling this to your superior officers?
BLAKE: I did. One of them asked if he saw any giant alligators down there. He needs you. He needs the Batman.
WAYNE: If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm the Batman he must be in a bad way
BLAKE: He doesn't know or care who you are. ( Off look. ) But we've met before. When I was a kid. At the orphanage. See, my mom died when I was small. Car accident, I don't really remember it. But a couple of years later my dad was shot over a gambling debt. I remember that just fine. ( Looks at Wayne. ) Not a lot of people who know what it feels like, do they? To be angry. In your bones. People understand, foster parents understand. For a while. Then they expect the angry kid to do what he knows he can never do. To move on. To forget. Wayne stares at Blake.
BLAKE: So they stopped understanding and sent the angry kid to a boys' home - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. See, I figured it out too late. You have to hide the anger. Practice smiling in the mirror. Like putting on a mask. You showed up one day in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm.
BLAKE: I don't know why you took the fall for Dent's murder, but I'm still a believer in the Batman. Even if you're not.
WAYNE: Why did you say your boys' home used to be funded by the Wayne Because the money stopped. Might be time to get some fresh air and start paying attention to the details. Some of those details might need your help.
BLAKE: Because the money stopped. Might be time to get some fresh air and start paying attention to the details. Some of those details might need your help.
WAYNE: You checked that name? 'Bane' -
ALFRED: Ran it through some databases. He's a mercenary. No other known name. Never been seen or photographed without a mask. He and his men were behind a coup in West Africa that secured mining operations for our friend John Daggett.
WAYNE: Now Daggett's brought them here?
ALFRED: It would seem so. I'll keep Alfred turns to leave.
WAYNE: Why did the Wayne Foundation stop funding boys' homes in the city?
ALFRED: The Foundation is funded from the profits of Wayne Enterprises. ( Off look. ) There have to be some.
WAYNE: Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
ALFRED: I'll get him on the phone -
WAYNE: No. Do we still have any cars around the place?
ALFRED: ( LIGHTS UP )
WAYNE: And I need an appointment at the hospital. About my leg.
ALFRED: Which hospital, sir?
WAYNE: Whichever one Jim Gordon's in. Alfred is less excited by this part of the request.
MIRANDA: I'm only asking for explanations because I think I can help.
FOX: I'll pass along your request. Next time I see him. Miranda catches something in this.
MIRANDA: He doesn't talk to you either?
FOX: Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has Mr. Fox, are you aware that John Daggett is trying to acquire shares in Wayne Enterprises?
MIRANDA: ( RISING )
FOX: I was not. But it wouldn't do him any good - Mr. Wayne still retains a clear majority. Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops.
FOX: Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe. Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane.
FOX: What brings you out of cryo-sleep Mr. Wayne?
WAYNE: I see you haven't lost your sense of humor.even if you have lost most of my money.
FOX: Actually, you did that yourself. See, if you funnel the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball, your company is unlikely to thrive.
WAYNE: Even with -
FOX: A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes. Wayne Enterprises is running out of time. And Daggett is moving in.
WAYNE: What're my options?
FOX: If you're not willing to turn your machine on -
WAYNE: I can't, Lucius.
FOX: Then sit tight. Your majority keeps Daggett at arm's length while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate - she's supported your project all the way. She's smart, and quite lovely.
WAYNE: You too, Lucius?
FOX: We all just want what's best for you, Bruce. Show her the machine.
WAYNE: I'll think it over.
FOX: Anything else?
WAYNE: No, why?
FOX: These conversations always used to end with some.unusual requests.
WAYNE: I retired.
FOX: Let me show you some stuff, anyway. Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - MOMENTS LATER Fox leads Wayne into the vast, gadget-filled space. They pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations.
WAYNE: I figured you'd have shut this place down.
FOX: It was always shut down, But all this new stuff?
WAYNE: But all this new stuff?
FOX: After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries. I've spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof. My roof.
WAYNE: Stop them falling into the wrong hands. Besides, I thought someone might get some use out of them. Wayne shakes his head.
FOX: Stop them falling into the wrong hands. Besides, I thought someone might get some use out of them. Wayne shakes his head.
FOX: Sure I can't tempt you to something? Pneumatic crampons? Infrared lenses? Least let me get you something for that leg.
WAYNE: It's fine the use it gets these Well, then I have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesn't like to walk. Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes light up.
FOX: Well, then I have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesn't like to walk. Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes light up.
WAYNE: Now you're just showing off.
FOX: Defense Department project for tight-geometry urban pacification. Rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without What's it called?
WAYNE: What's it called?
FOX: It has a long and uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation. So I took to calling it the Bat. And yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.
FOX: Works great except for the What's wrong with that?
WAYNE: What's wrong with that?
FOX: Software-based instability. Take a better mind than mine to fix it.
WAYNE: Better mind?
FOX: I was trying to be modest. A less busy mind. Yours, perhaps. Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.
WAYNE: I told you. I retired, Lucius.
DOCTOR: I've seen worse cartilage in knees
WAYNE: That's good -
DOCTOR: No, that's because there is no cartilage in your knee. And not much of any use in your elbows and shoulders. Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys, residual concussive damage to your brain tissue and general scarred-over quality of your body. ( Takes a deep breath. ) I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing. About the only part of your body that looks healthy is your liver, so if you're bored I recommend you take up drinking, Mr. Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask, steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane, which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as -
GORDON: We were in this together. Then you were gone.
WAYNE: The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won.
GORDON: Built on a lie. Our lie. Now there's evil rising from where we tried to bury it. Nobody will listen. The Batman has to come What if he doesn't exist anymore?
WAYNE: What if he doesn't exist anymore?
GORDON: He must. He must.
SELINA: Get out.
YUPPIE: She took my wallet! Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.
SELINA: She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs. Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.
SELINA: I told you not to try it with the assholes, Jen.
JEN: They're all assholes.
SELINA: Okay, the assholes who hit.
JEN: I don't know what he's so upset about, he only had sixty bucks in Probably the watch.
SELINA: Probably the watch.
YOUNG WOMAN: Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie's Rolex.
PAPARAZZI: Another stiff too old to climb out of his sports car.
PAPARAZZI 2: No, that's Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne, where you been hiding? Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob - a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door.
WAYNE: I'm not sure if my assistant put me on the guest list -
GREETER: Right through here, Mr. Wayne.
WAYNE: Miss Tate, isn't it?
MIRANDA: Even before you became a recluse, you never came to these things.
WAYNE: True. Proceeds go to the big fat spread, not the cause. It's not about charity, it's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid it on.
MIRANDA: Actually, this is my party, Mr. And the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself.
WAYNE: And the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself.
MIRANDA: And the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself.
WAYNE: That's very generous of you.
MIRANDA: You have to invest to restore balance to the world. Take our clean-energy project.
WAYNE: Sometimes the investment doesn't pay off. Sorry.
MIRANDA: You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne. But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it. ( Gentle. ) And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued.
MIRANDA: Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne. Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.
WAYNE: Mind if I cut in? Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes Selina by the waist. She glares at him.
WAYNE: You don't seem very happy to see You were supposed to be a shut-in.
SELINA: You were supposed to be a shut-in.
WAYNE: Felt like some fresh air.
SELINA: Why didn't you call the police?
WAYNE: I have a powerful friend who deals with this kind of thing. ( Admires her cat ears. ) Brazen costume for a cat burglar.
SELINA: Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
WAYNE: Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Who's your date?
SELINA: His wife's in Ibiza. She left her diamonds behind, though. Worried they'd get stolen.
WAYNE: It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You wouldn't want these folks realizing you're a crook not a social You think I care what anyone in this room thinks about me?
SELINA: ( flash of anger ) You think I care what anyone in this room thinks about me?
WAYNE: I doubt you care what anyone in this room thinks about you.
SELINA: Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You don't know a thing about me.
WAYNE: Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town - modest place for a master jewel thief. Which means either you're saving for your retirement - or you're in deep with the wrong You don't get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.
SELINA: You don't get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.
WAYNE: Actually, I was born in the Regency I started off doing what I had to. Once you've done what you had to they'll never let you do what you want to.
SELINA: I started off doing what I had to. Once you've done what you had to they'll never let you do what you want to.
WAYNE: Start fresh.
SELINA: There's no fresh start in today's world. Any twelve-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did. Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks. We are the sum of our mistakes.
WAYNE: Or our achievements.
SELINA: The mistakes stick better. Trust You think that justifies stealing?
WAYNE: You think that justifies stealing?
SELINA: I take what I need to from those who have more than enough. I don't stand on the shoulders of people with less.
WAYNE: Robin Hood?
SELINA: I'd do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you.
WAYNE: Maybe you're assuming too much.
SELINA: Or maybe you're being unrealistic about what's really in your pants other than your wallet.
WAYNE: You think all this can last? Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.
SELINA: You think all this can last? Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.
SELINA: There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us.
WAYNE: Sounds like you're looking forward to it.
SELINA: I'm adaptable.
WAYNE: These pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe. Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back of her neck, unclasps the necklace. But I still can't let you keep The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears into the crowd. Wayne's cane reappears.
RICH TWIT: ( ANNOYED )
WAYNE: Not likely.
WAYNE: I must have lost my ticket -
VALET: Your wife said you were taking a cab home, sir.
WAYNE: My wife?
ALFRED: Just you, sir? Wayne gives him a withering glare.
WAYNE: Remember those 'unusual requests' I used to make?
ALFRED: You've got the wrong leg, sir.
WAYNE: You start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it - the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious. Now we tighten it up. Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth.
ALFRED: It is terribly painful?
WAYNE: ( GRITTED TEETH )
ALFRED: Happy watching, thank you, sir. Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.
WAYNE: Not bad - Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick. Not bad at all. Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows Wayne across the bridge to the cube.
ALFRED: Master Wayne, if you're considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding Bane.
WAYNE: I'm all ears.
ALFRED: There is a prison. In a more ancient part of the world. A pit. Where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes, a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes.the pit sends something back.
WAYNE: Born and raised in a hell on earth.
ALFRED: Born and raised in a hell on earth.
WAYNE: Born in a prison?
ALFRED: No one knows why. Or how he escaped. But they know who trained him one he did.R¯'s al Gh¯l. Your
A U: Wayne takes this in. Shocked.
ALFRED: He plucked Bane from a dark corner of the earth and trained him in the blackest disciplines of combat, deception and endurance. Just like Bane was a member of the League of Until he was excommunicated. And a man considered too extreme for R¯'s
WAYNE: Bane was a member of the League of Until he was excommunicated. And a man considered too extreme for R¯'s
ALFRED: Until he was excommunicated. And a man considered too extreme for R¯'s
A: al Gh¯l is not to be trifled with.
U: I didn't realize I was known for trifling with criminals.
WAYNE: I didn't realize I was known for trifling with criminals.
ALFRED: That was then. And you can strap up your leg and put the mask back on. But it won't make you what you Which was?
WAYNE: Which was?
ALFRED: Someone whose anger at death made him value all life. Even his own.
WAYNE: If this man is all the things you say he is, then this city needs me. The Batsuit emerges from the cube.
ALFRED: Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne. Your resources, your knowledge.not your body. Not your life. That time has passed.
WAYNE: I tried helping as Bruce Wayne, Alfred. And I failed.
ALFRED: You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As Batman, you can't afford to.
WAYNE: That's what you're afraid of - that if I go back out there I'll fail.
ALFRED: No. I'm afraid that you want to. Wayne looks at Alfred. Then turns to examine the Batsuit.
TRADER 2: You can't short the stock because Bruce Wayne goes to a party -
TRADER 1: Wayne coming back is change. Change is either good or bad.
TRADER 2: On what basis?
TRADER 1: I flipped a coin. Near the front entrance: a Food Delivery Guy is standing there negotiating with a Trader.
TRADER 3: No. Rye. I told 'em rye. Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen. Alright, I'll take it. He thrusts Food Guy a tip and grabs the bag, distracted. At the rear secure entrance: a Motorcycle Courier enters, wearing his helmet - a Female Security Guard gets in his FEMALE SECURITY GUARD Rookie! Lose the helmet! ( Points at a camera. ) We need faces for In the rest room: a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of the way of two Traders who rush in to pee. At the shoeshine stand, Trader 1 waves a bill down at the man shining his shoes without a glance. Shoeshine Man takes the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a gym bag and checks an automatic weapon. He clicks the slide home, then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading At the secure entrance: the Courier pulls off his helmet. The Female Security Guard's eyes go wide.
TRADER 1: This is a stock exchange, there's no money you can steal - He dries up as Bane stops. Turns to him.
BANE: Why else would you people be here? Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the floor to an online automated trades terminal. He puts the man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.
BANE: Enter your password. Or I send these men to your home. Trader 1, terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens. Shoeshine man pulls out a USB drive with an antenna - plugs it into the computer - figures race across the screen.
BLAKE: Move it, now! We've got a Where can I move it?!
CONSTRUCTION WORKER: Where can I move it?!
BLAKE: That way! Blake points - but SWAT vehicles pile in, blocking.
BLAKE: Get in your vehicle and stay there! Foley and the SWAT Commander, Allen, approach the entrance. The Market Security Chief walks up, frantic.
SECURITY CHIEF: You've gotta get in there!
FOLEY: This is a hostage situation -
SECURITY CHIEF: It's a robbery! They've got direct access to the online trading desk.
FOLEY: I'm not risking my men for your
SECURITY CHIEF: It's not our money, it's Really? Mine's in my mattress.
ALLEN: Really? Mine's in my mattress.
SECURITY CHIEF: If you don't shut these guys down, the stuffing in that mattress might be worth a whole lot less, pal.
FOLEY: Cut the fiber line - shut down the cell tower. That'll slow them down.
SHOESHINE MAN: They cut the fiber. Cell's working.
BANE: For now. How much longer does the program need?
SHOESHINE MAN: Eight minutes.
BANE: Time to go mobile. Shoeshine Man picks up the laptop, slips it into his pack.
ALLEN: Get the barriers up - no more in and out on this street! Steel wedge-shaped barriers rise up at the mouth of the street. A Sniper watches the doors through a thermal scope. Six large heat signatures bloom, too big for people.
SNIPER: I've got something - The door explodes. SWATs duck, six sportbikes race out and leap the ramp-like barricades, sending SWATs scattering. Cops scramble to pull their vehicles out to give chase.
ROOKIE COP: Shoot the tires! A Veteran Cop sights a shot, but the Traders are in the way.
VETERAN COP: No shot!
FOLEY: Back off, back off! They've got INT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS The cruiser follows the bike into a large tunnel. A Rookie Cop looks up into his rear-view.
ROOKIE COP: What's going on with the lights? The Veteran Cop looks back - streetlights and headlights are dying one after another. The darkness is chasing them - the darkness hits them. Their lights, sirens, and engine die. And, out of the silence, a dark shape roars past -
VETERAN COP: It can't be.
ROOKIE COP: The hell was that?!
VETERAN COP: Oh boy. You're in for a show tonight, son.
FOLEY: Let's roll, they've spotted the EXT. HIGHWAY INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS The remaining bikes split up as they reach a high overpass.
FOLEY: ( INTO RADIO )
FOLEY: I'm gonna do what Gordon never What's that?
BLAKE: What's that?
FOLEY: I'm gonna take down the Batman.
BLAKE: Sir, what about the armed robbers? Foley ignores him.
SPOTTER: ( INTO RADIO )
SPOTTER: ( OVER RADIO )
FOLEY: Negative! Stay on the Batman!
BLAKE: But he's getting away!
FOLEY: ( ANNOYED )
TV ANNOUNCER: People aren't saying much - frankly, they're too busy - but all signs suggest that what we're
CATWOMAN: Well, what do you know? Catwoman opens the safe. Nothing inside. She frowns.
BATMAN: WHAT WERE YOU STEALING?! Shoeshine Man stares. Unafraid. Batman rips the computer from his pack. The screen reads:
APPLICATION COMPLETE: Blinding light and noise as police choppers descend - sirens everywhere. Batman grabs the USB drive from the laptop. He jumps on the Bat-Pod - pauses, taking in the sight of thousands of police, cars, choppers, dogs, closing in.
POLICE VOICE: ( OVER LOUDSPEAKER )
DAGGETT: After eight years he has to pick He's drawing the cops off Bane. Daggett watches, intrigued.
STRYVER: He's drawing the cops off Bane. Daggett watches, intrigued.
FOLEY: How did you let him go?!
COP: ( OVER RADIO )
FOLEY: And you don't?! We're not letting one nut with a bad attitude and some fancy gadgets run this town down, you hear me?!
COP: ( OVER RADIO )
FOLEY: ( EXCITED )
FOLEY: Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen. Foley reaches for a loudhailer. VARRROOOOM!! A noise from the alley that none of the cops have heard before.
VETERAN COP: You might have the wrong animal there, sir - Spotlights smash on and a massive dark cyclone roars out of the alley, spinning the choppers sideways, dual rotor downdraft forcing all the cops to the ground. The Bat, now black, thunders up and over the entire Gotham PD. Blake slides up to Foley. Dry.
BLAKE: Are you sure that was him? Foley looks at Blake. Thrusts the loudhailer at him.
ANNOUNCER: ( ON TV )
STRYVER: Bane says the Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished.
DAGGETT: What about the men they arrested?
STRYVER: He says, and I quote, they would die before talking.
DAGGETT: ( GRINS )
DAGGETT: And can we get some girls in here?
CATWOMAN: Cat got your tongue? She plucks the gun from his trembling hand.
DAGGETT: You dumb bitch.
CATWOMAN: Nobody ever accused me of being Dumb to show up here tonight.
DAGGETT: Dumb to show up here tonight.
CATWOMAN: I want what you owe me - Click - Stryver has a gun to her head.
DAGGETT: 'I want' never gets. Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her Nice outfit.those heels make it tough to walk? Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams.
STRYVER: Nice outfit.those heels make it tough to walk? Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams.
CATWOMAN: I don't know, do they? Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett.
CATWOMAN: So where is it?
DAGGETT: Where's what?
CATWOMAN: The program. The 'Clean Slate'.
DAGGETT: Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a master thief with a record. I don't have it. The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the window. He screams - they drop.
CATWOMAN: Where is it?
DAGGETT: The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name and date of birth and within a couple hours that person ceases to exist in any database? Little too good to be true.
CATWOMAN: You're lying. Rykin Data took it to prototype stage -
DAGGETT: That's why I bought them. But they had nothing. It was a gangland Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in. Shapes drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They're not Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men. Catwoman holds Daggett by the throat, threatening him.
CATWOMAN: Stay back! They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer onto his gun.
CATWOMAN: I'm not bluffing!
BATMAN: They just don't care. As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.
CATWOMAN: You've got to be kidding.
BATMAN: No guns. No killing.
CATWOMAN: Where's the fun in that? As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for the far edge.
BATMAN: Come on! Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof. She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley - sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open. Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy hisses shut, taking bullets from above.
CATWOMAN: My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men -
BATMAN: This isn't a car. Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky, downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against the wind.Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night.
CATWOMAN: See you around - Batman steps down after her.
BATMAN: You're welcome.
CATWOMAN: I had it under control.
BATMAN: Those weren't street thugs - they were trained killers. I saved your life. In return I need to know what you did with Bruce Wayne's Catwoman looks at him. Considering.
CATWOMAN: Wayne wasn't kidding about a 'powerful friend'. I sold his prints to Daggett. For something that doesn't even exist.
BATMAN: I doubt many people get the better of you.
CATWOMAN: Hey, when a girl's desperate.
BATMAN: What were they going to do with I don't know. But Daggett seemed pretty interested in that mess at the stock market. Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past, searching. Batman turns to it. Then turns back.
CATWOMAN: I don't know. But Daggett seemed pretty interested in that mess at the stock market. Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past, searching. Batman turns to it. Then turns back.
BATMAN: Miss Kyle -? But she is gone. So that's what that feels like.
ALFRED: Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell the neighbors you got yourself a new leaf-blower?
WAYNE: We bought all the neighbors. Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.
ALFRED: From the look of the television coverage, you seem to have your taste for wanton destruction back.
WAYNE: ( pulls out USB drive ) I retrieved this.
ALFRED: Shouldn't the police be gathering the evidence?
WAYNE: They don't have the tools to analyze it.
ALFRED: They would if you gave them to them
WAYNE: One man's tool is another man's In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't many things you couldn't turn into a weapon.
ALFRED: In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't many things you couldn't turn into a weapon.
WAYNE: Alfred. Enough. The police weren't getting it done -
ALFRED: Perhaps they would've if you haven't made a sideshow of Perhaps you're upset you were You thought I didn't have it in me. Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.
WAYNE: Perhaps you're upset you were You thought I didn't have it in me. Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.
ALFRED: You thought I didn't have it in me. Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.
WAYNE: You thought I didn't have it in me. Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.
ALFRED: You don't. You lead a bloated police force on a merry chase with some fancy new toys from Fox. What about when you come up against him. What then? Alfred points to the monitor - Wayne sees Bane killing.
WAYNE: I'll fight harder, I always have.
ALFRED: When you had something to fight for. What are you fighting for now? Not your life. Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his Take a good look. At his speed, his ferocity, His training. I see the power of belief. Of the fanatic. I see the League of Shadows You said he was excommunicated.
ALFRED: Take a good look. At his speed, his ferocity, His training. I see the power of belief. Of the fanatic. I see the League of Shadows You said he was excommunicated.
WAYNE: You said he was excommunicated.
ALFRED: By R¯'s al Gh¯l. Who leads them
A U: R¯'s al Gh¯l was the League of
WAYNE: R¯'s al Gh¯l was the League of
A U: Shadows. And I beat him. Bane's just a mercenary, and we have to find out what he's up to. Wayne plugs the USB in, hits keys. Text scrolls.
WAYNE: Trades of some kind. Coded. The screen blanks, a thumb print appears.
ALFRED: Is that -?
WAYNE: Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle. Wayne pulls out the USB, rises. Get this to Fox - he can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing. Alfred looks at Wayne. Takes the USB.
ALFRED: I'll get this to Fox. But no more. Wayne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him.
ALFRED: I've sewn you up and set your bones.but I won't bury you. I've buried enough members of the Wayne You'd abandon me?
WAYNE: You'd abandon me?
ALFRED: You see only one end to your story. Leaving is all I have to make you understand: you aren't Batman anymore - you have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing. About life beyond that awful cave -
WAYNE: Rachel died knowing we'd decided to be together. That was my life beyond this cave and I can't just move on. She didn't. She couldn't. Alfred considers this. Looks away.
ALFRED: What if he had? What if she wasn't intending to make a life with you?
WAYNE: She was, I can't change that -
ALFRED: What if, before she died, she'd written a letter? Explaining that she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you? Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -
ALFRED: And what if, to spare you pain.I'd burned that letter? Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.
WAYNE: Why would you say such a thing?
ALFRED: Because I have to make you You're lying.
WAYNE: You're lying.
ALFRED: Because you are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father and I swore to them that I would protect you and I haven't.
WAYNE: You're lying!
ALFRED: I've never lied to you. Except when I burned Rachel's letter. Wayne turns on the old man, furious.
WAYNE: How dare you use Rachel to stop me!
ALFRED: I'm using the truth, Master Wayne. Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and just let it have its day. I'm Sorry?! You expect to destroy my world, then shake hands?!
WAYNE: Sorry?! You expect to destroy my world, then shake hands?!
ALFRED: No. I know what this means -
WAYNE: What does it mean, Alfred?!
ALFRED: It means your hatred. It means losing the person I've cared for ever since I heard his first cries echo through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important. Wayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to say and says it quietly and calmly.
WAYNE: Goodbye, Alfred.
ALFRED: ( QUIET )
WAYNE: But Alfred is gone.
FOX: Answering your own door?
WAYNE: Yes. Could you decode the trades on that drive? Fox hands Wayne a newspaper - the main headline:
FOX: I didn't need to. Page three. Wayne turns the page:
FOX: It seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange. Verified by thumb print. The options expired at midnight last night. Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling.
FOX: Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now.you're completely broke. And Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett.
WAYNE: The weapons - we can't let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences -
FOX: Applied Sciences is shut up tight, and off the books. The energy project is a different story.
WAYNE: Miranda Tate. We need to convince the board to get behind her. Let's show her the reactor -
FOX: We're meeting her there in thirty-five minutes. You better get EXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES RECYCLING PLANT - DAY A scrapyard on the Gotham river. Across the water, the towers of Gotham. Lucius leads Miranda from her car.
MIRANDA: You brought me out here to show me a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox?
FOX: Bear with me, Miss Tate. They arrive at a Portakabin and enter.
FOX: Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times. He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked as the office becomes an elevator into -
MIRANDA: This is it, isn't it?
FOX: The reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach.
MIRANDA: Is Bruce Wayne really that I'm gonna plead the fifth on that Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.
FOX: I'm gonna plead the fifth on that Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.
WAYNE: I thought you might like to see what your investment built.
MIRANDA: No radiation, no fossil fuels. Free, clean energy for an entire If it worked. It doesn't. Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal. Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold.
WAYNE: If it worked. It doesn't. Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal. Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold.
WAYNE: Ignition, yes. But no chain You've built a lot of security around a damp squib. About three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions. One week later your reactor started developing problems. ( Looks at Wayne. ) I think this machine works.
MIRANDA: You've built a lot of security around a damp squib. About three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions. One week later your reactor started developing problems. ( Looks at Wayne. ) I think this machine works.
WAYNE: Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.
MIRANDA: Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.
WAYNE: Someone else will work out what Dr. Pavel did. Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon. I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.
MIRANDA: And to do what with it?
WAYNE: Nothing. Until we can find a way to guarantee its safety.
MIRANDA: And if we can't?
WAYNE: Decommission it. Flood it.
MIRANDA: Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future?
WAYNE: If the world's not ready. Yes.
MIRANDA: Bruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting I'm trusting you.
WAYNE: I'm trusting you.
MIRANDA: Doesn't count. You have no choice.
WAYNE: I could've flooded this chamber any time in the last three years. I'm choosing to trust you, Miranda, and that's not the easiest thing for me. Please. His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.
FOX: We have a board meeting to get to.
DAGGETT: I'd like to point out that we have a non-board member here. Highly irregular, even if it is his family name above the door. All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up.
FREDERICKS: Bruce Wayne's family built this
DAGGETT: Into the ground, sir. Anybody disagree? Check the value of your shares this morning. Gambling on crazy futures didn't just lose Mr. Wayne his seat, it's lost us all a lot of money. He needs to leave.
FOX: I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. I understand. Ladies and gentlemen. Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves.
WAYNE: I understand. Ladies and gentlemen. Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves.
DAGGETT: Let's get down to business.
FOX: Right away.
REPORTER: Wayne, how's it feel to be one of the people?!
COMPANY VALET: I'm sorry, sir, they had paperwork
DAGGETT: How the hell did Miranda Tate get the inside track on the Wayne board?! Was she meeting with Wayne? Was she sleeping with Wayne?
STRYVER: Not that we know of -
DAGGETT: Clearly you don't 'know of' anything, do you?! Where's Bane?!
STRYVER: We told him it was urgent -
DAGGETT: Then where is the masked -
BANE: .and he shall appear.
DAGGETT: What the hell's going on?
BANE: The plan is proceeding as expected.
DAGGETT: You see me running Wayne Enterprises?! ( Moves towards Bane. ) Your stock exchange hit didn't work, friend. And now you've got my construction crews working all hours around the city? How's that supposed to help my company absorb Leave us.
BANE: ( TO STRYVER )
DAGGETT: You stay right there! I'm in Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett's shoulder.
BANE: Do you feel in charge? Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.
DAGGETT: I've paid you a small fortune -
BANE: And that gives you power over me? Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder. Nervous.
DAGGETT: What is this?
BANE: Your money and infrastructure have been important. Till now.
DAGGETT: What are you?
BANE: Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the borrowed time you've all been living on. Bane gently takes the terrified Daggett's head in his You are true evil.
DAGGETT: You are true evil.
BANE: I am necessary evil. Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches.
SCENE OMITTED: INT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - MOMENTS LATER Wayne stares out the window. Blake glances across.
BLAKE: When you began.why the mask?
WAYNE: To protect the people closest to You're a loner with no family.
BLAKE: You're a loner with no family.
WAYNE: There are always people you care about. You just don't realize how much until they're gone. ( Collects himself. ) The idea was to be a symbol. Batman could be anybody, that was the point.
BLAKE: It was damn good to see him back.
WAYNE: Not everybody agrees.
BLAKE: They'll figure it out in the end.
WAYNE: Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?
BLAKE: Yeah, I've got five hundred pages of tunnel records and a flashlight. I could use some help.
WAYNE: ( THINKS )
WAYNE: Don't wait. I'll get a cab.
BLAKE: You got money?
WAYNE: ( smiles, sheepish ) Actually, no. Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street. The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off.
SELINA: He's not a mark. Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne.
SELINA: And he doesn't have a cent to his name, anyway.
SELINA: Yeah, it's not much. ( Smiles. ) But it's more that you've got right Actually, they're letting me keep the house.
WAYNE: Actually, they're letting me keep the house.
SELINA: ( SHAKES HEAD )
WAYNE: ( spots her bag ) Let's just say that I've incurred the wrath of some people less susceptible to my charms than you.
SELINA: Let's just say that I've incurred the wrath of some people less susceptible to my charms than you.
WAYNE: My powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving.
SELINA: And how would he do that?
WAYNE: By giving you what you want.
SELINA: It doesn't exist.
WAYNE: He says it does. He wants to meet. He needs to find Bane. He thinks you'd know how.
SELINA: He needs to find Bane. He thinks you'd know how.
WAYNE: He needs to find Bane. He thinks you'd know how.
SELINA: Tell him I'll think about it. Wayne nods, starts to leave.
SELINA: Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all your money.
WAYNE: No, you're not.
FOLEY: Can we help you, officer?
BLAKE: John Daggett's body was found in a dumpster an hour ago. I thought you might like to know.
GORDON: Because Daggett's name is all over the permits I pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham. Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.
BLAKE: Because Daggett's name is all over the permits I pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham. Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.
BLAKE: MTA maintenance, sewer Where did you get to with the tunnel searches?
GORDON: ( TO FOLEY )
FOLEY: ( TO BLAKE )
GORDON: Get more men, work a grid. I want him found.
FOLEY: Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're on it. Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake.
GORDON: This is good work. Lose the uniform - you're working for me now. We could use some hotter heads around This could just be a coincidence.
BLAKE: This could just be a coincidence.
GORDON: You're a detective now, son, you're not allowed to believe in coincidence anymore. Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley.
WAYNE: No. I'm on my own now.
MIRANDA: Do you have keys? Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden.
WAYNE: Never needed them. She takes his hand.
MIRANDA: Let's find a window.
MIRANDA: Fox worked the board like you've never seen - I'm in, Daggett's out and he's not happy. Wayne sets down the newspaper:
WAYNE: Hope you don't like me for your Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.
MIRANDA: Suffering builds character. Then at a photo of Wayne's parents.
MIRANDA: I'll take care of your parents' legacy, Bruce. Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel.
MIRANDA: Who's this? Wayne looks at her. Can't find words.
MIRANDA: Where's Alfred?
WAYNE: He left. Taking everything. Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.
MIRANDA: What's that?
WAYNE: ( SHEEPISH )
WAYNE: You're pretty good at that.
MIRANDA: When I was a child we had almost nothing. But on the nights we had a fire, we felt very rich indeed. She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them.
WAYNE: I assumed your family was wealthy.
MIRANDA: Not always. Not when I was young. He traces a scar on her shoulder.
MIRANDA: An old mistake.
WAYNE: I've made a few myself. She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.
MIRANDA: More than a few. ( Smiles. ) We could leave. Tonight. Take my plane. Go anywhere we wanted.
WAYNE: Someday perhaps. Not tonight. She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room.
CATWOMAN: Don't be shy. .Batman is there.
CATWOMAN: Wayne says you can get me the 'Clean Slate'.
BATMAN: That depends.
CATWOMAN: On what?
BATMAN: On what you want it for. I acquired it to keep it out of the wrong Still don't trust me, huh? How can we change that?
CATWOMAN: Still don't trust me, huh? How can we change that?
BATMAN: Start by taking me to Bane.
CATWOMAN: ( SHRUGS )
CATWOMAN: From here, Bane's men patrol the tunnels.and they are not your average brawlers.
BATMAN: Neither am I. Catwoman swings into a -
CATWOMAN: He's behind you.
MERCENARY: ( SPINS )
CATWOMAN: Just a little further. A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He is deep inside.
CATWOMAN: I had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me.
BATMAN: You've made a serious mistake.
BATMAN: Let's not stand on ceremony here, Mr. Wayne. Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done. Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches his fist.
BANE: Let's not stand on ceremony here, Mr. Wayne. Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done. Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches his fist.
BANE: Peace has cost you strength. Victory has defeated you.
BANE: Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.to the Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.
BANE: But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce? The League of Shadows. And you betrayed us.
BATMAN: Us? You were excommunicated. From a gang of psychopaths.
BANE: Now I am the League of Shadows, here to fulfill R¯'s al Gh¯l's
A U: Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them. Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses. Bane's arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES.
BANE: You fight like a younger man. Nothing held back. No reserves. Admirable. But mistaken. Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once.
BANE: You think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it. Formed by it. In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike.
BANE: I didn't see the light until I was already a man. And by then it was nothing to me but blinding.
BANE: The shadows betray you, because they belong to me. Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding, pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS. Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes.
BANE: I will show you where I've made my home while preparing to bring justice. Then.I will break you. A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through cracked cowl - Bane hits the detonator - explosions BURST over his head as the ceiling CRUMBLES revealing: Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox's weapons store.a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble.
BATMAN: Your precious armory. Gratefully accepted. We will need it.
BANE: Your precious armory. Gratefully accepted. We will need it.
BANE: I wondered which would break first - your spirit. Batman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him
BLAKE: ( INTO RADIO )
UNIFORM: Excuse me, Miss. I need to see your ticket and identification, please. Selina, surprised, fumbles with her purse.
SELINA: Would you mind?
BLAKE: I showed your picture to the Congressman and guess what?
SELINA: Don't tell me, still in love?
BLAKE: Head over heels. Pressing charges, Blake lays a police file down with a thump. You've made some mistakes, Ms. Girl's gonna eat.
SELINA: Girl's gonna eat.
BLAKE: You have an appetite. Why run? You can't hide from us with this Maybe it's not you I'm running Who then? Bane? What do you know about him?
SELINA: Maybe it's not you I'm running Who then? Bane? What do you know about him?
BLAKE: Who then? Bane? What do you know about him?
SELINA: ( QUIET )
BLAKE: We can offer you protection. Selina looks at him with contempt. Blake shrugs, switches off the tape, moves to the door.
BLAKE: When I spotted you, I was looking for a friend.Bruce Wayne. Selina turns to look at Blake. His eyes plead with her.
BLAKE: Did they kill him?
SELINA: I'm not sure. And we -
WAYNE: Why didn't you just kill me?
BANE: You don't fear death. You welcome it. Your punishment is to be more You're a torturer.
WAYNE: ( SCATHING )
BANE: Yes. But not of your body. Of your Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain.
WAYNE: Where am I?
BANE: Wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison. Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five hundred feet above. Like being at the bottom of a gigantic Bane points to an old TV, just outside the bars.
A: Gh¯l's destiny. We will destroy
U: Gotham. And when it is done.when Gotham is ashes.then you have my permission to die. Bane rises. Leaves. Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness.
GUARD: We're locking her up in here?
WARDEN: The Dent Act allows non-segregation based on extraordinary need. First time she broke out of women's correctional she was sixteen. Selina passes a Huge Inmate who strains through the bars.
HUGE INMATE: Little closer, baby.
SELINA: Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand? Without breaking step, she slips his outstretched hands between her handcuffed ones and cartwheels, snapping his arms - he screams in agony - she keeps walking.
WARDEN: She'll be just fine.
FOX: I don't see the need for a board meeting on the energy project -
MIRANDA: Bruce got a lot of things right. Keeping the board in the dark wasn't one of them. Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open.
BANE: This meeting is called to order. Fox and Miranda freeze. Staring at the mask.
BANE: Chair and President. I also need one ordinary member - Mr. Fox, would you care to nominate?
FREDERICKS: No. I volunteer. The dignified older board member gets to his feet. Mercernaries round the three up.
FOX: Where are you taking us?
BANE: Where you buried your resources. The bowels of Gotham.
GORDON: So you think our friend is gone This time.he might not be coming Gordon takes this in.Foley bursts in, agitated.
BLAKE: ( GRAVE )
FOLEY: Okay, Commissioner, you were right.
GORDON: What's happened?
FOLEY: Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board. He let most of them go, but took three down into the sewers.
GORDON: No more patrols, no more hide and seek. Send every available cop down there to smoke him out.
FOLEY: The Mayor won't want panic -
BLAKE: So it's a training exercise. Foley looks at Gordon.
FOLEY: I'm sorry for not taking you
GORDON: Don't apologize for believing the world's in better shape then it is.just fight to make it true. Foley nods. Leaves. Blake gets up.
GORDON: Not you. You're telling me the Batman's gone. So you chase up the Daggett leads, any way you can. Blake nods.
PRISONER: He asks if you would pay us to let you die. I told him you have Do it for the pleasure. The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips.
WAYNE: Do it for the pleasure. The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips.
PRISONER: They pay me more than that to keep you alive. A chant gets Wayne's attention. He rolls his head painfully to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other He will try the climb. Strong Man starts scaling the wall.

BANE: Turn it on. Fox shakes his head. Bane holds his gun to Fredericks' head.
BANE: I only need one other board member. There are eight more waiting I won't do it. Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.
FOX: I won't do it. Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.
MIRANDA: Alright, stop. She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It beeps. She turns to Fox. Quietly pleading.
MIRANDA: Lucius, you'll kill this man and yourself, and barely slow them Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then Fredericks. The core glows brighter and brighter. Dr. Pavel is transfixed.
BANE: Do your work. Bane turns to his men. Gestures at the hostages. Take them to the surface. People of their status deserve to see the next era of western civilization. Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble.
REPORTER: We're seeing literally thousands of police heading into the sewers -
MAYOR: A training exercise, that's all. If you'll excuse me, I've got tickets to watch our boys thrash Rapid The Mayor heads into the stadium with the crowds.
BLAKE: I've been to half Daggett's cement plants, logged locations they've poured for underground GORDON ( O.S. ) Anything strange about the Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations.

DR. PAVEL: And then it will go off.
BANE: For the sake of your family, Dr. Pavel, I hope so. Dr. Pavel stares as Mercenaries start to disconnect the EXT. CEMENT PLANT - CONTINUOUS Blake is led through a fence by a Worker.
WORKER: Boss is about to leave. Blake walks past cement mixers. Spots someone. A Driver.

BLAKE: And as a detective.I'm not allowed to believe in coincidences
BLAKE: What were you doing?! What?! The man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses is down. Pulls out his phone. Dials.
BLAKE: Commissioner, I'm at the Fourteenth Street plant with two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. Call me - Blake freezes, stooped to pick up his gun. Looking at some empty barrels. Commissioner, they've got Polyisobutylene here. ( Looks around. ) And motor oil. They weren't making cement, they were making explosives -
BLAKE: Oh, God. Blake fires up the cruiser and pulls out, hard.

ANALYST 2: Whatever it is.it's nuclear.
BANE: Identify yourself to the world.
DR. PAVEL: Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear Bane turns Dr. Pavel's head for the cameras.
CIA ANALYST: Pavel was confirmed dead - plane crash on an Agency pull-out of Uzbekistan. But it certainly looks like him - He points to a monitor with a photo of Dr. Pavel. An Air Force General rubs his chin, thinking, nervous.
BANE: Tell the world what this is.
DR. PAVEL: A fully primed neutron bomb. With a blast radius of six miles.
BANE: And who can disarm this device?
DR. PAVEL: Only me.
BANE: Thank you, Doctor. Bane snaps Dr. Pavel's neck in front of the world.
BANE: The bomb is armed, the bomb is mobile, the identity of the triggerman is a mystery. One of you holds the detonator - we come not as conquerors, but as liberators to return control of this city to the people. At the first sign of interference from the outside world or of people attempting to flee, this anonymous Gothamite, this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb. For now, martial law is in effect. Return to your homes, hold your families close, and wait. Tomorrow you claim what is rightfully yours. Bane turns, leaves the field, followed by his men.
GENERAL: Pull back the fighters, start high-level reconnaissance flights. And get the President on the line.
LEAD MERCENARY: Tanks and planes cannot stop us detonating our device. Send an emissary to discuss terms of access for supplies and communication. A Captain steps forward, walks to the apex of the bridge.
CAPTAIN: How many of you are there, son? ( Nothing. ) You don't have enough men to stop twelve million people leaving that island.

BLAKE: Bane's not gonna let that happen -
GORDON: Then he'll show his true colors.
BLAKE: And you'll be dead. Gordon says nothing.
BANE: Behind you stands a symbol of oppression. Blackgate Prison.
BANE: Harvey Dent. Held up to you, and over you, as a shining example of justice and good.
BLAKE: We're gonna keep moving you, till we can get you in front of a camera
BANE: But they supplied you a false idol. A straw man. To placate. To stop you tearing down this corrupt INT. CELLBLOCK, BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS The Prisoners start cheering, shouting.
BANE: Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent. In the words of Gotham's Police Commissioner, James INT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS This gets Blake's attention. Gordon watches, uneasy.
BANE: 'The truth about Harvey Dent is simple in only one regard - it has been hidden for too long. After his devastating injuries, Harvey's mind has recovered no better than his mutilated face. He was a broken, dangerous man, not the crusader for justice that I, James Gordon, have portrayed him to be for the last eight years. Harvey's rage was indiscriminate. Psychopathic. He held my family at gunpoint, then fell to his death in the struggle over my son's life. The Batman did not murder Harvey Dent - he saved
BANE: 'The things we did in Harvey's name brought desperately needed security to our streets. But I can no longer live with my lie. It is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth, and it is time for me to Bane folds the papers. Looks out to the stunned crowd. Do you accept this man's Individuals in the crows start shouting 'Yes!'
BANE: Do you accept the resignation of all the liars?! All the corrupt?! More and more of the crowd is chanting 'Yes!'
BLAKE: These men, locked up in Blackgate for eight years, denied parole under the Dent Act. Based on a lie.
GORDON: A lie to keep a city from burning to the ground. Gotham needed a hero, someone to believe in -
BLAKE: Not as much as it does now. But you betrayed everything you stood for.
GORDON: ( looks at Blake ) There's a point. Far out there. When the structures fail you. When the rules aren't weapons anymore, they're shackles, letting the bad get ahead. Maybe one day you'll have such a moment of crisis. And in that moment, I hope you have a friend like I did. To plunge their hands into the filth so you can keep yours clean.
BLAKE: Your hands look pretty filthy to me, Commissioner. Gordon stares at him. Blake goes back to packing.
BANE: We take Gotham from the corrupt. The rich. The oppressors of generations who've kept you down with the myth of opportunity. And we give it to you, the people. Gotham is yours - none shall interfere. Do as you please. The Tumbler fires, blowing the doors to hell.
PRISONER: He says you must first straighten your back. The Prisoner helps Wayne roll over, painfully.
WAYNE: How would he know?
PRISONER: He was the prison doctor. A morphine addict who incurred the displeasure of powerful people. Including your masked friend.
WAYNE: Many years ago, during a time of plague, Bane was attacked by other prisoners. The doctor's fumbling attempts to repair the damage left him in perpetual agony. The mask holds his pain at bay.

WAYNE: Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was he born here?
PRISONER: The legend is that there was a mercenary working for the local warlord who fell in love with his daughter. They married in secret. The Prisoner takes a rope - ties it under Wayne's arms.
PRISONER: When the warlord found out, he condemned the mercenary to this pit. But then exiled him instead. INSERT CUT: the Mercenary is dropped at the side of a barren road. He starts to walk.

FOLEY: How can we trust you?
GORDON: Captain, glad to have you here.
CAPTAIN JONES: How many of you are there?
GORDON: Dozens. I'd rather not say exactly. But the men trapped underground number almost three thousand.
CAPTAIN JONES: What kind of shape they're in?
GORDON: They've been getting water, food.
CAPTAIN JONES: Could we break them out?
BLAKE: Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries guarding the outflow south of Ackerman Park, blow the rubble, you've got a hole big enough for ten at a time. I'm in contact with my partner - they're waiting for the day.

CAPTAIN JONES: What about the triggerman?
GORDON: No leads. It's a bluff - Bane wouldn't give control of that bomb to someone else.
CAPTAIN JONES: We can't take that chance. Until we have the triggerman, we just track the device, smuggle men over -
BLAKE: While Gotham lives under a warlord, like in some failed state?
CAPTAIN JONES: Dial it back, officer. This situation is unprecedented. We can't do anything to risk millions of lives.
BLAKE: ( TO GORDON )
GORDON: Captain, things are more complicated than you think. There's somebody you need to meet. Blake? Blake nods, leads Jones and his men up the stairs.
BLAKE: I was up here looking for a vantage point. Found the people who run the corporation who owns it living Which corporation?

FOX: Miss Tate is fully aware of the And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I have to take responsibility for it.
MIRANDA: And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I have to take responsibility for it.
CAPTAIN JONES: Because, Captain, we built it.
MIRANDA: Because, Captain, we built it.
CAPTAIN JONES: You built the bomb?
FOX: It was built as a fusion reactor. The first of its kind. Bane turned the core into a bomb, then disconnected it from the reactor.
BLAKE: And here's the important part.
FOX: As the device's fuel cells decay, it's becoming increasingly unstable.until the point of The bomb's a time bomb.
BLAKE: The bomb's a time bomb.
FOX: And it will go off. In twenty-three Captain Jones reels at this news.
BLAKE: Bane's revolution is a sham. He's watching Gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ship's going down. Your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.
CAPTAIN JONES: Could you disarm it?
FOX: I don't know, But I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.
CAPTAIN JONES: We'd have to let the Pentagon know.
CAPTAIN JONES: We have no choice. Let's move away from this location, then call it INT. TELLSONS BANK - MOMENTS LATER Captain Jones exits the elevator, followed by his men and Blake.

BLAKE: Fox, somebody sold us out! Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor.
FOX: Take Miranda - Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs. Mercenaries jump out of the elevator, firing high.
MERCERNARY: DOWN ON THE FLOOR! Fox freezes. Lowers himself to the ground.
CAPTAIN JONES: I'll die before I talk.
BANE: I'm on your schedule, Captain. Bane places his hand over Jones's nose and mouth.
MERCERNARY: There were people living upstairs. Bane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead.
BANE: Give them over for judgement. ( Indicates bodies. ) Hang them where the world will see.
PRISONER: He says the leap to freedom is not about strength.

SKINNY PRISONER: Shouldn't you get him down? The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful.
PRISONER: He'll keep. As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we - INSERT CUT: Young Bruce lies at the bottom of the well, looking up at his father, lowering down to rescue him.
BLIND PRISONER: ( CRACKED ENGLISH )
WAYNE: BLIND PRISONER
BLIND PRISONER: How can you move faster then possible? Fight longer than possible? If not from the most powerful impulse of the spirit. The fear of death. The will to survive. Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner.
WAYNE: I do fear death. I fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it.
BLIND PRISONER: Then make the climb.
WAYNE: BLIND PRISONER
BLIND PRISONER: As the child did. Without the rope. ( Dry laugh. ) Then fear will find you again. Wayne considers this.
PRISONER: Supplies for your journey? Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down below the Prisoners start a low chant. As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS. They circle up to the opening above. Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a breath.opens his eyes.looks down at the drop.up again.then he jumps. Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing. And Wayne GRABS the ledge above. The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM.
STRYVER: I want to see Bane! There's been a mistake! Take me to Bane! Fox watches him dragged upstairs.
STRYVER: There's been a mistake! Where's VOICE ( O.S. ) There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver turns to look at the 'judge': Dr. Jonathan Crane.
CRANE: You are Philip Stryver, executive vice-president of Daggett Industries? ( Off nod from Stryver. ) The same Philip Stryver who for years lived like a prince off the blood and sweat of people less Call Bane! I'm one of you! Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane.
STRYVER: Call Bane! I'm one of you! Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane.

STRYVER: ( SMASHES GAVEL )
CRANE: ( SMASHES GAVEL )
BLACKGATE INMATE: Follow the tick ice. Try to swim - you're dead in minutes.
STRYVER: Has anyone made it? The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the ice. He shuffles forward, listening to the creaking. Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him.
GORDON: Where the hell are they? It's not like we have a lot of time, here.
COP: How long?
GORDON: The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've got about eighteen hours to do To do what?
COP: To do what?
GORDON: We mark that truck. Get a GPS on it, then we can start thinking about how to take it down. The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops. Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake.
GORDON: ( LOW )
GORDON: Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?! Gordon heads for the door.
BLAKE: You shouldn't be out on the streets
FOLEY'S WIFE: Jim. He's not here - Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her.
GORDON: You're sending your wife to the door when the city's under Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed.
FOLEY: Wait in the kitchen, honey.
GORDON: What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard?
FOLEY: Jim, you saw what they did to those Special Forces.
GORDON: You forgotten all the years we went out on patrol with every gangbanger wanting to plant one as soon as our backs were turned?
FOLEY: This is different and you know it. These guys run the city - the government's done a deal with them
GORDON: Deal?! Bane's got their balls in a vice. That's not a deal -
FOLEY: You move against Bane, the triggerman's gonna hit the button -
GORDON: You think he's given control of that bomb to one of 'the people'?! You think this is part of some revolution? There's one man with his finger on the button - Bane.
FOLEY: We have to keep our heads down until they can fix this. If you still had family here maybe you'd -
GORDON: This only gets fixed from inside the city, Foley. ( Calmer. ) Look, I'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your dress blues. But we've got to do something before this maniac blows us all to hell.
FOLEY: I'm sorry Jim. I gotta -

FOLEY: You don't know that's going to Foley closes the door on Gordon. Gordon stands there.
MIRANDA: How about me, instead?
GORDON: Miss Tate, I can't ask you -
MIRANDA: My company built it.
GORDON: Bruce Wayne built it.
MIRANDA: And he wanted to destroy it. It was me who didn't listen. Please. Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods.
GORDON: Let's go.
GANGBANGER: You steal from us, you little They grab the Kid's backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an apple, moves to hit the Kid when - SMACK! - his hand is grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks. Selina catches the apple.
SELINA: You boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking Gangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off, howling. The Kid eyes her, wary.
SELINA: Never steal anything from someone you can't outrun, kid.
KID: Now you're gonna take it. Selina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite.
SELINA: Just tax. She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs.
SELINA: You came back. I thought they'd killed you.
WAYNE: Not yet.
SELINA: If you're expecting an apology -
WAYNE: It wouldn't suit you. I need your And why would I help you? Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket.
SELINA: And why would I help you? Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket.
WAYNE: For this. The 'Clean Slate'.
SELINA: You're gonna trust me with that? After what I did to you?
WAYNE: I admit I felt a little let down. But I still think there's more to you. In fact, I think for you - ( indicates USB ) this isn't a tool, it's an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh. She looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it.
SELINA: Start fresh? I can't even get off this island.
WAYNE: I can give you a way off. Once you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I need you to find out where they're holding him. Then take me in.
SELINA: Why do you need Fox?
WAYNE: To save this city.
SELINA: Who says it needs saving? Maybe I like it this way.
WAYNE: Maybe you do. But tomorrow that bomb's going off.
SELINA: Get your powerful friend on the I'm trying. But I need Fox.
WAYNE: I'm trying. But I need Fox.
GORDON: Stay further up the block. ( Points at Men. ) They're gonna cross the street and try and slow the truck down. As it approaches, hit this button. If the needle hits two hundred - give me the signal and I mark the truck. Okay?
BLAKE: ( OVER RADIO )
GORDON: Got it. They keep moving, turning down the next street.into an ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained.
MERCENARY: Commissioner Gordon, you're under On whose authority?
GORDON: On whose authority?
MERCERNARY: The people of Gotham. Blake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and the other Cops being rounded up and led away.
MIRANDA: You picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.
FOX: You picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.
WAYNE: How long until the core ignites?
FOX: That bomb goes off in twelve hours.
WAYNE: Unless we can connect it to the If you can get it there. I'll find a way to plug it back in. ( Indicates Miranda. ) Can you get Miranda out?
FOX: If you can get it there. I'll find a way to plug it back in. ( Indicates Miranda. ) Can you get Miranda out?
WAYNE: Not tonight. I'm sorry.
MIRANDA: Do what's necessary.
WAYNE: ( TO FOX )
FOX: What for?
WAYNE: To get me back in the game. Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.
CATWOMAN: Sorry to spoil things, boys, but Bane wants these guys himself. The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks I won't forget about you.
WAYNE: I won't forget about you.
MIRANDA: I know.
FOX: I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.
CATWOMAN: He should be so lucky. And she's gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs.
WAYNE: Any move I make against Bane or the bomb - the triggerman sets it off.
FOX: They can't be using radio or cell - too much interference. Infrared doesn't have the range. It could only be micro-burst long wave. Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment: mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt.
WAYNE: Could you block it?
FOX: Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance mount from the Bat. You remember where you parked? Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor.
CRANE: The charges are espionage and attempted sabotage. Do you have anything to say in your defense?
GORDON: No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort of due process is this?
CRANE: More than you give Harvey's prisoners, Commissioner. Your guilt is determined, this is merely a sentencing hearing. What's it to be, death or exile?
GORDON: Crane, if you think we are going willingly out onto that ice, you've got another think coming.
CRANE: Death, then?
GORDON: Looks that way.
CRANE: Very well. Death. ( Smiles. ) By He smashes his gavel. Bane leans in to one of his men, indicates Miranda.
BANE: Bring her to me.
LUCIUS: I think it's time to talk about my year-end bonus.
FOX: She fly pretty well?
WAYNE: Even without the autopilot.
FOX: Autopilot? That's what you're there EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - NIGHT Gordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice. A Mercenary fires his gun in the air. Gordon takes a breath, then leads his men onto the ice.which creaks and groans. Further out, Gordon stops - sniffs - looks down: a pool of liquid, beside it: a flare. Gordon picks it up, puzzled.
FOLEY'S KIDS: Dad! Check it out!
FOLEY'S WIFE: Honey, take a look! Foley moves to a back window. Sees the flaming sign.
MERCENARY: Bane turns. The Mercenary points at the sign.
MERCENARY: You think it's really him?
BANE: INT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER Foley yanks up the floorboards. Pull his dress blues from their hiding place.
BATMAN: This blocks the remote detonator signal to the bomb. Get it onto the truck by sunrise. They might hit the button when it starts.
GORDON: When what starts?
BATMAN: EXT. OUTFLOW PIPE, ACKERMAN PARK - CONTINUOUS Blake takes out a second Mercenary - moves over to the open manhole. Ross emerges - nots at Blake, who helps him climb out. BANG - Ross goes down as Blake dives for cover. Blake is grabbed by Mercenaries. They detonate the manhole, sealing it, prepare to execute Blake. A dark shape drops onto the Mercenaries. Blake watches, in awe, as Batman takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks - then it is finished. Quiet. One of the Mercenaries moves slightly.
BLAKE: You missed a spot. Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake.
BATMAN: If you're working alone, wear a No one cares who I am.
BLAKE: No one cares who I am.
BATMAN: The mask is not for you. It's to protect the people you care about.
BLAKE: Huh. And you always seem to know where those people are. How is I lost someone once. Since then I break into their homes when they're sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck. Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses Blake a mini-mine.
BATMAN: I lost someone once. Since then I break into their homes when they're sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck. Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses Blake a mini-mine.
BATMAN: On three - one, two, three - They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance - the blasts barely move any rubble.
BLAKE: No offense, but you got anything bigger in that belt?
BATMAN: That's to warn the men on the other Batman disappears into the shadows.
BLAKE: But how do we -? KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night.
BLAKE: Cops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but glad to be alive and carrying guns.
BLAKE: What now?
BATMAN: All-out assault on Bane.but you need to get the people you care about across the bridge.
BLAKE: In case we fail. Lead an exodus across the bridge. Save as many lives as you can.
BATMAN: In case we fail. Lead an exodus across the bridge. Save as many lives as you can.
BLAKE: Don't you need me here?
BATMAN: You've given me an army. Now go. Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops.
BLAKE: Thank you.
BATMAN: Don't thank me yet.
BLAKE: I might not get a chance later. Batman nods. Blake disappears into the night.
CATWOMAN: Oh, you shouldn't have. She hops on, feeling the controls.
BATMAN: The mid-town tunnel's blocked by debris, but the cannons give you enough firepower to make a path for Catwoman marvels at the controls.
BATMAN: To start it, you -
VARROOOM!: I got it.
CATWOMAN: I got it.
BATMAN: We've got forty-five minutes to save this city -
CATWOMAN: No, I've got forty-five minutes to get clear of the blast radius, because you don't stand a chance against these guys.
BATMAN: With your help I might. She shakes her head.
CATWOMAN: I'll open that tunnel, then I'm He looks at her.
BATMAN: There's more to you than that. She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch.
CATWOMAN: Sorry to keep letting you down. He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring. Come with me. Save yourself. You don't owe these people anymore - you've given them everything.
BATMAN: Not everything. Not yet. Batman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the bike and takes off.
VOICE: ( OVER LOUDSPEAKER )
FOLEY: There's only one police in this He steps forward. The line follows.
BANE: Open fire.
GORDON: Come on, come on.
BANE: You came back. To die with your No. I came back to stop you.
BATMAN: No. I came back to stop you.
GORDON: That's impossible. Come on! Cut over to Fifth! They sprint for the next parallel avenue.
BLAKE: Knock on doors, spread the word - the bomb's going to blow! Get out by the South Street tunnel, or over the bridge! Do two blocks, then get back to the bus! The boys race down the street. Father Reilly climbs into the EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS Batman and Bane fight, Batman pushing Bane back - a Tumbler roars between them, separating them. Batman chases after.
BANE: Stay back. He is mine - Bane SMASHES Batman's head - moves in for the kill, but Batman SMASHES Bane to the ground, RIPS sideways across the tubes of Bane's mask with the blades of his forearm. Bane bellows, thrashing in AGONY. Batman holds him down with a hand on his throat - searches him with his free hand.
BATMAN: Give me the trigger! You'd never give it to an ordinary citizen - Bane's thrashing calms as he stares at Batman through pain-soaked eyes.gasping through his broken mask for I broke you. How have you come You thought you were the only one who could learn the strength to Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.
BANE: I broke you. How have you come You thought you were the only one who could learn the strength to Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.
BATMAN: You thought you were the only one who could learn the strength to Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.
BANE: I never escaped - R¯'s al Gh¯l
A U: rescued me. That is why I must fulfill his plan. That is why I must avenge his murder.
BATMAN: ( CONFUSED )
A U: CLIMB -
A: Batman flinches, frozen as Miranda leans into his ear.
U: Batman flinches, frozen as Miranda leans into his ear.
MIRANDA: I am. Miranda has a knife through Batman's suit, into his ribs. And though I am not 'ordinary', I am a citizen. She pulls out the trigger.
BANE: Then is overrun.
TALIA: I climbed out of the pit. INSERT CUT: Young Talia stands by the hole looking out at the landscape. I found my father and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance - but by that time.the prisoners and the doctor had done their work to my friend.my protector.

A U: INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS Talia looks into Bane's eyes as she holds the knife in Batman's side.
TALIA: He saw only a monster who could never be tamed. Whose very existence was a reminder of the hell he'd left his wife to die in. He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows. His only crime was that he loved me. I could not truly forgive my father. Talia looks at Batman, cold. Until you murdered him.
BATMAN: He was trying to kill millions of innocent people -
TALIA: 'Innocent' is a strong word to throw around Gotham, Bruce. I honor my father by finishing his work. Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience. Talia twists the knife in Batman's side. You see, it's the slow knife.the knife that takes its time, the
BATMAN: Your knife may have been too A Mercenary steps forward -
MERCENARY: The truck's under attack - Talia looks around, mind racing.
TALIA: Gordon. ( To Batman. ) You gave him a way to block my signal. No matter - ( Looks at watch. ) He's bought Gotham eleven minutes. ( Shouts at Mercenary. ) Prepare a convoy. We must secure the bomb until it Talia jumps to her feet. Bane grabs a shotgun from a Mercenary - points it at Batman.
TALIA: Not yet. I want him to feel the heat. ( To Batman. ) Feel the fire of twelve million souls you failed. Talia reaches up to Bane's mask, reconnects his tubes, Goodbye, my friend. Bane nods at her, slowly. Talia moves out with the EXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS Talia gets into a Tumbler with a Mercenary. Three Tumblers pull out in convoy, blowing anything out of the way - cars, Foley stands in the road, firing his sidearm. Talia's Tumbler SMASHES him out of the way.
BANE: You'll have to imagine the fire - He shuts the gun - jams it into Batman's face. We both know I need to kill you He squeezes the trigger. BLAMMM! Bane is blasted across the lobby by cannon fire. Catwoman is there, on the Bat-Pod.
CATWOMAN: The whole no-guns thing? I don't feel as strongly about it as you EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS Blake pulls up to the barricade, leads the kids off, marching them up the bridge, Father Reilly at the rear. A Uniform shouts through the loudhailer -

BLAKE: It's gonna blow anyway. We need this bridge open right now.
UNIFORM: No one leaves the island. Orders -
BLAKE: Whose orders? Bane's?
UNIFORM: Police Department's.

BLAKE: Your orders are out of date! The situation's changed! Listen, I'm a cop like you. And I'm walking out there. Please don't shoot me. Blake walks. Shots ring out at his feet. He keeps walking.
UNIFORM: Son-of-a-bitch! ( To his partner. ) Blow it! Before he reaches the line
UNIFORM: Get down! We're blowing the bridge! As Blake looks, disbelieving, the bridge in front of him blasts upwards in a massive fireball. Blake dives backwards.
BLAKE: You idiots! You sons of bitches! You're killing us!!
BLAKE: Father! Get the boys on the bus -
FATHER REILLY: But there's nowhere to go, son.
TUMBLER DRIVER: ( OVER RADIO )
TALIA: Pushing us to the entrance of the reactor. They're going to try and reconnect the core.
TUMBLER DRIVER: ( OVER RADIO )
GORDON: Give me a hand! The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try and grab the core but it is too hot. Let's get a cable on it and drag it out! Come on, we're almost there - Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck. Fox showed me how to operate the reactor core. Including the emergency flood -
TALIA: Fox showed me how to operate the reactor core. Including the emergency flood -
TALIA: There is no way to stop this bomb. Prepare yourselves. ( Looks up at Batman. ) My father's work is done. Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns - Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to attach a hoist from the Bat.
GORDON: What're you doing?
BATMAN: Two minutes. I can fly it out over the bay. Catwoman is at his side as he works.
CATWOMAN: Rig it out to fly over the water, then bail -
BATMAN: No autopilot. She takes this in. He stands to face her.
CATWOMAN: You could've gone anywhere. Been anything. But you came back here.
BATMAN: So did you.
CATWOMAN: I guess we're both suckers. She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves to the Bat, Gordon alongside.
GORDON: So this is the part where you vanish, only this time you don't come back? Batman opens the canopy.
BLAKE: Come on! On the bus!
FATHER REILLY: What're you doing?
BLAKE: Protection from the blast -
FATHER REILLY: It's an atom bomb -! Blake turns on Father Reilly, furious.
BLAKE: You think they need to hear that in their last seconds? You think I'm going to let them die without hope?
GORDON: I never cared who you were -
BATMAN: And you were right.
GORDON: But shouldn't the people know the hero who saved them?
BATMAN: A hero can be anyone. That was always the point. Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon. Anyone. A man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a little boy's shoulders to let him know that the world hadn't ended. The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers
GORDON: Bruce Wayne? - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the tunnel mouth. The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core. A building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but there's no power to get over it.
BLAKE: Heads down! Heads down, now!
FATHER REILLY: Blake, they need to make their Blake turns to him, furious.

The smallest of the boys stares through the window past No. That's Batman! Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth of the river.the bay.the ocean. Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST - wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham. As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon.

GORDON: 'I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave. 'It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.' Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him. Alfred. Tears streaming. Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves. Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of Thomas and Martha Wayne.
ALFRED: I'm so sorry. I failed you. You trusted me, and I failed you. And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs.
GORDON: Can I change your mind about quitting the force?
BLAKE: No. What you said about structures. About shackles. I can't take it. The injustice. ( Gestures at gardens. ) I mean.no one's ever going to know who saved an entire They know.

BLAKE: Blake, John.
CLERK: ( CHECKS LIST )
BLAKE: Try my legal name. The Clerk glances at the license. Checks.
CLERK: Yup, here it is. She reaches down behind the desk, sorting through various items, and hands him a sports bag. Blake takes it, curious.
CLERK: You should use your full name. I like that name. Robin.
LAWYER: Any word on the missing item?
CLERK: No, not yet.
LAWYER: Well, they'd better leave no stone unturned. We can't just put a string of pearls on the manifest as INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - DAY Fox stands in front of the second camouflage rotor. Two Techs are examining the controls in the cockpit.

TECH 2: But Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed. ( Typed on panel. ) Software patch.six months ago.
