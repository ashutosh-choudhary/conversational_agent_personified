GETTYS: Why? What are you talking about?
KEVIN: The wife. The kid. The outrage. You definitely had me fooled.
GETTYS: You're my lawyer! You're here to defend me!

REPORTER: What's the game plan, Kevin? I got a four-thirty deadline. I need a quote. Gimme a quote.
KEVIN: Fuck off.
REPORTER: 'Mr. Lomax had no comment on today's events. Speculation, however, was widespread that the young lawyer's unblemished string of victories would come to an end in this courtroom.'
REPORTER: It was a nice run, Kev. Had to close out someday. Nobody wins 'em all.
KEVIN: Math hasn't exactly been your subject this year, has it?
BARBARA: Any theories on why you've done so poorly in math this year?
KEVIN: Any theories on why you've done so poorly in math this year?
BARBARA: It's not my fault.
KEVIN: Would you say Mr. Gettys is the You're not sure. Have you had any discipline problems in math class this year?

BARBARA: I don't know what the other teachers wanted. You'd have to talk to them.
KEVIN: You ever pass notes in class, Barbara? Maybe a note that made fun of Mr. Gettys?
BARBARA: No? Never called him a 'disgusting pig monster'?
KEVIN: No? Never called him a 'disgusting pig monster'?
BARBARA: Kevin handing out paperwork.
KEVIN: Your Honor, I've pre-marked this Defense Exhibit A.
PROSECUTOR: Objection, Your Honor, we've had plenty of time for discovery here.
JUDGE: I'm gonna let this in, Mr. Lomax, I'm also gonna suggest that if you have any other exhibits you present in a timely fashion or not at all.
KEVIN: ( right to I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong, it's 'huge hog beast'. This is your handwriting, isn't it?
BARBARA: Yes, but
KEVIN: You wrote this in his class.
BARBARA: It's a joke.
KEVIN: 'He's a huge hog beast. He probably eats a thousand pancakes for breakfast.' You're writing here about Mr. Gettys, aren't you?
BARBARA: It was meant to be a joke.
KEVIN: Have you ever had a party at your house when your parents were away? Yes or no?
PROSECUTOR: Objection. This is way out of.
KEVIN: Credibility and bias.
JUDGE: Overruled. Answer the question.

JUDGE: I'm gonna sustain that, Mr. Lomax. Rephrase your question.
KEVIN: You threatened those children, didn't you?
BARBARA: That's not the way it happened
KEVIN: You told them to falsely claim that Mr. Gettys had hurt them, didn't you?
BARBARA: These things did happen!
KEVIN: Because if they didn't go along you were going to tell everyone about this special party.
BARBARA: They happened to me.
KEVIN: So you made up a story. A special story, about a math teacher a disgusting pig monster you didn't like. That's what really happened, isn't it?
BARBARA: I didn't want to be the only one!
BARBARA'S FATHER: You son of a bitch!
KEVIN: I have no further questions, Your

REPORTER: So, Kev, off the record, how's it feel to squeeze a man like Gettys through the door of reasonable I told you already, we're not gonna discuss that damn case anymore. Done. Am I right?
MARY ANN: ( waving him off ) I told you already, we're not gonna discuss that damn case anymore. Done. ( to Kevin ) Am I right?
KEVIN: I'll drink to that. No shop talk.
HEATH: Helluva job today. I didn't want to disturb your Milton, Chadwick, Waters. Never heard of it. What're you gonna do? Sue me?
KEVIN: Milton, Chadwick, Waters. Never heard of it. What're you gonna do? Sue me?
HEATH: Actually, we were hoping to retain your services. We've been following your progress.
KEVIN: From New York.
HEATH: You've never lost a case.
KEVIN: I've had some sympathetic juries.
HEATH: That's exactly what we're looking for. We want you to come to New York. Help us pick a jury.
KEVIN: ( amused now ) I'll tell you, man. You're pretty damn good. And the card is great. And the black thing you being black whose idea was that? Paul's? 'Cause that's just ( as he's walking ) I'm just not drunk enough yet to fall for it.
HEATH: You'd have to start next week. All expenses. First class travel and lodging. You and your wife. A lump sum payment, regardless of verdict in the amount of, well. Here. Take a look.
KEVIN: It's two weeks at most.
MRS. LOMAX: You've never been to New York.
KEVIN: Every dog gets a day.
MRS. LOMAX: Pick a jury. I feel the hand of Mary Ann on this adventure.
KEVIN: MRS. LOMAX
MRS. LOMAX: New York is not a good idea.
KEVIN: Look, how you fixed for cash?
MRS. LOMAX: I have my bad feeling.
KEVIN: ( an envelope ) I put a couple hundred in here.
MRS. LOMAX: Sounds like more than two weeks.
KEVIN: Mary Ann typed out the numbers for you phone, the flights it's all in there.
MRS. LOMAX: Let me tell you about New York.
KEVIN: ( with a smile ) Forewarned is forearmed. ( half-serious ) 'Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great. It has become a dwelling place of demons.' Revelation Eighteen. Wouldn't hurt you to look it over.
MRS. LOMAX: Forewarned is forearmed. 'Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great. It has become a dwelling place of demons.' Revelation Eighteen. Wouldn't hurt you to look it over.
KEVIN: ( rolls with it ) Couldn't forget it if I tried.
MRS. LOMAX: And what happened to Babylon?
KEVIN: 'Thou mighty city. In one hour hast thou mighty judgement come.'
MRS. LOMAX: 'And the light of a single lamp shall shine in thee no more.'
KEVIN: Okay. Open your eyes.

KEVIN: 'Go ahead.' '. bite the Big Apple.'
MARY ANN: ( she's dancing ) '. Rats on the West Side, bed bugs uptown, I can't give it away on Seventh Avenue. This town don't look good in tatters.'
KEVIN: I don't know. looks to me like that dress is in your way.
MARY ANN: ( shocked, stops ) Why, counselor. ( her best drawl ) Surely you don't think a small- town girl changes overnight just because a man buys her dinner in the big city.
KEVIN: No, ma'am. In fact, I hardly ever think at all.
MARY ANN: Well, that's different, then. You're my kind of guy.
MEISEL: Do you think as a juror you'd be able to set aside any prior opinions you might hold about the savings and loan industry? That was a question, sir.
MEISEL: Your Honor, may I have a minute to speak with my colleagues.
KEVIN: Dump him. While you're at it let's get rid of number six, eight, and I'd say lose number twelve, except the prosecutor's gonna fuck up and do it for us.
MEISEL: Number six? You're kidding, right? She's my first choice.
KEVIN: She's my first pass.
MEISEL: And eight? With the dreadlocks? That's crazy. He's a defendant juror if I ever saw one.
KEVIN: You see his shoes?
MEISEL: Look, kid, maybe down in Florida you're the next big thing, but this is New York. Manhattan. We're not squeezing oranges here.
KEVIN: He polishes those shoes every night. He makes his own clothes. He may look like a brother-with- an-attitude to you, but I see a man who's got a shotgun under his bed and woe betide the creature who steps into his garden. And number six? Your favorite? She's damaged goods.
MEISEL: She's a Catholic schoolteacher. She believes in human frailty.
KEVIN: No. There's something missing from her. She's wrong. She wants on this jury. Somebody hurt her and she wants revenge.
MEISEL: How the hell do you know that?
KEVIN: ( honestly ) I don't know.
MEISEL: ( to Heath ) Look, either you put a stop to this happy horseshit or I walk.
HEATH: ( a pause ) All right. Here's the deal. ( to Kevin ) I lose with your jury? You do the

KEVIN: Every now and then she gets one What's up? You okay? Something's up.
MARY ANN: What's up? You okay? Something's up.
KEVIN: They deliberated for thirty-eight Oh shit.
MARY ANN: Oh shit.
KEVIN: Yeah. Except one.
MARY ANN: ( a big ole smile ) Not fucking guilty.
KEVIN: ( a big ole smile ) Not fucking guilty.
MARY ANN: Thirty-eight minutes. My jury.
KEVIN: Thirty-eight minutes. My jury.
MARY ANN: You did it! Omigod, Kevin.
KEVIN: Put on something that's gonna be easy to take off later. We are going out, girl!
HEATH: Sorry to keep you waiting, but Mr. Milton got pinned down in Indonesia a little longer than expected. Not bad, huh? You can play it cool if you want, but the first time I walked in here, my jaw was on the floor.
HEATH: ( as they walk ) We've got forty partners vested at the moment. Close to six hundred associates. This is the home office, but we've got quite a few international arrangements, so Mr. Milton spends a good deal of his time in the air. In addition to our corporate clients, we're currently representing about twenty-five foreign countries. Mid-East, Balkans, Central America, West Africa. Interesting work, but travel intensive.
HEATH: ( smiles ) Man, I just love that.
HEATH: I watched a Senator piss his pants right where you're standing.
KEVIN: ( nonplussed ) He's waiting for you. Good luck.
HEATH: He's waiting for you. Good luck.
MILTON: Sorry. Didn't mean to.
KEVIN: No. Please. Kevin Lomax.
MILTON: ( they shake ) John Milton.
KEVIN: Nice to meet you.
MILTON: Have we been treating you well?
KEVIN: Very well. Thank you.
MILTON: Your wife, she's had a good time?
KEVIN: She sure has. It's been great. The whole thing's been great.
MILTON: Good. That's our secret. We kill you with kindness. What's your secret?
KEVIN: I couldn't say.
MILTON: You were a prosecutor.
KEVIN: Out of law school. Five years in the Jacksonville D.A.'s office.
MILTON: Sixty-four straight convictions. What a number.
KEVIN: I like to be in court. I didn't plea out a lot.
MILTON: What's that like? One day you're putting them away and the next you're setting them free?
KEVIN: Takes a little getting used to.
MILTON: Pays better though, doesn't it?
KEVIN: Yes it does.
MILTON: The math teacher. The Gettys case. I hear you were brilliant.
KEVIN: Prosecutor dropped the ball.
MILTON: Really. So you think your guy was I didn't say that.
KEVIN: I didn't say that.
MILTON: What did you say?
KEVIN: How's this? I began the case with a clear conscience.
MILTON: ( quiet a moment ) I was sure you had a secret.
KEVIN: The men's room. Upstairs men's room in the Duval County courthouse. There's a hole in the wall. Straight through to the next room. I spent five years listening to juries deliberate.
MILTON: I love it.
KEVIN: Love it all you want, just don't repeat it. I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association would appreciate it.
MILTON: You don't really want to go back to Florida, do you? Walk with me.
MILTON: What do you think? Some people can't handle it.
KEVIN: It's peaceful.
MILTON: ( pleased ) Fill in the resume. Tell me about your family. What does your father do?
KEVIN: I never got to know my father. He passed away before I was born. My mom raised me. Just the two of She never remarried?
MILTON: She never remarried?
KEVIN: She wasn't married the first time.
MILTON: That can't be easy in Gainesville.
KEVIN: I don't think it's easy anywhere. Holy shit.
MILTON: Little different when you're looking down, isn't it? Tell me about her. Your mother. What's she like?
KEVIN: She's a preacher's daughter. She's tough. She's worked in the same poultry plant for as long as I can remember. I think she's up to eight-fifty an hour. She's got a church she really likes, so she's usually either there or they go out, they do a lot of volunteer
MILTON: 'Many are in high places, and of great renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek.'
KEVIN: So they say.
MILTON: Didn't rub off on you? The book? The church?
KEVIN: I'm on parole. Early release for time served.
MILTON: Lotta potential clients down there. ( Sooner or later it all flows through the streets. )
KEVIN: You don't have to sell me on New You like it here, don't you?
MILTON: You like it here, don't you?
KEVIN: Are we negotiating?
MILTON: Why do you need a criminal Because our clients break the law just like everyone else and I'm tired of sending their business across the street.
KEVIN: Why do you need a criminal Because our clients break the law just like everyone else and I'm tired of sending their business across the street.
MILTON: Because our clients break the law just like everyone else and I'm tired of sending their business across the street.
KEVIN: Are you offering me a job?
MILTON: I'm thinking about it. You have the talent. I knew that before you got here. It's the other thing I wonder about.
KEVIN: What thing is that?
MILTON: Pressure. Changes everything. Some people, you squeeze them, they focus. Some people fold. Can you summon your talent at will? Can you deliver on deadline? Can you sleep at night?
KEVIN: When do we talk about money?
MILTON: Money's the easy part.
HEATH: I doubt it was at the top of his list when Mr. Milton bought the building, but it's a great neighborhood for children.
JACKIE: You must be Mary Ann Welcome. I'm Jackie Heath.
MARY ANN: It's so sweet of you to come by.
JACKIE: Please. We live across the hall.
MARY ANN: You're kidding?
HEATH: Right here.
KEVIN: So it's just two apartments per You didn't tell them about the I thought I'd let it speak for
JACKIE: ( to her husband ) You didn't tell them about the I thought I'd let it speak for
HEATH: I thought I'd let it speak for
HEATH: It's what they call a classic We had them paint everything white. Let you see it naked before you pick your palette.
JACKIE: We had them paint everything white. Let you see it naked before you pick your palette.
MARY ANN: What am I picking?
JACKIE: Palette. Your colors.
HEATH: I need to warn you about one There are going to be some very envious people at the firm. These apartments, there aren't many of them, it's really a partner's perk. You must've made quite an Took us six years to get in here.
JACKIE: Took us six years to get in here.
MARY ANN: Are you really this good?
KEVIN: I sure as hell hope so.
MARY ANN: They must want you pretty bad.
KEVIN: Look, Mare, I'm only getting behind this if you're on board. You want to go home, I'm with you.
MARY ANN: Sure. Let's go back to Gainesville. You can keep scrounging for clients and pumping out the basement and I'll keep repossessing cars for Akamian. Maybe, if we kill ourselves, in about five years we can afford a baby and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores. Are you shitting me?

MILTON: There you go, Kevin. The whole team. I'm trying to think how long it's been since we were all together. All of us. Too long. I'm looking around, I know some of you came from very far away to be with us here today. It's This room we're in was built architecturally designed to promote healthy group dynamics. A psychic centrifuge. Makes you want to reach out, doesn't it? Inclusion. Commonality. Synergy. All that good shit. That's what I'm looking for today. Because when I hear stories the kind of stories I've been hearing about backbiting, about partners not working together, departments cutting each other's throats over clients, or worse. I feel drained. It drains me. I feel empty. I feel as though I've let you all down. We need something. A gesture. What do I need, Eddie?
BARZOON: How about a public flogging?
MILTON: Wait a minute. I got it. It's perfect. It's intimate. It's quick. Doesn't cost a thing. There's a power to it. What is Let's hold hands. All of us.
MILTON: Right now. Every person at this table take the hand of the person on either side.
MILTON: You want out of this, Eddie?
BARZOON: You've made your point, John.
MILTON: You won't hold hands? It's important to me, Eddie.
MILTON: See. See, I feel better already.
HEATH: What do you think?
KEVIN: ( kidding ) I guess it'll do.
HEATH: Kevin Lomax. Pam Garrety.
PAM: In the pipeline. For now, we'll just have you work pro hac vice. We've petitioned Florida for a letter of good conduct. And. . I prepared, at Mr. Milton's request, an overview of the Moyez The Moyez case?
KEVIN: The Moyez case?
DRIVER: I gotta stick with the vehicle.
JUNKIE: Tell her turn that shit down! I know what she's doin'! That's right! Tell 'em take that noise back t'Africa 'fore I
KEVIN: I'm looking for Phillipe Moyez.
KEVIN: I called this morning, I'm not sure who I spoke with. I'm his lawyer. I have a card. They said he would meet me here. Phillipe Moyez.
WOMAN: ( into the back ) Bhalla! Bhalla!
KEVIN: Look, I'm not sure I'm making myself clear here.
BOY: ( a French accent ) You need him. Speak wid him.
KEVIN: You're saying he's down here? In the basement? In the dark?
BOY: ( laughing ) Where? Where you think ? Where you think me taking you?
KEVIN: Mr. Moyez? We've never met. I'm a lawyer. I'm here about the animals.
MOYEZ: As you wish.
KEVIN: I'll be arguing your case with the city. I need to ask you some I've done a little preliminary research precedent cases in the past that dealt with Santeria and Vou
MOYEZ: No. This is not Santeria. We are not Voodoo. Candomble. Obeayisne. None of that. We are much older. Before. Before all of it.
KEVIN: Okay. Is there a name? Or.
MOYEZ: We have papers. At your firm. We have the tax exemption.
KEVIN: Okay. I'll get right into that. The animals. Let's start with that, then.
MOYEZ: We have an investment in blood. Think of it as spiritual currency.
KEVIN: Look, Mr. Moyez, I'm going to need your help with this.
MOYEZ: Yes. That's very clear.
KEVIN: Perhaps we could start at the
KEVIN: Mr. Moyez?
MOYEZ: What is the name of the man who will prosecute us?
KEVIN: ( scanning file ) Merto. Assistant District Attorney Arnold Merto.
MOYEZ: Bhalla. La chemise noire. Vite!
KEVIN: What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?
MOYEZ: You can go now. You will have all the help I can give you.
PAM: What do you think?
KEVIN: It's a health code case. And it's a loser. So what's the point? It's a test, right?
PAM: Isn't everything?
KEVIN: The smart thing to do is make a deal. Plea him out and suppress the tape.
PAM: I'm sure the D.A.'s waiting for your call.
KEVIN: Yeah, well, let him wait. And you can tell Milton too. I didn't come to New York to plea DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96 38.
PAM: It's only a health code case.
KEVIN: Your Honor, the city timed this police action to catch my client exercising his constitutionally- protected right to religious
JUDGE SKLAR: This is a law protecting Kosher Exactly, Your Honor. And I'd like to move at this time for an immediate directed verdict for I happen to know a little bit about Kashrut law, Mr. Lomax.
KEVIN: Exactly, Your Honor. And I'd like to move at this time for an immediate directed verdict for I happen to know a little bit about Kashrut law, Mr. Lomax.
JUDGE SKLAR: I happen to know a little bit about Kashrut law, Mr. Lomax.
KEVIN: I'm aware of that, Your Honor, which is why I feel confident in requesting a dismissal.
JUDGE SKLAR: Mr. Merto?
MILTON: ( coming toward them ) Bravo, Kevin. Bravo. ( as he arrives ) Pamela, you're looking lovely. ( to Moyez ) Satisfied, Phillipe?
MOYEZ: Kevin, what can I say?
MILTON: Kevin, what can I say?
MILTON: Best street food in the world. Try that. Tell me it isn't great. New York. What a scene, right?
KEVIN: You gotta be kidding.
MILTON: What do you think? We're giving you away? He's paying us in goat's blood? I'm billing you out at four-hundred an hour, my friend. I don't see a whole lot of pro bono work in your immediate future. Seriously, what I like, you got in there with him. Inside the cage. That's instinct. Can't be taught. You gotta hear that on your own. It's gotta be in your blood. It's molecular. I bet I've got five thousand lawyers working around the planet. I couldn't name ten couldn't name three I'd trust with Moyez.
KEVIN: So what the hell are they doing?
MILTON: What are they doing? They're corporate lawyers, what do you think they're doing? They're busy reducing life and death to the proper position of a semi- colon. They're doing needlepoint. Push button battles. Push button wars. Armies that get so fucking far away from each other they need satellites to tell them who won. No pain. No sound. No smell. One big, multinational circle jerk. You, on the other hand, you're on the slaughterhouse floor. You can't help but smell your clients.
KEVIN: I figure you came to court to make sure I didn't fuck this up.
MILTON: Maybe I did. But don't get too cocky. No matter how good you are. Don't let them see you coming. That's the gaff, my friend make yourself small. Be the hick. The cripple. The nerd. The leper. The shit- kicking surfer. Look at me I've been underestimated from day one. Do I look like a master of the universe? That's your only weakness as far as I can tell.
KEVIN: What's that?
MILTON: The look. The Florida stud thing. 'Scuse me, ma'am, did I leave my boots under your bed?'
KEVIN: Never worked a jury didn't have a You know what you're missing? What I have? This beautiful girl she's just fucked me every way she knows how we're done she's walking to the bathroom she turns back and there I am. It's me. And she smiles it's like a veil coming down across her face and that smile, that's a question mark, because she's looking at me, she's wondering, how did that happen? And see, right there, from that moment on, she's got a secret. I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt. I'm the whisper in Nefertitti's ear. I'm a surprise. They never see me coming. That's what you're
MILTON: You know what you're missing? What I have? This beautiful girl she's just fucked me every way she knows how we're done she's walking to the bathroom she turns back and there I am. It's me. And she smiles it's like a veil coming down across her face and that smile, that's a question mark, because she's looking at me, she's wondering, how did that happen?

KEVIN: So why did you come down today?
MILTON: Because I knew it was gonna be good. Because I knew I was gonna like it. That you would shine that we would take this walk that we'd really talk. Why I came down? You want the truth? I'm an aging, hipster plutocrat. I came up from nothing. From dirt. I'm warming my hands on your talent Where's the chicken?
KEVIN: A CHINESE MAN sits in a doorway
MILTON: ( perfect Cantonese ) Where's the chicken? The chicken that plays tic-tac-toe. He used to be right here.
CHINESE MAN: ( Cantonese ) No, you passed it. Back that way.
MILTON: ( back to Kevin, as There's a chicken, he's famous, he plays tic-tac-toe. He never ( suddenly ) Hey. Like you. Right? ( catching himself ) Look, I'm rambling because I'm excited. You're in the part of the game I like best. The realm of the True Believers. You are a believer, aren't you?
KEVIN: I believe in the presumption of Better a hundred guilty men go free than a single innocent be
MILTON: Better a hundred guilty men go free than a single innocent be
KEVIN: Something like that.
MILTON: No. Exactly like that. It's faith. You're either in or out. You can't believe a little bit.
KEVIN: I was kidding.
MILTON: You're not here to amuse me. See, that's why people hate lawyers. So many of us have lost our faith. Don't let that happen to you. Excuse me?
KEVIN: Excuse me?
MILTON: Learn the subways, Kevin. Use them. Stay in the trenches.
KEVIN: ( walking through ) Mare. Mare.?
KEVIN: What's all this?
MARY ANN: Oh, that. It was gonna be a nursery, but then I remembered you'd have to be home long enough to knock me up, so now I'm thinking of building a law library.
MARY ANN: Save the thought. We were due up there fifteen minutes ago.
MARY ANN: Tell me I can handle this.
KEVIN: You can handle this.
MARY ANN: Say something nice.
KEVIN: Something nice.
MARY ANN: Promise me you won't leave me alone in there.
KEVIN: MARY ANN
MARY ANN: How the hell did we get here?
KEVIN: 58 INT. BARZOON APARTMENT - NIGHT 58
DIANA: There you are! Diana Barzoon, Eddie's wife. Come on, you two. Everyone can't wait to meet you.
DIANA: I love the eights. The entire 'A' line such a great shell. I do. I envy you. Starting from scratch. Do you have your fabrics yet? Tell me you don't.
MARY ANN: Not yet. I don't think so.
DIANA: Come with me. Instantly. I'm borrowing your wife.
BARZOON: Be gentle, honey. These are normal people.
BARZOON: Your first?
KEVIN: Excuse me?
BARZOON: Is this your first marriage?
MARY ANN: Who is that?
JACKIE: ( looking over ) My God, girl.
DIANA: You haven't met him yet?
MARY ANN: Who is he?
DIANA: I swear he can hear us.
JACKIE: Hell, he can smell us.
MILTON: Mary Ann? John Milton. I was hoping we'd meet tonight. And here you are, already swimming with the sharks.
MARY ANN: Deadbeats. I mean, that's what it comes down to. You can call yourself a finance trainee, or a financial resources adviser, or whatever, you're still spending most of your day trying to hammer car payments out of No deadbeats here tonight.
MILTON: You'd be surprised. There's a lot more fear in this room than you'd think.
MARY ANN: What do these people have to be afraid of?
MILTON: Each other. Themselves. Why? What scares you?
MARY ANN: Not knowing who the deadbeats are.
MILTON: You'll figure that out. There's only one thing worth being frightened of anyway, and that's being alone. Truly and finally Yes. I think you're right.
MARY ANN: Yes. I think you're right.
MILTON: You know what terrifies me? For what?
MARY ANN: For what?
MILTON: For what. For you. Let's be honest, I've changed your life. Changed it forever. There's been a seismic shift in your existence and I'm responsible. And you've never even met me. We're talking for the very first time. How insane is that?
MARY ANN: It's a wonderful opportunity for Kevin. Please. I'm not worried about Kevin. He buys a few new suits. Learns a few new tricks. He's there. I don't worry about Kevin. What about you?
MILTON: Kevin. Please. I'm not worried about Kevin. He buys a few new suits. Learns a few new tricks. He's there. I don't worry about Kevin. What about you?
MARY ANN: I'm not leaving a lot behind.
MILTON: You must have family.
MARY ANN: Bad subject. I haven't spoken to my folks in a long time. My sister ran all the way to Whoaa. I gotta think about that. I had you down as daddy's little girl, you know? The princess. Sugar plum snapshots. Pastel bedspreads. Cinnamon cookies.
MILTON: Whoaa. I gotta think about that. I had you down as daddy's little girl, you know? The princess. Sugar plum snapshots. Pastel bedspreads. Cinnamon cookies.
MARY ANN: I tell Kevin the only thing worse than not having a father was having mine.
MILTON: So you've got a lot at stake here. You've made a real commitment.
MARY ANN: I guess I have.
MILTON: It's not gonna be like Gainesville, but then you know that already.
MARY ANN: We're gonna be fine. It's gonna be great.
MILTON: If it isn't, will you come to me? Let me help? I'd feel a lot less responsible. Will you do that for me?
MARY ANN: The worst vice is advice, right? But can I make a suggestion? It's about your hair, some people are sensitive, that's why I ask.
MILTON: The worst vice is advice, right? But can I make a suggestion? It's about your hair, some people are sensitive, that's why I ask.
MARY ANN: No. I mean, go ahead. You don't like it?
MILTON: You have shoulders nobody can see. Pull it back.
MARY ANN: You mean, you want me to pull my hair back?
MILTON: If I do it, everyone in this room that's pretending not to watch us will assume we're fucking or something. Pull back your hair. Take a look. See. That's it. Isn't that incredible? You need to cut your hair.
MARY ANN: You're kidding.
MILTON: A woman's shoulders are the frontlines of her mystique. And her neck, if she's alive, has the very mystery of a border town. It's the no man's land in the battle between mind and body. You know, your natural color would really bring out your eyes.
CHRISTABELLA: Do you have this view?
KEVIN: From your terrace, is this your Sort of. Not exactly. I'm about twelve floors down. What about No, I live downtown. This is the family building.
CHRISTABELLA: From your terrace, is this your Sort of. Not exactly. I'm about twelve floors down. What about No, I live downtown. This is the family building.
KEVIN: Sort of. Not exactly. I'm about twelve floors down. What about No, I live downtown. This is the family building.
CHRISTABELLA: No, I live downtown. This is the family building.
KEVIN: Sounds like fun. Downtown, I mean. I'm just getting to know the city.
CHRISTABELLA: Is it everything you expected?
KEVIN: ( raising her glass ) May we always have more than we expect. Salute.
CHRISTABELLA: ( raising her glass ) May we always have more than we expect. Salute.
KEVIN: Are you alone?
CHRISTABELLA: Are you alone?
KEVIN: You mean, tonight?
CHRISTABELLA: Is your wife a jealous woman? Silly question. We're all jealous, aren't we?
KEVIN: I doubt it.
CHRISTABELLA: You like to be on top, don't you?
KEVIN: Excuse me?
CHRISTABELLA: Of the situation. You prefer to be on top.
KEVIN: Depends on the view.
MILTON: I see the future of this law firm. Christabella, cara, prestamelo per favore, pe lo riporto piu tardi.
CHRISTABELLA: It's a boring party, anyway.
MILTON: Look, we gotta talk. You grab Heath and Eddie Barzoon and get up to my place right away. And let's be quiet about it.
MARY ANN: Have you seen Kevin?
MARY ANN: ( in doorway ) I'm looking for my husband.
MAN #1: Don't think he's here.
WOMAN: It's just us.
MAN #2: But feel free to join in.
KEVIN: Is there more to it?
BARZOON: Just this room.
KEVIN: And a bedroom?
BARZOON: No bedroom.
KEVIN: Where does he sleep?
HEATH: Who said he sleeps?
KEVIN: Where does he fuck?
BARZOON: What's up, John?
MILTON: How many hours did we bill Alex Cullen last year?
HEATH: Sixteen thousand, two hundred and
BARZOON: What the fuck did he do now?
MILTON: Alex Cullen has just been charged with murdering his ex- wife, her stepson, and a maid.
BARZOON: When did this happen?
MILTON: Just now. Tonight. I already sent Pam downtown to make bail
BARZOON: They'll fucking crucify him. They'll get in line. I gotta call No. I want Kevin on this case.
MILTON: No. I want Kevin on this case.
BARZOON: I hope you're kidding. Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan triple murder? With Kevin? You're dreaming.
MILTON: I've shaken hands with every marquee defense attorney in town. I take Kevin and I don't look You're a great judge of talent, John. You're the master. I just don't see it coming together.
BARZOON: You're a great judge of talent, John. You're the master. I just don't see it coming together.
MILTON: I want you on board, Eddie.
KEVIN: Look, I appreciate the vote of confidence, but maybe Eddie's got a point here.
MILTON: We can get this case. The man's our client.
BARZOON: He's a business client.
MILTON: We know him better than he knows himself. We have the inside track. We have the best damn trial lawyer in the city. It's ours to lose.
BARZOON: Tell it to Cullen.
MILTON: No. That's up to Kevin.
MILTON: That's Pam calling. Are we fighting for this, or not?
MARY ANN: You left me there. I had a fucking panic attack until Jackie told me where you were. Three hours? You don't even call?
KEVIN: Stop. Reset. I'm upstairs, I'm with Milton and Barzoon and there is a very good possibility that I'm about to catch a triple homicide defendant who also happens to be the largest real estate developer in the city. I had to bail on the party!
MARY ANN: You bailed on me!
KEVIN: Mare. did you hear me?
MARY ANN: I was all by myself!
KEVIN: For three whole hours. You gotta be kidding, right?
CULLEN TOWERS: "The Next Great Address"
CULLEN: . You may be right, but look at it from my point of view. I'm sure he's a whiz kid. I believe you. But this is my ass we're Jesus, Eddie.
MILTON: Alex, you know how this town works. You've got enemies you never heard of. And now? Now you're down? I'd prepare for a class-A, New York pig-fuck. You're going to have to ask yourself who you really trust. Who do you trust, Alex?
CULLEN: I don't know. I gotta look You don't have time to shop, Mr. Jury selection started this morning at every breakfast table in the city. You lost round one. This is what people know. They know you and your wife were living separately. They see this maid Elucinda a sixty-eight-year-old grandmother supporting seven children. And then there's your stepson, a ten-year-old with a bullet in his brain. Those are already powerful images in the mind of the public.
KEVIN: You don't have time to shop, Mr. Jury selection started this morning at every breakfast table in the city. You lost round one. This is what people know. They know you and your wife were living separately. They see this maid Elucinda a sixty-eight-year-old grandmother supporting seven children. And then there's your stepson, a ten-year-old with a bullet in his brain. Those are already powerful images in the mind of the public.
CULLEN: I didn't kill anybody.
KEVIN: I'm telling you how it looks. You discover the crime. You call it in. You've got blood on your person and clothes, and and your prints are on the murder weapon.
CULLEN: How do you know that?
KEVIN: There's a second print in blood it's a partial of a hand on the wall next to th
CULLEN: I have keys! I called the cops from the house! I touched the goddamn wall! I was panicked! I panicked!
KEVIN: We need twelve people who can see past all that. I'd get out in front of this fast.
CULLEN: I panicked! Is that a crime? I touched the wall!
BARZOON: He's right, Alex. People need to hear these things.
KEVIN: You're not happy tomorrow? The next day? We'll move over. But right now this moment you need immediate representation.
CULLEN: I've got a fourteen-year-old stepdaughter who I care more about than anything in the world. They won't let me call her from downtown. They won't let me talk to her after I'm out. I gotta go deal with that first.
KEVIN: We need to issue a statement.
MILTON: He's a winner, Alex. And they'll never see him coming.
CULLEN: I'm gonna make some very tough phone calls. Then I'm gonna take a pill and try to get some sleep. My place. Eight A.M. tomorrow. Alone. And you better be every fucking inch as good as you think you are.
MARY ANN: ( whispering ) This is three thousand dollars.
JACKIE: Know what you need to do? Buy it. Wear it once. And then throw it away. That'll loosen you up.
DIANA: I say spend it all. If you're never gonna see your husband, you might as well have a relationship with his money. I swear, if he wasn't afraid of me shooting my mouth off, Eddie would've put a cellulite clause in the pre-nup.
JACKIE: Dr. Robert, I'm telling you, he's the miracle man. You've seen my new tits, I mean who does it better than that?
DIANA: It's not my tits I'm worried
JACKIE: Real or not? They look real. They move real.
MARY ANN: ( trapped there ) Must be real.
JACKIE: Feel them. Go ahead. That's the ultimate test.
JACKIE: ( smiling ) Feel real?
MARY ANN: ( pulling away ) Absolutely. Real.
JACKIE: ( backing away ) Dr. Robert. When you're ready.
JACKIE: What do you think?
KEVIN: . first thing I need this ASAP I want articles, clippings, TV interviews, I want everything you can get on Alex Cullen.
HEATH: ( walking off ) You better get a semi truck.
CHRISTABELLA: Enjoying yourself?
KEVIN: ( caught ) Sorry. I'm just.
CHRISTABELLA: Just what? Looking?
KEVIN: Congratulations on Cullen.
CHRISTABELLA: Congratulations on Cullen.
KEVIN: Thank you.
CHRISTABELLA: What an incredible situation, even if you lose you become a star.
KEVIN: What if I win?
CHRISTABELLA: If you win. If you win it's everything.
KEVIN: Any advice?
CHRISTABELLA: Cullen is a pig. He's a pig beyond reasonable doubt. I suggest you keep him as far away from the jury as possible.
KEVIN: I'll keep it in mind.
CHRISTABELLA: ( leans in, You can look all you want, but I don't fuck married men.
KEVIN: What a relief. I was starting to think you were perfect.
PAM: Your wife is on the phone. She sounds upset.
MARY ANN: I don't care if they can hear me! I don't care! I don't like it here. And these women, my God. I mean, I'm seeing things for crissake!
KEVIN: You just left them in the store?
MARY ANN: Look, calm down, all right? Listen to me. Mare? First, you do this radical thing with your hair.
KEVIN: Look, calm down, all right? Listen to me. Mare? First, you do this radical thing with your hair.
MARY ANN: You hate it.
KEVIN: Stop. I think it's fine. But I also think it's traumatic. You've got the pressure of fitting in with new friends, a new place. add three bottles of wine and
MARY ANN: No! It wasn't the wine. It wasn't the wine or my hair or talking to Kathy, because I know that's what you're gonna say
KEVIN: What about Kathy?
MARY ANN: What about her? She's pregnant Oh, and that's got nothing to do with it.
KEVIN: Oh, and that's got nothing to do with it.
MARY ANN: Kevin, I never see you anymore. Now that you've got this big case, it's just only gonna get worse. I don't know anybody here. These women scare the living shit out of me. If you can believe it, I'm actually looking forward to having your mother come and visit.
KEVIN: What about the apartment?
MARY ANN: Exactly! You just go out you buy a few new suits and you're fine. I've got this whole place to fill up and I know we have all this money and it's supposed to be fun, but it isn't! It's like a test! The whole thing is like one big test! I'm lonely.
KEVIN: Let's make a baby.
MARY ANN: Don't tease me.
KEVIN: I wouldn't do that. Unless you You hate my hair, don't you?
MARY ANN: You hate my hair, don't you?
MARY ANN: Kevin looks like he's been shot. In the balls.
MARY ANN: Where are you?
KEVIN: Right here.
KEVIN: . because it needs to be clear, Mr. Cullen, because I need to understand exactly what happened you're standing there you look down there's the gun
CULLEN: I don't know why I picked it up it was before I saw Elucinda's body and then, I mean we've been over this.
KEVIN: You kneeled down to pick it up?
CULLEN: You work late. You come home. You walk in. Everybody's dead. It's not something you plan for.
KEVIN: Back up. Two prints by the gun. Right knee. Right hand. It's a strange move you must've made to pick it up.
CULLEN: The blood, I don't know, maybe I was trying to avoid the blood.
KEVIN: I'm trying to picture it. Your hand came from inside and
CULLEN: You want to see? Here. I'll fucking show you.
CULLEN: ( standing ) Okay? Clear? Got it?
KEVIN: Whose gun is that, Alex?
CULLEN: It's mine.
KEVIN: Are you out of your mind? You're charged in a triple homicide, you're walking around with a forty-five?
CULLEN: I've had nine death threats.
KEVIN: Give it over. Now. Gimme the I gotta protect myself.
CULLEN: I gotta protect myself.
KEVIN: That's my job. When the case is over you can have it back. This is a dealbreaker, Alex.
KEVIN: Okay. Let's wrap it up.
CULLEN: So what's next?
KEVIN: We need to talk to your assistant.
CULLEN: Call her.
KEVIN: You feel confident she'll back you on the time.
CULLEN: Melissa, yeah. She's okay. She's a real straight arrow.
KEVIN: So we're going to talk to her and you're not going to talk to anybody. Okay?
CULLEN: ( with a smile ) No comment.
MELISSA: Would my babysitter have to We need her to establish the time you returned home.
KEVIN: We need her to establish the time you returned home.
MELISSA: She doesn't have her green card is why I ask. I don't want her to get in trouble.
KEVIN: Tell you what, Melissa, let's talk to her first. See where she stands and take it from there.
PAM: I'll make sure Melissa gets down to the car.
MELISSA: Mr. Cullen didn't kill those That's why we're all working so
KEVIN: That's why we're all working so
BARZOON: ( directing traffic ) Okay, Excelsior Insurance, who's handling that? ( a hand goes up ) All this has to go. Guatemala, Sudan, Cyprus. ( cheerleading ) Let's stay organized here. ( across the room ) Martin, no. Devada Holdings. That's all you're doing. Believe me, it'll take all night.
KEVIN: I thought I was the only one working late.
BARZOON: So did we.
KEVIN: Good news. We just wrapped up with Cullen's assistant. She looks like a great alibi.
BARZOON: What a pleasant surprise.
KEVIN: But it looks like you have your hands full.
BARZOON: Just a little housekeeping. If they ask, you never saw this.
KEVIN: Who would ask?
BARZOON: Who's that?
KEVIN: Who's that?
BARZOON: Justice Department. Weaver You don't know about Weaver?
KEVIN: How nice for you.
BARZOON: How nice for you.
MILTON: The night is young. Title fight. Ringside.
KEVIN: I'd have to call Mary Ann.
MILTON: Do it on the way.
BARZOON: ( am I here? ) You get my message?
MILTON: You write beautifully, Eddie.
BARZOON: We need to talk.
MILTON: I hope so.
BARZOON: I hope so.
KEVIN: So what's this Weaver Commission?
MILTON: I don't micro-manage. You find the talent and then you delegate. Who knows what the hell Eddie's up to. He's got a lotta fingers in a lotta pies.
BIG GUY: What the fuck you looking at? You fucking deaf or something?
MILTON: No. I can hear you just fine.
BIG GUY: Good, 'cause I want you should get your skinny little ass somewhere down the fucking car away from me.
MILTON: ( stare-down ) I'm not going anywhere.
KEVIN: Oh, shit.
MILTON: ( perfect Spanish ) Maricela, the moment you left the apartment she was upstairs with Carlos. They're on the pipe right now, my friend. They're in the kitchen splitting a jumbo and then he's going to fuck her in the ass, right on your bed, and she's going to like it.
BIG GUY: Como.? How do you.?
MILTON: ( still Spanish ) Do yourself a favor and put that knife where it belongs.
KEVIN: What did you say to him?
MILTON: I told him if he didn't leave us alone, you were going to kick all three of their asses.
KEVIN: ( on his feet ) Get up! Get up, dammit! C'mon!
DON KING: Look at this sorry shit, you got better seats than me.
MILTON: You need a better lawyer.
DON KING: Nobody better than you, Johnny.
MILTON: Hang on a second. Meet my new heavyweight. Kevin
KEVIN: And say what? He's the senior partner at the Mare, you're really starting to piss me off Yes. I'm having one cigarette. You want me to lie? One cigarette after seven months is not That's exactly what I'm saying. Go to bed. I have no idea. I told you, he never sleeps. Mare. Stop. The guy pays our bills. The food, the heat, the rent on that enormous fucking apartment we live in. I live there, too! Can I help you?
DANCER: Can I help you?
MARY ANN: Silence. And then, the sound of a BABY CRYING.
MARY ANN: How.? What are you.?
MARY ANN: You poor thing.
MARY ANN: How did you. how did you get Are you okay? Look at you. hello. hello. Where's your mommy?
MARY ANN: What are you playing with? What do you have there?
MARY ANN: . Oh, God, no.
MARY ANN: . no. please, God, no
JACKIE: Took two seconals to get her out.
KEVIN: ( hung-over and guilty ) Milton got his hooks into me.
HEATH: Relax. We've all been there.
JACKIE: Leave her with me. Let her sleep. She'll be out another five, six hours at least.
KEVIN: This transition, it's been really tough on her.
HEATH: We're gonna find some names for you. Doctors. Good people.
PAM: Caught me.
KEVIN: I've gotta find Cullen. We just got the prosecution discovery package.
PAM: That bad?
CHRISTABELLA: ( stepping out ) You'll spoil me for other men.
KEVIN: That's what they all say.
CHRISTABELLA: Heard he finally dragged you out the other night. Can't believe I missed it.
CULLEN: I get one supervised hour a week with my stepdaughter. This is it. You better have a great reason to call me out.
KEVIN: Your wife, the day she was killed, had lunch with a friend. She says and I quote: 'Alex is fucking around and I can prove it.'
CULLEN: Hearsay. Never gets in.
KEVIN: Wrong answer. Your prenuptial agreement is on file at the firm. The contract is null and void in the event of marital infidelity. You fuck around, she gets rich. That's a motive, Alex. What do I need to know?
CULLEN: Melissa. My assistant. She's not even that good a fuck.
KEVIN: And, on the night in question?
CULLEN: I was boning my assistant while my wife was getting shot.
KEVIN: I've got to re-interview Melissa.
CULLEN: Forget it. We're not telling that Juries want honesty. Fuck with that at your peril.
KEVIN: Juries want honesty. Fuck with that at your peril.
CULLEN: Allesandra. Wait.
KEVIN: Not now.
CULLEN: Not now.
THERAPIST: Time's up, Mr. Cullen.
CULLEN: Allesandra. Please.
PAPARAZZI: Kevin, hey, how's it going? Can we get a couple shots here? How about a thumbs-up here? What do you say?
MRS. LOMAX: What's he doing?
MARY ANN: Kevin's had his picture in the
KEVIN: Welcome to Babylon, Ma.
FEENEY: Sorry, Mr. Lomax, I thought we'd scared 'em all away.
MRS. LOMAX: Always did like to stick his nose in a camera.
FEENEY: ( as they enter ) And how are you, Mrs. Lomax? Did you have a fine dinner?
MRS. LOMAX: I surely did. Are you hungry?
FEENEY: No, I'm fine. Thank you.
MILTON: I was just telling the Moyez And is this your mother?
KEVIN: And is this your mother?
MILTON: And is this your mother?
KEVIN: Yes. Mom, this is.
MILTON: John Milton. Nice to meet you.
MRS. LOMAX: Alice Lomax. How do you do?
MILTON: Mary Ann. I think you've met Christabella, and this is Giselle who's just in from Paris.
KEVIN: Thanks for the champagne.
MILTON: You've very welcome. This isn't really your first visit to New York, is it?
KEVIN: ( after a moment )
GISELLE: Cette femme, elle est la mere de l'homme dont vous m'avez parle?
MILTON: She can't believe you're his mother. You've done one helluva job bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax. I'm sure it wasn't easy.
MRS. LOMAX: Mrs. Lomax has been staring, and now Milton meets her eyes as the elevator stops and the doors open.
MARY ANN: Nice to see you.
CHRISTABELLA: Have a lovely evening.
KEVIN: Mom, we're here.
MRS. LOMAX: Yes. Good night to you.
MILTON: Kevin, hang on. How's Cullen. Everything on beam?
KEVIN: That's a long conversation.
MILTON: ( hush hush ) Why don't you come on up?
KEVIN: Milton smiles. Christabella smiles. Giselle smiles.
KEVIN: Let's talk tomorrow.
MILTON: You sure?
MARY ANN: That what you're doing when you're working late?
KEVIN: What are we talking about?
MARY ANN: You know exactly what I'm talking That's ridiculous.
KEVIN: That's ridiculous.
MARY ANN: I'm going to bed. 'Night, Alice.
MRS. LOMAX: Mary Ann exits.
MRS. LOMAX: I'm worried about her. You shouldn't fight like that.
KEVIN: That's not a fight, Ma, it's marriage. Not exactly your area of expertise.
MRS. LOMAX: Are you happy here?
KEVIN: MRS. LOMAX
MRS. LOMAX: Are you happy here?
KEVIN: You're kidding, right? Am I happy? Every now and then I look around and I think my mama must be praying awful hard for me, 'cause I died and went to heaven. Am I happy?
MRS. LOMAX: You were always running somewhere.
KEVIN: I guess I finally got there. Look, I'm sorry about being so busy this week. Maybe Saturday I can get some time off and.
MRS. LOMAX: Don't worry on it. I love you more than anything in the whole world. You know that, don't you?
KEVIN: I love you too, Ma.
KEVIN: The door to the guest room is open. He looks in
KEVIN: Mom? Ma, what are you doing?
MRS. LOMAX: I'm going home, Kevin.
KEVIN: What? What are you talking about?
MRS. LOMAX: I don't feel right.
KEVIN: You just got here. Look, I'm late and I just got my teeth kicked in on the front page, so I gotta run. We'll talk later.
MRS. LOMAX: I have to go, Kevin. I miss my Ma, this is New York, there must be twenty-thousand goddamn churches. Take your pick.
KEVIN: Ma, this is New York, there must be twenty-thousand goddamn churches. Take your pick.
MRS. LOMAX: You need to do a better job with Mary Ann. She's not well. This place isn't good for her.
KEVIN: So stay. Take care of her if you're so concerned! Help me out.
MRS. LOMAX: I'll take her home if you let me.
KEVIN: This is home. You understand? This is where we live! I'm not going back to Gainesville. 'Wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to It's a little early for scripture. I'm going to work. You can do whatever you want.
MRS. LOMAX: 'Wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to It's a little early for scripture. I'm going to work. You can do whatever you want.
KEVIN: It's a little early for scripture. I'm going to work. You can do whatever you want.
MELISSA: I can't do it. It's one thing to have an affair with your boss, it's another to have to tell the world in a murder case.
KEVIN: We have to bring it out, Melissa.
MELISSA: My ex-husband would have a field day with this.
KEVIN: A man's life is at stake. You're our whole case.
WEAVER: . there is nothing vague or exploratory about this subpoena request, Your Honor. We're specifically asking for any and all documents relating to Devada Holdings. It's taken six months and seventeen separate motions and we still don't know who's responsible here. We've got a paper trail here that seems to stretch into eternity!
WOMAN JUDGE: Mr. Barzoon?
BARZOON: Can't turn over what you don't have, Your Honor. We've been conducting a comprehensive search of our records and I'm sorry to say it's a great deal less than Mr. Weaver would suggest.
WEAVER: Your Honor, this is outrageous. We need to get in there and seize these documents before there's nothing left!
BARZOON: Your Honor, it's exactly these types of insulting accusations
WOMAN JUDGE: Enough. Both of you. Put it on paper. I'll read it.
WEAVER: Your Honor.
BARZOON: Forget about lunch. This guy Weaver is running me ragged.
REPORTER: Kevin. Nancy Osborne, Metro News. How are you?

KEVIN: ( cutting her off ) Mr. Cullen is innocent. He's not going anywhere. He's been released on a two million dollar bond. He looks forward to having his day in court. Thank you.
REPORTER: Kevin, is there any truth to
KEVIN: I'm in the middle of a meeting. Call my office. Schedule an interview. Or else forget it.
KEVIN: I'm picking a jury tomorrow.
BARZOON: You're good at that.
KEVIN: You're not gonna have time to help me on Cullen, are you?
BARZOON: Just then, Weaver comes rumbling past
WEAVER: Devada Holdings, Eddie. Look in your rearview window, I'm right behind you.
REPORTER #2: Kevin, Chuck Higgery, Action News. Have you spoken with Alex Cullen concerning the D.A.'s report.
REPORTER #3: Kevin, just a statement
BARZOON: ( backing away ) Gotta go.
MARY ANN: I dreamt about this. Right here. It's not a dream if it's true.
KEVIN: Tell me this is the medication.
MARY ANN: You won't stay with me now.
KEVIN: Look, let's get you undressed and in the tub. Okay?
MARY ANN: You won't stay. I know you. You'll leave me now for sure. Okay. I'm confused. Why? What is it now? What the fuck is it today, Mare? I swear to God, I'm calling this doctor, I'm gonna find out what the hell they're giving you.
KEVIN: Okay. I'm confused. Why? What is it now? What the fuck is it today, Mare? I swear to God, I'm calling this doctor, I'm gonna find out what the hell they're giving you.
MARY ANN: They took my ovaries. I told you! My sisters have seven children between them. My mother had Derek when she was forty-five. You could set a clock by my periods.
KEVIN: What are you talking about?
MARY ANN: I can't have children!
KEVIN: Says who?
MARY ANN: The doctor! The other doctor. I was there today. Non-specific ovarian failure.
KEVIN: That's ridiculous.
MARY ANN: ( grabbing his arm ) I know you. You'll leave me.
KEVIN: Mary Ann.
MARY ANN: It's these monsters, Kevin. I dreamt this.
KEVIN: Uh huh. For sleep. And she can take that during the day? No, she won't be driving. I'm gonna have the pharmacy call you right back. Thanks. He thinks, he's not sure, he thinks it could be some kind of hormonal imbalance.
MILTON: I'm taking you off the case.
KEVIN: I want you to drop this case.
MILTON: I want you to drop this case.
KEVIN: This case? Cullen? John, I've got a jury showing up this morning.
MILTON: Do you love this woman?
KEVIN: Yes. Of course I do.
MILTON: Kevin, she's sick. Everyone will understand. I'll understand.
KEVIN: ( stunned ) What about Cullen?
MILTON: We'll find someone new. You consult. You live to fight another day.
KEVIN: I put together a great jury.
MILTON: It's a disappointment. We all have them. Embrace it. Use it. You move on.
KEVIN: Hang on, we gotta talk about What's to talk? It's your wife, man. And she's very sick. And that's gotta come first. Are you telling me the possibility of leaving the case has never crossed your mind?
MILTON: What's to talk? It's your wife, man. And she's very sick. And that's gotta come first. Are you telling me the possibility of leaving the case has never crossed your mind?
KEVIN: You know what scares me? I quit the case. She gets better. And I hate her for it. I don't want to resent her, John. I've got a winner here. I gotta nail this fucker down, do it fast, and put it behind me. Just get it done. Then put all my energy into her.
MILTON: I guess you have thought about it. I stand corrected.
BROYGO: . And when all that evidence is laid before you, when all these pieces weave together, you will conclude you will know that Alexander Cullen is guilty of murdering three people in cold blood with malice aforethought.
JUDGE POE: Mr. Lomax. We can break for lunch now, or you can do a stop and start.
KEVIN: If it's a choice, I'll go now. I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.
JUDGE POE: We just spent our morning listening to Mr. Broygo talk about his 'evidence'. What he neglected to tell you is what this case is really about. He left out the most important fact of all: Alex Cullen was somewhere else when these murders took place. Now, Alex Cullen has done a lot of things I don't like. He's been a terrible husband to all three of his wives. He's been a destructive force in the lives of his step-children. He's cheated the city. His partners. His employees. He's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fines over the years. I don't like those things. I don't expect you to like them. There will be other things during the course of this trial that you will hear about and like even less. But this isn't a popularity contest. It's a murder trial and Alex Cullen hasn't killed anybody.

CULLEN: What the fuck was that? Are you out of your fucking mind? They fucking hate me!
KEVIN: Listen to me like you've never listened to anybody before. I'm going to bust my ass to make sure they hate you. Because as long as you're out boning Melissa, you're not home killing your wife.
CULLEN: ( pause, as he warms Why didn't you tell me before?
KEVIN: Then it doesn't look spontaneous.
KEVIN: Let me put it this way, then: can you tell from a blood sample if the person were alive or dead?
TECHNICIAN: The victim? Of course not.
KEVIN: And there's a two hour window in which to place these murders.
TECHNICIAN: So, you've got absolutely no way to determine the condition of the victims when Alexander Cullen put his hand on that wall.
KEVIN: So, you've got absolutely no way to determine the condition of the victims when Alexander Cullen put his hand on that wall.
KEVIN: Saw you go in.
BARZOON: Saw you go in.
KEVIN: What's up?
BARZOON: ( cold )
KEVIN: It's not over yet.
BARZOON: I'm not talking about the trial.
KEVIN: What are you talking about?
BARZOON: How the fuck does your name get on the firm's charter?
KEVIN: Looks like it's been there for years. Now you're a partner? When did that happen? I am still the managing director of this firm. You want my job? Take me head on. Backdoor me one more time and I'll take your partnership papers and stuff 'em down your throat.

KEVIN: I don't know what you're talking about, but I sure as hell don't like your tone of voice.
BARZOON: You got a problem with documents, I suggest you put together one of your late-night shredding You think you're tough enough to run this firm? Fine. You tell Milton next time Weaver calls maybe I pick up the phone.
KEVIN: You got a problem with documents, I suggest you put together one of your late-night shredding You think you're tough enough to run this firm? Fine. You tell Milton next time Weaver calls maybe I pick up the phone.

MILTON: Was he drunk?
KEVIN: I doubt it. He was going running. What the hell was he talking Eddie's gotten himself into trouble again. And he wants me to save him. And I can't.
MILTON: Eddie's gotten himself into trouble again. And he wants me to save him. And I can't.
KEVIN: Why does he think I'm after his Do you have any experience with Not directly, no.

KEVIN: Not directly, no.
MILTON: You do now.
MILTON: Yes, it's me. Get Eddie Barzoon. Right away. He may be out running, so page him if you have to. It's an Looks like you could use a drink.
MARY ANN: Eddie Barzoon. I've nursed him through two divorces, a cocaine rehab, and a pregnant receptionist. God's creature, right?
MILTON: I'll tell you, Kevin, because I know you're into theology. When you've seen when you've represented when you've dealt with as many people as I have over the years, finally you say to yourself, 'God must've been awfully bored.'
OLD MAN: Gimme your watch.
BARZOON: ( standing now ) You want the watch, old man? Come and get it.
KEVIN: I'm gonna, I'm gonna go downstairs now. Put this stuff away. Ice cream's already melting.
KEVIN: You testified that the defendant called you at four-thirty to ask you to come to his office gym for the purposes of sex.
MELISSA: Mr. Cullen, though, he's not just your lover, is he? He's the boss.
KEVIN: Mr. Cullen, though, he's not just your lover, is he? He's the boss.
MELISSA: So two hours go by before you act on his request?
KEVIN: So two hours go by before you act on his request?
MELISSA: Yes, I went up at six-ten. I knew it was six-ten, they had weather coming on the news. I remember
KEVIN: Okay. Stop. This prosecutor is no fool. He's gonna change tempo, attitude, tone of voice he's gonna come out with questions you never thought of, just to screw you up. So what do we do?

KEVIN: Is he circumcised? You understand the question?
MELISSA: ( CONTINUED )
KEVIN: So is he cut or not?
MELISSA: Which is it?
KEVIN: Which is it?
KEVIN: You've been polishing his knob three times a week for six months and you don't know whether or not he's got foreskin?
MELISSA: ( total transformation ) I've had it up to here with this fucking game. Why don't you take your questions and shove 'em up your ass.
CHRISTABELLA: Oh, Kevin
KEVIN: What's happened?
CHRISTABELLA: Eddie Barzoon.
KEVIN: What about him?
CHRISTABELLA: He's dead. He was killed.

PAM: Kevin. Kevin, I'm sorry, but you're due in court in thirty
MELISSA: Are we through here, or what?
PAM: I'll bring Melissa down in the car, but you better get going.
MILTON: I want you to put Eddie aside. Let me worry about it. You gotta deal with Cullen now. Marshal your strength. Prioritize. Conserve your energy.
KEVIN: I can't put her on the stand.
MILTON: What choice do we have?
KEVIN: I know she's lying.
MILTON: Because she didn't answer you fast enough? Did she lie to you? No. She said nothing. The fact is, you'll never know.
KEVIN: He killed those people.
MILTON: You really believe that?
KEVIN: Cullen set me up. Melissa, the whole thing, I know it.
MILTON: Look, you gotta go with your gut.
KEVIN: That's your advice?
MILTON: I'll back you either way. Hey, you think I haven't lost before? We talked about this, Kevin. Pressure. Take a big whiff.
JUDGE POE: Mr. Lomax, you may call your next

KEVIN: MARY ANN ( coming apart for good )
MARY ANN: Then we talked. We talked for I haven't talked to anyone, really talked to anyone in such a long time. You have this whole life and all I have is me and he was so clear about it all.
KEVIN: Who let himself in?
MARY ANN: I came down here. I've just been sitting. I'm afraid to pray. I let him stay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kevin.
KEVIN: Did somebody hurt you?

MRS. LOMAX: I wish you'da let me help you.
KEVIN: Finish the story. Nineteen-sixty-four. You're in New York. There's a waiter in a Finish the story.
MRS. LOMAX: He talked to me. Nobody'd ever really talked to me before. Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away from home, somebody takes an interest. Working so hard, putting himself through school, I'd never met anybody like that. Knew the Bible, every word, just knew it by heart. Every meal, there he was, at my ear and I just. I didn't want that week to ever end. But it did. He came to say goodbye, it was late, and I started to cry and he said not to worry, 'Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.' And that just stopped me cold because we'd spent that whole day at Bible study reading Matthew Ten and there was just no way for him to know about that, so I was. I took it as a sign. I let him in. And then everything was different. He was cruel. He was so cruel and I was so ashamed, I thought I'd die.
MRS. LOMAX: I promised right there if God would let me back into His grace I would never leave again. I prayed there was a reason this terrible thing had happened. There had to be a reason. And there was. It was you. You were my blessing. You were reason enough to endure anything. How much I love you.
KEVIN: I want to hear you say it.
MRS. LOMAX: His face that night I knew it was him and the same time I was confused and you were so proud you'd come to New York and done all this on your own, I didn't have the heart to tell you
KEVIN: Say it.
MRS. LOMAX: ( desperate you wondered yourself the apartment, the money, all this attention, everything out of ( pause ) Milton. He's your father. ( there it is, Somehow he found us. Tracked you What do you mean?
KEVIN: MRS. LOMAX
MRS. LOMAX: What do you mean?
KEVIN: He's always been there. I know that now. Watching. Waiting. He's been playing us like a game. Jerking us around. Destroying Mary
MRS. LOMAX: What are you doing?
KEVIN: I gotta go.
MRS. LOMAX: No. let it alone! Stay with me. Forget about him! We can leave here. We can go home! We don't ever have to see him again!
KEVIN: I can't do that. You go home. Pray for Mary Ann.
MRS. LOMAX: Kevin, please. Honey! I love you!
PAM: There you are. Look at you. you're terrified. Not to worry. He'll take that fear away. You don't ever have to be frightened again. Go on, he's
MILTON: . I don't make things happen. Doesn't work like that. Free will it's like butterfly wings one touch and it never gets off the ground. I only set the stage. You pull your own strings.
KEVIN: What did you do to Mary Ann?
MILTON: A gun? In here?
KEVIN: What did you do to my wife?
MILTON: On a scale of one to ten, ten being the most depraved acts of sexual theater, one being an average Friday night run-through at the Lomax household, I'd say.
MILTON: Whoa. Got me! Damn! That's my boy. Step on up! Stay angry! Keep hold to that great fury! Hang on tight, Kevin, because it's the final fig leaf.
KEVIN: Who are you?
MILTON: Never lost a case. Why? Why? Because you're so fucking good? Yes. But why?
KEVIN: Because you're my father.
MILTON: Well, I'm a little more than that. Awful hot in that courtroom, wasn't it? 'What's the game plan, Kevin?' 'It was a nice run, Kevin. Had to close out someday.'
KEVIN: Who are you?
MILTON: I have so many names.
KEVIN: Call me Dad.
MILTON: Call me Dad.
KEVIN: Mary Ann, Barzoon, Weaver.
MILTON: Come on. You're not listening. Blaming me for Mary Ann? I hope you're kidding. You could've saved her any time you liked. She only wanted love. But you knew it wouldn't really work out, didn't you? Mary Ann in New York? Face it, you started looking to better- deal her the minute you got here.
KEVIN: That's a lie.
MILTON: Hey, it's not that you didn't care for her, it's just you were a little bit more involved with someone else. Yourself.
KEVIN: What the hell do you know about
MILTON: Bio-chemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate. Don't be such a fucking chump. There's only one real sickness in all of creation and that is self- delusion. I told you to take care of your wife that the world would understand. And you made a choice. 'You know what scares me, John? I leave the case, she gets better and I hate her for it.' You set me up. It's entrapment.
KEVIN: You set me up. It's entrapment.
MILTON: Who told you to pull out the stops for Mr. Gettys? And Moyez the direction you took Snake handlers, Popes and swamis all feeding at the same trough whose ideas were those? And then Cullen knowing he's guilty seeing those pictures putting that lying bitch on the stand. What did I say, Kevin? Maybe it was time to lose, right? You didn't think so.
KEVIN: That's my job. That's what I do!
MILTON: ( gotcha ) Vanity is definitely my favorite sin. Self love. It's so basic. What a drug. Cheap, all-natural, and right at your fingertips. Pride. That's where you're strongest. And believe me, I understand. Work for someone else? Hey, I couldn't hack it. 'Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.'
KEVIN: What do you want from me?
MILTON: What do I want? I want you to be
MILTON: I've had many children, Kevin. So many disappointments. Neurotic, indecisive wannabes. Over-eager, ham-handed butchers. Strung-out, priapic losers. And then there's you. Your mother, I'll tell you, she outstripped my wildest fantasy. That church she dragged you to? Every day? What training. What a challenge! It's awesome what you've done. How far you've come. Both of you. You and your sister.
MILTON: Half-sister to be exact.
CHRISTABELLA: What do you think, Kevin? What a scene, huh?
MILTON: What do you think, Kevin? What a scene, huh?
CHRISTABELLA: ( passing Kevin ) Don't let him scare you.
MILTON: Wait till you meet her mother.
KEVIN: It is a test, isn't it? The whole game, you sitting there, keeping No. That's the other guy. I don't judge anybody. As far as I'm concerned, everyone's a winner.
MILTON: No. That's the other guy. I don't judge anybody. As far as I'm concerned, everyone's a winner.
MILTON: I'm here, on the ground, my nose in it since the whole damn thing began. Why? Because I worship man himself. And it's my time now. Our time.
CHRISTABELLA: Anybody want a drink? I'm having a drink.
KEVIN: This is some pitch. You must need me pretty bad. What do you want?
MILTON: Eddie was right. Your name is on the partnership charter. I want you to take over the firm. You and your sister.
KEVIN: Is that it?
MILTON: ( letting his hand She's ovulating. Right now.
KEVIN: Your vanity is justified, Kevin, you're the seed to a new future. Your son will sit at the head of all tables. You hold a special place in the history of all things.
MILTON: Your vanity is justified, Kevin, you're the seed to a new future. Your son will sit at the head of all tables. You hold a special place in the history of all things.
KEVIN: You want a child.
MILTON: I want a family.
KEVIN: The Antichrist.
MILTON: But I have to volunteer.
KEVIN: But I have to volunteer.
MILTON: Free will. It's a bitch. I need a family. I command an ever larger presence on the board. I'm busy and I need some help. There's a plan here. I've been conserving my energy. Synergy. Prioritize. It's the millennium, Kevin. Title fight. Round twenty. I'm ready to work.
KEVIN: So what are you offering?
MILTON: Are we negotiating?
KEVIN: ( CONTINUED )
MILTON: What are you offering?
KEVIN: What are you offering?
MILTON: Everything. Anything. All of it! What am I offering? I'm offering bliss. Instant bliss. Bliss by remote control. Bliss on tap. That first line of cocaine. That walk into a strange girl's bedroom. The jury coming back in thirty- eight minutes. Freedom. Revolution! Viva la causa!
KEVIN: You're right, aren't you? About me. I mean, I made all the choices, didn't I? Gettys. Cullen. Mary Ann. I did kill her, didn't I?
MILTON: Don't be too hard on yourself.
CHRISTABELLA: It's done. Forget it. It's all for us now.
MILTON: God, she's just fucking stunning, isn't she?
KEVIN: You're right. I wanted to fuck her from the minute we met.
MILTON: Like that's wrong. Like there's anything wrong with that. That there could be laws preventing something so natural. That's our ticket in. Did you know there were more students in law school right now than lawyers walking the Earth?
MILTON: We're coming out, guns blazing. The two of you all of us acquittal after acquittal until the stench of it reaches so high into heaven it chokes the whole fucking lot of them! What we cannot legislate we will buy. What we cannot buy we will degrade. We will blow every fuse of enlightenment until it looks like a vandalized, neon sign! And while God is busy at his peephole as he deigns us with his disapproval as he lumbers around his empty kingdom like some overfed colonial governor as God sleeps late, we will win. We've got a winner here, kids!
KEVIN: In the Bible you lose. You're destined to lose.
MILTON: Consider the source.
CHRISTABELLA: Stop talking. Both of you. Kevin, please.
CHRISTABELLA: ( urgently now ) Kevin, really, please.
MILTON: She's right, my son. It's time to step up and take what's yours.
KEVIN: You're right. It's time.
MILTON: CUT TO:
MARY ANN: Honey, what are you doing? Are you okay?
BAILIFF: All rise for the honorable Justice Garson Deeds.
JUDGE: ( to Barbara ) You're still under oath, young ( to Kevin ) Your witness, Mr. Lomax.
KEVIN: Your Honor, I'm terribly sorry, but I can no longer represent my client. I need to be replaced as
REPORTER: Kevin! Hey! Listen, this story this is the one, pal this is the one you dream about
KEVIN: There is no story.
REPORTER: Bullshit. A lawyer with a crisis of conscience? You gotta be kidding. It's huge!

MARY ANN: Can they do that?
