DEEP COVER: Written by Michael Tolkin
SHOOTING DRAFT: EXT. CLEVELAND STREET - NIGHT ( 1970 ) Rain. Christmas lights. A rusted out '56 Lincoln rattles down the bleak boulevard. In it: JOE STEVENS, an angry, black man in his late 20's, beside him his 10-year-old son, JOE
JOE STEVENS: Your mother okay?
JOE STEVENS: ( firm, without irony ) Don't you do this shit, boy. Don't you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear
JOE STEVENS: ( continuing ) You hear me, goddam it?
JOE STEVENS: ( continuing; charged up ) What do you want for Christmas?
JOE STEVENS: ( light changes; he accelerates ) You don't know?? You gotta know what you want, boy, if you ever expect to get it.
JOE STEVENS: ( continuing ) Wait here. This won't take a minute.
STORE OWNER: ( enraged, almost to tears ) Fuckin' niggers. fuckin' niggers.
JOE STEVENS: looks at the money in his hand: two 20's, two 5's.
JOE STEVENS: Fifty bucks. fifty goddam bucks. I'm sorry.
CARVER: Officer Leland? You know the difference between a black man and
CARVER: ( continuing; pleasant smile ) Yeah, most niggers don't.
CARVER: ( continuing ) Nice to meet you.
CARVER: So, Winston, what's the difference between a black man and a nigger?
WINSTON: Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
CARVER: Thanks for coming in.
STEVENS: The nigger's the one who falls for your bullshit.
CARVER: Gerald Carver, United States District Attorney. Call me Gerry.
STEVENS: He ought to be wearing a sign.
CARVER: You can tell he's a cop?
STEVENS: He keeps looking for his back-up. Now, the other guy knows it, too.
CARVER: Then why's he taking him to the room?
STEVENS: ( why else? ) To rip him off.
STEVENS: ( continuing ) Too late.
TAFT: Oh, Bobby. Jesus, Jesus. Get an ambulance and back up. Who is he?
STEVENS: ( focussed on Taft ) Who is he?
CARVER: Charles Taft. LAPD Narcotics.
STEVENS: He's a good cop.
CARVER: He's a great cop. Two [names citation] and a [another citation]. As tough as they come and twice as honest.
STEVENS: But the cops aren't getting it done here, are they? Gotta try something
STEVENS: ( continuing ) Who's John Hull?
CARVER: You are. If you want to be. Most undercover guys don't know what they're doing because it's a day I need somebody who goes under and stays there; six months, a year, five years.
STEVENS: What does he have to do?
CARVER: Buy drugs. Sell drugs. Feed me He's a snitch.
STEVENS: He's a snitch.
CARVER: He's a drug dealer. A criminal. A scumbag. But for the right side. I want you to come to Los Angeles on loan to the Justice Department as a federal agent. Your experience there will be credited toward your seniority here. And you'll come back to Cleveland a P3 or higher.
STEVENS: ( uncomfortable ) I can't do that. I've got a wife and You're separated from your wife, she's filled for divorce. You see your kids every other weekend.
CARVER: You're separated from your wife, she's filled for divorce. You see your kids every other weekend.
STEVENS: ( almost a confession ) All my life I've stayed away from that stuff. I've never touched drugs.
CARVER: ( tolerant ) Come on, a little grass.?
STEVENS: Not grass. Not nothing. I never even had a drink. Never have, never will. You don't understand. I made a choice in my What's to understand? You saw your father killed when you were ten, and you decided you wouldn't be like I'm God, I know everything. You wanted to be a good boy, so you became a cop. Hiding out in uniform. That's why you got the hard-on for Taft.
CARVER: What's to understand? You saw your father killed when you were ten, and you decided you wouldn't be like I'm God, I know everything. You wanted to be a good boy, so you became a cop. Hiding out in uniform. That's why you got the hard-on for Taft.
STEVENS: It's not that simple.
CARVER: ( opening Joe's file; as if reluctantly ) I'll tell the truth, Joe. You're never going to be a Taft.
STEVENS: I don't believe that.
CARVER: ( looks at MMPI results ) You ever take a look at your psychological profile? You score almost like a criminal. ( reading ) "Resents authority."
STEVENS: I do not.
CARVER: ".Exaggerated moral standards, but with no underlying value system." Look at the anger, the repressed violence, it's almost off the scale.
STEVENS: Let me see that.
CARVER: Why'd you join the force?
STEVENS: ( awkward, but felt ) I wanted to be of use.
CARVER: Well, now you can be. You won't be Taft, but maybe you'll be something more. interesting. There's a man named Ramon Gallegos who supplies 60% of the cocaine to the West Coast. He's smart, smooth, and sufficiently elusive that we don't even have an adult photograph of him. However, his uncle is Hector Guzman, an important Latin American political figure. Gallegos uses Uncle's connections to get product into the country, and everyone we've sent after him has ended up like
STEVENS: Why would I be different?
CARVER: You already are, that's the point. You've got the ability and the personality to go underground and blend in completely. That's what the others couldn't. Some part of them showed. That's why they're dead. See, there's only one rule in this
CARVER: ( continuing ) Don't blow your cover.
STEVENS: ( calls to them ) Joe-J, Carmen.
STEVENS: What were you doing with those kids?
STEVENS: ( displeased ) Your mom lets you play with them?
STEVENS: I thought we talked about this. The older brother up there's got a sheet Lay off it. They're just kids.
TERRY: Lay off it. They're just kids.
TITO: Hey, Joe.
STEVENS: A moment of surprise, then he gets it. He looks to Terry. She gives a little shrug, refusing to be embarrassed.
STEVENS: They're real nice, honey. Is that a Daddy! It's a bunny.
CARMEN: ( exasperated ) Daddy! It's a bunny.
CARMEN: ( continuing ) I don't want you to go away, Daddy.
STEVENS: It's my work. I've got to.
STEVENS: ( continuing ) What happened to you there, baby?
CARMEN: Tito did it.
STEVENS: ( instantly outraged ) He hit you?! ( up in a fury ) God damn it, what's he doing touching her? I'm gonna.
TERRY: She was running behind his chair when he got up. It was an accident. A complete. total. accident.
BLONDE WOMAN: Television mostly. I was on "Sky King" twice, "Ramar of the Jungle." That was a silly show. The jungle was mostly flats.
BLONDE WOMAN: ( continuing ) You want my advice, I'd stay away from that bitch.
EDDIE: On the day of the King's castration, all the counts and no accounts were down on the deck with Georgia Tech taking turns in the back seat.
HULL: Whatta you got?
IVY: What the fuck I tell you about being
IVY: ( enjoying it, shouting ) Get down, motherfuckers!
CROWD: Who is he?. Why'd they shoot him?. Ivy did him, man. He's in the wrong fuckin' place. That poor boy. Get his beeper.
EDDIE: ( sadly ) He done done, ain't he?
BARTENDER: How's it going, John?
HULL: I'm in there. "Where's the Queen," said the King. "She's in bed with laryngitis." "Is that bastard still in town?. Fuck the Queen," said the King, and ten thousand knights straaaained at their Pina colada times two and a white
EDDIE: ( to himself ) "Where's the Queen," said the King. "She's in bed with laryngitis." "Is that bastard still in town?. Fuck the Queen," said the King, and ten thousand knights straaaained at their ( to the bartender ) Pina colada times two and a white
EDDIE: ( continuing ) How you doin', Dudley.
HULL: John, man, right.
EDDIE: John, man, right.
A TABLE: where he rejoins a white man, DAVID ELIAS ( 30s, slick, powerful ) and a well-dressed BLACK WOMAN ( mid-20s, good- looking ). She gets the wine. Elias rises to let her out. As the woman passes Hull on her way to the restrooms, their eyes meet: an instant of perfect chemistry. He's struck. Her features open, grow sensual for a moment, but then, as if seeing something she doesn't like, her eyes flick away, and she walks by as if he weren't there.
HULL: Eddie something. a motormouth. he supplies the street dealers. buys from him. David Elias. who apparently buys from a guy named Barbolla or something. But I haven't seen him.
CARVER: Barbosa, Felix.
HULL: There was also a woman, but she's not here. I saw a kid killed. Twelve, thirteen at the most. Turf war.
CARVER: Get to Elias. Then to Barbosa.
HULL: You can't rush this stuff.
CARVER: Rush it, please. I want art, John, not reality. Budget hearings start in April, and I need Gallegos by then. They won't give us funding for three ounce buys.
HULL: We're not just doing this for the funding, are we?
CARVER: Without funding, we aren't doing it at all.
EDDIE: My man, Dudley, he's so fud-ley.
HULL: Eddie, man, I need.
EDDIE: So what is it you need so bad, blood? Need, need, need??
HULL: A whole K, quick as you can get it.
EDDIE: ( impressed, a trace of envy ) Comin' in the world, Dudley.
HULL: ( winning grin ) All because of my man.
EDDIE: Give me a day.
EDDIE: ( continuing ) Stick around, let the bitch Hoover you, too. Only if you Clorox him first.
HULL: Only if you Clorox him first.
TAFT: ( cheerful, gregarious ) Eddie Shitface! Where you been, boy?
TAFT: ( continuing ) Eddie, I don't think I introduced you to my new partner, Michael Pleased to meet you, Mr. Shitface.
HERNANDEZ: Pleased to meet you, Mr. Shitface.
HERNANDEZ: You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney. You have the right to go back to Ontario for eight-to-ten on a second Oh, man, I can't go back in there, I just can't.
EDDIE: ( in several kinds of pain ) Oh, man, I can't go back in there, I just can't.
TAFT: ( soothing ) 'Course you can't, child, 'course you can't. That's why you're gonna start giving us some help.
ELIAS: Again. Three times four.
MIRANDA: Elias is not a sweet Daddy. It should make us uncomfortable to watch him push his daughter.
ELIAS: No. You're adding again, you have to multiply. Three and four is seven. Three times four is.
MIRANDA: Three times five.
ELIAS: Three times five.
NANCY: Can you get that?
MIRANDA: ( getting up; more about the answer than the door ) Damn it.
ELIAS: ( getting up; more about the answer than the door ) Damn it.
MIRANDA: Why can't I just use a calculator?
ELIAS: What are you doing here?
BARBOSA: We've got a problem, David.
ELIAS: Call me on the phone.
BARBOSA: Your friend Eddie just started bending over for the cops.
BARBOSA: ( continuing ) They busted him, and he's dealing to save his ass.
GOPHER: Which is how he'll lose the skinny little thing.
ELIAS: Did he give us up?
BARBOSA: Not yet, but he will if he has to, and eventually he'll have to.
ELIAS: I don't think he'd talk about us. He'd try not to.
BARBOSA: If we whack him, he definitely won't.
ELIAS: ( to Miranda ) Just a second. ( to Barbosa ) Not yet. Let me check on this, first.
BARBOSA: ( taunting ) Nobody said you had to do the dirty work, David. I'll take care of
ELIAS: Felix, if he's a problem, we'll kill him. I'll kill him myself.
ELIAS: ( continuing ) Nancy, get out of here.
NANCY: For you; it's Eddie.
BARBOSA: You got a tasty wife, David. No wonder you don't want us coming here.
ELIAS: ( warning him ) Don't talk about her that way.
GOPHER: He can't help it, David, it's his Eddie. Sure, man, what do you need?
ELIAS: ( into phone, chipper ) Eddie. Sure, man, what do you need?
EDDIE: David, this is John, John, David. Eddie, this is Eddie. Everybody ready?
HULL: ( to Elias ) So what's this, you want to meet me?
ELIAS: ( charming, touch of mockery ) I like to know the important
ELIAS: ( continuing ) You're taking a lot of weight for a guy we hardly know. Where're you moving this stuff, John? We haven't seen you around. We like to have a sense who your customers are.
HULL: Ah, come on, man, do Macy's tell the Gimbel motherfuckers?
ELIAS: ( beat; watches him ) Eddie, forget this guy, he's a cop.
ON HULL: He's blown it. He's been made. The crushing failure. He rallies himself to indignation.
HULL: What is this shit, Eddie? I thought you were the man.
EDDIE: Nobody's the fuckin' man. Go to your place. I'll call you.
TAFT: This is our collar?
TAFT: ( continuing ) Who is he?
HERNANDEZ: Some scumbag.
EDDIE: He's no cop, David. He's an animal. You see his eyes? You never see a cop with those eyes. I know this shit, man, you don't.
ELIAS: ( giving him an opening ) What's going on, Eddie?
EDDIE: Twenty-six thousand cash is what. We need it, David. We're behind.
ELIAS: ( a warning ) I want him to get it all, Eddie.
BELINDA: ( a crackhead ) Mr. Hull. Mr. Hull.
HULL: ( wearily ) What's happening, Belinda?
BELINDA: Now you know, Mr. Hull, I was to the welfare this afternoon, but the bus, you know what I'm saying?. the one bus, and then the other, and when I got there they'd gone and changed the time on me, without notification. They's supposed to give notification, ain't they? They said I got a thing in the mail, but I don't remember, I don't think they sent it, so now I'm off the welfare, plus I forgot to take James for his shot. for the school? Which otherwise they let him go. And he's gotta learn, he's gotta learn, don't he, Mr. Hull, you tell him, so's he can better hisself.
HULL: ( to James ) You had any food today, James?
JAMES: ( disclaiming any need ) I had Ding-Dongs.
HULL: ( sighs, gives him money ) You go to the Mexican place over there, and get the chicken tostada or the beef and bean burrito or both. And a milk.
JAMES: I don't like milk. I want a
HULL: ( an order ) You get the milk! And get something for your mother, too. ( to Belinda ) What do you want?
BELINDA: Now, Mr. Hull, if you just
HULL: ( to James ) Two tostadas, two burritos, two milks.
BELINDA: You now, I look out for my James best I can, Mr. Hull, but it's hard. Now you like the boy, don't you?
BELINDA: ( continuing ) I know you do. And I was thinkin' if you wanted to take care of him, that might be good for him. Give him a male figure to look up to.
HULL: Look, Belinda, I can't.
BELINDA: If you could just give me something for him. Say five thousand dollars. Or maybe four thousand. I couldn't give up my boy for less than four
HULL: It's me. I'm here. Where?. five
BELINDA: Or you could just give me a part
BELINDA: ( continuing ) Let me do somethin' for you, Mr. Hull. Let me do a little somethin' for you.
BLONDE WOMAN: No solicitin' in the halls. I told you that before.
BELINDA: ( spunkier than we've seen ) I ain't doin' shit. Bitch.
AMPLIFIED VOICE: This is the police. Remain inside the vehicle. Place your open hands against the windshield so that they are clearly visible.
HULL: ( a strategy ) Spread the floor, Dudley. ( rap sound effects with rhythmic head spasms ) A-ga, a-ga, a-ga, a-ga.
EDDIE: ( a strategy ) Spread the floor, Dudley. ( rap sound effects with rhythmic head spasms ) A-ga, a-ga, a-ga, a-ga.
HULL: running. Police and SIRENS pursuing. He hurls the Fed Ex envelope into a dumpster. HELICOPTER light sweeps over him. As he cuts around a building, Taft opens a car door right into his face. Hull goes down hard.
TAFT: ( into car radio ) Thank you kindly.
TAFT: ( continuing ) How you doin', child?.
HULL: ( barely audible ) ( briefly puzzled ) Me? Of course, it's me. You know me?
TAFT: ( briefly puzzled ) Me? Of course, it's me. You know me?
TAFT: ( continuing ) Hurts, huh?
TAFT: ( continuing ) Here, I want to show you something. You have kids?
TAFT: ( continuing ) These are mine. Aren't they the most beautiful children you ever saw?
TAFT: ( continuing ) Yeah, I know, they kind of leave you speechless. So let me ask, if someone put a gun to your baby's head, wouldn't you kill him if you could?
TAFT: ( continuing ) Me, too. And you're the bastard with the gun.
HULL: ( hoarse; his first words ) You know the difference between a nigger and a black man?
TAFT: Don't jive me, boy.
HULL: The nigger's the one covers Whitey's ass by puttin' the brothers in jail.
TAFT: You ain't my brother.
PUBLIC DEFENDER: Hi, I'm Shelley Weissbrod. This is only an arraignment, a preliminary hearing, but if you don't have money for an attorney, the Public Defender's office can.
BAILIFF: You've got counsel. Over there.
HULL: You're a lawyer??
ELIAS: I'm your lawyer.
HULL: Who hired you?
ELIAS: ( smiles ) It's pro bono. If you don't want me, there's Shelley. She's good. She just can't provide special services.
HULL: Like what?
ELIAS: Getting your case called first.
ELIAS: ( continuing ) Your Honor, I believe the preliminary police toxicology report will show that the substance seized from my client was Mannitol, a baby laxative. We move for immediate dismissal.
ELIAS: ( continuing; to Hull ) We're out of here, Dude.
TAFT: ( to Hull, amused ) Baby laxative, they sold you some bad shit.
DRUNKEN PRISONER: ( to Hull ) You have a constipated baby, and you're in jail? What kind of a father are you?
TAFT: A father who don't know his own children, ain't that right?
HULL: ( under his breath ) You sold me Mannitol, motherfucker.
ELIAS: ( under his ) If it hadn't been, asshole, you'd be in jail right now. Come on, I want you to meet some people.
EDDIE: Dudley, Dudley, Fo-Fudley.
ELIAS: Surprised to see him, Eddie?
ELIAS: ( continuing ) John got busted and kept his mouth shut. Can't say that for everybody, can we?
EDDIE: What are you saying? Are you saying me? Are you saying something about Tell the truth, Eddie. Be honorable. It's all you got left.
GOPHER: Tell the truth, Eddie. Be honorable. It's all you got left.
EDDIE: Shut up, you little faggot.
ELIAS: The cops made you give them somebody. We know it.
EDDIE: All right, so what? I mean, so what, man? You got the money. Twenty-six G. Twenty-six, David. Count it.
ELIAS: Next time you might trade us.
EDDIE: ( turns to Barbosa ) Never, Felix, never. Come on, man, you know I'd never.
BARBOSA: ( softly ) I know you never will.
EDDIE: Felix, no. Don't be. I'm worth money to you. Let me give you money.
BARBOSA: Why? You don't owe me anything.
EDDIE: Another twenty-six grand. Just to show you. Fifty.
BARBOSA: Why not a hundred?
EDDIE: ( that's so much ) A hundred??? Felix.
EDDIE: ( continuing ) Okay, a hundred.
BARBOSA: Give it.
EDDIE: Tomorrow. Twenty-four hours.
BARBOSA: Now. Ten seconds.
EDDIE: Felix, I need time. I
BARBOSA: One. two.
EDDIE: I don't have it right now. But I can
GOPHER: ( sadly ) Then goodbye, Eddie. I forgive you for what you said to me.
EDDIE: ( pleading ) Twelve hours. Tomorrow morning.
BARBOSA: Six. seven. You want to do it, David?
BARBOSA: ( continuing ) Piece of shit!
EDDIE: grabs the first thing he lays eyes on, a tiny snail fork and plunges it into Barbosa's neck. As if it were a fly bite, Barbosa flings the table aside and, with a long knife already in his hand, guts Eddie from groin to breast bone. Eddie falls like a suddenly emptied Elias can't help gasping. Hull looks away, hiding his horror. Barbosa rips the fork out of his neck and hurls it at the Elias stares at Eddie's body, transfixed. Horrified, fascinated, afraid, in awe. Barbosa turns to Hull.
BARBOSA: Piece of shit!
BARBOSA: ( continuing ) What'd you think?
HULL: At least it was clean.
BARBOSA: ( pleased, to Elias ) What about you, bar mitzvah body? First time you saw somebody die?
ELIAS: ( eyes fixed on the body ) ( catching breath ) At camp. when I was fourteen. a friend of mine was water skiing. The motorboat ran him over. A junior counsellor was driving.
BARBOSA: You should kill a man some day, David, it's liberating. Summer camp. I'm in business with somebody who went to summer camp.
ELIAS: Eddie, man. He was always nice to my daughter.
HULL: How'd a guy like you get into this?
ELIAS: The way most drug lawyers do: clients paid me in product, and I had to move it. Soon I was doing more dealing than law. But this was '83, '84, there was so much money we thought it would never end.
HULL: Yeah. And now.?
ELIAS: The road gets rougher. Cocaine's a dying business.
HULL: Then what are we doing here?
ELIAS: People are always going to want to get high. Every society has ways to alter consciousness.
HULL: Because they can't bear reality.
ELIAS: ( smiles ) We all need our delusions, only the means change: psychedelics, opiates, prayer, orgies, human sacrifice.
HULL: What's next?
HULL: ( continuing ) Why aren't you selling it?
ELIAS: I know how to make it and market it. But I need capital. That's the only reason I'm hanging out with an asshole like Barbosa. And because I can't get to the big Who are the big guys?
HULL: Who are the big guys?
ELIAS: Gallegos, et cetera.
HULL: ( reacts to the name ) Why can't you get to them?
ELIAS: What do you care?
ELIAS: ( continuing ) Anyway, designer drugs have a bad name: ice, ecstasy, tar there's a limited market for Parkinson's disease. But what about completely safe, almost legal, terrific shit you can go to work on and do your job better than you ever did it Sounds like a dream.
HULL: Sounds like a dream.
ELIAS: ( closing the subject ) In dreams begin responsibilities.
HULL: Tell me about this new shit.
ELIAS: Some other time, John, when we know each other better. Hey, bunnela. Five times two.
MIRANDA: It's too early. Don't bother me.
MIRANDA: ( continuing; head in her father's chest )
MIRANDA: ( continuing ) Oh, yeah. Ten. Who's he?
ELIAS: That's my friend, John. This is Hi, Miranda.
HULL: Hi, Miranda.
NANCY: Come on, honey.
ELIAS: Nancy, this is John.
ELIAS: ( continuing; on Nancy's chilliness ) That's not about you. It's, she's. judgmental about what I do.
HULL: That's more than I bought.
ELIAS: Half we owe you. The other half's on consignment. A token of our esteem.
HULL: You're having trouble moving it.
HULL: ( continuing ) Make me your partner. I'll help you get your capital.
ELIAS: I don't need a partner. I need a
CARVER: I can't buy this much shit. I haven't got it in the budget.
HULL: What am I supposed to do with it?
CARVER: You're a drug dealer, John. Deal
HULL: You know how this goes, Gerry. It won't stop here. You know what they're going to ask me to do pretty soon, to prove I'm down. What am I supposed to do then?
CARVER: Don't blow your Carver.
HULL: You can't back down with them. You've got to project strength, from inside, you know?
HULL: As soon as the woman's gone. He goes over to the Dealer, slaps his head, slaps it again. Under the MUSIC:
DEALER: ( hurt, confused ) What'd you do that for?
HULL: ( walking off ) 'Cause I can, motherfucker, 'cause I
HULL: .Touch her again, motherfuckers, I'm gonna mess you up.
HULL: Is David Elias here?
ELIAS: Jacqueline, ho-ney.
ELIAS: ( continuing ) "Who's making love to your old lady. while you're out make love.?" ( cheerful ) How come I like balling black chicks so much?
HULL: 'Cause you're a racist asshole. You feel like you're fucking a slave, and it gets you off.
ELIAS: Oh, don't mau mau me with the Malcolm X shit. Tell me you're not chasin' white pussy every chance you get.
HULL: I don't dig white women. Even if I did, it wouldn't mean the same thing.
ELIAS: Sure, it'd be the slave fucking the master. Hegel talks about it. Just like me, but the other way around.
HULL: Fuck Hegel. Who the fuck is Hegel? Some smart-ass kike that talks
ELIAS: Everybody digs the other, John. They dig their own, and they dig the other.
HULL: Does your wife dig black guys, David? Did she fuck Eddie? Does she want to fuck me?
ELIAS: ( mock-terrified ) Ooo. you mean with that great big purple dick of yours? I hope not. She'd never be impressed with my little thing again.
HULL: You think what impresses her now is your dick?
ELIAS: ( musing ) What does impress her?
ELIAS: Betty, this is John, my new associate.
MCCUTCHEON: Your new Eddie. I hear the old one wore out.
ELIAS: Factory recall. John's going to be a good customer. He does a lot of wash. So how's this place work?
HULL: So how's this place work?
ELIAS: Betty wires the money to a store in Aruba in payment for things they never sent her. They deposit the money in a bank there that turns around and loans her money she never has to repay. That way it doesn't turn up as income for the IRS. Welcome to the laundromat.
MCCUTCHEON: David, you talk too much.
ELIAS: She doesn't trust you.
HULL: How much is this?
MCCUTCHEON: More than you can afford.
HULL: I'll take it.
ELIAS: By all means.
MCCUTCHEON: ( offering him the straw ) Come on, Eddie 2. you're up.
HULL: No, thanks. Who is he, my mother?
MCCUTCHEON: Who is he, my mother?
HULL: ( smiles ) Never have, never will.
MCCUTCHEON: ( taunting Hull ) Oooh. Cocaine, I love it and I hate it and I love it. The disease is the cure.
MCCUTCHEON: ( continuing ) Don't look at me. Elias, tell him not to look at me. I don't like the
ELIAS: ( sniffling ) John's an ascetic Negro; he wants to make sure you know he's not a jungle Watch your mouth, David.
HULL: Watch your mouth, David.
ELIAS: But he's got another side. You should seen him on the street the other day with these two USC kids. Do the spade bit for her, John. I'm gonna mess you up, muthafugga. Don't call me a spade. And don't tell me to play black.
HULL: Don't call me a spade. And don't tell me to play black.
ELIAS: ( hurt, disappointed ) Come on, John, you do it so well. ( falling into it ) Ah ain't playin', muthafucka. Ah ain't playin'.
ELIAS: ( continuing ) Don't fuckin' dis me, muthafucka. Fucka. fucka. fucka a. fucka b. fuck b-hive. fucka, fucka,
HULL: Say it again, and I'll kill you.
MCCUTCHEON: Grow up, assholes!
DEALER: .The guy ripped me off, man, so I don't got the money, I don't got the stuff and
HULL: ( eyes on street ) You gotta pay anyway.
DEALER: Oh, but, man.
HULL: Hull glances up: Bijoux is selling on the next corner. The Range Rover passes the Trans Am. Ivy leans out. Hull flings open the Trans Am door, throwing the Dealer to the ground. He jumps from the car:
HULL: ( continuing )
ELIAS: It wasn't your fault. What could you have done?
HULL: She worked for me. I'm supposed to protect her.
ELIAS: We have to kill him.
ELIAS: ( continuing ) Or we lose all authority with the other dealers. And one of them'll kill you.
ELIAS: ( continuing ) You've got to assert now, or you're
ELIAS: ( continuing ) And if we kill Ivy, we control this whole territory.
HULL: That guy who works for Barbosa can do it, Chino.
ELIAS: No. If we use Chino, it's Barbosa who's asserting. It'll be Barbosa's It's gotta be us.
HULL: And if it's us, it's gotta be you.
ELIAS: And if it's us, it's gotta be you.
HULL: ( to himself ) Don't blow your cover.
ELIAS: If I do this, we're partners. Equal partners on everything.
HULL: If I do this, we're partners. Equal partners on everything.
HULL: ( continuing ) Let's go.
ELIAS: ( afraid )
HULL: Go wait around back.
ELIAS: I want to see you in that alley.
CIRCULAR BALCONY: that overlooks the dance floor. On stage: a RAP ACT with its throbbing beat and below Hull a sea of dancers. Hull circles the balcony. It isn't hard to pick out Ivy he's all in red, dancing with the woman we saw him with in the Range Rover the first time. Hull reaches the steps again and starts down, keeping his eye on Ivy. The number ends. In the pause before the next one, Ivy can be seen excusing himself, heading toward the rear of the club. The next number begins. People dance. Hull pushes his way through the dancers to.
IVY: What're you looking at?
IVY: ( continuing ) You want to suck it, bitch? ( offers his dick ) Or drink it? ( continuing; recognizing him ) Oh, I know you. You're the bitch whose whore I wasted tonight, ain't
IVY: ( continuing; recognizing him ) Oh, I know you. You're the bitch whose whore I wasted tonight, ain't
IVY: ( continuing ) I gotta take care of you, too, huh?
HULL: .Carmen, it's me. It's Daddy.
CARMEN: HULL ( V.O. ) ( through phone )
CARMEN: HULL ( V.O. )
CARMEN: ( thrilled ) I miss you, too, Daddy.
VOICE: ( young, nasal, too smart ) The maze leads in two directions. At one end the rat can obtain a food pellet. At the other. ( pointer indicates each end ) .it receives electrical stimulus to a very specific area of the
VOICE: ( continuing ) This rat, like 86% of the others in the experiment, chose the electrical stimulus repeatedly and exclusively. It continued to do so until it died of malnutrition.
CAL TECH: This is an addictive amphetamine with time-space distortion, delusions of grandeur or maybe they're real tending to be impulsive, sometimes violent behavior. Psychotropic adaptation for late monopoly capitalism. It's illegal, and you can buy it on any street corner.
CAL TECH: ( continuing ) This increases energy, attention, cognitive powers, yet with a smooth, almost opiate-like emotional surface. Ideal for the post-political, post- rationalist global marketplace and 24 hour lifestyles. It's completely legal and can only get it here, in my lab.
ELIAS: ( to Hull, proudly ) Randy's a genius. His professor told him he could win the Nobel prize.
CAL TECH: Nobel prizes are for wussies.
HULL: What does this shit do to you?
CAL TECH: I'm on it now. It's like cocaine only better. Want some?
HULL: I don't take drugs.
CAL TECH: ( unoffended ) Your mistake. This is designed for the top end of the market. For people who want to master reality, not avoid it. Because it's synthetic, you don't grow it, refine it, or best of all import it.
ELIAS: What would it take to manufacture this stuff in quantity?
CAL TECH: With a million dollars, I could produce enough for a limited market at about two bucks a pop. But then with five million, or better yet ten, the cost would drop to thirty cents, and we'd have enough for the whole world.
ELIAS: I'm going to put two hundred fifty thousand into your corporate account. You cheat me, Randy, I'll use your bladder for a bagpipe. We're going to put Barbosa out of
CARVER: ( dismissive ) Synthetic shit?? Sounds like a 20/20
CARVER: ( continuing ) So, what was it like?
HULL: ( still looking out ) What was what like?
CARVER: Popping Ivy.
HULL: You knew.
CARVER: I'm God, remember?
HULL: ( looks back out ) Then you should know how it was.
CARVER: You didn't clear it with me. You're getting independent. That's good.
CARVER: ( continuing ) How're we coming on Gallegos?
HULL: He supplies Barbosa. To get to him we'll have to take quantity.
CARVER: Then you've got to
HULL: That's what killing Ivy did. I'll get to him soon.
HULL: ( continuing ) Is that it?
CARVER: ( seeing him to the door ) I want you to get a new apartment. Something expensive.
HULL: I like where I am.
CARVER: That shithole? You're big time now. Act it. And get some clothes. Spend money. Have fun. That's an order.
HULL: Whether I'm here or not, no one else uses that room. And change the linen twice a week, just like now. And make sure James gets what he needs. And something for you.
ELIAS: ( impressed, envious ) Nice place. Nice suit. You pick all this shit out yourself?
HULL: He hurries over, lifts Elias feet to the floor. Hull brushes the wood, inspects it carefully, fusses, worries. Elias is
ELIAS: You pick all this shit out yourself?
HULL: A Jewish lady in the store helped Aw. Very nice. Understated. I'm
ELIAS: ( mock touched by racial harmony ) Aw. Very nice. Understated. I'm
HULL: ( to himself ) Fifty bucks, fifty fucking bucks.
ELIAS: You sold it all?
ELIAS: ( continuing ) I'll order a couple more keys from Order ten.
HULL: Order ten.
ELIAS: Better twenty.
HULL: Better twenty.
ELIAS: ( afraid of that ) I don't want to push it.
HULL: I do. We've got a bigger territory, we need more product. I want to deal directly with Gallegos. It would save us money.
ELIAS: Barbosa'll never let us near him.
HULL: If we buy twenty, Gallegos'll come to us himself.
ELIAS: How do you know?
HULL: When I bought a key from Eddie, you came to me.
HULL: ( continuing ) Who's above Gallegos?
ELIAS: Guzman, but he's. Don't ask so many questions.
HULL: How else will I learn? Call Barbosa, David, put in our order. Because we have to split this, and there isn't enough here for both of us.
BETTY'S VOICE: ( annoyed ) Nobody's home, go away.
MCCUTCHEON: ( doesn't want to let him in ) Look, I'm tired, why don't you.
MCCUTCHEON: Why do you look at me like that?
HULL: How do I look at you?
MCCUTCHEON: Like you know something I don't. Like you're better than me.
HULL: I don't think I'm better than you. I don't think I'm better than anybody. But I do know something. You can't stop thinking about me.
HULL: ( continuing ) But I do know something. You can't stop thinking about me.
MCCUTCHEON: Let's go back here.
MCCUTCHEON: ( indicates coke ) Do this. do it with me.
MCCUTCHEON: ( continuing ) This is where I'm at. You want to be with me, it's gotta be there.
HULL: I don't do that.
MCCUTCHEON: Never have, never will.
HULL: It's for fuck-ups.
MCCUTCHEON: What do you think, you're not a nigger? You're a nigger as much as
HULL: She's angry, hurt, confused, wants to love him, but feels he won't let her, or she won't let herself. It's torment. Finally she's released by a KNOCK on the door. She goes out to.
ELIAS: ( amused, jealous ) Having fun? ( neither answers; to Hull ) I talked to Barbosa. He'll see us
BARBOSA: Ten kilos? You're always late on Not ten. twenty.
HULL: Not ten. twenty.
HULL: ( continuing ) The more we have, the more we can move. There're markets we can't open because we don't have the inventory.
BARBOSA: Finally some balls on this team. Come work for me, John. I'll give you your own franchise. You can supply Elias, lean on him when he's late.
ELIAS: Go fuck yourself.
HULL: I'm with David.
BARBOSA: Why? He give you his "designer drugs" pitch. He's never going to do it. He's a shmuck.
ELIAS: Don't talk to me that way.
BARBOSA: I'm not talking to you at all. I'm talking to John.
GOPHER: It's the cocaine. Don't listen to him. Felix, you've had enough.
BARBOSA: Elias goes for him. He's fast and strong, and it takes Chino and Hull to pull him off.
GOPHER: Praise God they don't let guns in "None of that in here." "Take it
CALMING VOICES: "None of that in here." "Take it
BARBOSA: David, you've been working out, you're getting strong. Are you quick, too? Come on, I'll give you a shot at me.
ELIAS: Any time, any place.
BARBOSA: Right here, right now. Do this.
ELIAS: This? What is this?
BARBOSA: You know, you slap me, I slap you. Come on, it's fun. Like summer camp.
HULL: Don't waste your time.
BARBOSA: Stay out of this. Come on, you can do it, David, you're not a shmuck.
BARBOSA: ( continuing ) Slap my hands. Just slap them.
BARBOSA: ( continuing ) Now it's my turn.
GOPHER: It's Barbosa's turn. He's gonna kill the white boy.
ELIAS: One more.
BARBOSA: No, you went, Davey, now it's my turn. First to four wins, like the World Series.
GOPHER: Oh, God, I can't look.
BARBOSA: You remember the rules? If you flinch, I get to hit you.
BARBOSA: ( continuing ) Again, shmuck.
GOPHER: That was two.
ELIAS: That was two.
BARBOSA: No, this is two.
GOPHER: Oh, and it hurts. Mercy, it hurts.
GOPHER: ( continuing ) Felix! No mas. Finito.
A VOICE: Felix! No mas. Finito.
A MAN: steps forward out of the shadows. He is young, mid-30's, handsome, European features, beautifully dressed, accompanied by a guard we'll know as MOLTO. Someone murmurs to someone Hull reacts. Their eyes meet.
SOMEONE: Hull reacts. Their eyes meet.
GOPHER: The fight is over! The Ambassador from the South has spoken!
ELIAS: ( refusing any mercy ) One more.
ELIAS: ( continuing ) One more! We're not finished! ( people are silent ) Four was the match.
BARBOSA: Okay, that's it. Get away.
HULL: Okay, that's it. Get away.
ELIAS: Look at me. Look at me, damn it!
HULL: Why did you do it?
ELIAS: I needed it. They taught me what I needed to know. That I'm not part of them, and I never will be. That they don't respect me. That I don't deserve respect. Because I'm a shmuck, John. I'm a shmuck. David, I'm sorry. It's a crazy time, and. you know. I'm doing a little too much coca. I'll buy your kid a pony. anything you want. Let's forget about it. I am so proud of you. You can be cruel, and you can be kind. And just now you were kind. Proud, proud, and more proud. That's me.
BARBOSA: David, I'm sorry. It's a crazy time, and. you know. I'm doing a little too much coca. I'll buy your kid a pony. anything you want. Let's forget about it. I am so proud of you. You can be cruel, and you can be kind. And just now you were kind. Proud, proud, and more proud. That's me.
GOPHER: I am so proud of you. You can be cruel, and you can be kind. And just now you were kind. Proud, proud, and more proud. That's me.
BARBOSA: Shut up.
BARBOSA: I got nothing to give you, my man. I'm an il-liquid son of a bitch.
HERNANDEZ: Felix, I keep telling them, "I have informants down there, I'm working guys, I can't say who." If you don't have money, give me busts, or they're gonna start wondering about They're already wondering.
GOPHER: They're already wondering.
BARBOSA: ( deadpan ) You can have Gopher.
GOPHER: Oh Gawd.
BARBOSA: How about a lawyer?
GOPHER: ( knows who he means ) Felix, don't do this.
HERNANDEZ: ( he knows, too ) Great, lawyers are great, Jewish is best. But I need spades, too. The politicians want dark facts to scare the suburbs so they'll vote Lawyers and spades; I got the trifecta: two dealers and a girl who does their wash. Two niggers and a kike; all Democrats.
BARBOSA: Lawyers and spades; I got the trifecta: two dealers and a girl who does their wash. Two niggers and a kike; all Democrats.
HERNANDEZ: You're my man. And afterwards.
BARBOSA: When this is over, I'll send you to Hawaii, Maui. It's very beautiful in Maui, it's a very spiritual place.
HERNANDEZ: I just want money.
GOPHER: I wouldn't trust that man when he's out of rifle range.
GOPHER: ( continuing; premonition of disaster ) Don't do this, Felix. It'll go wrong. Kill Elias if you have to, honey, but don't set him up for this. It damages your prestige.
BARBOSA: David, you're awake, I'm impressed. I'm sorry about what happened. Listen, I'll get you twenty boxes, like you wanted. You were right, you should have what you need. Tomorrow night. Bring your partner and that girl with the store, Betty. I need her advice on something. I want us to have fun, like we used to. We'll go to that shrimp place, okay?. Good. Me, too, David.
HULL: We're getting twenty kilograms Tonight. I made it happen. I pushed Elias, now he doesn't make a move without me.
CARVER: You run Elias.
HULL: I control him. Barbosa's selling it to us because he thinks I can move And last night I met Ramon Gallegos.
HULL: ( continuing ) We're getting the dope from him; it's still coming through Barbosa, but Gallegos will approach me soon on his own. We're going to get him, Gerry. We're going to bring him and the whole thing down.
HULL: ( continuing ) What's your problem?
CARVER: ( looking out window ) My problem? My problem is that you don't really know what's happening.
HULL: ( sardonic ) Oh, so, tell me what's happening, Barbosa is setting you up tonight.
CARVER: Barbosa is setting you up tonight.
HULL: He's dealing you to Taft and Hernandez. You're going to be taken down as you receive the drugs. They're putting together the arrest team right now.
CARVER: He's dealing you to Taft and Hernandez. You're going to be taken down as you receive the drugs. They're putting together the arrest team right now.
HULL: What do we do?
CARVER: You stay away. We're going to take them down.
HULL: Who? Elias and Betty? Don't be silly.
CARVER: My boss wants a bust right now. He goes before the oversight committee next week. He needs something to justify the budget.
HULL: ( imploring ) I'll get him something. Give me ten days, and I'll get him Gallegos on a Too late. The whole thing's set up.
CARVER: Too late. The whole thing's set up.
HULL: Gerry, what are you telling me? I need Elias. and Betty. You arrest them, and you're throwing away everything I've set up.
CARVER: It's out of my hands.
CARVER: ( continuing ) John, don't go near that bust.
HULL: We shouldn't go to them. Maybe them come to us.
ELIAS: He wouldn't.
HERNANDEZ: ( whispering into radio ) Here they are. Nobody move until we see the green suitcase.
BARBOSA: ( flirtatious ) I'm sorry for dragging you out so late, but I have to be careful.
MCCUTCHEON: It gives me confidence.
HULL: watching planes descend into the airport, nervous. He knows what's coming, but how does he handle it?
HULL: Let's see what we've got.
HULL: ( continuing; spotting the police van in the adjacent lot ) Don't touch it.
BARBOSA: What is this?
HULL: Something's wrong. What's that van doing there? This is a bust. The minute we take the stuff, they'll be over us.
HULL: ( continuing ) This is a bust. The minute we take the stuff, they'll be over us.
BARBOSA: He's crazy, David. I thought you were the crazy one, but it's him.
HULL: Chino, pick up the suitcase and give it to Elias. I'll only kill him if something goes wrong.
BARBOSA: Everyone looks at Hull amazed, even Chino.
ELIAS: ( softly ) Fucking A, John.
HULL: Okay, everybody in the car.
TAFT: We have a problem.
HERNANDEZ: Shit! Shit! Shit! Enough of this.
TAFT: EXT. TWO CARS - NIGHT Hull shepherding everyone into the limo. He glances toward the van. On instinct. He pulls Chino to him.
BARBOSA: ( screaming at van ) Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
TAFT: Goddam it, what the hell are you
MCCUTCHEON: ( weeping ) I asked for this. I asked for it. It's my fault.
HULL: ( calm, eyes on road ) Relax. We'll make it.
BARBOSA: He's a cop. He has to be. How else would he have known?
HULL: If I was cop, you'd be face down back there.
MCCUTCHEON: How did you know?
HULL: The whole thing smelled. Changing his mind about the stuff. Meeting us way out here. And I'd seen cops in that van before. Hernandez is dirty, that's who he's using.
ELIAS: ( to Barbosa ) Get out of the car.
HULL: David, not now.
ELIAS: Yes, now!
TAFT: Who are you, man? Who the fuck are I'm me.
HERNANDEZ: ( stonewalling ) I'm me.
ELIAS: He traded us to the cops. Just like Eddie. Eddie, who was nice to my daughter, had to die because that's the rule. And you were vulgar about my wife, Felix, so at the very least the same rule applies to you.
BARBOSA: I'll give you money. I'll give you a million. Anything you want.
ELIAS: I want you to get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car. Out of the fucking
MCCUTCHEON: ( near tears ) No, no. we can't do this.
HULL: ( turning around from front seat ) Stop it, David, or we're.
ELIAS: ( in a fury ) Look at my hands!
ELIAS: ( continuing; to Barbosa, softly ) Get out of the car.
MCCUTCHEON: Elias wheels on them, swinging the gun from one to the other.
HULL: Elias wheels on them, swinging the gun from one to the other.
ELIAS: Stay out of this, or you'll die. You'll both die. Everyone'll die.
BARBOSA: I can't.
ELIAS: I had him!
HULL: You want to kill a cop?? Don't be
ELIAS: Everything is different. We're the Colombians now. This is the greatest night of my life. Terrible but great. Felix was About what?
MCCUTCHEON: ( appalled ) About what?
ELIAS: He said I should kill a man. He was My God.
MCCUTCHEON: My God.
ELIAS: Barbosa was a roach. Do you miss him? Will anybody in the world miss Are you a roach, too?
MCCUTCHEON: Are you a roach, too?
ELIAS: ( happily ) Yes. Thank God.
MCCUTCHEON: ( to Hull ) What about you?
MCCUTCHEON: ( continuing ) Stop the car.
MCCUTCHEON: ( continuing ) Stop it!
MCCUTCHEON: ( continuing ) No more laundering, no more anything. I'm finished with this.
ELIAS: She knows too much. We have to kill No! She's with me. She's not going to talk. You touch her, I'll kill you.
HULL: No! She's with me. She's not going to talk. You touch her, I'll kill you.
ELIAS: She's your responsibility then.
ELIAS: ( continuing ) We're going to get the money now, John. Enough for the new drug. We're going to be rich. We're going to be so rich that we're going to leave the world of ordinary people and going to a higher realm. I mean that.
HULL: They're going to come after us.
ELIAS: ( matter-of-fact ) It's a hardball game. We're hardball
HERNANDEZ: It wasn't my fault.
MOLTO: It never is.
MCCUTCHEON: Don't kill me. I'm not going to talk. I swear. Please.
MCCUTCHEON: Don't look.
HULL: ( softly ) Tell me about you.
MCCUTCHEON: ( half-kidding ) Everything worth knowing you just found you.
HULL: Don't hurt her.
ELIAS: Who's grave?
GALLEGOS: My wife's. She died of leukemia three years ago. I like to be among the dead. They never interrupt you. Felix Barbosa started out as a skinny fourteen-year-old fucking Yankee businessman in Bogata hotels. He grew up. He made himself strong and rich, but getting there made him sick, and that killed him. So he lost everything for the same reason he'd gotten it in the first place. Now we'll see if you can do as well.
GALLEGOS: ( continuing ) Felix owed me one million eight hundred thousand dollars.
GALLEGOS: ( continuing ) When you killed him, you bought the debt; now you owe it to me; you get to keep thirty percent, like he did. You have three days.
HULL: Who did Barbosa collect from?
GALLEGOS: If you don't know, you shouldn't have killed him.
GALLEGOS: ( continuing ) Cute. Can I have that?
GOPHER: I don't want you in here. You killed the man, and I loved him. I don't want to have anything to do with
GOPHER: ( continuing; apoplectic ) I'm a sixty-three-year-old man! I'm a grandfather! Would you hit a sixty- three-year-old white man? Would you hit your own grandfather?
ELIAS: ( slaps him against wall ) Listen, you fucking monkey, you know who owed him money, and we know you know. Tell us or
HULL: He'll tell us. Gopher, just.
GOPHER: You can't tell anyone it was me.
HULL: Where the hell is all the money? We're still a million short.
ELIAS: I gotta get laid.
HULL: David, we've got thirty-six hours.
ELIAS: ( slams trunk, moves toward door ) Pick me up at Jacqueline's in the Sooner than that.
HULL: Sooner than that.
CARVER: ( an order ) Get in.
HULL: ( as he gets in ) What are you doing here? You're going to get me killed.
CARVER: Where the hell have you been?
HULL: Doing my job.
CARVER: You violated a direct order to stay away from that bust. As a result, a police informant is dead, a state senator was critically injured in the tunnel pile up and a city policeman was subsequently murdered.
HULL: I didn't blow my cover.
CARVER: Don't get smart with me, motherfucker.
HULL: Don't be a shmuck, Gerry. I'm talking to Gallegos. I'm collecting his money. We can set him up right now.
NIGHT: They get out of the car. Carver takes out a flask, has a drink, offers it to Hull who declines.
CARVER: Never have, never will. I want you to give me your gun. You're coming in right now.
HULL: ( doesn't understand ) Coming in where?
CARVER: Your assignment has been terminated. You're not going out there again. If I have to, I'll put you in custody.
HULL: ( uncomprehending ) I'm going to have Gallegos in two
HULL: ( continuing ) You're protecting him. You're protecting Gallegos.
HULL: ( continuing ) No, of course. That's why you wanted to bust Elias and Betty. I was getting close, and you wanted to cut this off then. What is he, the new Noriega? Helps you fight commies, so you let him sell drugs to the niggers. Two birds with one stone.
CARVER: You violated orders, so you're through. Don't make a conspiracy theory out of it.
HULL: ( laughs ) I'm through.? Then, I might as well have a drink after all.
HULL: ( continuing ) Now tell me the truth or they're going to decide your troubles got the best of you.
CARVER: You're insane.
HULL: All the more reason to do what I say. Jesus, Ger, I'm having trouble holding on.
CARVER: All right!
HULL: Say it!
CARVER: It's the State Department. I told you, Gallegos's uncle is a big deal down there.
CARVER: ( continuing ) I told you, Gallegos's uncle is a big deal down there.
HULL: Guzman, right. Our government supports Guzman because he's a moderate. That's a right-winger who's pro-U.S. If Gallegos got busted here, it would hurt Guzman's political career there. It's politics, John, not drugs.
CARVER: Guzman, right. Our government supports Guzman because he's a moderate. That's a right-winger who's pro-U.S. If Gallegos got busted here, it would hurt Guzman's political career there. It's politics, John, not drugs.
HULL: Drugs is politics. Politics is Christ, Gerry, I dealt drugs. I killed a man. Others died. What did I do all this for? For nothing.
CARVER: I'm going to Washington, John. I'll bring you with me. We'll have clout, I didn't do this for clout or money. You said we were gonna do some good.
HULL: ( outraged ) I didn't do this for clout or money. You said we were gonna do some good.
CARVER: We tried.
HULL: Trying's for college boys. If all there is is power and money. If all there is. then what am I doing here? 'Cause I can get more power and money out on the street, I got more there already, than I'd ever get kissing your ass in But you can't do that, John. It's not you.
CARVER: But you can't do that, John. It's not you.
HULL: Me? There is no me. We took care of that. First I was a cop pretending to be a dealer. Now I'm just a dealer pretending to be a cop. Why not stop pretending.? Quit the force. Be a It's not that simple.
CARVER: It's not that simple.
HULL: My assignment's already terminated. All I have to do is quit. I hereby My first one. Not so bad. Don't blow your cover.
CARVER: Don't blow your cover.
MCCUTCHEON: What's the matter?
HULL: Who are you, my mother?
MCCUTCHEON: Tell me.
HULL: Tell you what?
MCCUTCHEON: What you came to say.
HULL: What did I come to say?
MCCUTCHEON: Then tell me anything. Something about you. Something real.
HULL: ( long beat; another drink ) When I was young, I occasionally stole things. ( laughs to himself ) My father died when I was ten. Right in front of me. ( continuing ) Heart attack. He just fell down. He said, "I love you," then died in my Oh, baby.
HULL: ( continuing ) Heart attack. He just fell down. He said, "I love you," then died in my Oh, baby.
MCCUTCHEON: Oh, baby.
MCCUTCHEON: ( continuing ) Tell me what's going on, John?
HULL: ( doesn't want to talk about that ) You're not doing the stuff anymore, are you?
MCCUTCHEON: No. Don't change the subject.
HULL: How is that?
MCCUTCHEON: It's hard. John.!
HULL: ( trying to tell without telling ) Things are getting, they're getting a little. confusing. I had certain plans, and people haven't come through exactly as they promised.
MCCUTCHEON: What do you expect with those people?
HULL: ( laughs ) It's not just those people. It's. it's bigger than that. It's of everybody. Present company excluded.
MCCUTCHEON: You've got to stop this, John, you know that. You gotta get out.
HULL: I can't.
MCCUTCHEON: Of course, you can.
HULL: ( almost angry ) No! This is what I'm supposed to do.
MCCUTCHEON: Supposed to? Who said you're supposed The whole fuckin' world. You think I didn't try something else? But everything funnels you right back here. Like it's where you had to go all along.
HULL: The whole fuckin' world. You think I didn't try something else? But everything funnels you right back here. Like it's where you had to go all along.
MCCUTCHEON: But you know what you're doing, don't you, selling this stuff? Doing to our own.
HULL: If I tried to get out now, they'd kill me.
MCCUTCHEON: ( tortured ) I can't be with somebody's who involved in drugs.
HULL: Everyone knows what he is: the Black Man with the Big Car. They don't remember when he was just another hustler making street buys. Now they hate him, revere him, want to be him, not caring what it entails. Every eye follows as. He and Elias cross the street toward Gopher's door. Hull's eyes don't go right or left. He's a driven man now.
HULL: There've got to be more. We have a million two, we owe Gallegos one I told you everyone. Everyone who owed him, everyone he. One eight? He's lying. Barbosa barely owed him a million.
GOPHER: I told you everyone. Everyone who owed him, everyone he. One eight? He's lying. Barbosa barely owed him a million.
TAFT: I got every money transfer, every phone call, all your laundry tickets.
MCCUTCHEON: ( miserable ) What do you want?
TAFT: John Hull.
MCCUTCHEON: I can't!
TAFT: Or you'll go away 'til you're a dried up old woman, and when you come out, ain't nobody gonna want you.
HULL: What are you laughing at?
HULL: It isn't one eight. It's a million one. That's all Barbosa owed, it's all we're paying.
GALLEGOS: Big brass balls. Collecting money makes you strong. What's that?
ELIAS: What's that?
GALLEGOS: I'm telling our suppliers they got paid. They'll be very happy. I'm And we're happy. Everybody's happy. It's a happy world.
ELIAS: And we're happy. Everybody's happy. It's a happy world.
GALLEGOS: So, how can I express my gratitude for a job well done?
ELIAS: We want Barbosa's business.
GALLEGOS: Done. Of course.
ELIAS: And, also, your business. All this. Your money, your dope, everything.
GALLEGOS: ( smiles ) You're tougher than I thought, but not that tough.
ELIAS: How tough is enough?
HULL: Meaning don't shoot him. But Elias has no intention of doing
