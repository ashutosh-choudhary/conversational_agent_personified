LLOYD: Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the medical school? I'm supposed to be giving a lecture in twenty minutes and my driver's a bit Go straight aheads and makes a left over za bridge.
YOUNG WOMAN: ( heavy European accent ) Go straight aheads and makes a left over za bridge.
LLOYD: I couldn't help noticing the accent. You from Jersey?
YOUNG WOMAN: ( unimpressed ) Austria? You're kidding. ( mock-Australian accent ) Well, g'day, mate. What do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie.
LLOYD: Austria? You're kidding. Well, g'day, mate. What do you say we get together later and throw a few shrimp on the barbie.
DISPATCHER: ( v.o. ) Carr 22, come in, car 22.
LLOYD: This is 22.
DISPATCHER: 22, where the hell are you, Lloyd? You're running late on the East Side Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my Well hurry it up. And make sure you park legally. One more ticket and your ass is history.
LLOYD: Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my Well hurry it up. And make sure you park legally. One more ticket and your ass is history.
DISPATCHER: ( v.o. ) Well hurry it up. And make sure you park legally. One more ticket and your ass is history.
HARRY: Okay, gang, single file. You know the rules: No pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies.
PALMER: Hey, why aren't those mutts on The same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell.
HARRY: The same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell.
PALMER: Just get them in here now! They all have to be bathed and clipped in an
HARRY: You kids stay right here.
MARY: ( beat ) I'll be just a minute.
LLOYD: Why you going to the airport? Flying How'd you guess?
MARY: ( dead-pan ) How'd you guess?
LLOYD: Well, I saw your luggage, then when I noticed the airline ticket, I put two and two together. So where you heading?
MARY: Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear California's beautiful this time of Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.
LLOYD: Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear California's beautiful this time of Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.
MARY: I'm Mary.
LLOYD: Uh, this isn't my real job, you know. It's only temporary.
MARY: Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store.
LLOYD: Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I are saving up our money so we can open our own pet store.
MARY: That's nice.
LLOYD: ( smiling ) I got worms.
MARY: I beg your pardon?
LLOYD: That's what we're gonna call it: I Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in selling worm farms you know, like ant farms. A lot of people don't realize that worms make much better pets than ants. They're quiet, affectionate, they don't bite, and they're super with the kids.
MARY: Aren't ants quiet, too?
LLOYD: Uh. well, sure but they aren't half as affectionate. And if you cut an ant's head off, it won't grow back.
MARY: I see.
LLOYD: And best of all, worm farming is a industry. I wouldn't mind having a piece of that pie, if you know what I mean.
MARY: ( beat ) Something like that.
LLOYD: It's really nothing to worry about, Mary. Statistically, they say you're more likely to get killed on the way to the airport. You know, like in a head-on crash, or something.
MARY: Um, Lloyd, could please keep your eyes on the road.
LLOYD: Good thinking. There's a lot of bad rivers out there.
MARY: Here you go.
LLOYD: Keep it. It was my pleasure.
MARY: Thanks Lloyd. And good luck with your worms.
POLICE OFFICER: Come on, move it, you're in a red
ARMANI SUIT: She's gonna leave the briefcase at the foot of the escalator. You make the pick-up.
PLAID SPORTCOAT: Piece of cake.
LLOYD: ( to car's driver ) Drive around me, you pinhead!
LLOYD: QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away.
LLOYD: You can't do this! I'll lose my job!
MENTAL: Who the hell do you figure this guy's working for?
SHAY: I don't know, but we'd better find
MENTAL: It ain't gonna kill me.
HARRY: I got fired again.
LLOYD: I don't mean to be harsh, Harry, but let's face it, you are one pathetic loser. No offense.
HARRY: None taken. Were you shitcanned, Of course not. I quit.
LLOYD: Of course not. I quit.
HARRY: Why'd you quit?
LLOYD: I had a hunch Arnie was gonna fire Why didn't you wait and see if your suspicions were well-founded?
HARRY: Why didn't you wait and see if your suspicions were well-founded?
LLOYD: Winners control their own destiny,
HARRY: You know, the thing that really chaps my ass is that I just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle. The alarm alone cost me two hundred.
LLOYD: Big deal. That car's an old bomb What are you talking about? It's only six years old.
HARRY: What are you talking about? It's only six years old.
LLOYD: That's forty-two in dog years.
HARRY: What's with the briefcase?
LLOYD: It's a love memento.
HARRY: The most beautiful woman alive. Her name was Mary. I drove her to the airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran high, breasts heaved. She left this case in the terminal and flew to Aspen and out of my life. End of What's in it?
LLOYD: The most beautiful woman alive. Her name was Mary. I drove her to the airport. Sparks flew, emotions ran high, breasts heaved. She left this case in the terminal and flew to Aspen and out of my life. End of What's in it?
HARRY: What's in it?
LLOYD: DO you really expect me to go snooping around in someone else's private Why not?
HARRY: Why not?
LLOYD: ( beat ) It's locked.
HARRY: ( WHISPERING ) We don't have any friends.
LLOYD: Hey, I ordered Mystic Mint. The little swindlers gave me Peanut Butter Well, whoever they are, they look serious. One of them's even wearing That's a hostile pattern. I say we bail and get down to unemployment.
HARRY: Well, whoever they are, they look serious. One of them's even wearing That's a hostile pattern. I say we bail and get down to unemployment.
LLOYD: ( cringing ) That's a hostile pattern. I say we bail and get down to unemployment.
AFTERNOON: STANLEY GRABNER is small, plump, balding, not a lot of laughs.
GRABNER: Gentlemen, I'm delighted to say that neither I nor the unemployment epartment of the state of Rhose Island can do anything for you. You've run out of chances. You're unemployable. Remember last year? Middle of winter I busted my butt to
LLOYD: Blew it? For your information, we only missed three days in two months.
HARRY: Yeah, and that was because of a
GRABNER: ( exploding )
HARRY: Come on, Stan. I'm sure you can find something else for us. How about another crack at that Suicide Hotline?
GRABNER: CUT TO:
OUT!!!!!: CUT TO:
MENTAL: The briefcase ain't here. He must've taken it with him.
J.P. SHAY: ( beat ) Well he's gotta come home sometime.
MENTAL: Maybe we should leave him a little message to let 'em know we're playing
LLOYD: Give me what's left of our dough. I'll go to the corner and buy a few
HARRY: Get Robitussin it's a better buzz.
LLOYD: Excuse me, little old lady, do you have change for a dollar?
ELDERLY WOMAN: Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't.
LLOYD: Well could you do me a favor and guard this while I go break a dollar? My wallet's locked in this machine.
ELDERLY LADY: Of course, young man.
HARRY: Where's the booze?
LLOYD: It's gone. I got robbed by Grandma Walton. She got my wallet, too.
HARRY: It gets worse, Lloyd. My parakeet Petey he's. he's dead.
LLOYD: Oh man, I'm sorry, Harry. What His head fell off.
HARRY: His head fell off.
LLOYD: His head fell off?
HARRY: Yeah, he was pretty old.
LLOYD: ( hopeful ) I don't suppose he had a warranty.?
HARRY: Nah, I bought him used.
LLOYD: That's it! I've had it with this ump! We don't have food, we don't have jobs, our pets' heads are falling off, we're surrounded by roving gangs of larcenous old
HARRY: Okay, calm down.
LLOYD: No I won't calm down.
HARRY: Yeah, and go where?
LLOYD: I'll tell you where: someplace warm, a place where the beer flows like wine, where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. I'm talking about Aspen.
HARRY: That's right, Aspen.
LLOYD: That's right, Aspen.
HARRY: I don't know, Lloyd, the French are Let me ask you something: do you want to end up like Petey dead in some flea-ridden apartment, face- down on a Dear Abby column, with a soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak? Or do you want to enjoy your life? Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's eath be in vain. Don't you see what he was saying? Spread your wings, man. he was saying? Spread your wings, man. Fly.
LLOYD: Let me ask you something: do you want to end up like Petey dead in some flea-ridden apartment, face- down on a Dear Abby column, with a soggy sunflower seed pressed against your beak? Or do you want to enjoy your life? Come on, Harry, don't let Petey's eath be in vain. Don't you see what he was saying? Spread your wings, man. he was saying? Spread your wings, man. Fly.
HARRY: ( confused ) What are you talking about, Lloyd? His head fell off. ( dawning realization ) Wait a second, I know what you're up to. You just wanna go to Aspen so you can find that girl who lost her briefcase and you need me to drive you there.
LLOYD: That's bullshit. I'll drive. And what's so wrong about going someplace where we know someone who can plug us into the social pipeline?
HARRY: ( torn ) I don't know, Lloyd. I think we should stay here, hunt for jobs, and keep saving money for the worm store. I'm getting a little sick and tired of always running from creditors. You know what I'm sick and tired of, Harry? I'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life. I'm sick and tired of being a nobody.
LLOYD: You know what I'm sick and tired of, Harry? I'm sick and tired of having to eek my way through life. I'm sick and tired of being a nobody.
HARRY: Come on, Lloyd. Give us a kiss.
LLOYD: On the other hand, maybe you're right, Harry. Maybe we should stay here and try our luck in bankruptcy court. With all those lawsuits against us, I'm sure we'll win at least one. It could be a boost to our egos.
HARRY: ( emotional ) Petey, I made a promise to you once, ( thinking hard ) .and I'll be damned if I can remember what it was.
AERIAL: SHOTS of the car travelling down the road while the song continues to play.
LLOYD: Well, we're finally doing it. Do you realize that in all the years we've known each other, this is the first time we've done this together.
HARRY: Been run out of town?
LLOYD: Taken a trip. Why'd you do that?
HARRY: Take your seatbelt off.
LLOYD: Take your seatbelt off.
HARRY: Because we just cleared the danger Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home. We've already traveled 6.3 miles.
LLOYD: Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home. We've already traveled 6.3 miles.
HARRY: Don't you know anything, Lloyd? Ninety percent of all accidents happen within five miles of home. We've already traveled 6.3 miles.
LLOYD: Well what about the people who live around here? What if we got into an accident with one of them?
HARRY: Where'd you get those?
LLOYD: Bought 'em when we filled up.
HARRY: Lloyd, I thought we agreed to confer on all expenditures. We're on a tight budget, remember?
LLOYD: This didn't come out of our travel fund. I was able to scrape up twenty- five bucks before we left. You know, so we could live in style.
HARRY: Where'd you get twenty-five extra I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C.
LLOYD: I sold some stuff to Billy in 4-C.
HARRY: You mean the blind kid?
LLOYD: That's right.
HARRY: What did you sell him, Lloyd?
LLOYD: Just some odds and ends.
HARRY: Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of marbles, Petey, three comic books a second, are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Well who else was I gonna sell it to?
LLOYD: Oh, a few baseball cards, a sack of marbles, Petey, three comic books a second, are you telling me you sold my dead bird to a blind kid? Well who else was I gonna sell it to?
HARRY: But Lloyd, Petey didn't even have a Put your mind at ease, friend. I took care of it.
LLOYD: Put your mind at ease, friend. I took care of it.
BILLY: Joe Mental and J.P. Shay approach and climb the steps.
MENTAL: Those bastards. They're rubbing it right in our faces.
J.P. SHAY: Shit! Andre will have a goddamn aneurysm if we don't get that briefcase back.
MENTAL: Don't worry, we'll get it back. And I'll tell you something else. They ain't gonna reach Aspen, either. I'll make sure of that. Come on, boy, fly!
BILLY: Come on, boy, fly!
MENTAL: Don't worry, Ironside, he just flew south for the winter.
HARRY: How far have we gone?
LLOYD: According to this map, about an inch and a half.
HARRY: Shit. We're gonna need a smaller map or we'll never get there. We don't have enough gas money.
LLOYD: Relax. We have more than enough.
HARRY: I believe you're wrong, Lloyd.
LLOYD: And I believe I'm right, Harry.
HARRY: I still say wrong, Lloyd.
LLOYD: How much you wanna bet?
HARRY: I don't bet.
LLOYD: What do you mean you don't bet?
HARRY: I mean I don't gamble, you know that. Never have and never will.
LLOYD: Oh, bull. I'll bet you our next meal that I can get you gambling before the day's out.
HARRY: There's no way, Lloyd. You can't do I'll give you three-to-one odds. That's three feedbags if you win, against only one if you lose.
LLOYD: I'll give you three-to-one odds. That's three feedbags if you win, against only one if you lose.
HARRY: You're wasting your money, Lloyd. I already told you, I don't gamble.
LLOYD: Okay, five-to-one I can get you gambling before the day's out.
HARRY: Sorry, pal, no way.
LLOYD: Make it ten-to-one.
HARRY: You got yourself a bet, sucker!
LLOYD: ( to Waitress )
WAITRESS: It's the soup-of-the-day.
LLOYD: Sounds tasty. I'll have a bowl.
WAITRESS: ( sarcastic ) Anything else before I leave the Actually, this chocolate milk isn't mixed very well. Could you please bring me a spoon?
HARRY: Actually, this chocolate milk isn't mixed very well. Could you please bring me a spoon?
WAITRESS: There. Now you don't need one.
LLOYD: FEELS GOOD TO MINGLE WITH THESE LAID- back country-folk, don't it, Harry? Harry wipes off his straw with a napkin. As he moves to put it in the ashtray, he accidentally
LLOYD: What's the matter?
HARRY: What's the matter?
LLOYD: You spilled the salt. That's bad luck. We're driving across the country and the last thing we need is bad luck. Quick, toss a handful of salt over your right shoulder.
HARRY: What for?
LLOYD: Because that's good luck.
MALE VOICE: ( o.s. ) What the fuck?!
LLOYD: Or was it the left shoulder? Who's the dead man threw shit in my
TRUCKER: Who's the dead man threw shit in my
HARRY: It was a terrible accident, Sir. Believe me, I would never do anything to offend a man of your size. Please accept my most sincere apology.
SEA BASS: You gonna eat that?
HARRY: Um. the thought had crossed my mind.
SEA BASS: Still want it?
HARRY: Nah, you go ahead.
HARRY: Perfect. I'm out eight bucks and I still haven't eaten.
LLOYD: Well if you'd stop picking fights with the locals. Wait a second. I think I just had an idea. Follow me.
SEA BASS: What I'm trying to say is, my friend and I would like to buy you guys a round of beers, just to bury the
LLOYD: What I'm trying to say is, my friend and I would like to buy you guys a round of beers, just to bury the
SEA BASS: Make it four boiler-makers.
LLOYD: Whatever you want, sir. I'll have the waitress send them over. Oh, and fellas hope to see you again down the road.
HARRY: Lloyd, what are you doing? You know we can't afford to buy them drinks.
LLOYD: Um, Sea Bass and the fellas offered to pick up our check. They said just add this to their tab.
CASHIER: ( skeptical ) Sea Bass said that?
LLOYD: Well, if that guy at the table over there is Sea Bass.
CASHIER: Okey-dokey, if that's what he wants.
HARRY: Oh, and put these on there, too.
CASHIER: You got it.
LLOYD: ( to Cashier ) By the way, how far is it to Rhode Island from here?
SEA BASS: I'm gonna kill those sons-of-bitches!
CASHIER: Hurry and you'll catch 'em. They was on their way to Rhode Island.
LLOYD: I just wish we could've seen Sea Bass's face when he got the bill.
HARRY: I hope we never have to.
LLOYD: Don't worry. That fish-head is probably half-way to Providence by I hope so.
HARRY: I hope so.
LLOYD: Hey, stop the car. I gotta take a Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now. What if they figure out we went the other way. They'll be on us in no But I gotta go. What am I supposed to do?
HARRY: Are you crazy? I'm not stopping now. What if they figure out we went the other way. They'll be on us in no But I gotta go. What am I supposed to do?
LLOYD: But I gotta go. What am I supposed to do?
HARRY: Hold it.
LLOYD: I can't hold it. I'm about to explode.
HARRY: Well. just take a whiz in an empty beer bottle. There's a couple on the floor in the back seat.
LLOYD: Are you serious?
HARRY: Yes, I'm serious. I'm not stopping now. We could get killed. What's the matter?
LLOYD: What's the matter?
HARRY: What's the matter?
LLOYD: The bottle's almost full and I'm still going.
HARRY: Well stop going.
LLOYD: I can't stop once I already started, you know that. Quick, get me another
HARRY: I'm sorry, Lloyd. I'm doing the best I can. Here, hold this.
LLOYD: Here, hold this.
HARRY: What are you, a goddamn camel?
LLOYD: Hey, I haven't gone all day.
STATE TROOPER: ( o.s. ) Pull over!
HARRY: STATE TROOPER
STATE TROOPER: PULL OVER!
PULL OVER!: Harry glances down at his sweater he's wearing, then back at the Trooper.
HARRY: ( calling out ) No, it's a Cardigan! But thanks for Jesus, what is this, the fashion
STATE TROOPER: PULL YOUR CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE
ROAD!: CUT TO:
STATE TROOPER: License and registration, please.
HARRY: Yes, sir, we had a little. ifficulty in the car.
STATE TROOPER: ( beat ) Have you boys been doing a little rinking maybe?
HARRY: No, sir.
STATE TROOPER: Then what's that?
HARRY: Oh, that's nothing, sir.
STATE TROOPER: Do you know it's against the law to rive with an open alcohol container in this state?
LLOYD: But, your honor, he's telling the truth. It's not beer.
STATE TROOPER: Is that right?
HARRY: Sir, I wouldn't TROOPER You'd keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you.
LLOYD: ( under breath )
STATE TROOPER: ( pained ) Get the hell out of here.
LLOYD: ( v.o. )
MARY: ( v.o. ) How does that feel, Lloyd?
LLOYD: ( v.o. )
MARY: ( o.s. ) How's the other side?
LLOYD: Nothing. Nothing at all.
MARY: ( o.s. ) Lloyd, will you wash my nipples.?
HARRY: ( v.o. ) I don't know, Lloyd, I feel a little sleazy staying here when we're not even engaged.
LLOYD: ( v.o. ) Hey, it's the only motel that charges by the hour. We can't afford anything
LLOYD: Yep, this sure is the life. Cold beer, a hot tube, and fuzzy pink sheets. You know, there's only one thing that could make this moment any better.
HARRY: What's that?
LLOYD: If you had a nice set of knockers.
HARRY: That's two things, Lloyd.
LLOYD: Right now I'd settle for one.
HARRY: I don't know, Lloyd, these places just don't do it for me. Brings back too many memories.
LLOYD: What happened, Harry? Some little filly break your heart?
HARRY: Nah, it was a girl. Fraida Felcher. We stayed at a place like this once No-Tell Motel out on Route 31.
LLOYD: Felcher? You mean the babe who worked for the tractor company?
HARRY: The same. We had this incredibly romantic time. Boy, I thought we'd be together forever.
LLOYD: That's cold, Har. Give you any reason?
HARRY: I called her up and she gave me some crap about me not listening to her enough or something like that. I wasn't really paying attention.
MENTAL: ( into phone ) The boys are holed-up in a little love nest for the night. I think they're a couple of fucking weirdos.
ANDRE: What in hell are those guys up to? Is it possible that they're Feds?
INTERCUT CONVERSATION: Unlikely from what I've seen.
MENTAL: Unlikely from what I've seen.
ANDRE: I don't like this one goddamn bit, Mental. You and Shay were supposed to grab that bag so we could end this shit. Now I don't know what the hell's going on.
MENTAL: Hold on a second, Mr. Andre.
ANDRE: Look, Mental, just find out what they're up to. I want to know who these guys are.
MENTAL: Don't worry. I'm on it.
SHAY: What the fuck.?
MENTAL: Where's the goddamn dog?
MARY: It just doesn't make any sense. I left the money exactly where they instructed me to.
HELEN: Actually, it makes a great deal of sense, Mary. We should have called in the authorities the moment we knew Melvin had been kidnapped.
KARL: Now, Helen, we've been through this already for Christ's sake, Karl, these bastards will extort us into bankruptcy if we let them.
MARY: But I'd never forgive myself if something happened to Melvin.
KARL: Stop upsetting my daughter, Helen. She's been through quite enough It's not her fault, Daddy. We're all a little on edge.
MARY: It's not her fault, Daddy. We're all a little on edge.
ANDRE: Has there been any word, Mr. Swanson?
KARL: Nothing yet, Nicholas.
ANDRE: Perhaps I should call off the Preservation benefit this weekend.
HELEN: No, Nicholas, it's imperative that we carry on as usual.
KARL: Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll do everything they ask. Nothing's going to happen to Melvin, I promise you.
MARY: Thank you, Daddy.
MENTAL: ( to Shay ) Lie down on the front seat. After they pick me up I want you to follow
LLOYD: You're it.
HARRY: You're it.
LLOYD: You're it. Quitsies.
HARRY: ( tapping him back ) Anti-quitsies. You're it. Quitsies. No anti-quitsies. No startsies.
LLOYD: Damn, you're good, Harry. Hey, didn't I tell you this trip would be a blast?
LLOYD: See, I told you these country folks were friendly, Harry.
SHAY: What happened?
MENTAL: These fuckers are really pissing me off now.
HARRY: Refresh my memory on something, Lloyd: what exactly do we do when we get to Well the first thing we do is take a good deep breath of that famous Aspenese air.
LLOYD: Well the first thing we do is take a good deep breath of that famous Aspenese air.
HARRY: Fresh, huh?
LLOYD: The freshest. They say on any day of the week you can smell a moose-fart ten miles away.
HARRY: ( sincere ) Wow. talk about paradise. ( beat ) And after we're finished breathing, what next, Lloyd?
LLOYD: Then we make a splash on the social
MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE: .That's two cheese burgers, two fries, and two medium Cokes. Five seventy-
HARRY: Then, before he can give them the bag of food, the guys absentmindedly DRIVE OFF. As they pull out of the parking lot, the McDonald's Employee sticks his head out the window and WAVES THE BAG OF FOOD at them.
MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE: But the guys are already around the corner.
HARRY: About this social scene how do you expect a couple mutts like us to make a splash in the land of pedigrees when we don't even have any money?
LLOYD: Look, once we drop the briefcase off to Mary, she'll be so grateful she'll plug us right into the party circuit. After that, we do a little of the
HARRY: Where'd you hear that?
LLOYD: Some bum down at unemployment.
HARRY: I don't know, Lloyd.
LLOYD: What's the matter?
HARRY: Money does terrible things to people. I mean, we could lose our friendship.
LLOYD: Yeah? So?
HARRY: Aren't you forgetting something?
LLOYD: Aren't you forgetting something?
HARRY: Lloyd rolls his eyes.
LLOYD: My change.
WAVING THEM: DOWN AGAIN. This time the Cadillac is PARKED SIDEWAYS ACROSS
THE ROAD,: BLOCKING THEIR PATH. Lloyd looks at Harry. Harry remembers that he's driving. He pulls the car to the side of the road. Mental approaches the passenger window.
HARRY: I think this guy's in trouble. Why on't you pull over.
MENTAL: You guys going as far as Des Moines? My car died and I'm late for a business meeting.
HARRY: It's a fruit.
LLOYD: It's a vegetable.
HARRY: I'm telling you, it's a fruit.
LLOYD: And I happen to know it's a vegetable.
HARRY: Tell you what, why don't we leet an impartial judge decide.
LLOYD: Fine with me.
HARRY: Hey, Mr. Mentalino, settle our bet: Are jelly beans fruits or vegetables?
LLOYD: Okay, Harry, my turn. Let 'er rip.
HARRY: Kit-Kat bar.
LLOYD: Kit-Kat bar.
HARRY: You're the best, man. Okay, my turn.
LLOYD: Where are your manners, Harry? We have a guest.
HARRY: Come on, Mr. Mentalino. Let one fly. It's only a buck.
HARRY: I'll do one if you will.
LLOYD: Okay, you go first.
HARRY: No, you go first.
LLOYD: No, you go first.
MENTAL: Why don't you both stop being a couple of pussies and go at the same time. It ain't that hot.
LLOYD: Hmmm, not bad.
HARRY: Yeah, more tingly than hot.
MENTAL: Have some water. It'll help. Aw, shucks, that's right. Water just makes it worse.
INTERCUT CONVERSATION: It's Mental. I'm just sitting down to a nice meal with our boys.
MENTAL: It's Mental. I'm just sitting down to a nice meal with our boys.
ANDRE: Good work. What did you find out so Nothing yet, but I'm gonna shake 'em own for information at lunch. Then I'm gonna kill 'em for dessert.
MENTAL: Nothing yet, but I'm gonna shake 'em own for information at lunch. Then I'm gonna kill 'em for dessert.
ANDRE: Well eat fast, time's running out.
MENTAL: Relax, they ain't gonna be running around anywhere after I dump a little cyanide in their pops.
HARRY: That really wasn't very polite of him, was it? Maybe we should loosen the screws of his chair.
LLOYD: Harry Dunne, I'm surprised at you. Perhaps it's about time you brushed
HARRY: ( humbled ) You mean like 'turn the other cheek?'
LLOYD: No, I mean like 'an eye for an eye.' Hand me those peppers the atomic
HARRY: ( whispering ) Here he comes.
MENTAL: Feeling any better, boys?
LLOYD: More like re-location.
MENTAL: Doesn't look like you packed much. All I saw was a couple bags. and that briefcase.
HARRY: The briefcase isn't even ours. Some lady just left it at the airport. We're bringing it back to her.
MENTAL: You mean you don't even know her?
LLOYD: Not really. I was just her limo river.
MENTAL: Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
TO THE: GROUND, GASPING. The boys look at each other guiltily, then bend down to help Harry checks Mental's coat pocket for his antacid pills but unwittingly brings out the BLACK OF CYANIDE PILLS. He shakes some pills out and hands them to Mental, who tosses them in his mouth and starts to MUNCH on them. For a moment, he appears to improve. His BREATHING SLOWS and he sits up. Then his EYES
HARRY: Hey, you okay, man? It was just a My ulcer. quick. pills. in my coat.
MENTAL: ( STRAINED WHISPER ) My ulcer. quick. pills. in my coat.
HARRY: I can't believe it.
LLOYD: Life is a fragile thing, Har. One minute you're chewing on a burger; the next minute you're dead meat.
HARRY: But he blamed me. You heard him. Those were his last words.
LLOYD: If you don't count that gurgling
HARRY: Small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids.
LLOYD: That's ridiculous. You probably won't live to see forty.
HARRY: Oh yeah. Wow. What a relief.
DOCTOR: .My official conclusion is that the eceased expired from oxygen eprivation caused by the presence of cyanide in the bloodstream.
DT. DALE: You mean he was poisoned?
DOCTOR: Unquestionably. We found these by the body.
COP: Waitress says he was with a couple of younger guys. They're the ones who called the ambulance then they hit the road.
DT. DALE: Any idea where they were going?
COP: A witness at the next table thought he heard them say they were driving to France.
DT. DALE: Get a make on the vehicle?
COP: Yes, sir. They were driving an '84
DT. DALE: An '84 what?
COP: ( straight-faced ) Well it might have been a wire-haired terrier, Detective. They're very similar in appearance.
HARRY: Let's get off and crash at a motel before I crash into one. I need a crib fast.
LLOYD: Sorry, Har. We're gonna have to hold out. Seems we misjudged our expense allocation. If we pay for a motel we won't have enough for gas.
HARRY: What happened to the dough?
LLOYD: We over-leveraged.
HARRY: On what?
LLOYD: I sprung for Mr. Chili Pepper's last meal. Felt it was the least we could o after we deep-sixed him.
HARRY: Wait a second one burger put us over budget?
LLOYD: The slob ordered a double-bacon eluxe and a chocolate malt.
HARRY: ( beat ) So what are we gonna do?
LLOYD: Drive. We've only got ten more hours. We can take turns.
SHAY: You heard me, he's dead. The bastards killed him.
ANDRE: Jesus Christ.
SHAY: ( v.o. ) How's our bankroll doing? Giving you a hard time?
ANDRE: Melvin's not the problem. It's these two other guys that have me worried. I wish I knew what the hell they
ANDRE: How you doing today, Melvin?
HARRY: Come on, wake up. You pay, I'll pump.
HARRY: Skis, huh?
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: That's right.
HARRY: She continues to pump gas.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Both of 'em?
HARRY: Both of 'em?
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Um, yeah.
HARRY: ( impressed )
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Excuse me, you're spraying everywhere.
SEA BASS: Well, well, well, if it ain't my old And right on time.
HARRY: ( re: suitcases in That's a lot of luggage for a little Actually, I'm moving to Aspen. I've got to get away from my boyfriend.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Actually, I'm moving to Aspen. I've got to get away from my boyfriend.
HARRY: ( holding out mirror ) Here, this is a little loose. Allow me.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Why not? You seem pretty harmless. I'll give you my number. Just let me find a pen.
HARRY: ( urgently ) Look, why don't you just tell it to me, I've got a good memory.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Are you sure you won't forget?
HARRY: ( desperate ) Positive please hurry.
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Is something wrong? Okay, my number is 652-2553. Oh, wait a second, that's my old number. It's so funny how your mind god sakes, give me the damn number!
SEA BASS: First I'm gonna rape you, then I'm gonna kill you. Any last request?
LLOYD: Um, yeah could you do it the other way around?
HARRY: You've got some serious explaining to o, young man.
LLOYD: Look, Harry, I told you what happened, now drop it.
HARRY: Sure thing, Lloyd. I promise not to mention another word about you being in a bathroom stall with a six-foot, five-inch trucker with his pants That's a low blow, man.
LLOYD: That's a low blow, man.
HARRY: Not at that height it's not.
LLOYD: Listen, bud, if you're trying to imply that I'm that thought look, we're almost in Colorado.
HARRY: I think it's about time we pull over and change seats. I've been driving for nine straight hours I don't have the energy to start a new state.
DT. DALE: Any sign of them yet?
COP: No, but we're expecting them shortly. A motorist said he spotted a pooch about thirty miles back headed this
LLOYD: Hey, I picked you up a Beef Jerky.
LLOYD: Hey, Mr. Sleepy Head, welcome back.
HARRY: ( groggy ) How long have I been out?
LLOYD: I'd say a good five hours, anyway.
HARRY: Great. We must be getting real close, Should be. I've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night.
LLOYD: Should be. I've been averaging about ninety miles an hour all night.
HARRY: Good man.
LLOYD: Boy, I'll tell you, this is one angerous highway. You wouldn't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs, a couple of rabbits, a snake and some big thing I couldn't even recognize.
HARRY: That's awful. Did you see them get hit or were they already lying there?
LLOYD: I hit 'em.
HARRY: Funny. I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little rockier than this.
LLOYD: I was thinking the same thing. That John Denver's some full of shit,
HARRY: Yeah, it really is. Wait a minute when did you visit Des Moines?
LLOYD: Last night. We drove through it.
HARRY: What are you talking about? You were snoring like a baby when we went through Des Moines.
LLOYD: ( sing-song ) Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Rise and ( LAUGHS ) You were the one who was asleep,
HARRY: Uh, Lloyd, refresh my memory: Doesn't the sun rise in the east and set in the west?
LLOYD: In our country it does, yes.
HARRY: Then perchance you can explain to me why the sun is in our face at 7:30 in the morning when we're heading
LLOYD: I'm only human, Harry. Anybody can make a mistake.
HARRY: You know, I got half a mind to just jump on the bus to Europe and say goodbye to your ugly mug forever.
LLOYD: ( rolls his eyes ) You can't take a bus to Europe, dodo.
HARRY: Oh yeah? Why not?
LLOYD: You don't have a passport.
HARRY: A tad? Lloyd, you drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction. Now we don't have enough money to get to Aspen, we on't have enough money to get home, we don't have enough to eat, we don't have enough to sleep!
LLOYD: Well it doesn't do any good having you sitting there on your butt whining about it. If we're gonna get out of this hole, we're gonna have to dig ourselves out.
HARRY: You know, you're absolutely right,
LLOYD: Where you going?
HARRY: Home. I'm walking home.
LLOYD: You can't be serious.
HARRY: ( sarcastic ) Why not? We're probably only five miles away.
LLOYD: ( CALLING OUT ) Thanks a lot, Mr. Perfect. Like you never screwed up.
HARRY: Look, man. I'm sorry. I never should have let you talk me into this in the first place. You've got a good reason to goo a beautiful girl's waiting for you. But let's face it, Lloyd, there's nothing waiting for me in Aspen. There's nothing waiting for me
LLOYD: Got room for one more, if you still want to go to Aspen.
HARRY: Where'd you find this baby?
LLOYD: Used car dealer. I traded the van for it. Plus I got the guy to throw in fifty bucks for gas money. Come on, man, what do you say? We still partners?
DT. DALE: It doesn't make sense. They should've been here hours ago.
COP: Maybe they're smarter than we thought.
DT. DALE: How smart can they be? They're riving a goddamn dog!
COP #2: We just got a report that they were spotted about two hours ago heading east near Des Moines on I-80.
DT. DALE: ( incredulous ) Des Moines?! Why that's five hundred miles from here!
COP #1: Guess they got wind of our welcoming We're wasting time. Let's mobilize.
DT. DALE: We're wasting time. Let's mobilize.
LLOYD: Tell me something, Harry. Would you really have kept going home if I
HARRY: Well let me put it this way, Lloyd: Do you remember when we were Cub Scouts and we got lost in the woods uring that blizzard? We huddled together all night, and we made an oath that if we ever got out of there alive we'd never ever leave each other's side again. Do you remember
LLOYD: We were never Cub Scouts.
HARRY: Just then several COP CARS whiz by them in the opposite direction with SIRENS BLARING and LIGHTS FLASHING. When Harry glances back at the cop cars, he notices that there's a COFFIN in the rear of the vehicle.
LLOYD: Relax, it's empty.
HARRY: I don't give a shit. I'm not driving anywhere with a casket. You know I'm superstitious calm down. We'll dump it off first chance we get.
WOMAN: I married a cheapskate.
MAN: Shut your trap, Gerdie.
WOMAN: I'm so embarrassed. I'll never be able to show my face again.
MAN: I knew something good would come out of this.
WOMAN: We could have given him a more ignified burial.
MAN: Your uncle was a cheap man. Remember what he got us for our twenty-fifth? A friggin' fern. There's no way I'm gonna spend a load to get him planted.
WOMAN: You son-of-a-bitch! I want a ivorce!
LLOYD: Isn't this wonderful? What more could a couple of single guys like us ask How about food and shelter?
HARRY: How about food and shelter?
LLOYD: You're so materialistic. Why don't we get down to business and eliver the briefcase to Mary. Who knows, maybe she'll invite us in for tea and a strumpet or two?
HARRY: Jolly good idea, chap. And where oes the lovely young lady reside?
LLOYD: Um. good question.
HARRY: Well what's her last name? We'll look it up in the phone book.
LLOYD: Hmmmm. You know, I don't believe I caught that either.
HARRY: What about the briefcase, Lloyd? There must've been a name on it, Come to think of it, there is. It's engraved right into the leather.
LLOYD: ( brightening ) Come to think of it, there is. It's engraved right into the leather.
HARRY: What is it?
LLOYD: Samsonite spelled just like it
HARRY: Any soup left?
LLOYD: A little. Shall we share it?
HARRY: Lloyd opens a TINY KETCHUP PACKET and squirts half of it into Harry's cup and the other half into his. They pour a few drops of water in and mix it with their spoons.
LLOYD: Mmmm mmmm good.
HARRY: Hey, you got something stuck in your front teeth.
LLOYD: Hmmm. looks like an old piece of Beef Jerky.
HARRY: Wanna split it?
LLOYD: You're pathetic. Get your own.
HARRY: I'm freezing my ass off, Lloyd.
LLOYD: Roll up your window.
HARRY: It is rolled up.
LLOYD: Then I guess the damn anti-cold system isn't working. You really should get it fixed if we're gonna live here all winter.
HARRY: What anti-cold system?
LLOYD: Right here the A/C button. I put it on full blast about an hour ago and, if anything, the car's getting colder.
HARRY: To warm up.
LLOYD: What are you worrying about now?
HARRY: I'm worried about how you're gonna survive the pummeling I'm about to give you.
LLOYD: Suddenly Harry LUNGES at Lloyd, who takes off around the other side of the car. Harry leaps across the hood, but Lloyd manages to evade his grasp.
HARRY: Get over here and take your medicine, Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine. I'm a Christian Scientist!
LLOYD: Sorry, doc, I can't take medicine. I'm a Christian Scientist!
HARRY: Something I should've done a long time ago. This stupid thing has been the root of our problems all along.
LLOYD: Don't do anything foolish, Harry.
HARRY: Foolish? This is the most sensible thing I've done in years. I'm gonna toss this goddamn curse right into that river.
LLOYD: You're making a big mistake, Harry! I'll never forgive you for this!
HARRY: You're bluffing.
LLOYD: No I'm not, man look.
HARRY: That's a filling, you liar!
LLOYD: ( CHOKED VOICE ) Harry, look!
LLOYD: Okay, here's the plan: We borrow a few bucks just a small loan from the briefcase, and we check into a cheap motel.
HARRY: Sounds good.
LLOYD: And we'll keep track of the money we spend with IOUs.
HARRY: We'll be meticulous right down to the last penny.
LLOYD: That way, whatever we borrow we can pay back.
HARRY: Absolutely. We're good for it.
LLOYD: You know, as soon as we get jobs.
HARRY: It'll come right out of our first
BARNARD: .This is the Hotel Danbury's Presidential Suite, gentlemen. It's normally reserved for royalty, visiting dignitaries, and illustrious stars of stage and take it.
LLOYD: Thanks, Barnard, but we'll find our own chicks.
BARNARD: ( peevish ) I wasn't talking about ladies.
HARRY: Oh. Then go ahead and send thim up. What are their names?
BARNARD: Sir, I meant your luggage.
LLOYD: Tell you what you can send up, my friend how about some chow?
BARNARD: I'll bring you a menu.
LLOYD: Don't bother. Just order us one of
HARRY: One of everything? Lloyd.
LLOYD: Oh, sorry. Make that two of everything.
BARNARD: Yes, sir!
LLOYD: ( proudly ) Our first IOU. Signed and dated.
HELEN: Mary? You awake?
MARY: ( o.s. )
HELEN: I brought you some tea. I thought it might help you relax.
MARY: Thank you.
HELEN: Uh, sorry. that one's mine.
MARY: Just knowing that Melvin's out there, being held by God knows who. It's all my fault. I should've been Bullshit. You can't blame yourself for this. If you'd been there they would've taken you, too.
HELEN: Bullshit. You can't blame yourself for this. If you'd been there they would've taken you, too.
MARY: Maybe we should just pay them the money again and get this thing over Now Mary, everything that can be done is being done. You've got to stop torturing yourself.
HELEN: Now Mary, everything that can be done is being done. You've got to stop torturing yourself.
MARY: What am I supposed to do? Go about my life as if everything were fine?
HELEN: That's exactly what you should do. Get the hell out more, go skiing, socialize. Don't you see, honey? We can't let on that anything is wrong. If the press or authorities get wind of this, the kidnappers might panic. Who knows what they'd do to poor Melvin then?
HARRY: Oh god, it's really true. Last night I thought I might've been dreaming.
LLOYD: It's no dream, Har. We finally cracked the big time.
HARRY: And it was so simple. All it took was somebody else's money.
LLOYD: What's the big deal? We're gonna pay it all back anyway, right?
HARRY: Sure, but do you really think you needed to buy those two surfboards?
LLOYD: Surfboards? I thought those were beginner's skis.
HARRY: Ahhh. I was wondering why you had those bindings put on them.
LLOYD: Where'd this come from?
HARRY: ( sheepishly ) I bought it.
LLOYD: What for?
HARRY: I like the feel of it against my .I mean, you know, when a woman's wearing it.
LLOYD: Harry, how many women do you know who wear a size XXL?
HARRY: Look, leave me alone. I'm rich now. I'm supposed to have a few
LLOYD: Enter, parlez vous!
BARNARD: I brought you your newspaper and some champagne, gentlemen. Unfortunately, we didn't seem to have the, um, label you requested.
LLOYD: All out of Boone's Farm, huh?
BARNARD: You have a rapier wit, sir. I took the liberty of bringing a comparable substitute: Dom Perignon.
LLOYD: Guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?
BARNARD: Thank you so much, sir.
LLOYD: Oh, one more thing: You can dispense with the 'sir' crap. Let's face it, Barney, we're all from the same mold. We just have a little more dough than you right now.
HARRY: Cocktail hour has commenced!
LLOYD: ( dumbstruck ) Harry, it's her.
HARRY: Mary with the briefcase. This is
LLOYD: Mary with the briefcase. This is
HARRY: Come on, Cinderella, it's time to get you ready for the ball.
LLOYD: Thanks for the lift, Barney.
ANDRE: Excuse me, gentlemen, but this is a five-hundred-dollar-a-plate dinner.
LLOYD: This should cover a couple plates.
HARRY: I'm kind of hungry, Lloyd. What if we want seconds?
LLOYD: Put us down for four plates, my good
J.P. SHAY: ( WHISPERING ) Jesus Christ, boss. it's them.
LLOYD: I'm getting nervous, Harry.
HARRY: relax, Lloyd. These people are just like you and me.
LLOYD: What are you talking about? They're educated, well-bred, charming, and So what? We can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound.
HARRY: So what? We can be sophistica holy shit, would you look at the fun bags on that hose hound.
LLOYD: Don't do this to me, Harry. I'm already a wreck. What if Mary oesn't like me?
HARRY: Look, let's just go saddle up to the bar and down a couple bowls of loudmouth soup. A little booze'll bring back that old Lloyd Christmas
LLOYD: ( to BARTENDER ) Two martinis, straight up.
HARRY: I didn't say anything.
LLOYD: Yeah, well I know what you were gonna say and I'm telling you to shut up in advance.
HARRY: How do you know what I was gonna I read you like a book.
LLOYD: I read you like a book.
HARRY: Okay, if you read me like a book then what was I gonna say?
LLOYD: You were gonna say:
VOICE ): 'That's one fiery bush I wouldn't mind roasting my weenie in.'
ANDRE: If I could have your attention,
MR. SWANSON: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Icelandic Snow Owl.
MR. SWANSON: Here these lovely birds will be allowed to breed in a natural but protected habitat. And, God willing, with your help and that of the Society's, we will see these wonderful creatures flourish once more.
LLOYD: Two more, please.
HARRY: Lloyd, I've never seen you this uptight. You've gotta chill out.
LLOYD: I can't help it. This is a very important night for me.
HARRY: What are you talking about? I went out with Fraida Felcher for two and a half weeks.
LLOYD: That was a fluke. The reason we never have long-term girlfriends is because of one thing: We're afraid of the C word.
HARRY: That's crazy. We live for the C word.
LLOYD: I'm talking bout commitment.
HARRY: ( beat ) Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry. The first time I laid eyes on Mary Swanson, I knew she was the one. ( beat ) Some things you feel in your heart, other things you feel in your groin. This girl makes me feel it all in the heart.
LLOYD: Well I'm ready for commitment, Harry. The first time I laid eyes on Mary Swanson, I knew she was the one. Some things you feel in your heart, other things you feel in your groin. This girl makes me feel it all in the heart.
HARRY: ( checking her out ) Wow. You weren't kidding, Lloyd. She's an angel. ( beat ) Well, what are you waiting for? Get over there and talk to her.
LLOYD: She's gonna think I'm some kind of psycho when she realizes how far I came just to see her.
HARRY: You have her briefcase she's gonna be thrilled to see you.
LLOYD: And then what? She'll take it back and that'll be it. I'm a nobody.
HARRY: Look, man, you just drove two thousand miles to see this girl. Don't quit on the last fifty feet.
LLOYD: ( brightening ) Wait a second, I have an idea. You go over and introduce yourself. That way you can build me up so when I come along I won't have to brag about myself. Tell her I'm good-looking and I'm rich and I have a rapist's I can't tell her you're good looking, Lloyd she's got eyes.
HARRY: I can't tell her you're good looking, Lloyd she's got eyes.
LLOYD: Please Harry, I'm appealing to you as one loser to another. Just build me up and then give me a signal to come over. Please.
HARRY: All right. But you're gonna owe me a big one for this.
MARY: I beg your pardon?
HARRY: The owls. They're beautiful.
MARY: Oh. Yeah. Are you a bird lover?
HARRY: Well, I used to have a parakeet, but my main area of expertise is canines that's dogs to the layperson.
MARY: Thanks. I love dogs, too. So how
HARRY: Oh, I've trained them, bathed them, clipped them; I've even bred them.
MARY: Really? Any unusual breeding?
HARRY: Nah, mostly just doggie-style. But one time we successfully mated a Bulldog and a Shitzu.
MARY: Really? That's weird.
HARRY: Yeah. We called it a Bullshit. Just a little breeder joke.
HELEN: Mary, I don't believe I've met your Actually, we haven't been introduced I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my stepmother, Helen.
MARY: Actually, we haven't been introduced I'm Mary Swanson, and this is my stepmother, Helen.
HARRY: Harry Dunne. Pleasure meeting you I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne. I was hoping we'd get a chance to You were?
HELEN: I saw you come in earlier, Mr. Dunne. I was hoping we'd get a chance to You were?
HARRY: ( taken aback ) You were?
HELEN: That tuxedo I love a man with a sense of humor. So does Mary.
HARRY: For a moment, he's caught up in Mary's eyes, but then manages to snap out of it.
MARY: Helen, you're embarrassing me.
HELEN: Well you are, aren't you? Poor girl doesn't get out enough. So what do you say, Harry? Are you
HARRY: Oh, I don't know. You see, my friend your friends for one day. You and Mary will have a ball.
LLOYD: How come you didn't call me over?
HARRY: Relax, you're golden. I got you a ate with her tomorrow.
LLOYD: Wha. you. I. it's. I love you, man. I love you!
HARRY: Okay, get a grip, Lloyd. You're making a scene.
LLOYD: This calls for a toast!
ZIPS ACROSS: THE ROOM LIKE A BULLET DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVEN EYED OWLS. In quick succession we hear a BOK!, a SQUAWK!, and a THUMP! A HUSH falls over the entire party as everyone turns their stunned attention to the cage.
HARRY: ( under breath ) I think we've done enough hobnobbing,
J.P. SHAY: Maybe it was just a coincidence.
ANDRE: Don't be stupid. It's a message, plain and simple: We killed their bird, now they killed ours.
J.P. SHAY: But how could anybody off a bird with a cork?
ANDRE: These guys arent' just anybody. They're good. Look what they did to Mental. He was the best, and yet he fell right into their web.
J.P. SHAY: But the bastards already got our money. What the hell more could they
ANDRE: ( at wit's end ) I don't know, god damn it!
LLOYD: Mrs. Christmas. Mary Christmas. Mrs. Mary Christmas. You
HARRY: Sounds nice, Lloyd, but don't you think you may be jumping the gun a little? I mean, who knows, when you get to know her, you may find out she's not your type.
LLOYD: Impossible. I know my type when I see it. Now let me get this straight, she wants me to meet her at the Avalanche Bar and Grill on Main That's what she said. Ten o'clock
HARRY: That's what she said. Ten o'clock
LLOYD: Time out. Where are going ressed like that.
HARRY: I, uh, thought while you were making your love connection I'd try my luck on the slopes.
LLOYD: You mean you're gonna go out in public dressed in tights?
HARRY: These aren't tights. They're fashionable Euro-trash ski trousers.
LLOYD: But you can see the outline of your
HARRY: Turn sideways.
LLOYD: Turn sideways.
HARRY: You're right. I can't go out dressed like this.
HARRY: Sorry I'm late. It's a bitch driving a clutch with these things.
HARRY: ( CALLING OUT ) You take the first run alone. I'm gonna loosen up down here.
WAITER: I'm sorry, we don't open until eleven.
LLOYD: I'm meeting someone. Mind if I wait at the bar?
MARY: Beautiful day, huh, Harry?
HARRY: Mary takes a DEEP BREATH.
MARY: God, it feels so good to get up here. I haven't been outdoors much in the last couple of weeks.
HARRY: Why not?
MARY: ( evasive ) There's been. family problems. I on't want to bore you with them.
HARRY: He looks mindlessly off in the distance. Then Harry notices a PATCH OF FROST on the chair lift bar.
MARY: Are you okay?
HARRY: ( lisping ) Sure. I do this all the time.
HARRY: ( lisping ) See ya at the bottom.
HARRY: ( lisping ) ( off their looks ) Say, kids, you wouldn't happen to have a cup of warm water, would you?
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: Lloyd GRUNTS a hello.
MARY: My god. Harry, are you okay?
HARRY: ( lisping ) I'm fine, I'm fine. It'll come off.
SHAY: You're luck just ran out, pal.
MARY: This is silly. Let me help you.
MIME: GODDAMN IT! WHAT THE FUCK?!
ATHLETIC BEAUTY: .Anyway, after my boyfriend backed into my garage for the third time, I said to myself, 'Run, Cathy, run for your life before he kills you both'. Then you know what the klutz does and to be perfectly honest, I on't really care. Look, I'm sorry, but I'm not very good company today. I'll say. I have an idea. Why don't you tell me a little about yourself.
LLOYD: Maybe some other time.
BARTENDER: Sure. Her family comes in here all the time.
LLOYD: Do you know where she lives?
BARTENDER: Yeah, they got that big place up on Alpine Drive.
MARY: I've got to tell you, today was really just what I needed. Thanks a lot, My pleasure, Mary.
HARRY: My pleasure, Mary.
MARY: So you'll pick me up tonight at 7:45?
HARRY: Better make it quarter to eight. I've got a few things to take care of first.
SHATTERED LLOYD: WATCHING ALL THIS IN DISBELIEF.
LLOYD: Some best man.
HARRY: It doesn't make any sense, Lloyd. She told me ten o'clock sharp. Are you sure you went to the right bar?
LLOYD: Believe me, it was the right place.
HARRY: I have a hard time believing that, Lloyd. The girl said she couldn't wait to see you again.
LLOYD: It just occurred to me. She must've meant ten o'clock at night.
HARRY: It just occurred to me. She must've meant ten o'clock at night.
LLOYD: ( brightening ) Do ya think.?
HARRY: Of course! Why would she have you meet her at a bar at ten in the I just figured she was a raging
LLOYD: ( shrugging ) I just figured she was a raging
HARRY: Boy, aren't we a couple of beauties?
LLOYD: I knew there was an explanation. And here I thought she was standing me That'll teach you to jump to Anyway, since you have your night
HARRY: That'll teach you to jump to Anyway, since you have your night
LLOYD: Will you join me in a good luck toast before you head out?
HARRY: ( o.s. ) Sure thing, pal. Whatever you think will help your chances.
LLOYD: Pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't Uh. it's for mature audiences. I on't wanna chance getting turned away at the door.
HARRY: Uh. it's for mature audiences. I on't wanna chance getting turned away at the door.
LLOYD: I see.
HARRY: He GULPS DOWN THE DRINK.
MARY: Hi. Come on in.
MARY: Make yourself at home. I'm almost ready. Just give me one more minute.
MARY: ( o.s. ) Are you in there, Harry?
HARRY: ( nervously ) Be right out.
MARY: ( o.s. ) I hope you're not using the toilet. It's broken.
HARRY: ( o.s. ) It doesn't flush.
MARY: ( o.s. ) It doesn't flush.
HARRY: Um, no, I was just. shaving.
MARY: ( o.s. ) Yeah! I was running a little late. Thought this would save time.
HARRY: ( o.s. ) Yeah! I was running a little late. Thought this would save time.
MARY: Okay. Well I'll be in the living room whenever you're ready.
HARRY: ( under breath ) Come on, flush, you bastard.
REPORTER: We'll be back in a minute with the story of the blind Indiana boy who was duped into buying a dead parakeet.
BLIND BOY: .I thought he was real quiet.
MARY: ( beat ) Don't you remember me?
LLOYD: ( beat ) Don't you remember me?
MARY: Um. I'm not really.
LLOYD: South Bend. I drove you to the airport last week.
MARY: ( dawning on her ) Oh my god. Lloyd, right?
LLOYD: You remembered.
MARY: What are you doing in Aspen?
LLOYD: I brought you your briefcase You left it at the airport so I picked it up for you.
MARY: You're the one who took my briefcase?
LLOYD: Yeah, it's back at my hotel room. Come on, let's take a ride. I'll give it to you. Wait right here.
MARY: Wait right here.
HARRY: Uh. just cleaning my teeth. Give me a minute, Mary, I'll be right with you.

HARRY: CUT TO:
ANDRE: They're mine.
LLOYD: ..So anyway, as soon as I got to town I tried to look you up but I idn't know your last name. I don't believe it. You really have 'Course I have it. When Lloyd Christmas drives a woman to the airport, he makes sure she gets all her luggage, no matter what he has
MARY: I don't believe it. You really have 'Course I have it. When Lloyd Christmas drives a woman to the airport, he makes sure she gets all her luggage, no matter what he has
LLOYD: 'Course I have it. When Lloyd Christmas drives a woman to the airport, he makes sure she gets all her luggage, no matter what he has
MARY: This is incredible. You mean to say you drove two thousand miles just for me?
