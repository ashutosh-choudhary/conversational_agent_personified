CHRISTY: You did what?
VINCE: For the first time in I don't know how long. I wanted everything done right. Open and above board. I told Father Antonelli I was in love. I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
CHRISTY: ( starting to fall for it )
VINCE: ( looking deep into her eyes )
CHRISTY: ( outraged )
VINCE: You want me to go against a priest? Get excommunicated? You think I'm nuts?

MICHELLE: But what about us?
TINA: You taught us the act. The songs, all the moves.

CHRISTY: His ashes?
JOEY: With love.
MICHELLE: From Vince! With love!
TINA: Michelle and Tina can't restrain themselves: they open the box. Inside is a rather gaudy fur coat. Michelle and Tina are impressed.

EDDIE: From Vince? What a guy. Doo-lang, doo- At least he's not a cop. At least he can afford a decent gift.
CHRISTY: At least he's not a cop. At least he can afford a decent gift.
EDDIE: I used to buy.you,..stuff. On your birthday . When we were seeing each Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? Lottery tickets? A travel iron?
CHRISTY: Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? Lottery tickets? A travel iron?
EDDIE: So I don't shop.
CHRISTY: 'Cause you're always out, arresting people. Making trouble. I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing! I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
EDDIE: Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then. I told people you were a hooker!
MICHELLE: Calm down, you two. It's always like Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' better class of people. Vince Laflocca.

CHRISTY: He's a businessman.
EDDIE: A what? When are you qonna wake up?

EDDIE: Information, baby. I thought maybe somebody around here might have a Think again! And get out of here.
CHRISTY: Think again! And get out of here.
EDDIE: I'm going. My regards to Vince, And the Mrs.
EDDIE: Eddie leaves. Christy is standing, absolutely furious.
CHRISTY: That's it! I'm not taking it from him, and I'm not taking it from Vince! From now on, it's all about me! And if I can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with it it's gone. Like Sister Immaculata used to say, "Life is short, and then you fry." So long, girls see you in
VINCE: Ernie Schmidt. How long you been with us, Ernie Schmidt?
ERNIE: Three years, Mr. LaRocca. One behind the bar, two as croupier.
VINCE: Ernie, you know what's important to me? What counts? It's not all this. This is ' what? Frosting. Loyalty. That's me, Ernie. That's home.
VINCE: You ain't been loyal, Ernie. What did you tell the cops?
ERNIE: I didn't tell the cops anything. I
VINCE: Joey slams Ernie on the side of the head with the gun.
VINCE: Who else, Ernie? Who else was in on it?
ERNIE: ( moaning )
VINCE: ( dropping Ernie's head in disgust )
CHRISTY: Won't need that anymore. Ta-ta.
VINCE: Do it.
CHRISTY: Stuff this up your.
VINCE: ( icy calm )
VINCE: Christy. Is there a problem? With the
CHRISTY: No. it's fine.
VINCE: Thanks. A lot.
CHRISTY: Thanks. A lot.
VINCE: Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
CHRISTY: And to say you're sorry. About this afternoon. And the things you said. Forgotten. Completely. Do you understand? Forgotten.
VINCE: And to say you're sorry. About this afternoon. And the things you said. Forgotten. Completely. Do you understand? Forgotten.
CHRISTY: ( catching the subtext )
VINCE: That's my girl. My girl in mink. Will you be home? Soon?
CHRISTY: Right. I'll be. at the apartment. Call me. Thanks. Again.
CHRISTY: Mink. Wow. Vince is she. okay?
JOEY: Vince is she. okay?
VINCE: ( considering this )
WILLY: I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
VINCE: She did. Bring her back. Now. For a talk.
JOEY: And if she runs?
VINCE: ( icy )
JOEY: Christy? He only wants to talk to you!
WILLY: There is a stuffed toy, a "Garfield the Cat," attached to the wall near Christy, with suction cups. Christy tries to pull the cat's feet off the wall, very quietly.
JOEY: Christy finally just yanks the cat off the wall. She hurls it as high and as far as she can, to the opposite end of the room. ANGLE on the flying stuffed cat. Joey sees the blur of the cat; he SHOOTS it, and the cat Christy steadies herself against a Xerox machine. She accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and starts HUMMING. ANGLE on Willy, as he hears the Xerox machine. He quickly moves toward the SOUND. Willy reaches the Xerox machine; the area is deserted. He starts moving quickly down the aisle A chair, the kind on casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways; the chair hits Willy and he falls. Christy runs out of the cubicle; Willy is on the floor, struggling to get up. As Christy sprints away, Willy SHOOTS at her. He misses, but a glass partition SHATTERS. Christy runs for an open elevator, but it has been summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to close. She runs even faster. A BULLET whistles past her ear and hits the back wall of the elevator. She reaches for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone. Christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs into a stairwell as two more BULLETS bite pieces out of the INT. STAIRWELL Taking the stairs three at a time, Christy is flying, still clutching the mink. The thugs are gaining on her. A BULLET hits metal and RICOCHETS off several walls and Page 15. At the next landing, Christy opens the door and ducks into a corridor.
JOEY: Come on, Christy! There's no place to
JOEY: Which way?
CHRISTY: Right between the eyes! Down and out! The guy was gone! I. I couldn't believe it!
EDDIE: You couldn't believe it? Vince the I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me! They tried to kill me! I'm not kidding!
CHRISTY: I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me! They tried to kill me! I'm not kidding!
CLARKSON: Tough break. Whoa.
EDDIE: What did you expect? Vince is as dirty as they come. We've been finding bodies around here for years.
CHRISTY: I don't know anything about bodies! I mean, he didn't bring it home. He was good to me. sometimes. He was sweet. He took care of me. Who am I supposed to go out with? He owns a casino. He let me sing.
EDDIE: He didn't do you a favor.
CHRISTY: Screw you!
TATE: Come on, she'll sing great. When she sings for us.
CHRISTY: Sing like testify? Are you nuts? I just want you to protect me! You're Busy cops. We don't have time to be bodyguards for anyone who comes in here with some cockamamie story. Mink coats and laundry chutes.
TATE: Busy cops. We don't have time to be bodyguards for anyone who comes in here with some cockamamie story. Mink coats and laundry chutes.
CLARKSON: Unless, of course, you're willing to
CHRISTY: What is this, some squeeze play? Can't you just protect me without any strings?
EDDIE: We could put you into our witness protection program.
TATE: A hiding place.
CLARKSON: A new identity.
EDDIE: But you'd have to agree to testify. The whole nine yards.
CHRISTY: And if I don't?
EDDIE: Then-you run.
TATE: You wait.
CLARKSON: You listen for the footsteps.
EDDIE: Then one day they find you.
TATE: They open a window.
CLARKSON: It's ten flights up.
TATE: Ten flights down.
CHRISTY: Ten flights?
EDDIE: You'd lose. You'd die. All over the sidewalk. And into the street.
CHRISTY: All right! I get the picture! I'll do it! I'll testify!
EDDIE: ( to Tate )
CHRISTY: Okay, here's what I want. I know about this stuff. A five-star hotel. With room service.
EDDIE: Maybe Hawaii.
CLARKSON: Diamond Head.
CHRISTY: Yeah. And I'll need a new look. Like a Maybe Armani.
EDDIE: Maybe Armani.
CLARKSON: No Calvin Klein.
CHRISTY: For sportswear. And a limo. And my hair up?
CLARKSON: It could work.
EDDIE: Jesus, what do you think this is Wheel of Fortune? Let me spell it out for you. You have to hide like you don't even exist. You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
CHRISTY: ( confused )
EDDIE: No nothing.
CHRISTY: What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
EDDIE: I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
CHRISTY: ( to Eddie )
EDDIE: Safest place in the world. You think Vince would look for you here?
CHRISTY: Nuns, Eddie. There are nuns here. Everywhere. It's crawling with 'em.
EDDIE: It's a convent. All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
CHRISTY: With nuns? With rulers? No way. I'm gonna go back, work things out with
EDDIE: Vince has put out a contract on you. A hundred grand. You've seen him in
CHRISTY: But. but Vince loves me. How could he. I mean, five years.
EDDIE: And one bullet. That's all it's gonna But Vince has contacts all over the place! This is San Francisco! They'll be looking for me!
CHRISTY: ( suddenly scared )
EDDIE: Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent. Nobody knows you're here but me. We're trying to get a quick court date. A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
CHRISTY: ( panicking )
EDDIE: ( smiling )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Absolutely not. I am very sorry, but We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite all in one
O'HARA: We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite all in one
MOTHER SUPERIOR: But she's been exposed to the underside of life. She is the underside of life.
O'HARA: And therefore an ideal prospect for We're a small convent, Bishop. Surely there are. more appropriate shelters.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: We're a small convent, Bishop. Surely there are. more appropriate shelters.
O'HARA: Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother. The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: But, Bishop.
O'HARA: St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality. To all in need.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I lied.
O'HARA: I know. Welcome, Lieutenant. Everything is in Aces. Bishop maybe a cup of coffee, down at the corner? Hey, you're not leaving me alone.
O'HARA: Welcome, Lieutenant. Everything is in Aces. Bishop maybe a cup of coffee, down at the corner? Hey, you're not leaving me alone.
EDDIE: Aces. Bishop maybe a cup of coffee, down at the corner? Hey, you're not leaving me alone.
CHRISTY: Hey, you're not leaving me alone.
O'HARA: ( reassuringly )
EDDIE: One month, two tops. Behave yourself.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( a last-ditch attempt )
O'HARA: ( opening the door to leave )
CHRISTY: A convent? They put me in a convent? What's the problem? Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( very calm )
CHRISTY: Mother Theresa. Gandhi. Don't you understand? This is all a mistake. I'm the good guy. I'm the witness. And I'm being punished!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Your name?
CHRISTY: Christy. Christy Van Cartier.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Enough joking.
CHRISTY: That's my real name! Currently I'm a singer. Sort of.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Very well.
CHRISTY: Oh my God. This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening. It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: St. Anne's?
CHRISTY: Parochial school. Akron. St. You were unhappy?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You were unhappy?
CHRISTY: I was expelled! When I was fifteen?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The reason?
CHRISTY: Beats me! What do you think? Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone. And wearing a black bra, under my uniform. The demon I see.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I see.
CHRISTY: You see? You see? I have to get out of here I have to make a phone call. Don't you get it? I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( very stern )
CHRISTY: Mother Superior rises. She is an extremely imposing Christy sits in a wooden chair across from Mother
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Christy sits in a wooden chair across from Mother
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Miss Van Cartier.
CHRISTY: ( belligerent )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Your cigarette out.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( ruefully )
CHRISTY: MOTHER SUPERIOR ( staring at Christy's outfit ) Spandex. And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I joined this convent some thirty years ago. At that time, the world knew some measure of peace. And hope. Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise. And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed. Drugs. Gangs. Are you talking about me?
CHRISTY: Are you talking about me?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: And all those like you.
CHRISTY: You mean black people?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Absolutely not. I mean the wicked. The heedless. And their Las Vegas
CHRISTY: ( very suspicious ) What's a concubine?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Check your driver's license.
CHRISTY: Fine. Got it. Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right? I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice. So here's the deal I don't bug you, you don't bug me. I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low. So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb. Capisce?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( suspiciously gracious )
CHRISTY: Cool. Is there a menu? Or buffet?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Before we do, you might like to freshen up. And you'll certainly want to change
CHRISTY: ( sniffing her clothes, the same outfit she's had on since the night at Vince's office )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Would you like that?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Excused. Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
CHRISTY: ( almost unable to speak )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all. While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are. You will not disrupt the convent. You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
CHRISTY: ( furious, in disbelief )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
CHRISTY: ( outraged )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola. There are three vows that every nun must accept. The vow of No problem.
CHRISTY: ( pulling out her pockets )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The vow of obedience.
CHRISTY: Like to who?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: And the vow of chastity.
CHRISTY: I'm outta here.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Good afternoon, Sisters. I apologize for my tardiness. I would like you to welcome a new member of our order, Sister Mary Clarence.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Mary Clarence comes to us from a somewhat more progressive convent. She is eager for a more disciplined life, and will make every effort to conform to our
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Yes, Mary Patrick?
MARY PATRICK: Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
MARY PATRICK: As part of our welcome, I've had a little thought, just for fun. Could we have our new friend offer today's
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( reluctantly )
CHRISTY: A blessing? Like, for lunch?
CHRISTY: ( trying to recall a blessing )
CHRISTY: may the Lord. prepare us and. watch us and. walk through the valley and be our shepherd and. to the republic for which it stands. God bless us every one, hallowed be thy name. Hallelujah. Ave Maria. Boyardee. Amen.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
CHRISTY: A what?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence. Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be Silence? No talking? All day?
CHRISTY: Silence? No talking? All day?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Until sundown.
CHRISTY: ( mouthing the words. without speaking aloud )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: And Mary Clarence?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
CHRISTY: ( mouthing the words )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: A fast. To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to No food?
CHRISTY: ( mouthing )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( taking away Christy's plate )
VINCE: They grilled me for six hours in there. And my hotshot lawyer where the hell were you?
LARRY: It takes time, Vince. Slow and steady. We've been through this before.
EDDIE: So long, Vince. See you soon.
VINCE: He's so damn cocky. This is different.
JOEY: It's a bluff, Vince.
VINCE: You know so much. They've got Christy, and we've got to find her. Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge. Fax it to every contact we got.
LARRY: I can't hear this. I'm an attorney, Vince, and you're just an honest casino owner. Object of a witch hunt. Innocent Keep the message vague, but let 'em know. The price has gone up. Christy Van Cartier a quarter of a million. Dead or nearby.
VINCE: Keep the message vague, but let 'em know. The price has gone up. Christy Van Cartier a quarter of a million. Dead or nearby.
CHRISTY: Is this all the food I get?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Yes. Until breakfast.
CHRISTY: That's tomorrow! Don't you have any snacks? Machines?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
CHRISTY: My what?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Your cell. Your room.
CHRISTY: ( looking around )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Our lives are simple. We have little need for material possessions.
CHRISTY: Right, sure thing. But what about, like, appliances? Like a little color portable? Boom box?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Useless distractions.
CHRISTY: ( sinking to the bed )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: And whom would you call?
CHRISTY: Oh, I don't know. Satan?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( not amused )
CHRISTY: Right. So what do we do now? Ping- Pong? Row over to the monastery?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams.
CHRISTY: Wait. No. You're kidding. Lights out? At nine? My day's just starting.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I'm sure. If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life. And its direction. Or lack thereof.
CHRISTY: ( indignant )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: From all I've heard, just about everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
CHRISTY: Mary Robert, in her nightshirt, stands outside.
MARY ROBERT: Come on, we're late.
CHRISTY: What? What time is it?
MARY ROBERT: It's after five. We have to bathe.
CHRISTY: ( groaning )
MARY PATRICK: ( sincerely )
CHRISTY: MARY ROBERT
MARY ROBERT: Is this like your old convent?
MARY PATRICK: Which convent was that, Sister?
CHRISTY: Which convent? It was, um, the Little Sisters. of the Moonlight. In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass. Frank. Dean. Sammy. Right at ringside.
MARY LAZARUS: Enough jabber.
CHRISTY: MARY LAZARUS
MARY LAZARUS: Progressive convents. Vanity. It sounds awful. It sounds just like this Like this place?
CHRISTY: Like this place?
MARY LAZARUS: I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods. It wasn't all modern, like here. No electricity. Cold water. Bare feet. Those were nuns. It was Hell on earth, but I loved it. This place is a
CHRISTY: MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK AND YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE
CHRISTY: MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK HE'S GONNA SAVE MY REPUTATION
CHRISTY: IF I WERE YOU, I'D TAKE A PERMANENT VACATION HEY-LA, HEY-LA MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
CHRISTY: Where did that come from?
MARY PATRICK: I haven't heard that song in ages. The You know that song?
MARY LAZARUS: ( very grouchy )
CHRISTY: You know that song?
MARY PATRICK: 1961? '62? Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows. It's the last secular music we recall.
CHRISTY: HEY HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING HEY-LA, HEY LA
MARY LAZARUS: ( cutting off the song )
CHRISTY: Anybody got conditioner?
O'HARA: We are a small congregation this morning. Too many mornings. Something has gone terribly wrong. Where is faith? Where is celebration? Where is everyone? Still, rather than regret the absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice in the fellowship of those present. Our choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has informed me that our choir, while always superior, has been toiling especially hard on this week's selection. Sister?
CLARKSON: There was a raid on a pawnshop in L.A. this morning. The place was fencing stolen property. They found this.
EDDIE: Jesus. Data-base hoods. It's a wonderful world. Beloved daughter missing. Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so. Dead or alive.
TATE: Vince is getting desperate. Where is she, Eddie? Where'd you stash her?
EDDIE: Where's who?
TATE: You won't even tell us?
EDDIE: I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
MARY PATRICK: Good afternoon, young ladies. And welcome to our Christian Youth Group.
MARY PATRICK: Hi. I hope we'll have some fun, and maybe learn a little something, too. Now, today's topic is something very up-to- date "Teenage Promiscuity." My. Now, can anyone tell me just what is
MARY PATRICK: Anyone? Yes?
LAWANDA: Uh, it's like, you know, doin' it. A whole lot. Till your head falls off.
MARY PATRICK: ( blushing )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Sister Mary Patrick?
MARY PATRICK: MOTHER SUPERIOR
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I need to see you, at once. Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments. Mary Clarence?
CHRISTY: MOTHER SUPERIOR
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return. Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage. Do not attempt discussion. Am I understood?
CHRISTY: I got it.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( to Mary Patrick )
CHRISTY: So, hi there. I'm. Sister Mary Clarence. And you're. young Christians. I guess I should assign you this passage. What's good? What were you talking about?
LAWANDA: We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
CHRISTY: ( after a beat )
CHARLENE: Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing it. You know she thinks it's a sin.
CHRISTY: ( trying to behave )
LAWANDA: ( goading Christy )
CHRISTY: ( still trying to behave )
CHRISTY: Excuse me just what are you all doing here? At Sunday School?
LAWANDA: 'Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation.
CHRISTY: Yeah. We all got caught. Shoplifting. Cuttin' school. Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade. So we gotta come here. So we'll be good, in the future. So we'll learn valuable lessons. And I learned mine. I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again. Can I go now?
CHARLENE: Yeah. We all got caught. Shoplifting. Cuttin' school. Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade. So we gotta come here. So we'll be good, in the future. So we'll learn valuable lessons. And I learned mine. I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again. Can I go now?
CHRISTY: ( getting fed up )
LAWANDA: Well, what would you know about it, anyway? What do any of you nunheads know about anything? About doin' the nasty, or gettin' high?
CONCHITA: Leave her alone, Lawanda, she's just some ol' nun! Don't pick on no nun, it's bad luck!
CHRISTY: ( fed up )
CHRISTY: Okay, so maybe I'm a nun so, you want to ask me something? You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
CHARLENE: What about crack? You a user?
CHRISTY: I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
KESHIA: Got you, Charlene!
CONCHITA: Dunked by the nun!
LAWANDA: ( more sincerely )
CHRISTY: And you listen to that?
LAWANDA: No, but. I don't know. sometimes.
CHRISTY: Hey, I know, it's hard. But do what I What you do?
LAWANDA: ( puzzled )
CHRISTY: Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't I'm a nun.
CHARLENE: But, like what if you are doin' it? What about protection? Who's responsible?
CONCHITA: What about them things, you know, for the guy? Aren't they like, a mess to put on? Don't they kinda mess up the mood?
CHRISTY: Deal with it, sweet thing. It's important, nowadays. You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
CHRISTY: ( thinking on her feet )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: A balloon and a banana! Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
CHRISTY: Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough. I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age. I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: This is a convent, not a clinic. We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
CHRISTY: Have you been out in those streets? Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: We are nuns. We seek solutions through
CHRISTY: Sometimes it's not enough!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You are correct. Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation. Such as your own, for example. How do you feel about physical labor?
CHRISTY: It never solves anything.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27? He spoke unto a wastrel youth. He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of In English?
CHRISTY: In English?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: How to put it. ah, Of course, Mary Clarence. "No pain, no gain."
VINCE: ( very seductive )
VINCE: Soon, you gorgeous thing. tell me. how lonely?
WILLY: It's that call you were expecting, Can you hold? Can you try?
VINCE: Can you hold? Can you try?
VINCE: Have you found out where Christy is yet? Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! You want to try making it on a cop's salary? Find her, and find her now!
VINCE: Raise the ante to three hundred grand.
VINCE: Sorry, baby. you are? Totally? Not a stitch?. Yeah, I'm naked too.
MARY PATRICK: The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver. Have you ever used a Not in years.
CHRISTY: Not in years.
MARY PATRICK: Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
CHRISTY: MARY PATRICK
MARY PATRICK: To sell, of course. I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's. We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
CHRISTY: But don't you get money? From the
MARY PATRICK: Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely self-supporting. Like all convents. Like Oh, right. At my old place, we used to. wash cars. Groom dogs. So. nice Isn't it lovely?

Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. Keep tension on the warp. Is that clear?

CHRISTY: Really catching on.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the office. Mary Clarence, carry on.
CHRISTY: I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Months of work, and the loom, absolutely Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
CHRISTY: Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
CHRISTY: ( into phone )
EDDIE'S VOICE: Christy cups her hand around the phone and speaks quietly and frantically. INTERCUT between Christy and Eddie.
CHRISTY: Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
EDDIE: Not again. You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you But I'm going insane! All these people do is pray and work, work and pray! I don't get it when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food! Gruel it's like Alpo for nuns!

CHRISTY: But I'm going insane! All these people do is pray and work, work and pray! I don't get it when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food! Gruel it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie anything fall off yet? Get me outta her!
EDDIE: Calm down. Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
CHRISTY: Like what?
EDDIE: Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
CHRISTY: You son-of-a-bitch!
EDDIE: I just need a few more weeks,
CHRISTY: But it's a nightmare! Mother Superior is out to get me! She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
CHRISTY: ( holding the phone out )
EDDIE: Don't call again. It's not safe. I'll be in touch.
CHRISTY: THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF
CHRISTY: ( without moving )
CHRISTY: What? What does she want now? I did the dishes. I oiled the pews. I dusted the hymnals. Two hundred hymnals. Why can't people share?
MARY ROBERT: ( not speaking above a whisper )
CHRISTY: MARY ROBERT
MARY ROBERT: I. I brought you something.
CHRISTY: A cigarette?
MARY ROBERT: An extra heel of bread. Please take it, you need your strength. You've been working so hard.
CHRISTY: Thanks. So which one are you? Sister Bruce? Sister Doug?
MARY ROBERT: ( until almost whispering )
CHRISTY: Right. Okay. Bob. Nice to know you. So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. Three years. Sister.
CHRISTY: So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. Three years. Sister.
MARY ROBERT: Three years. Sister.
CHRISTY: Three years. A rookie.
MARY ROBERT: A novice.
CHRISTY: Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time? You know, when do you take the final vows?
CHRISTY: Whoa! Bob! What's going on here? What'd I say?
MARY ROBERT: ( still sobbing )
CHRISTY: Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you? Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents? We can call the No, you don't understand I don't want to get out! I want to get in?
MARY ROBERT: No, you don't understand I don't want to get out! I want to get in?
CHRISTY: Excuse me?
MARY ROBERT: Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy. I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let She won't? Why not?
CHRISTY: She won't? Why not?
MARY ROBERT: She says I should wait. She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. In a mature manner.
CHRISTY: She said that? Reverend Mother?
CHRISTY: Well, then there's only one thing to do.
MARY ROBERT: Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life. In order to make a responsible decision. This is going to be very painful for me. You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent. Wait.
CHRISTY: Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life. In order to make a responsible decision. This is going to be very painful for me. You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent. Wait.
CHRISTY: ( to Jesus ) ( she gestures to Mary Robert ) ( desperate )
CHRISTY: We must do this sacred thing, Mary Of course! We must do it! It's the will of God! What is it?
MARY ROBERT: ( desperate )
CHRISTY: ( shutting her eyes, for the full spiritual effect )
MARY ROBERT: Are you sure?
CHRISTY: ( to Jesus )
MARY ROBERT: ( looking around cautiously )
CHRISTY: I know it is. It's life. Experience. Take a deep breath.
MARY ROBERT: ( shocked )
CHRISTY: Now you.
CHRISTY: It's a start.
CHRISTY: How are you doing.
LAWANDA: ( puzzled )
CHRISTY: You know it.
MARY ROBERT: We need experience.
CHRISTY: ( remembering she's a nun )
CHRISTY: And you, with the devil's brew passing through your lips. A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
CHRISTY: ( shocked )
MARY ROBERT: Experience! Right?
CHRISTY: The club is alive with activity; the bar is crowded, couples are making out at small tables, and the dance floor is packed. The atmosphere is a combination of hazy darkness and colored lights; the club should have the feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all ages and races. The MUSIC percolates, and Christy starts to move to it. She and Mary Robert find a table in the corner, and signal a nearby waitress.
CHRISTY: A couple of bowls of chili. And another round of these.
MARY ROBERT: ( to the waitress, confidentially ) ( to the waitress )
CHRISTY: ( to the waitress )
MARY ROBERT: Page 53
CHRISTY: ( to the waitress )
MARY ROBERT: Who are all these people?
CHRISTY: This is your neighborhood. Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
DUDE: Hey, Sisters how you doin'?
CHRISTY: ( flirting )
DUDE: How come they let you out? Out of that convent place?
CHRISTY: Time off. For bad behavior.
DUDE: Oww! A nun havin' fun! I don't believe it! It's good to have you ladies in this fine establishment. So. anybody on the I am.
MARY ROBERT: ( standing up )
CHRISTY: Bob! What're you doing?
MARY ROBERT: I'm getting experience.
CHRISTY: ( to the Dude )
MARY ROBERT: Those people are wonderful! Why don't we ever see them in church?
CHRISTY: Good point. Especially that dude you were with. I'd like to see him down Mary Clarence! You're so. different from the other sisters. Sometimes, well. sometimes you sound more like a
MARY ROBERT: ( giggling )
CHRISTY: As the two women laugh together, they don't notice the car that begins to follow them, creeping slowly forward with its headlights out. Page 55.
MARY ROBERT: I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences. I've learned so much.
CHRISTY: Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything. I mean, nothing really happened. We just. took a walk.
CHRISTY: ( to Mary Robert )
MARY ROBERT: Mary Clarence!
CHRISTY: Keep moving!
CHRISTY: Climb! Now!
CHRISTY: Goddamn it!
MARY ROBERT: Mary Clarence!
MARY ROBERT: Oh my Lord!
CHRISTY: ( pushing Mary Robert forward )
MARY ROBERT: What was all that? Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
CHRISTY: I don't know, some people just don't like nuns. I wish I had a ruler.
MARY ROBERT: We could have been killed! But you saved me! Thank you, Mary Clarence! Yes thank you so much.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Yes thank you so much.
CHRISTY: What'd she say?
EDDIE: You blew it big time. She doesn't want you back.
CHRISTY: Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
EDDIE: She's counting on it. She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
CHRISTY: So what am I supposed to do in the Go in and talk to her. It can't hurt. So. hi there.
EDDIE: Go in and talk to her. It can't hurt. So. hi there.
CHRISTY: So. hi there.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( not amused and not looking up )
CHRISTY: Look. I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
CHRISTY: I know! I'm sorry I didn't mean for it to happen! And I was the one they were shooting at!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity. To change. To make a decent life for yourself.
CHRISTY: A decent life? Excuse me? As what? A Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
CHRISTY: But you can't kick me out! Guys want to kill me! You're a nun! A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep? I mean, I'm a major sinner! All-time great! Hall of Fame! Aren't I, like, your dream come true? Your Olympic event?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
CHRISTY: ( surprised )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You may stay. But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
CHRISTY: ( with great dread )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You have, I believe, some minimal background in music. Therefore, you are to join our choir.
CHRISTY: No. No.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( smiling )
CHRISTY: Not the choir, please, anything but that. The choir I mean, have you heard them? I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( in triumph )
CHRISTY: Is this. choir practice?
MARY PATRICK: Sure is! Come on in, and sing a spell.
CHRISTY: Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last Now stop that. You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience. I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but I don't know if she understood. Soprano or alto?
MARY ROBERT: Now stop that. You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience. I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but I don't know if she understood. Soprano or alto?
MARY LAZARUS: Soprano or alto?
CHRISTY: ( very gloomy )
JOEY: We're looking for Mike.
MIKE: You found him but we're not open yet.
MIKE: Hey the till's empty!
JOEY: I'm sorry I don't know what gets into Who are you guys?
MIKE: Who are you guys?
JOEY: We're the guys from Vegas. You had Christy last night, but you let her get away. It's upsetting.
MIKE: But you didn't tell me!
JOEY: We didn't tell you what?
MIKE: That she's a nun! That chick you're looking for she's a nun!
WILLY: What? Christy?
JOEY: A nun?
MIKE: I'm telling you!
WILLY: Gimme a hand here.
JOEY: A nun!
MARY LAZARUS: Mary Clarence, are you with us?
CHRISTY: Um, I don't really know this one.
MARY ROBERT: Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
MARY PATRICK: ( eagerly )
CHRISTY: Sure. Kind of. free-lance.
MARY LAZARUS: ( circling Christy )
CHRISTY: MARY LAZARUS
MARY LAZARUS: You're a ringer. She brought you in to replace me. Out with the old.
CHRISTY: Hold on.
MARY PATRICK: Mary Clarence, could you? Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but. Could you help us?
ANOTHER NUN: ANOTHER NUN
ANOTHER NUN: You've heard us.
MARY LAZARUS: Everyone falls silent. Mary Lazarus walks across the room, eyeballing each member of the choir.
MARY LAZARUS: There's a word for this mutiny. So, Mary Clarence, you think you can do better. I believe I'd like to see that. I'm out to pasture. Dry dock. The glue factory. Go ahead, Sister make 'em
CHRISTY: ( to Nary Lazarus )
CHRISTY: LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
CHRISTY: Man. I sound like you guys.
MARY LAZARUS: ( victorious )
CHRISTY: ( standing )
MARY ROBERT: Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.
CHRISTY: Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.
MARY ROBERT: I don't want to mess anyone up.
CHRISTY: ( to Sister Alma ) ( because Sister Alma is hard of hearing )
A C!: Sister Alma plays the note. Christy points the baton at Mary Robert. Mary Robert whispers the note.
CHRISTY: Louder! Like you're onstage.
CHRISTY: Like people are eating, and there's silverware, and you want them to hear
CHRISTY: Think about that guy you were dancing
MARY ROBERT: Oh my!
CHRISTY: You see? We've got the voices. They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower you're decent. Better than me. We just need charts harmony chops.
MARY PATRICK: ( puzzled )
CHRISTY: The goods. The sound. The sale. Let's rearrange a few things. Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto. Get over here. Mary Robert with the sopranos.
CHRISTY: Sister Alma a C.
CHRISTY: Middle section, hold that note, for dear life. Sopranos, an A. Sister Alma?
MARY PATRICK: We did it! We actually sang a chord!
MARY ROBERT: ( thrilled and disconcerted )
CHRISTY: Yeah, for one second. That was the blend you've got to listen to each other. Be a group.
MARY LAZARUS: ( under her breath )
CHRISTY: Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline. Hard work.
MARY LAZARUS: Of course. I'm a nun. Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
CHRISTY: I hear you. How many days a week do you Two days. An hour or so.
MARY PATRICK: Two days. An hour or so.
CHRISTY: No way. We're a choir, right? Headliners. The big room. Two days a week won't cut it. Every day.
MARY LAZARUS: ( impressed )
MARY ROBERT: ( to Christy )
CHRISTY: I don't know. Mary Lazarus, what do you think? They're pretty raw.
MARY LAZARUS: Wet behind the ears.
CHRISTY: A bunch of real mama's girls.
MARY PATRICK: Oh, please? Can't we try?
CHRISTY: It'll be hell.
MARY LAZARUS: Tell me about it.
CHRISTY: INT. CONVENT LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY This is a basement utility room. A large industrial washer-dryer stands along one wall; the machine makes a repetitive CHUNG-CHUNG sound Page 66. The choir nuns are busily doing laundry; some iron, others fold sheets, others stack towels and garments on a long table. Christy is helping Mary Patrick fold a sheet. Everyone is working rhythmically, to the drone of the
CHRISTY: That machine.
MARY PATRICK: I know. It's ancient.
CHRISTY: It's a rhythm section. The beat.
CHRISTY: Mary Patrick do you remember the Dixie Cups?
MARY PATRICK: The Dixie Cups? Oh my. I was just a girl. Of course.
CHRISTY: ( stopping the beat )
MARY PATRICK: Am I?
MARY PATRICK: ( as a confession )
CHRISTY: So use it. When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration. Most music is. So don't hold back. Let all that joy go right into your voice. Make me happy. Let me hear it. Perk out. Perk down.
MARY PATRICK: ( with real joy )
CHRISTY: Because we're
MARY PATRICK: GOING TO THE CHAPEL OF LOVE!
NUNS: ( in unison )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Good morning, Sisters.
NUNS: GOING TO THE CHAPEL.

CHOIR: LET THY SPIRIT I think they hear you!
CHRISTY: I think they hear you!
MARY LAZARUS: LET THY SPIRIT LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLYI
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Gospel. A jazz solo on the organ. What next? Jesus goes to Rio? Good Friday-a- go-go? What were you thinking?
CHRISTY: I was thinking Las Vegas. Get some butts in those seats.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: And what next? Popcorn? Curtain calls? This is not a theater. or a casino.
CHRISTY: ( sincerely )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Through blasphemy? You have corrupted the entire choir!
CHRISTY: Hold on. That's not fair. I worked hard with them. They gave up their free time, and they loved it. Those women are happy. And we can get even better. We can wake this place up.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Out of the question.
CHRISTY: Please let me try. I'm begging you.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: And I am refusing. As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
BISHOP O'HARA: Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: BISHOP O'HARA MOTHER SUPERIOR
BISHOP O'HARA: I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years. What a marvelous program. Innovative. Inspiring. You are to be Well. thank you.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Well. thank you.
BISHOP O'HARA: I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again. Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music it called to them.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: BISHOP O'HARA
BISHOP O'HARA: I must tell the Cardinal. I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Christy has just been eating this up with a spoon.
CHRISTY: Excuse me, Bishop. Reverend Mother has some other ideas too. She's too modest to talk about it, but she thinks we should get out of the convent and into the neighborhood more. This woman.
MARY PATRICK: Bless her! There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve. That's why many of us became nuns. It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: ( confused by the turn things have taken ) ( with regard to Mother Superior )
CHRISTY: ( with regard to Mother Superior )
BISHOP O'HARA: ( to Mother Superior )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: But, Bishop, surely you realize this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
O'HARA: And you'll face that danger head-on. As if I could stop you. And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
CHRISTY: ( hugging Mother Superior from behind )
CHRISTY: ( rapping )
MARY ROBERT: ( rapping )
YOU: MARY PATRICK ( rapping )
MARY PATRICK: ( rapping )
MARY LAZARUS: ( rapping )
PLAN!: The parade goes on, the crowd gathers, and a general air of jubilance prevails.
CHRISTY: Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting. Make it look easy. Again!
MARY LAZARUS: Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
CHRISTY: Hopeless I
MARY LAZARUS: Amateurs 2
CHRISTY: MARY LAZARUS
MARY LAZARUS: EXT. CRACK HOUSE - NIGHT One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb. He starts toward the car as the DRIVER rolls down the window, but before he gets there, Christy and several nuns surround the car. Page 75.
CHRISTY: We're here to pray for you, brother.
DEALER: What? Get the hell out of here.
CHRISTY: We know you don't want to sell drugs. You just had an unhappy childhood, and maybe a learning disability. You just need someone to pray for you.
MARY PATRICK: We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
CHRISTY: And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse. And so you truly need our prayers.
DRIVER: What is this? Outta my way!
CHRISTY: Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
MARY ROBERT: ( to the Dealer )
MARY PATRICK: ( to cruising cars )
DEALER: You're hassling my customers! That's not legal! I know my rights. This is restriction of trade.
CHRISTY: You wanna call a cop?
MARY PATRICK: Are you going to shoot us all, tough Is it worth it? A lot of witnesses Can I get a witness?
MARY LAZARUS: Is it worth it? A lot of witnesses Can I get a witness?
CHRISTY: ( to the crowd )
DEALER: So I'll find another neighborhood to do my business. You can' t stop me.
CHRISTY: If we can stop you here, they can stop you there.
CONNIE: Vinnie, get in here. You gotta see
VINCE: What? Nuns? You got me in here to see nuns? Isn't there a ball game on or
CONNIE: Look she's adorable!
NEWS REPORTER: This tiny convent has experienced an amazing turnaround. The sisters have revitalized and taken back their neighborhood, all due to the energy and talent of the convent choir, a group led by this gifted young nun. Tell us, Mary Clarence1 what makes you so special?
CHRISTY: ( trying to appear modest and nun-like )
CHRISTY: Eddie! You scared the hell out of me!
EDDIE: What if I was Vince? You'd be dead right now. What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
CHRISTY: It wasn't my fault! They just showed up. It's helping the convent.
EDDIE: You're supposed to be hiding out!
CHRISTY: I really can't talk about it now. The place is packed. SRO. I've got a show to do.
EDDIE: Listen to yourself. This isn't a career I know that. This isn't about me. It's about the choir. You should hear them. They're good. Really good. And I taught them.
CHRISTY: I know that. This isn't about me. It's about the choir. You should hear them. They're good. Really good. And I taught them.
EDDIE: Jesus, look at you You're glowing.
CHRISTY: I am?
EDDIE: Yeah. You look. great. I mean it..
CHRISTY: ( flirting )
EDDIE: I've been worried about you.
CHRISTY: You mean worried about my testimony?
EDDIE: No worried about you. Personally.
CHRISTY: Well.. thanks. I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes. I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here. I mean, sometimes I feel like. a nun.
EDDIE: Me too.
CHRISTY: You're not. seeing anybody?
EDDIE: No. Most of the time I'm thinking about you. And now. you've really changed.
CHRISTY: I have?
EDDIE: You re sort of. radiant. your eyes are shining. You're rea1ly different. You're. you're a nun.
EDDIE: You're. you're a nun.
CHRISTY: We're in a convent!
CHRISTY: I've got to go.
EDDIE: Just remember - you're a target. Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
CHRISTY: ( trying to think straight )
CHRISTY: Magic time!
CHRISTY: This Sunday's hymn is inspired by the lesson of Mary Magdalene. You know the one. Mary Magdalene was a young lady with a past. She was no stranger to sin. She was no stranger to practically everybody. Many condemned her. The whole neighborhood. But one man refused to do so. One man said, hey now, wait a minute. Listen to the story.
CHRISTY: Hey, girls.
CHRISTY: Jerusalem is a real drag. Everybody hates me.
CHRISTY: People throw stones. They call me names. I mean, really.
CHRISTY: But wait.
MARY PATRICK: What is it, Mary?
CHRISTY: That man who is he?
MARY ROBERT: He's a carpenter.
MARY PATRICK: He's not like other guys.
MARY ROBERT: He's decent.
MARY PATRICK: He's kind.
CHRISTY: He's. dreamy. He's.
CHOIR: Yes, Mary?
CHRISTY: HE'S SO FINE.
CHOIR: DOO- LANG, DOO-LANG, DOO- LANG. WISH HE WAS MINE THAT HANDSOME GUY OVER THERE THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR
CHRISTY: Jackpot! Two buckets
MARY PATRICK: This is so exhilarating! All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
MARY ROBERT: I'd rather sing than do anything!
MARY PATRICK: It's better than ice cream.
MARY ROBERT: It's better than springtime.
CHRISTY: It's better than sex!
CHRISTY: ( catching herself )
O'HARA: Better and better, Sisters, you are truly an inspiration. And I bear gladsome tidings.
O'HARA: I've kept the Cardinal informed of your progress in the neighborhood. He has been most impressed. And he has invited you to attend a special evening Mass at St. Matthew's Cathedral on Sunday night1 to sing for the Council of Cardinals.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: That is indeed glorious news, Bishop. We will be honored to appear.
CHRISTY: What do you mean?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church. They command the utmost respect. Your more. secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
MARY PATRICK: But, Reverend Mother everyone loves our new style.
MARY ROBERT: It's brought people back to the church.
CHRISTY: Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
CHRISTY: A vote?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Of course. Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state. Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole. A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
CHRISTY: But. wait a minute.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The majority has spoken.
BISHOP O'HARA: Reverend Mother, as always, you are a true leader. Gracious and understanding.
MARY ROBERT: It will be wonderful, Reverend Mother. You'll see.
MARY LAZARUS: ( gesturing to Christy )
CHRISTY: MOTHER SUPERIOR
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I am certain the presentation will be a great success. Congratulations, Mary Clarence. And congratulations to you
CHRISTY: You sent for me?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You have a phone call.
CHRISTY: EDDIE'S VOICE
EDDIE'S VOICE: Good news, kid. I pulled a few strings the judge has agreed to move the trial up. We'll be in court in a couple of
CHRISTY: That soon?
EDDIE'S VOICE: Forty-eight hours and you'll be a free woman.
CHRISTY: Great. That's good to hear.
EDDIE'S VOICE: Hey, don't thank me or anything.
CHRISTY: Right, right thanks.
CHRISTY: Hey your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving. In just a couple of days.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Really. Well, that makes two of us.
CHRISTY: MOTHER SUPERIOR
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara. Privately. I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
CHRISTY: But why?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I must go where I can be of use.
CHRISTY: But there's so much more to do right here. And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Indeed. After how long? A few weeks? I have been here thirty years. And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
CHRISTY: But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: A part of what? Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
CHRISTY: Okay, so I just got things started. But you could build on that. You could keep it going.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I am sorry, Mary Clarence. I seem to have misplaced my tambourine. Good day, Mary Clarence.
CHRISTY: MOTHER SUPERIOR
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Good day.
CHRISTY'S VOICE: ( whispering )
MARY ROBERT: ( delighted )
MARY PATRICK: Mary Clarence you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
MARY LAZARUS: It's a sin. It's a wicked indulgence. Is this butter almond?
CHRISTY: It's contraband. Don't ask. But I wanted to give you a treat. A sort of. thank-you gift.
MARY ROBERT: A thank-you? For what? You're the one we should be thanking.
MARY LAZARUS: Is there any syrup?
CHRISTY: Well. see, at my old convent, I wasn't always. real popular. I was sort of selfish and. not real helpful. Okay, I'll say it I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you. maybe I'm shaping up.
MARY ROBERT: Mary Clarence, don't be silly. You're an example to us all. You've taught us so much. We're singing for the Cardinals, and then who knows? Maybe the choir can travel to schools, and nursing homes.
MARY PATRICK: Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
MARY LAZARUS: We could cut a demo. Look for a label.
CHRISTY: ( knowing she has to leave )
MARY ROBERT: ( worried )
CHRISTY: ( sincerely )
MARY LAZARUS: That's what Diana Ross said.
TATE: You're too late. Mulcahy just left.
PARKER: I need his signature on some things. They can't be processed without it.
TATE: Leave 'em. He'll sign 'em later.
TATE: What the hell is this.?
PARKER: Tate said you were gone.
EDDIE: I get all the way down to my car, and, of course where are the keys?
PARKER: I left the money vouchers with him. He said you'd sign them in the morning.
VINCE: This is it. Get ready to move. No mistakes. Grab her, get her to the Moonlight. We meet there, and we take care of her. We're on it. Give me the address.
TATE: St. Katherine's Convent on East Barton. It's gotta be the place.
EDDIE: You're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch!
EDDIE: Get him out of here! Downstairs, in the cell! I want his ass locked up now!
EDDIE: Clarkson, get on the other line. Call Frisco Central. Tell 'em to get two squad cars outside St. Katherine's convent, and stop anybody with an out-of- state license plate from getting near the
MARY ROBERT: The Council of Cardinals! I'm so nervous! What if I forget the words?
CHRISTY: Right to Hell. Just kidding. Where is that bus?
MARY PATRICK: It should be here any minute.
MARY LAZARUS: ( with a clipboard )
TONIGHT!": A Catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in front. Several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry onto the bus. A moment later, Eddie's police car streaks up to the side entrance of the convent, parking around the corner from the bus.
EDDIE: Reverend Mother! Quick! Where's What's wrong?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: What's wrong?
EDDIE: They know she's here! They're on their
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The rehearsal room!
MARY ROBERT: It's here! Let's go!
MARY PATRICK: Hurry, Sister!
CHRISTY: Get moving. I'm right behind you.
CHRISTY: Eddie grabs her hand and pulls her toward the side
EDDIE: Vince knows you're here.
CHRISTY: ( shocked and scared )
EDDIE: Long story. His goons will be here any minute. We've got to get you out of here '- now! I can't go with you.
CHRISTY: I can't go with you.
EDDIE: I've got a show at St. Matthew's Cathedral. We're singing for the You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
CHRISTY: I've got a show at St. Matthew's Cathedral. We're singing for the You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
EDDIE: You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
MARY PATRICK: Mary Clarence! Sister!
MARY ROBERT: It's no use. She just isn't here.
MARY PATRICK: It doesn't make any sense. She was right behind me. We can't sing without her! What should we do?
MARY ROBERT: We can't sing without her! What should we do?
MARY PATRICK: ( calming herself )
CHRISTY: Eddie I've got to go back. They won't sing without me. I'm deserting I think they'd understand.
EDDIE: I think they'd understand.
CHRISTY: That's not the point! They need me!
EDDIE: They need you? A bunch of nuns? For what? Moral guidance? Make-up tips?
CHRISTY: You don't get it! It's a big thing for them, it's like. Caesar's Palace. Prime-time. They're singing for the Cardinals. It's like. "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve
EDDIE: ( goading her )
CHRISTY: They're not nuns. They're like.. people. With one outfit.
JOEY: So that guy in the bar was right? She's like. some kind of nun?
WILLY: Yeah, right when I see it.
LAWANDA: You dudes looking for nuns? They all went to St. Matthew's.
JOEY: St, Matthew's? Thanks.
LAWANDA: Praise the Lord.
EDDIE: What're you doing?
CHRISTY: Even nuns have to pee.
CHRISTY: Okay, it's me. Mary Clarence. Christy. It's Chris Carter. I need some help here. I can't believe I'm doing this. Okay, look, I know I should just get back in the car, and get the hell out of here. Save my skin. I mean, it's not wrong, Vince really wants to kill me. Why do you make guys like Vince? But if I don't sing at St. Matthew's. Mary Robert. Mary Patrick. It means so much to them. They're counting on me and I like that. Maybe Reverend Mother is right, maybe I am a bad influence, maybe I'm just some Vegas slut, but. can we cut a deal here? I mean, I still don't believe in, like, most of the Commandments, and stuff in church still gives me the willies, but if I go back and sing, if I do a good deed, will you promise I won't get killed? All I want is a sign. Lightning. Thunder. Anything. No. No. Doesn't count.
CHRISTY: ( in disbelief )
CHRISTY: Oh my God.
CHRISTY: I'm late for church. Can I get a lift?
CARDINAL: Is this the choir you've been speaking so highly of, Bishop?
O'HARA: They're just a bit nervous. They'll be
MARY PATRICK: We sound terrible We need Mary We're losing it.
MARY LAZARUS: We're losing it.
MARY ROBERT: I don't understand. Where is she?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. Pull yourselves
FLOOR DIRECTOR: Okay, Sisters, we have to move on now. That was great, just great. Charlie, throw a spot on the pulpit. Let's get a
MARY ROBERT: You're here! Thank goodness!
CHRISTY: Excuse me where's the rehearsal room?
JOEY: The rehearsal room is right this way.
MARY ROBERT: Wait, this isn't the way. Who are you?
CHRISTY: They're from my old convent.
CHRISTY: Run! Take off!
MARY ROBERT: Revived Willy lunges for Mary Robert and grabs her. The two men hustle the two struggling nuns out the door to the Page 98.
WILLY: Joey starts the car, and it takes off with SQUEALING tires. Willy has his gun pointed at Christy, who sits beside Mary Robert.
MARY ROBERT: But what do they want? Where are we She's got nothing to do with this. Let her go.
CHRISTY: ( to Joey and Willy )
JOEY: Yeah, right to the cops. No way.
CHRISTY: Mary Robert, don't panic. Remember what we talked about? Experience?
JOEY: ( quickly, to Mary Robert )
CHRISTY: ( quickly, to Mary Robert )
CHRISTY: Mary Robert executes a perfect somersault onto the sidewalk. She looks to heaven, crosses herself and runs back to the cathedral. Willy grabs Christy before she can escape.
JOEY: She's gettin' away!
WILLY: Forget her! We got the one we need! Step on it!
MARY PATRICK: You mean they kidnapped her?
MARY ROBERT: Yes two men and they had guns.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: She shouldn't have come back. She knew she was in danger.
MARY PATRICK: But why would anyone kidnap a nun?
MARY LAZARUS: Were they Catholics?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: She isn't a nun. Her real name is Christy Van Cartier, and she is a professional entertainer. She witnessed a vicious crime, and has been hiding in our convent.
MARY ROBERT: An. entertainer?
MARY PATRICK: She wasn't a nun?
ANOTHER NUN: She lied to us?
MARY ROBERT: But. but. she was such a wonderful Look what she did with the choir. She made us sing beautifully.
MARY PATRICK: Look what she did with the choir. She made us sing beautifully.
MARY LAZARUS: That should have tipped us.
MARY ROBERT: Well, I don't care who she is. We can't sing without her!
MARY PATRICK: She's our inspiration!
MARY LAZARUS: She's the act!
MARY ROBERT: Reverend Mother, I know that you and Mary Clarence didn't always agree, but we've got to help her.
MARY PATRICK: We've got to save her!
MARY LAZARUS: We can't leave it up to the Feds!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
MARY ROBERT: She said they were from her old convent.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: But. she was a showgirl. She didn't have an old convent.
MARY PATRICK: She told us about one. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: All right. It's a beginning. Las Vegas, Nevada.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Mary Lazarus, find the Bishop and tell him the situation. Everyone else follow me.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Emergency! Open up!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The San Francisco airport! Immediately!
MARY LAZARUS: ( to the Driver )
EDDIE: Where is she?
O'HARA: There was a kidnapping. We think Las
MANAGER: Fifteen hundred for the run to Vegas. But we don't have fifteen hundred!
MARY PATRICK: But we don't have fifteen hundred!
MARY ROBERT: We're nuns!
MANAGER: Can't help you. No exceptions.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Young man!
MANAGER: MOTHER SUPERIOR
MOTHER SUPERIOR: We are nuns. We pray.
MANAGER: MOTHER SUPERIOR MARY PATRICK
MOTHER SUPERIOR: We pray for good things. Food for the Peace on Earth.
MARY PATRICK: Peace on Earth.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: However, we can also pray for other Tax audits. Come, Sisters. Let's go to chapel. Bring your beads.

MARY ROBERT: MARY LAZARUS MOTHER SUPERIOR
MARY LAZARUS: Tax audits. Come, Sisters. Let's go to chapel. Bring your beads.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Come, Sisters. Let's go to chapel. Bring your beads.
MANAGER: EXT. NIGHT SKY - LATER A plane sweeps through the desert sky, headed for Las Vegas. Through the windows of the plane, we see nuns staring out at the glittering city in the distance.
JOEY: We got her.
VINCE: ( turning on the charm )
VINCE: Babe, what happened here? Look at you.
CHRISTY: Good evening, Vincent.
VINCE: What, Vincent? This is me, doll. I know you. What did you think you were doing? Running to the cops. Hiding out. No, no. You're sorry now, aren't you?
CHRISTY: I am sorry for all my sins. And yours.
WILLY: She's a nun, Vince.
VINCE: ( kneeling by Christy )
CHRISTY: You will be judged, Vincent. We all What do you mean judged? I don't get judged, baby.
VINCE: What do you mean judged? I don't get judged, baby.
WILLY: She's acting weird, Vince. Ever since we picked her up.
JOEY: It's spooky. It's like she ain't even afraid or nothing.
VINCE: She's afraid. Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
CHRISTY: ( calmly )
VINCE: Who gives a damn? Waste her.
MARY PATRICK: It's so beautiful.
MARY ROBERT: And what a lovely name. Las Vegas.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: And Gommorah.
VINCE: It's done?
JOEY: Not. totally.
VINCE: ( disturbed )
WILLY: She's. she's a nun.
VINCE: Are you nuts? She's not a nun. It's Christy. She's a babe!
JOEY: But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
VINCE: It didn't happen.
WILLY: She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
JOEY: No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
VINCE: I can't believe this. Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
JOEY: Right. That way we'd never know which bullet got to her brain and killed her first. It could always be the other guy.
WILLY: Right. That way we'd never know which bullet got to her brain and killed her first. It could always be the other guy.
JOEY: Okay, we got one-two-three, and on three we both shoot. Got it?
WILLY: Got it.
JOEY: One. two.
JOEY: Neither man shoots. They look at each other with anger. Christy opens her eyes.
JOEY: You didn't shoot!
WILLY: Neither did you!
JOEY: I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
WILLY: That's what I figured, too.
MARY ROBERT: Las Vegas she's here somewhere.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: But where?
MARY PATRICK: Look! There she is!
MARY ROBERT: The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
MARY PATRICK: But how do we get there?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Stand back.
VINCE: It didn't work, Vince.
JOEY: It didn't work, Vince.
VINCE: You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
WILLY: We both missed.
VINCE: Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
JOEY: So, take it off.
VINCE: So, take it off.
WILLY: ( shocked )
JOEY: For like, twelve zillion eternities?
VINCE: I'm telling you, she's not a nun! Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
JOEY: Maybe pants.
WILLY: A sweater.
JOEY: And then we can ice her. No nun, no evil eye.
CLARKSON: Eddie jumps in the car. Clarkson turns on the red bubble light and the SIREN, and the car zooms off.
WILLY: We got it all worked out.
JOEY: Okay, Christy strip.
CHRISTY: That. thing. That nun thing. Take it
JOEY: That. thing. That nun thing. Take it
WILLY: What's she doing?
JOEY: She's praying.
CHRISTY: And God bless Joey and Willy, who are only trying to do their jobs. Pox fibula tibia vobiscum. Et marcus domino's pizza. Have mercy. Amen. I'm finished now. Help me up.
JOEY: There she goes! she's taking the stairs
I: They run quickly after her.
JOEY: Find Vince and tell him what happened. I'll take this side of the room.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Brace yourselves, Sisters.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Spread out and look for Mary Clarence. Try to blend in.
MARY PATRICK: Excuse me has anyone seen a nun?
MARY ROBERT: A Benedictine.
CROUPIER: Place your bets.
CHRISTY: ( to the Salesman )
SALESMAN: You sure? How do you know?
SALESMAN: ( to the Croupier )
CROUPIER: Black 14.
CHRISTY: Did you learn something?
EDDIE: ( to Clarkson )
CHRISTY: What are you doing here?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Saving you. Move!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The nuns split up, each taking a different direction. Vince and Joey look bewildered.
VINCE: Get her!
JOEY: Which one!
VINCE: The nun!
VINCE: The nun spins around; it is Mother Superior.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Vince releases her and frantically searches the crowd Joey catches up with his nun, only to find it is Mary Patrick. The shell game has worked; Christy has escaped for the moment.
EDDIE: Move in. Seal off the exits, but don't come inside till I tell you.
WILLY: There's nuns everywhere! Hundreds of
VINCE: There she is!
JOEY: Which one?
CHRISTY: Quick, there's another way out of here. Follow me.
VINCE: She's heading for the lounge! Go! Move in now!
EDDIE: Move in now!
JOEY: I can't see anything in here!
VINCE: Willy hit the lights.
WILLY: Find 'em!
VINCE: Find 'em!
JOEY: Before he can shoot, there is another flash of fabric on the opposite side of the room.
VINCE: ( aiming )
JOEY: Over there!
VINCE: Freeze! Everybody!
VINCE: Where is she?
JOEY: Where is she?
CHRISTY: Right here. Let the others go they have nothing to do with this.
VINCE: Joey do it.
JOEY: But, boss she's still, you know, a She's a broad! Got it! Just some

MARY LAZARUS: ( also smiling )
CHRISTY: You know? About me? About everything?
CHRISTY: Reverend Mother Thank-you.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You saved my life.
CHRISTY: You saved my life.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I'm a Christian.
EDDIE: Don't you have a concert to go to?
CHRISTY: That depends. Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news. I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
MARY ROBERT: Not a note.
MARY PATRICK: Mary Lazarus coughs, and points to her throat, as if she has laryngitis. All the other nuns imitate her.
CHRISTY: ( to Mother Superior )
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Very well. I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent. For utterly disrupting our way of life. And for placing all of us in mortal danger.
CHRISTY: Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent. So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
EDDIE: I don't know. There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
CHRISTY: Yeah, like what?
VINCE: I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit That used to be true, Vince. I was with you. But something happened. And I'm different now. Realdifferent. I've had, well, you might call it a religious experience. And I've got just two words for you. And those two words Mary Clarence!
CHRISTY: ( staring at Vince, seeing him for the scum that he is ) ( afraid Christy will curse )
MARY ROBERT: ( afraid Christy will curse )
CHRISTY: ( grinning, to Vince )
MARY PATRICK: ( to Christy )
CHRISTY: Hey you re supposed to be the cheerful one. Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
MARY LAZARUS: ( to Christy, with humor )
MARY ROBERT: Reverend Mother?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: MARY ROBERT
MARY ROBERT: Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet? For final I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
CHRISTY: I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious What about me, Reverend Mother? I think you were right. I'm just a bad influence. Sister show biz.
CHRISTY: What about me, Reverend Mother? I think you were right. I'm just a bad influence. Sister show biz.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Perhaps not. Perhaps we can all use. a little Spandex.
CHRISTY: Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Don't push it.
MARY ROBERT: I WAS DOWNHEARTED It's true!
CHRISTY: It's true!
MARY ROBERT: I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING Don't you know it!
