LORNA: And you can only spend another fifty on me? Todd walked right into that one. LORNA ( CONT'D ) ( cont'd ) Maybe you'll feel more generous once you get to know me. Lorna smiles. Her face has an open, unguarded beauty.
TODD: You have a great smile, do you know that?

LORNA: I bet she's going to have a very happy life. She lingers over the photo.
LORNA: I don't think I'm the marrying kind, though.
TODD: Me, neither. Marriage, it's so.medieval. Sometimes when I'm doing a wedding I look at the bride and groom and think, "What a couple of lemmings."
LORNA: I'm not sure people can be true, that's all.

LORNA: Go on, ask.
TODD: Well, after we.after we did it, you didn't really mean what you said, did you? About me being so good.
TODD: ( back-peddling ) I'm only asking because I'm fascinated by this whole scene you're in. So, don't worry about sparing my feelings or anything. I'm just curious.

But no matter how he looks, or how bad he smells, or whether he makes weird wheezing sounds when he comes, I tell him the same thing.the same thing I told you.
TODD: Right.Well, that's what I thought. I mean, a guy would have to be pretty lame to think that.

That's a two-day rental. That means you can get off at least a couple times before it's due. $125 divided by $2.65 equals approximately 47. 47 X 2 = 94. I can get off ninety-four times for the same amount you paid to get off once. Now tell me who gets the better deal.
TODD: You're right. I can't argue with that.
PHIL: Anyway, I stopped watching porno.

SARAH: You haven't asked me if I'm seeing anyone.
TODD: Is that bad?
SARAH: It's silly, I know, but it makes me feel like you couldn't imagine anyone being interested in me.
TODD: What? You should be flattered I don't ask. I respect you enough to assume you'd tell me if you're involved with someone.
SARAH: Hmm. Ask me, anyway.
TODD: Are you serious? ( off her look ) Alright. Are you seeing anyone?
SARAH: Absolutely not. Todd takes the bracelet, puts it on the dash, then leans to kiss I do want to make love tonight.

SARAH: No small feat.
GRANDMOTHER: It's an accomplishment. But the next morning, your Pappy saw it. He demanded an explanation. And, Sarah, do you know how I got out of that pickle?
SARAH: You lied.
GRANDMOTHER: Damn right. I said, "What, you don't remember giving me this?" He said, "No." And I said, "Well, you were so fired up last night, it's a wonder you can remember anything."
SARAH: And you've never been tempted to.
GRANDMOTHER: What? Come clean with your Pappy? Why should I tell him? He had nothing to do with it.
SARAH: It's mine. Not his.

TODD: You know what the problem is? The first night we went out, we should've just fucked. Right away. Without thinking. Two dumb bunnies. Without any history, any baggage. A pair of blank slates. Fucking. It could've been perfectly meaningless. You want chemistry? The less you think, the better the chemistry.
SARAH: I'm sorry. It's just not happening for me.
TODD: The least you can do is give me your goddam pickle. They look away from each other. Todd eats in silence. The pickle sits between them.
CUT TO: EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT - DAY Josh's model come to life. A fallow stretch of land lined with unfinished houses, some more skeletal than others.
CUT TO: INT. HOUSE - DAY A house-in-progress. The walls are in place, but little else. In an upstairs room what will soon be the master bedroom, Josh confers with a construction supervisor. Nearby, Sarah talks on her cell phone.
SARAH: ( into phone ) I don't care if it costs the same, if it's not Dom Perignon tell them we don't want it, alright?.Good. Anybody else call? Nobody, huh.Okay.
SARAH: Guess I'll be heading back.
JOSH: ( beat ) About the other day.Are you having any second thoughts?
SARAH: ( shrugs ) No. None.
JOSH: You're angry I called it quits, aren't you? You can admit it.
SARAH: No. In fact, I want to thank you.
JOSH: For what?
SARAH: For sparing me from the most unhealthy relationship I've ever had in my life. For that, I thank you.
JOSH: Are you having seconds thoughts?
SARAH: Are you having seconds thoughts?
JOSH: No. I say, let's make a clean break. Let's just walk away from Sarah smiles. She extends her hand.
JOSH: What are you doing?
SARAH: Let's seal the deal. Shake. It's a little awkward, but they do.
JOSH: Alright. Now that we've put that behind us, there's one problem Where do we put the bed? Josh gestures to the empty room. Sarah smiles it's a familiar Oh, the bed. Let's put it against this wall. Away from the morning sun.
SARAH: Where do we put the bed? Josh gestures to the empty room. Sarah smiles it's a familiar Oh, the bed. Let's put it against this wall. Away from the morning sun.
JOSH: Where do we put the bed? Josh gestures to the empty room. Sarah smiles it's a familiar Oh, the bed. Let's put it against this wall. Away from the morning sun.
SARAH: Oh, the bed. Let's put it against this wall. Away from the morning sun.
JOSH: Wrong. It's got to go here. So you can see the hallway. They head out. As Josh and Sarah leave the house, they "decorate" several rooms.
SARAH: Not enough height for bunk beds.
JOSH: Why do you assume there will be two children?
SARAH: There has to be. They need to keep each other company.
SARAH: Definitely not enough space for two people to cook.
JOSH: I prefer to eat out.
SARAH: Oh, no. I wouldn't put the ottoman there.
JOSH: Where would you put it?
SARAH: It needs to go over. She waves her hand, accidentally brushing against Josh's chest.
SARAH: .and linger. They both know what's happening.
JOSH: .and linger. They both know what's happening.
SARAH: We have another problem.
JOSH: And that would be.?
SARAH: What do we do with the elephant in the room?
JOSH: You're very clever. She rubs his chest.
SARAH: We shouldn't be rude to an elephant. She lets her hand drop to his crotch.
SARAH: They can get very annoyed.if you ignore them. She pulls Josh to her and kisses him. Josh fairly attacks her, his hands all over her body.
SARAH: Josh. The door. It's an absurd request the room is completely exposed, but Josh carries her to the front door and kicks it closed.
JOSH: I have to tell you, that was the best "break-up" sex I've ever Sarah considers this. Nods.
SARAH: It was, wasn't it? ( beat ) Closure is important. Now you can move on. You can meet someone who. What? Someone who's not a prick like you. Josh reacts slightly offended. No. Someone who's.free. Oh. Right. ( beat ) As if that would have made any difference in this.what is this thing called again? A relationship?
TODD: ( into phone ) No, no, no. You don't understand. I don't want an appointment, I just need to get in touch with her.She left a package here by mistake, a gift.No, I'd rather give it to her myself.Lorna, but I assume none of you use your real names.What? But she was working last week?.And you don't have a forwarding number? The line goes dead.
TODD: He dials again. Then, a knock at the door. Todd reacts he's not expecting anyone.
SARAH: Still dressed in the clothes she wore earlier. She holds a small paper bag.
TODD: I brought you something. She hands him the bag. He looks inside.
SARAH: I brought you something. She hands him the bag. He looks inside.
TODD: Pickles. Huh. ( beat ) What's in your hair? She touches her hair.
SARAH: Oh. Sawdust. Lots of sawdust at the job site. ( beat ) Can I come in? Todd puts the bag of pickles on the kitchen counter. He sees Lorna's bracelet.and slides it into a trash can.
CUT TO: INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT Josh, still sporting his hickey, approaches the humorless teenage GIRL behind the counter.
GIRL: Need some help?
JOSH: Yes, I have a problem. I need some.something to cover up a.Hell, just take a look.
GIRL: Yeah. You're fucked.
JOSH: I can do without the attitude, thank-you.
GIRL: Try concealer. Aisle three.
JOSH: ( impatient ) But what do I do with it?
GIRL: Just put it on. And call your lawyer. She smiles.
CUT TO: EXT. JOSH'S HOUSE - NIGHT In the driveway of his fashionable home are two parked cars.
CUT TO: INT. JOSH'S BATHROOM - NIGHT Josh washes his hands in the master bathroom. He double-checks his neck in the mirror. From the adjoining bedroom, we hear but do not see his wife GWEN.
GWEN: I'm reading a stupid article in a stupid magazine.
JOSH: I'm reading a stupid article in a stupid magazine.
GWEN: I'm reading a stupid article in a stupid magazine.
JOSH: If it's stupid, why read it?
GWEN: ( ignores this ) The whole issue is devoted to famous couples who are breaking up. Listen to this.Remember the blonde doctor on that show you hate?
JOSH: Yeah. She's a bore.
GWEN: She's breaking up with her husband of twenty years. Said a friend, "Her show's in syndication, she's thin, she's rich and she wants to play." Josh dries his hands.
JOSH: Some poor tree gave its life so we could know that.
GWEN: It's comforting, reading about these broken marriages. Josh opens the door into the
JOSH: It's not enough for our marriage to succeed. Everyone else's must fail.
GWEN: It's not enough for our marriage to succeed. Everyone else's must fail.
JOSH: Is this going to be one of those nights?
GWEN: One of those nights we talk.
JOSH: One of those nights we talk.
GWEN: No. There's no need to talk, because there's no problem. He gets into bed next to her.
JOSH: I've been under a lot of stress.
GWEN: You don't have to apologize. There's nothing wrong with the slump we're going through. In fact, it's a good thing.
JOSH: How's that? He turns off the side light. We can't see them the room is completely dark.
GWEN: Too much passion can ruin a marriage. Look at Eric and Sylvia. at the genitals. And, then.total burn-out. A marriage cannot sustain that kind of intensity. It's good for people to grow bored with each other. That way, they can meet and fall in love She snuggles up to him, strokes his back.
GWEN: In case you hadn't noticed.I'm trying to seduce you.
JOSH: I can feel that.
GWEN: You're welcome to reciprocate. Josh turns on the light and sits up.
JOSH: I can't.
GWEN: It's alright.
JOSH: To seduce.to be seduced, there needs to be an element of surprise. Gwen sits up, throws back the sheet.
GWEN: Rub my feet. He does.
GWEN: I think we should have an affair.
JOSH: With each other.
GWEN: With each other.
JOSH: That makes no sense.
GWEN: You pick me up at a bar.
JOSH: And, what? Pretend I don't know you?
GWEN: ( ignores him ) Or we could meet at a hotel. I'll register under my maiden name.
JOSH: THE GRADUATE is about a married woman having an affair with a college boy.
GWEN: When I met you, you were a college boy.
JOSH: Gwen, THE GRADUATE is a story about a very unhappy woman who has an affair out of wedlock. As I recall, it turns out rather badly for her.
GWEN: Alright. Bad example. ( rethe foot rub ) You can stop.
JOSH: Actors pretend. That's what they do. I'm not an actor. And I love you the way you are.
GWEN: I love you, too. And he turns out the light again.
JOSH: Pretending to be strangers is not going to solve the problem.
GWEN: Who said there was a problem?
CUT TO: INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT A cocktail party at Josh's firm. Josh is the center of attention, greeting investors, fielding compliments. Gwen stands beside him, drinking champagne Dom Perignon, after all.
JOSH'S POV: Through the crowd he spots Sarah, entering with her date Todd.
GWEN: Your lovely assistant is here. ( reTodd ) You didn't tell me she had a new boyfriend.
JOSH: I don't ask her about her personal life. Sarah and Todd arrive.
SARAH: Hey, you two. Todd, this is my boss Josh, and his wife Gwen.
TODD: Sarah's told me a lot about you. Josh is not sure how to take that.
GWEN: Sarah, you look great. You've been keeping my boy on his best It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.
SARAH: It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.
GWEN: I know he asks to go above and beyond the call of duty.
SARAH: He can be tough.
JOSH: But fair.
GWEN: Josh, I'm trying to thank Sarah for all the extra attention she gives you.
SARAH: You're welcome.
GWEN: We should really have you over for dinner, Sarah. It's been too long. You can bring.
TODD: Sorry. I'm hopeless when it comes to names.
GWEN: Sorry. I'm hopeless when it comes to names.
JOSH: Especially after two glasses of champagne.
GWEN: Hey, I'm still working on the first, thank you. ( to Todd ) So, are you two living together?
TODD: Living together? No. Sarah and Todd both laugh.
SARAH: We've only known each other a few weeks. Josh reacts he knew nothing of this.
GWEN: You two seem to fit. It only took me a few days to know with Josh. In fact, I knew after the first date.
SARAH: You knew what?
GWEN: That he was the one for me.
JOSH: ( to Sarah ) She loves to embarrass me.
SARAH: ( to Gwen ) Don't stop. I want to hear about this first date.
GWEN: Well, it was the cheapest date I've ever been on.
JOSH: I was broke.
GWEN: Do you know the Chinese place on Third? That little hole-in-the-wall?
TODD: I know it. Used to be a cool dive. Now it's ultra-hip and overpriced.
GWEN: Really? I think our first dinner cost a grand total of ten dollars.
JOSH: Gwen loves to dissect our first date.
GWEN: It was a momentous night. Babe, we should really go back there.
JOSH: Gwen, why don't you continue your stroll down memory lane while I drink? Todd, you up for it?
TODD: They move away toward

TODD: I'm fine, thanks.
JOSH: So.Sarah's an attractive girl.
TODD: You two serious?
JOSH: You two serious?
TODD: ( shrugs ) Hard to say.
JOSH: She wants to play the field, right?
TODD: No, that's not it.
JOSH: I see. You want to fuck around. Todd reacts.
JOSH: C'mon, we're guys. I know the drill. Todd considers his audience, then decides to open up
TODD: We dated a few times, and to be honest, I was on the fence about Sarah. I liked her, but I didn't think we were in a good groove.
JOSH: I didn't know. ( beat ) She didn't say a thing about it.
TODD: It wasn't unexpected, but Sarah took it really hard. So where did that leave me? I was ambivalent about things, right? But then my ambivalence had to take a back seat. I had to be there for her. Completely. And, ready or not, our relationship became.a real relationship.
TODD: You know, I wasn't ready to be that involved with anybody. I don't know.Death has a funny way of making you get outside Josh looks past Todd

GWEN: What do you want to talk about, then?
JOSH: I want to talk about me. A beat.
JOSH: .and what a fool I've been. Gwen is not prepared for this.
JOSH: I thought if we came here tonight we could.start again.
GWEN: ( flustered ) But I thought you were over this place. And, look.There's nothing left. Not one remnant of our first date.anywhere.
JOSH: ( brightens ) The fortune cookies haven't changed. He brings over the plate.
GWEN: You're supposed to wait
JOSH: I can't wait. I have to know. He opens the first.
JOSH: ( reading ) "You are on the verge of success".in bed. Gwen laughs, opens one herself.
GWEN: ( reading ) "You will have a change of plans".in bed. Josh reacts, opens a third.
JOSH: ( reading ) "You are very creative".in bed.
GWEN: Hmm. That's what I've heard.

JOSH: What's that?
GWEN: That you tell me your name.
JOSH: Oh, I thought everyone knew my name. I'm Bill Gates. Billionaire.
GWEN: Is it true what they say, Bill, about billionaires? That all the wealth is just a way to compensate.for size?
JOSH: People are jealous.
GWEN: I can imagine. It must be so lonely at the top. He reaches between her knees.
GWEN: What are you doing?
JOSH: What do you think I'm doing? ( beat ) The fortune cookie said you're on the verge of success.in bed.
GWEN: We're not in a bed.
JOSH: You shouldn't read fortune cookies too literally. Josh swings Gwen onto his lap. They go at each other like.a couple of college kids.
JOSH: .Can anyone see us?.Is anyone looking?.Why should it bother you? You're alone.with your wife.That's the way it's supposed to be.You know every inch of her.every smell.every sigh.every freckle.the shape of her ass.the mole under her nipple.the whole history of her body.And, you know that if you really concentrate, you can succeed.in imagining.she's someone you don't know.
GWEN: Color. That's the problem with this room, it needs color. Think of.the vibrant colors of Haiti.
JOANNE: Personally, Haiti does nothing for me. When your father and I were there this was before you were born, I almost died from a piece of lettuce, and I wouldn't want anything to remind me of that trip.
GWEN: Alright. I didn't say anything.
JOANNE: Because you're not sure?
GWEN: No, I'm sure. I'm sure he's sleeping with her. ( beat ) And I may have to kill him.
JOANNE: What? You think I should just forget about it?
GWEN: What? You think I should just forget about it?
JOANNE: Yes, I do.
GWEN: Mother, don't you think honesty is essential in a marriage?
JOANNE: It depends. It can be quite detrimental. Gwen begins to pace in exasperation.
JOANNE: Alright. Confront him. You know where it will get you. Your whole marriage will unravel, and you'll have nothing. All the things you take for granted month-long vacations in St. Lucia they'll disappear. You'll be a divorced woman in her late 30s. Lonely.
GWEN: Why did I invite you over? You make me feel like shit.
JOANNE: That's my job. The phone rings.
GWEN: The machine can get it.
JOANNE: I don't monitor calls. It makes me feel like I'm hiding in my own home.
VOICE: Gwen, this is David Warren. Hopefully, a welcome voice from your past. My show's on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend.
JOANNE: Pick up the phone. Gwen just stares at the machine.

GWEN: A brief liaison with an old flame. The perfect way to deal with your anger.
JOANNE: A brief liaison with an old flame. The perfect way to deal with your anger.
GWEN: You're insane. You're an insane mother.
JOANNE: It'll be good for your self-esteem.
GWEN: Did it occur to you that maybe he just wants to have coffee?
DAVID'S VOICE: .on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend. Are you free for coffee.or something?
JOANNE: "Coffee.or something." He's flirting, admit it. Coffee.or He's stammering. He's nervous. He's calling out of the blue!
GWEN: He's stammering. He's nervous. He's calling out of the blue!
JOANNE: You're wrong. I'm right, and I'm going. But take a tip from someone who's been there. Opportunity is knocking, Gwen. You have a chance to level the playing field.
CUT TO: INT. GWEN'S BATHROOM - DAY Morning. Gwen, fresh from the shower, studies her face in the mirror as Josh unseen, in the bedroom dresses for work.

GWEN: I said you're right.
JOSH: I said you're right.
GWEN: About what?
JOSH: About more color in the living room.

DAVID WARREN: They were, with knives drawn.
GWEN: What did they say?
DAVID WARREN: Basically, why am I working on a piece of shit like MALIBU NIGHTS when I should be doing Shakespeare or Chekhov?
WAITER: Compliments from the table in the corner. The Waiter gestures. David and Gwen turn. In the corner three middle-aged women are smiling.
GWEN: See? Those women are happy you're not doing Shakespeare. Gwen. You look great. You haven't changed a bit.
DAVID WARREN: Gwen. You look great. You haven't changed a bit.
GWEN: I don't think I'm MALIBU NIGHTS material.

GWEN: Hmm. Someone else in particular?
DAVID WARREN: If she's as tan as you, I don't want to hear about it. David reaches for his wallet.
