HOLLY: Daddy. What are you doing here? I missed you so much.

STANLEY: It's okay, baby. Let me give you a ride home.
STANLEY: He walks toward Ginger's silver Mercedes CLK which he's borrowing. Holly runs and jumps on his back. They laugh as he carries her to the car.
STANLEY: You believe in me, right?
HOLLY: Of course, but
STANLEY: I've found a way to get you back, sweetheart. It's my one shot and I'm taking it. Just give me a couple of days.
HOLLY: ( crying ) I don't want anything else to happen to you, Dad.
STANLEY: Holly, everything's going to be okay. You just have to trust me.
HOLLY: ( crying ) I love you, Daddy.
STANLEY: Who the fuck are you?

ROBERTS: So, why was it you are in L.A. I told you
STANLEY: I told you
ROBERTS: vacationing. That's right. Ya know it's funny. Axl Torvalds was just here for a vacation, too. Isn't it odd that the two best hackers in the world are here at the same time.
STANLEY: I'm a sucker for Disneyland. Tell Torvalds I said hello.

GABRIEL: In the early Eighties the D.E.A. set up a network of dummy corporations as a government front to launder drug money and gather evidence. Problem is, the front companies started making money. Lots of money. By 1986, when Operation Swordfish was terminated, there was close to 400 million dollars in the D.E.A.'s
STANLEY: Money that just sorta disappeared.
GABRIEL: It didn't disappear. It just sat in those accounts earning interest, it's been 15 years. You have any concept how much money we'd be actually talking about today? Billions, brother. That's nine Look, this is a sweet deal. We go in over phone lines.

REISMAN: Goddamn right I did. You know where I got that? From the deputy director of the F.B.I. He thought I might be interested.
GABRIEL: Sir, with all due respect. Do you think there is any aspect of this operation I am not fully aware of?
REISMAN: We are aborting the operation and securing alternative means of finance elsewhere.
GABRIEL: We are aborting this operation. Take a vacation.
REISMAN: We are aborting this operation. Take a vacation.

GABRIEL: Everything is under control.
REISMAN: ( regretful ) Do it. Terminate the Vortex.
KAPLAN: ( beat ) Sir, he does work for us.
REISMAN: Excuse us. Son, let's say you have a 200- pound Rottweiler. He loves you, and it's his job to protect you. But if he ever bites you, even once, you gotta put him down. You can't have an uncontrollable weapon running unchecked in your back yard. He becomes a liability. You never know who he might bite next.

STANLEY: Why can't we talk here?
GABRIEL: 'Cause I don't want to talk to you in the house, Stanley.
GABRIEL: Let's go.
GABRIEL: How you doing, Stanley?
STANLEY: ( obviously not fine )
GABRIEL: Something you need to say to me?
STANLEY: ( freaked ) What the hell is going on here?
GABRIEL: ( totally cool ) You know anything about Harry
GABRIEL: He used to make an elephant disappear in a theater full of people. You know how he did it?
STANLEY: and sticks the piece in his mouth.
GABRIEL: Gabriel whips right down a side street and drops the hammer. He blows through a stop sign, then another. CARS CRASH. He is calm, cool, but continues to glance in his rearview mirror.
STANLEY: What are you doing?
GABRIEL: We have a tail. Hope you had a light lunch, Stan. Hold the wheel.
GABRIEL: Hold the wheel.
STANLEY: Shit, it's blocked.
GABRIEL: Keep it straight.
GABRIEL: It's just rough when you grow up lovin' James Bond movies. Don't worry, Stanley, it'll be over soon.
GABRIEL: Drive, drive!
GABRIEL: Go, go!
STANLEY: I am!
STANLEY: ( changing out a clip ) Keep your cool, Stanley.
GABRIEL: ( changing out a clip ) Keep your cool, Stanley.
GABRIEL: Goddamit. I knew it.
GABRIEL: Get in the fucking car, Stanley.
STANLEY: I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on.
GABRIEL: You're on my good side and you want to stay there. Stanley, I like you, but don't confuse kindness with weakness. So, get in the fuckin' car. I need my
GINGER: Stanley? You alright?
STANLEY: What do you think? I just watched that maniac murder ten men in the street. I'm just fucking great. It doesn't matter if I get my daughter back if I'm dead. Even if I do survive this, who's gonna keep me out of jail? You?
GINGER: I won't let anything happen to you, Stanley. You have to trust Trust you? Two hours ago I found out you're D.E.A. The feds are crawling up my ass and there's a dead body in the basement that looks just like
STANLEY: Trust you? Two hours ago I found out you're D.E.A. The feds are crawling up my ass and there's a dead body in the basement that looks just like
GINGER: Stanley, if we don't find out who he's working for then we're just going to have to do this all over Your little slush fund is not my problem. I'm pulling the plug on this rodeo. Roberts may be an asshole, but he is definitely the lesser of the two evils.
STANLEY: Your little slush fund is not my problem. I'm pulling the plug on this rodeo. Roberts may be an asshole, but he is definitely the lesser of the two evils.
GINGER: I've been working on this thing for eight months, and I will not let some jarhead fed fuck up my operation. Please, I know what I'm doing.
GINGER: C'mon, Stanley. You have twelve hours. Do what he wants. Finish the worm.
STANLEY: You're starting to sound just like
REISMAN'S POV: An evil-looking, camouflaged gunship suddenly crests the hill directly above him, ROTORS THUMPING.
GABRIEL: ( sniffing in air ) Ahh, the great American outdoors. I'll never understand the appeal of fly-fishing, Jim. A little too much like masturbation for me, without the payoff.
GABRIEL: This's a catch-and-release stream, isn't it?
REISMAN: That's right.
GABRIEL: Oh c'mon, Jim. You gotta see the irony in the chairman of the Joint Sub-Committee on Crime, fishing in a catch-and-release
WIDER: How could you do it, Jim? After all we have sacrificed. All the blood, all the death. I've changed my identity so many times, I don't even know what I look like anymore. How could you turn on me when we are so close?
GABRIEL: How could you do it, Jim? After all we have sacrificed. All the blood, all the death. I've changed my identity so many times, I don't even know what I look like anymore. How could you turn on me when we are so close?
REISMAN: You did this to yourself.
GABRIEL: You brought me in to get the job done and you didn't want to know about the consequences.
REISMAN: The F.B.I. was watching you
GABRIEL: I told you there was nothing that I was unaware of
REISMAN: That's why we're here. You are too arrogant, too aggressive
GABRIEL: You have misplaced your loyalties, Senator. You have sold America out. I am a patriot, and patriotism does not have a four-year shelf life. Unfortunately, politicians do.
REISMAN: ( arrogantly ) And what are you going to do with that?
GABRIEL: Thomas Jefferson once shot a man on the White House lawn for treason, Senator. You tried to execute me in the name of politics, now I execute you in the name of the people.
MARCO: You're up, mate.
STANLEY: Get your shit, we're headin' out.
MARCO: Get your shit, we're headin' out.
GABRIEL: ( over shoulder ) Make sure that bus doesn't top out over fifteen-seven.
GABRIEL: Stan, how are you?
STANLEY: Have you finished?
GABRIEL: Have you finished?
GABRIEL: ( into phone )
STANLEY: ( into phone )
STANLEY: OPERATOR ( V.O. )
GABRIEL: Just like I promised, Stanley.
STANLEY: Then let me go. I want to see my Soon, Stanley. Walk with me.
GABRIEL: Soon, Stanley. Walk with me.
GABRIEL: I'm about to do something against my better judgement. I'm going to tell you something I never tell anyone. I'm going to tell you who I am.
STANLEY: Don't bother. I know who you are.
GABRIEL: Do you? You think I'm a bank robber. Really, I'm just like you.
STANLEY: Like me? You're a murderer.
GABRIEL: That I am. And worse. Much worse. I am forced to operate on a different plane than you. But, I have ethics. Rules to which I must adhere.
STANLEY: I don't understand why the fuck you're telling me this.
GABRIEL: Listen to me and you will. In the 1950s, armed with this letter, J. Edgar Hoover created an organization to protect the freedoms of this country at all I don't care about any of this. All I care about is my daughter.
STANLEY: I don't care about any of this. All I care about is my daughter.
GABRIEL: I'm talking about your daughter.
STANLEY: My daughter.
GABRIEL: Yes. You, your daughter and 200 million other Americans who take their freedoms for granted. You don't understand what it takes to protect those freedoms. That's my job, Stanley, to protect your way of life at all costs.
STANLEY: So you and your band of lunatics are really stealing all this money to protect me.
GABRIEL: That's right, Stanley
GABRIEL: 'cause wars cost money.
STANLEY: ( realization hitting You're going into the fucking bank.
GABRIEL: That's what I'm telling you, Stanley. We are at war.
STANLEY: War? Who are we at war with?
GABRIEL: Anyone who infringes on America's freedom. Terrorists' states, Stanley. Someone must take their war to them. They bomb a church, we bomb ten. They hijack a plane, we take out an airport. They execute American tourists, we tactically nuke an entire city. We must make terrorism so horrific that it becomes unthinkable to attack Americans.
STANLEY: I'm out. I'm not doing this. You're insane.
GABRIEL: Maybe. I wanted you to do this because you wanted to, because we need men like you, but our time table's been moved up. Just relax and it will all be over in twenty-four hours. You're rich, Stanley. Pretty soon Holly and you will be basking in the sun on the deck of some eighty-foot scarab, eating bon bons and living the good life.
GABRIEL: ( to himself ) Pretty slick.
MARCO: ( walking over ) You want to send a team after him?
GABRIEL: No. He'll be back. We gotta move. Load up.
BLACK SCREEN: SUPERIMPOSE: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 18 8:45:33. 34. 35 FADE IN: 113 INT. BANK 113 THROUGH glass doors, we see the woman slam into the locked doors. The SWAT guy pulls her into the street.
KABOOM!!!: The EXPLOSION rips the SWAT guy and the girl from the beginning apart. This time we see it from ANOTHER ANGLE. BALL BEARINGS RICOCHET against the plate steel of the 115 EXT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - LOW SHOT - DAY 115 as the ball bearings bounce across the street and tap against the coffee shop.
GABRIEL: Get that son-of-a-bitch on the
GABRIEL: If you need to test my resolve then God help you. You have 25 minutes. That plane better be on the runway.
GABRIEL: Get my money, Stanley.
STANLEY: Not until I see my daughter.
WIDER: Stanley's heart almost stops. He sighs as Gabriel tosses him the giraffe.
GABRIEL: Do you really think I wanted it to come to this. Do you? I am not a psychopath, Stanley, but I told you, I will sacrifice as many lives as it takes to protect our country, including my own. Now get me my money.
STANLEY: Will you let Holly go once you have the money?
GABRIEL: Both of you. You have my word, Stanley. C'mon.
GABRIEL: We okay?
MARCO: Look at the cover pattern they've set up. The right hand doesn't know what the left's doing.
STANLEY: I need the disk.
STANLEY: Almost done.
STANLEY: Whoa! What the hell just
GABRIEL: They just cut the power. Forget it. How long to transfer the Couple of minutes. Which National Bank of Zurich. Spread it evenly over these accounts. It won't be there that long.
STANLEY: Couple of minutes. Which National Bank of Zurich. Spread it evenly over these accounts. It won't be there that long.
GABRIEL: National Bank of Zurich. Spread it evenly over these accounts. It won't be there that long.
STANLEY: ( dryly ) Good job, Stanley, I got someone who wants to see you.
GABRIEL: Good job, Stanley, I got someone who wants to see you.
STANLEY: Stanley grabs her and pulls her close to him.
STANLEY: Are you okay?
GABRIEL: Hold up.
GABRIEL: ( to Stanley ) Told you I was a man of my word,
STANLEY: It's okay. I love you, baby.
MARCO: See ya around.
STANLEY: I doubt it.
GABRIEL: ( CONTINUED )
GABRIEL: What do you mean, gone?
WIDER: We see Stanley. He looks like he just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
STANLEY: Shit! Run, Holly!
GABRIEL: Get her!
STANLEY: Won't do you any good. The money jumps every 60 seconds from one numbered account to another and will for the next ten years. 'Course it wasn't supposed to happen for another six hours. The power surge must have scrambled the internal clock. But, you kill me and you never get a single
STANLEY: You let the hostages go and then I'll tell you where and when you can extract the money. We all walk away, nobody gets hurt. The accounts are encrypted with a 1024 bit cipher. Even I can't break through the fire wall. It's my act of God policy. I'm thinking.
GABRIEL: I'm thinking.
GABRIEL: Tell ya what. No deal. Marco! Grab Agent Sculley!
GABRIEL: Marco! Grab Agent Sculley!
STANLEY: No, don't do this.
GABRIEL: In all reality, Stan, she has you to thank for this. That first night in Prague you broke the D.O.D. database that contained her true identity. She's D.E.A., Stan, but without you, I never would have known.
STANLEY: ( freaking ) What are you doing? Stop!
GABRIEL: String up the D.E.A. bitch.
STANLEY: Just let her down. I'll do whatever you want.
GABRIEL: Then get me my money, Stan. I'm not doing shit until you bring her down. I'm serious. Let her down. Now!
STANLEY: I'm not doing shit until you bring her down. I'm serious. Let her down. Now!
GABRIEL: Gabriel yanks out his .40 cal. H&K, turns and SHOOTS the hanging Ginger.
STANLEY: Stanley looks at her lifeless body as they lower her. He looks up at Gabriel and runs at him. Gabriel slaps him in the throat, spinning him, and grabs Stan around the neck in the crook of his arm.
GABRIEL: ( close and very serious ) Take a moment, big guy. Don't make me put you in a wheelchair.
STANLEY: You didn't have to kill her.
GABRIEL: I didn't Stan, you did. But we're not done yet.
GABRIEL: There are a lot of hostages here. I cared about Ginger, can you imagine what I could do to someone I don't care about. How long before the money jumps?
STANLEY: Sixty seconds.
GABRIEL: They better hope you installed a back door or it could be a long day. Somebody get me a laptop. Money just jumped.
COMPUTER MERC: ( looking at a screen ) Money just jumped.
GABRIEL: ( looking at his watch ) Okay, Stan. Sixty seconds.
GABRIEL: Forty-five seconds, Stanley.
STANLEY: I need another laptop, logged on!
GABRIEL: Twenty seconds, Stan.
GABRIEL: Fifteen. She's gonna die, Shut up!
STANLEY: Shut up!
STANLEY: C'mon, c'mon.
GABRIEL: The home page for Grand Cayman Banc appears on the other laptop. "Account Number" appears.
GABRIEL: Nine. Eight. Seven.
STANLEY: I need your account number.
GABRIEL: Four, three, two.
GABRIEL: Let her go.
STANLEY: Let her go.
STANLEY: Now, goddammit, it's done. Let her go!
GABRIEL: Well, that was fun.
MERC: Joy says the plane is ready.
GABRIEL: Well, 'bout time for us to leave.
STANLEY: They'll never let you escape. You've gone too far.
GABRIEL: Au contraire. Do you hear that? That's the sound of America
GABRIEL: ( to the driver ) Let's roll.
ROBERTS: You just gonna let them drive the fuck on outta here?
A.D. JOY: There isn't a free cop in a hundred miles that isn't on his ass. He wants a plane. He'll get a plane.
A.D. JOY: He won't get away. We'll take them at the airport. Let's go.
GABRIEL: ( dropping the mic Ladies and gentlemen, we will be in your lives for approximately 55 more minutes. This bus has just become your new yard. So sit back, think happy thoughts, and this will be over before you can say 'cat in the hat.'
GABRIEL: Whaddaya think, Stanley?
STANLEY: You'll never get away. Even if they have to kill everyone on the bus.
GABRIEL: Really? Five hundred bucks says I do. Tell ya what, Stanley, I'll even spot you the five bills.
GABRIEL: Stan, c'mere.
GABRIEL: Take a look.
STANLEY: How the fuck can you justify all You're not looking at the big
GABRIEL: You're not looking at the big
GABRIEL: Stanley, here's a scenario. You have the power to cure all of the world's diseases. But the price for this is that you must kill a single, innocent child. Could you kill that child to save the world?
STANLEY: You disappoint me, Stanley. It's the greatest good.
GABRIEL: You disappoint me, Stanley. It's the greatest good.
STANLEY: How about ten innocents?
GABRIEL: Now you're getting it. How about a hundred?
GABRIEL: How about a thousand? Not to save the world, but just to preserve our way of life.
STANLEY: No man has the right to make that decision. You're no different than any other terrorist.
GABRIEL: You're wrong, Stanley. Some men are put here to shape destiny, to protect freedom, despite the atrocities they must commit. I am one of those men. Thousands die every day for no reason at all, where is your bleeding heart for them? You give your twenty dollars to Greenpeace every year and think you are changing the world. What countries will harbor terrorists, when they realize the consequences of what I will do? Did you know I can buy nuclear warheads in Minsk for forty million each? I buy half a dozen, I even get a
STANLEY: What the fu
GABRIEL: I saw Sugarland Express, Stan. Didn't like the way it ended.
STANLEY: I thought we were going to the Misdirection, Stanley.
GABRIEL: Misdirection, Stanley.
WIDER: One of the mercs in the front speaks French again. Gabriel looks around. He smiles.
GABRIEL: Faintly, we can hear powerful ROTORS APPROACHING.
GABRIEL: Stanley looks out the window as two of the mercs scramble through hatches in the roof.
GABRIEL: Hold on.
ROBERTS: Well why the fuck not.
A.D. JOY: Everything in place?
AGENT TORRES: We're ready, sir.
A.D. JOY: AGENT THOMAS ( running up ) AGENT THOMAS
AGENT THOMAS: ( running up ) I don't think they're coming.
A.D. JOY: AGENT THOMAS
AGENT THOMAS: I don't think they're coming.
A.D. JOY: What do you mean you don't think they're coming?
AGENT THOMAS: ( listening to the The bus was just lifted off the street by a giant helicopter.
A.D. JOY: ( freaking ) ( laughing )
GABRIEL: ( laughing ) The only way to fly, huh, Stanley.
GABRIEL: Bank right!
BROKER: Holy sh.
GABRIEL: We okay?
DRIVER: ( listening to his We'll make it, sir.
ON ROOF: Mercenaries begin to pile off the bus.
GABRIEL: Well, Stanley, gotta fly. Take care of that little girl. Maybe I'll see you again one day.
STANLEY: It can't end like this. You can't get away.
GABRIEL: C'mon, Stan. Everything doesn't always end the way you think it 'Sides, audiences love happy
ROBERTS: I'm F.B.I.
SWAT GUY: ( ignoring him ) Check the rest of the hostages, we'll come back for them.
STANLEY: Are we sure this is Gabriel?
DOCTOR MICHEALS: The body's dentals exactly match the dentals the Israeli government sent us for an ex-Mossad agent named Gabriel Shears.
WIDER: It sure looks like Gabriel Shear. What the hell was he doing in that bank?
ROBERTS: It sure looks like Gabriel Shear. What the hell was he doing in that bank?
STANLEY: What about Ginger?
TORRES: We searched all the hospitals and morgues but we haven't been able to find her body yet.
STANLEY: You can't find her body?
TORRES: No, sir.
ROBERTS: Keep looking. Bodies just don't fucking disappear.
STANLEY: ( to himself ) Houdini made an elephant disappear in a room full of people. You know how he did it?
GINGER: I'm D.E.A., Stanley.
GINGER: Trust me.
GABRIEL: ( smiling )
ROBERTS: Cheer up, Stan, we got him. You're a hero.
STANLEY: Yeah that's me. Hero.
ROBERTS: I was wrong about you, Stanley. I wanted you to know that. You know, you should take your daughter on vacation. Relax a little, you're lucky to be alive.
WOMAN: I would like to transfer money between my employer's accounts.
BANK EXECUTIVE: Certainly. May I have your employer's account number and password, please?
BANK EXECUTIVE: ( looking at the Oh, of course. You realize, how should I say, there is a substantial amount of money in that account.
WOMAN: That's why I'm here. My employer doesn't like drawing attention to himself. He likes to keep a low
BANK EXECUTIVE: Of course. Would you feel more comfortable dealing with the bank Would you?
WOMAN: ( exhaling ) Would you?
BANK EXECUTIVE: Get him.
WOMAN: Get him.
BANK EXECUTIVE: Right away. A glass of Cristal while you. Wait a moment.
WOMAN: BANK EXECUTIVE
BANK EXECUTIVE: There seems to have been a series of large withdrawals out of this account.
WOMAN: That's impossible.
STANLEY: Everything's fine. Just making the last of some charitable donations..
STANLEY: How about you, almost done?
HOLLY: ( folding up road Yep. Got it all figured out.
STANLEY: Well, let's do it.
STANLEY: By the way, where exactly are we The Petrified Forest.
HOLLY: The Petrified Forest.
STANLEY: The Petrified Forest.
HOLLY: Right. And I'm driving.
STANLEY: Scoot over, you.
WIDE SHOT: WE CRANE UP and AWAY as the vehicle pulls out of the desert truck stop.
MAN: How much he leave?
MAN: Did you ever see the Maltese Falcon?
MAN: 1941. Nominated for three Academy Awards, lost, but what the fuck does the Academy know anyway. John Houston's first film and probably Bogey's best.
MAN: At the end, when they realize the bird's a fake, and all they had gone through and sacrificed was for nothing, Gutman, the bad guy in the movie, says, 'well, sir, what do you think, shall we stand here, shed tears, and call each other names, or shall we go to Istanbul?'
GINGER: Istanbul? What's in Istanbul?
MAN: The, ah, stuff dreams are made of.
GINGER: They both smile as the CIGARETTE disappears toward the Writers : Skip Woods
THE END: Writers : Skip Woods
