CLARENCE: My Mom cooked your ass a whole Damn meal, why you gotta go asking what's in it?
MONIX: It's a compliment. It's good.
CLARENCE: If it's good, then it's good. Why do you gotta know what's in it? What's in hot dish? Hot dish is in hot dish, asshole. BEE BEE and SCOOTSIE look over the seat, facing them.
MONIX: They were fast.
MONIX: ( pointing to his mind ) Fast up here.
MONIX: Well, you have to be able to jump SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY Hey, let us see that ring again.
MONIX: Not right now, okay Twiggy?
CLARENCE: Isn't it a little embarrassing wearing that thing everyday?
MONIX: You call yourself a Celtic? You sat through every single playoff game. You didn't see action once. And now you walk around wearing the ice like you're Bill Russel. Well you BEE BEE ELLIS Oh, you're just jealous.
CLARENCE: You call yourself a Celtic? You sat through every single playoff game. You didn't see action once. And now you walk around wearing the ice like you're Bill Russel. Well you BEE BEE ELLIS Oh, you're just jealous.
CLARENCE: Whatever. At least I never sat on the bench and then called myself a champion. You didn't do shit for that Celtic team. If I was Dave Cowens, I'd yank that ring right off your neck. That was a pretty heated exchange. Monix looks like he's got something to say, but he doesn't. Clarence has the last word.
CLARENCE: He doesn't wear it on his finger because he knows he didn't earn it. He didn't even play.
JACKIE MOON: Alright. Now, a lot of people out there are writing us off. A lot people are saying things like 'Jackie Moon is an offensive liability.' They're saying 'Flint's turnovers led to sixty fast break points per game.' ( Making this up ) They're saying 'Bee Bee's retarded brother is so retarded that his eyes look too big,. Like a French BEE BEE ELLIS No one said that, man.
JACKIE MOON: ( trying to motivate ) Yes they did. And we're going to use it as motivation, okay? THIS IS
EVERYONE: LET'S GET TROPICAL! MONTAGE: FLINT PLAYS HARDER BUT THEY STILL SUCK. GAME 1 ) JACKIE MOON sprints across the floor tries to get two f eet planted in the lane. It's not even close, JACKIE HAS TAKEN A GUY DOWN HARD. The ref whistles a blocking foul.
JACKIE MOON: OH, C'MON!? Where's the charge, Father Pat?
JACKIE MOON: OH, SUCK MY COCK. I WILL MURDER YOUR FAMILY. FATHER PAT THE REF That's it, you're out.
JACKIE MOON: What!? What did I say? Jackie takes a ball and drop kicks it, PUNTING IT high up into the rafters.
CLARENCE: I ain't guarding my guy anymore.
CLARENCE: He's too'Damn sweaty, man. ( re: his wet uniform ) Look at me.
MONIX: Quit talking and play defense! The sweaty guy backs in on Clarence, posting up top.
CLARENCE: Right on! I'm open baby! Try a Monix delivers a nice two handed bounce pass, but Clarence isn't ready for anything fundamentally sound The ball hits him in the nuts.
CLARENCE: Ah, shit.
MONIX: Ice? What for?
CLARENCE: I don't know, it's free. Clarence takes some ice, pops it in his mouth and starts Want some?
CLARENCE: Want some?
MONIX: No thanks. Now BEE BEE enters, yet another player in the small room.
MONIX: You turned off the Celtics?
CLARENCE: I don't watch people play basketball. They watch me. With that, Clarence pulls out a JOINT and lights it.
MONIX: ( re: the marijuana ) What the Hell is that?
CLARENCE: ( as he inhales ) It's a fucking Egg-McMuffin. Monix opens the window, clearing the pot smoke out of his JACKIE EXITS the bathroom, having just taken a shower. He's wearing a very small robe. This is now the fourth player who's sleeping in this tiny room.
MONIX: Why don't you shower in your room?
JACKIE MOON: My wife is using it. I'll be crashing with you guys tonight.
MONIX: Jackie, have you ever even slept with your wife?
JACKIE MOON: ( LYING ) What? Are you kidding? Try, like, every weekend. She's so hot.
MONIX: Sounds like a great arrangement.
JACKIE MOON: You guys need to wake up. Quit living like it's the 1950's, man. Live it up. ( showing off ) Hey Clarence, let's have some of that smoke, bro.
MONIX: I'm pretty sure we have a game JACKIE MOON ( as he inhales ) This stuff won't affect you. It's Jackie finishes inhaling, then holds it out for Monix. He stares at the joint, then around the room at his teammates.
JACKIE MOON: ( as he inhales ) This stuff won't affect you. It's Jackie finishes inhaling, then holds it out for Monix. He stares at the joint, then around the room at his teammates.
MONIX: Well, if this is really going to be my life, I might as well be stoned like everyone else.
JACKIE MOON: Well said. Monix takes the stupid joint. The instant Monix inhales he
MONIX: What the Hell is this?
CLARENCE: What do you mean?
MONIX: It's harsh.
CLARENCE: Take that back.
MONIX: Take what back?
JACKIE MOON: His Mom grows it.
CLARENCE: Yeah, in the yard.
MONIX: Your Mom grew this?
CLARENCE: It's sweet grass.
MONIX: Well, I'm finished, thanks.
CLARENCE: What's wrong, my Mom's weed ain't good enough for you?
MONIX: I guess not.
JACKIE MOON: C'mon man, have some respect for his Mom's weed.
CLARENCE: That's it, I ain't sleeping in the same bed as this motherfucker.
AMIGO MANAGER: You want all the fans to sit on one side of the stadium?
JACKIE MOON: Yeah, just move all those people over to this side.
AMIGO MANAGER: Actually, that's not a bad idea. MEANWHILE, ON THE COURT: Both teams are warming up. Clarence now has a new name on his Jersey. There are so many words, there is barely space for a number. It's a mess.
CLARENCE: ( re: Jersey, new name ) Check it out. I sewed it on the SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY ( struggling to read it ) What's it say?
CLARENCE: Jumping Johnny Johnson. The asshole, PETRELLI, wanders over near the Tropics side of the court.
PETRELLI: Yo, Granny Yarn Barn, how's the needle point going?
CLARENCE: Kiss my ass, Petrelli.
PETRELLI: ( re: the Jersey name ) Hey man, I think you spelled 'Flint sucks balls' wrong.
MONIX: No one calls him Clarence. His name
IS: ( BEAT ) What's your name?
CLARENCE: Jumping Johnny Johnson.
MONIX: His name's Jumping Johnny Johnson. ( nose to nose ) You got that? Jackie hurries over.
JACKIE MOON: Alright, break it up. ( to his team ) Everyone huddle up!. VAKIDIS! OVER HERE. Where is he walking to?
JACKIE MOON: Hey! You guys want to merge or not? Because the fastest way to screw this up is to start punching people in the face while the commissioner is at home, watching the game with his kids. Children are very impressionable. Their minds are not yet soiled by the cruel realities of this world.
JACKIE MOON: No punching. Behind the huddle, FANS BEGIN WALKING RIGHT ACROSS THE COURT. Both teams turn to watch this strange thing. The Amigos manager leads the herd, Jackie helps out, directing them across to the other side.
JACKIE MOON: THAT'S RIGHT, JUST MOVE RIGHT ACROSS- IF YOU COULD JUST FILL IN ALL OF THOSE EMPTY SEATS IN THAT AREA, THAT'D BE GREAT. INT. AMIGO'S STADIUM - LATER The optical illusion has worked. The game does indeed look crowded. The game is in full swing.
MONIX: That's a moving pick Father Pat! FATHER PAT THE REF Play on. Monix can't believe it. Petrelli taunts Monix.
PETRELLI: What's wrong Monix, cat got your Monix faces off.
JACKIE MOON: MONIX! NO! ( POINTING ) Not with the cameras. ( miming the commish' ) He's watching. Monix looks around and thinks.
MONIX! NO!: ( POINTING ) Not with the cameras. ( miming the commish' ) He's watching. Monix looks around and thinks.
MONIX: What about commercials?
JACKIE MOON: Commercials, what about Jackie thinks about this, then nods 'good idea.'
MONIX: Commercials, what about Jackie thinks about this, then nods 'good idea.'
JACKIE MOON: I like it. Time out Ref!
CAMERA MAN: ( rooting them on ) And. You're clear.
JACKIE MOON: SOMEBODY HIT SOMEBODY! BAM! MONIX CLOCKS PETRELLI. BAM! JACKIE MOON PUNCHES ANOTHER GUY. PETRELLI TAKES THE HIT AND TACKLES MONIX. BOTH BENCHES CLEAR. THE CROWD GOES NUTS. INT. THE COMMISSIONER'S HOUSE - MEANWHILE The commissioner relaxes at home with his two kids. A Shasta commercial is on TV.
KONG: MEANWHILE: MONIX AND PETRELLI ARE TRADING HOCKEY PUNCHES. CAMERA MAN And we're back in -5- ( Monix punches Petrelli )
CAMERA MAN: And we're back in -5- ( Monix punches Petrelli )
JACKIE MOON: Okay, solid first half guys, but we're going to have to make some
ADJ: Monix interrupts Jackie, pissed. He addresses the team, stepping in front of Jackie Moon.
MONIX: This is bullshit guys. They're kicking our ass in basketball and they're kicking our ass during the commercials, too. Does anybody here understand the concept of the pick and roll? Because they're going to keep double teaming at the top of the key until somebody rotates the Damn ball.
JACKIE MOON: Yeah! C'mon guys! Rotate the ball. Monix looks at this group and gets even madder.
MONIX: Does anyone in this room have any pride? Don't you realize, this is thelast four weeks of basketball anyus are ever going to play?Is thishow we're really going togo out?You'd think we'd want toend ourcareers battling, hustling after every loose ball. Boxing out under the boards. Setting picks for our teammates. But we haven't done shit out there. Twiggy Munson and Scootsie Double-Day hang their heads.
MONIX: We're a bunch of selfish assholes And I've got news for you, we aren't going to finish in fourth, we're going to finish dead last. Monix paces in front of the guys, a man possessed.
MONIX: One day, you're going to look back on your life. And you're going to look back on this time. And you're going to realize. Monix is staring right at Clarence. And Clarence is actually .You're going to realize you never even played basketball. A moment of silence after the intensity. Monix waddles to the Now, you guys have fun out there in the second half. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the training room, draining my knee. Monix limps off, everyone's head is hanging low.
MONIX: .You're going to realize you never even played basketball. A moment of silence after the intensity. Monix waddles to the Now, you guys have fun out there in the second half. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the training room, draining my knee. Monix limps off, everyone's head is hanging low.
MONIX: Now, you guys have fun out there in the second half. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the training room, draining my knee. Monix limps off, everyone's head is hanging low.
JACKIE MOON: ( into phone ) Dukes! I don't make the rules. If they can't cash it, maybe you'll have to go out of state.
CLARENCE: Why do we have to put the court SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY I guess the Ice Capades sold out.
CLARENCE: Monix should be here helping us.
JACKIE MOON: The commissioner just called.
CLARENCE: What's wrong?
JACKIE MOON: I looks like we've got ourselves a situation. We've got some new 'terms and conditions' for this merger deal.
JACKIE MOON: Basically, we've got to average at least 2,000 fans per home game for
TWIGGY MUNSON: 2,000 people? Every home game?
JACKIE MOON: He said the NBA will only take a franchise that has fans.
CLARENCE: Shit. Winning is going to be hard. But getting 2,000 people to watch is going to be impossible.
JACKIE MOON: Let's try and stay positive. My Mother always believed Flint was a town of destiny. And I believe that. Now, I've already started work on a huge idea to promote us.
CLARENCE: What kind of huge idea?
MONIX: Two more Johnny Walkers. And another pack of Kools.
BARTENDER: You could use some fresh air, Monix. You want to take a nap in the back of my truck?
MONIX: ( ANGRY ) Just the drinks and the smokes, ( BEAT ) Do you have any idea where Lynn is these days?
BARTENDER: She asked me to tell you to quit going to her house.
MONIX: Well, tell her that's just fine with me.
BARTENDER: Okay. Sorry man.
MONIX: Well, well, well, look who it is. ( to the bartender ) Brian, I'd like you to meet Jumping Johnny Downtown Funky stuff Boner- time finger-blast Fag-erton.
CLARENCE: ( to the bartender ) Johnny for short. ( to Brian, re: Monix ) Two coffees.
MONIX: So, what brings you to the The Listen, I know you and I haven't always been the best of buddies.
CLARENCE: Listen, I know you and I haven't always been the best of buddies.
MONIX: I hate to break it to you, Clarence, but the Tropics will never play in the NBA.
CLARENCE: So maybe we won't. But like you said, I don't want to look back on this with any regrets. I know what you think of me. But I'm willing to put our differences aside. I'm telling you right now, I'll do whatever it takes to win.
MONIX: You mean, like, pass?
CLARENCE: ( with a smile ) I would consider passing, yes.
MONIX: Sorry kid. Even if I wanted to play harder, this knee won't let me.
CLARENCE: I'm not just talking about you playing point guard. I'm talking about you teaching us. Monix could not be less interested.
CLARENCE: Monix, you know more about basketball than any man who's ever set foot in Flint. Monix drinks, not into it.
CLARENCE: All I'm saying is, instead of getting so pissed off at us all the time, why not just show us what the Hell you're talking about? Coach us a little. I mean, we can't get any And why should I give a shit about the Tropics?
MONIX: And why should I give a shit about the Tropics?
CLARENCE: I know you. You've got all that basketball shit stored up in your head. I know you're dying to pass it down to somebody. Why not us?
MONIX: What about Jackie? He's the coach.
CLARENCE: Jackie's got his hands full, trying to sell tickets. He's obsessed. ( looking up, re: TV )
UP!: ECU: THE TROPIC'S VIDEO ON TELEVISION. ON TV: The Tropics are performing a video not unlike 'The Super Bowl shuffle.' Each member takes a turn rapping, dancing around wooden palm trees with a smile.
MONIX: ( to the bartender ) Two more Johnny Walkers.
CLARENCE: So that's the way it's going to be? Monix doesn't answer, he just drinks. Clarence gets the hint and walks out.
LYNN: Looking good Monix.
MONIX: Thanks. You too.
LYNN: Ms. Quincy told me the Tropics asked you to coach them.
MONIX: I know what it takes to be a real team, Lynn.
LYNN: ( re: his knee ) Stay still.
MONIX: It doesn't matter. The truth is, I hate basketball right now.
LYNN: Do you really hate basketball? Or do you hate yourself?
MONIX: Why would I hate myself?
LYNN: Well, for one, you cheated on me.
MONIX: You hate me for that. Not me. Lynn just stares at him.
MONIX: Okay, maybe I hate myself a little.
LYNN: You don't wear the ring around your neck anymore. ( no response ) Where is it?
MONIX: I rode the bench through the playoffs, Lynn.
LYNN: Monix, that was greatest moment of your career. And you look back on it like some kind of embarrassment.
MONIX: Riding the bench was the greatest moment of my career?
LYNN: You did more than ride the bench, What else did I do?
MONIX: What else did I do?
LYNN: Every practice, you took your team to the limit. I know you did. I was the one draining this stupid knee of yours every night. The Celtics were practicing against you, Monix. And when you ran that scout team, you were running Milwaukee's offense better than their first stringers ever could. Lynn continues the business of disposing fluid into the toilet and preparing another syringe.
LYNN: By game time, your team knew where Milwaukee was going to be before their own players did. The Celtics made the right adjustments to win that series. And those adjustments came from you.
MONIX: So, I should be proud of running the scout team?
LYNN: Dave Cowens put that ring in the palm of your hand. And he told you to wear it with pride, because you were a champion. And he meant it He was being a nice guy. The bench is the bench.
MONIX: He was being a nice guy. The bench is the bench.
LYNN: Your whole life, you've bitched about people playing selfish. It takes a team to win, right?
MONIX: That's right.
LYNN: But when you're on the team, your effort doesn't count? Is that it?
MONIX: Watch that needle.
LYNN: Answer me. Would they have won?
MONIX: I don't know.
LYNN: Yes you do. You know. Monix looks away for a moment.
MONIX: Why are you doing this? What does any of this matter, anyway?
LYNN: What's it matter? You're drinking yourself to death!
LYNN: I made sacrifices! How many years did I support you? And finally, after all of our blood and sweat and bullshit together, you got there, Monix! You made it, you won an NBA championship ring. It wasn't just about you, okay? And I'm sick of you acting like you're some kind of joke. You didn't blow it. You're not a fraud. You're not a fake champion. And all the time we spent together, fighting for you to get to that moment, was not a waste! You're a champion, you asshole!
JACKIE MOON: ( CHOREOGRAPHING ) 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and turn like back. Yes. Now, the waterfall. One by one, each dips down like a waterfall. And now a leg JACKIE MOON Nice leg kick Kong. Those flexible hips are a coach's dream.
JACKIE MOON: Nice leg kick Kong. Those flexible hips are a coach's dream.
CLARENCE: Are we going to practice or what?
JACKIE MOON: This is practice, okay Clarence? We need to get two thousand people in here! Our intro dance has to blow people's minds. He begins pacing around, more passionate than ever.
JACKIE MOON: From now on, I want our afros bigger. And shinier . . I want our shorts shorter. And tighter. We're going to pull our tube socks up higher than we ever have before. The team seems to be looking off screen.
JACKIE MOON: What's wrong?
JACKIE MOON: Hey, you're back! Listen, you should probably chalk your hands up for this number.
CLARENCE: Jackie, I asked Monix to coach us.
JACKIE MOON: Jackie is totally thrown by this. He looks around at the team. Clearly, a decision has been made.
JACKIE MOON: What do you mean, coach? ( truly hurt ) What is this? What's going on? ( staring his team down ) It's a Mutiny.
CLARENCE: Jackie. Don't be like that.
JACKIE MOON: Hold on a second. Last time I checked, we didn't live in Flint, Russia. We live in Flint, America. I'm coach until a new one is Don't make us elect Monix, man. ( Jackie Moon holds firm ) Alright, show of hands. Who wants Monix to step in as player-coach? Everyone feels bad, but they all raise their hands.
CLARENCE: Don't make us elect Monix, man. ( Jackie Moon holds firm ) Alright, show of hands. Who wants Monix to step in as player-coach? Everyone feels bad, but they all raise their hands.
JACKIE MOON: Please God No.
TWIGGY MUNSON: Sorry Jackie.
JACKIE MOON: ( starting to cry ) It's cool. I get it. I'm a big boy, I can handle it.
CLARENCE: Don't take it so hard, Jackie. You're a great owner. We all know JACKIE MOON Woah. Hold on. Did you just say 'great owner?'
JACKIE MOON: Woah. Hold on. Did you just say 'great owner?'
CLARENCE: Yeah. Everyone thinks so.
JACKIE MOON: Now, when you said great owner, were you just saying that? Because it's not cool to mess with me about We mean it. For real. Monix is just more of an X's and O's kind of guy, that's all. Jackie is emotional. It's a bittersweet moment. He takes off his whistle, then walks over and hands Monix his whistle.
CLARENCE: We mean it. For real. Monix is just more of an X's and O's kind of guy, that's all. Jackie is emotional. It's a bittersweet moment. He takes off his whistle, then walks over and hands Monix his whistle.
JACKIE MOON: ( re: The whistle ) Here. You may need this. Now he pulls out a bunch of crazy notes on loose paper written in ball point pen. The pages look insane.
JACKIE MOON: ( handing him papers ) And here are some ideas for plays I've jotted down. Just thoughts.
MONIX: Thanks Jackie. ( to the team ) The way I see it, any team in this league can put together a run. Most of our opponents are all flash. If we play unselfish, fundamental basketball, we can win games.
JACKIE MOON: I like it. Unselfish, guys.
MONIX: Yes. Unselfish. Unselfish meaning tough team defense, full and half court traps, boxing your man out to help the team rebound.
JACKIE MOON: Wait, so, what's going on with the blow jobs?
JACKIE MOON: ( raising his hand ) All in favor? Everyone raises their hands in favor of blow jobs.
CLARENCE: Would everyone let the man talk Clarence is serious. This shuts everyone up.
MONIX: The most important work we do on the court is away from the Monix FLIPS OPEN A SWITCH BLADE KNIFE AND STABS THE BALL, deflating it. This gets everyone's attention.
MONIX: ( re: deflated ball ) Until you start moving like a real team, you practice without a ball.
MONIX: Alright, Clarence, run the offense.
CLARENCE: I don't get it.
MONIX: Set a pick for somebody. Clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent.
MONIX: Okay, that's kind of a pick, I guess. Try standing on the other side of Scootsie's man, so you free him up to cut into the lane. Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants him to stand.
MONIX: Widen your stance. Plant your feet. Hands back. Like this. Now Scootsie GO. Set a pick for Jackie. Scootsie cuts across the lane. The team slowly gets i rotating faster.
MONIX: Now Jackie pick Bee Bee's man, and rotate to the rim like this. Everyone move to the open space. And Clarence you swing back out up They've completed the play. Monix stands there, smiling. The players look at each other, what's the big deal?
MONIX: You know what that was?
CLARENCE: A flash to the high side post with an outside screen and a back door cut. Let's do it again.
MONIX: A flash to the high side post with an outside screen and a back door cut. Let's do it again.
MONIX: I'm saving my knee for the games. Coach's decision. NOW RUN. Clarence sets a screen for Scootsie and they perform the same basic rotation.
MONIX: ( as they run ) We're not just rotating, we're clearing out, making space. A pass and cut can change defensive match- ups. Creating seams can give us back door looks. Down screens can make a team vulnerable to JACKIE MOON Hold on. I'm lost.
JACKIE MOON: Hold on. I'm lost.
TWIGGY MUNSON: Yeah, what are we, building some kind of basketball space. ship?
MONIX: You don't have to understand it yet. Just run it again. You heard me AGAIN.
CLARENCE: We've been running this play for a long time, man.
JACKIE MOON: Yeah, maybe we could try, like, play number two.
MONIX: No. We're running this play. We're running this play until we puke.
JACKIE MOON: Yeah, I'm pretty beat.
MONIX: 'Until we puke' is not a figure of speech. We are literally going to JACKIE MOON What does he mean by 'literally?'
JACKIE MOON: What does he mean by 'literally?'
CLARENCE: I think he's talking about vomit.
JACKIE MOON: Monix, can I talk to you for .a No. No talking.
MONIX: No. No talking.
JACKIE MOON: Jackie hangs his head, but then accepts his fate. He runs.
MONIX: Jackie hangs his head, but then accepts his fate. He runs.
GO!: Jackie hangs his head, but then accepts his fate. He runs.
MONIX: ( as they run ) We need to get in shape fellas. And we need to learn some fundamentals quick. AGAIN! They run it again, getting more and more winded.
MONIX: I want you to be brain dead. Because someday you're going to be too tired, or too nervous to think - - AGAIN! And when you are, this is the play I'm going to call. The play that your lungs and legs will have memorized. We will be able to run this in our sleep. Clarence tries to gag himself with his fingers.
MONIX: HEY! No sticking your fingers down your throat, Clarence, I saw that. You're going to puke. And it's going to be all natural AGAIN!
MONIX: MOVE MOVE MOVE! FOURTH QUARTER NOW! FOURTH QUARTER! JACKIE MOON You're fired!
FOURTH QUARTER!: JACKIE MOON You're fired!
JACKIE MOON: You're fired!
MONIX: Fuck you.
JACKIE MOON: Fuck you.
MONIX: Get up and run. You're going to puke like everybody else.
JACKIE MOON: Monix, I need to talk to you.
MONIX: We'll. talk after you puke. GO!
JACKIE MOON: I can't puke Monix!
MONIX: Yes you can. Go. Jackie crawls harder along the hardwood.
JACKIE MOON: Monix! You don't understand. I've never thrown up in my life.
MONIX: What are you talking about?
JACKIE MOON: I've never puked. Ever.
MONIX: That makes no sense. Everyone has thrown up before.
JACKIE MOON: I haven't. I swear to God. I can eat anything. I can drink anything. I've been sick, but I've never puked. I swear to God.
MONIX: That's bullshit. Keep moving, you're going to puke.
JACKIE MOON: I don't puke. I can't do it! It's the truth! I swear on my Mother's At this point, Monix can't help but be intrigued.
MONIX: What about when you were a baby? Babies throw up all the time.
JACKIE MOON: My Mom said I never did. I swear. She said I was fascinating.
MONIX: No way.
JACKIE MOON: You can call my Dad! I've never When Jackie looks up at Monix, it's clear he is not lying.
MONIX: Isn't that kind of dangerous?
JACKIE MOON: What do you mean?
MONIX: What happens if you swallow poison?
JACKIE MOON: I don't know. I ate bad sausage before. But nothing happened.
MONIX: Stand up. Jackie manages to stand up.
MONIX: Have you ever been punched in the JACKIE MOON I don't know. What's a Jejunum?
JACKIE MOON: I don't know. What's a Jejunum?
MONIX: It's part of your small intestine.
JACKIE MOON: I don't know. I doubt
JACKIE MOON: ( to the sky ) WITH THAT, JACKIE PROJECTILE VOMITS. THE DISCHARGE IS BEYOND BELIEF. A LIFETIME'S WORTH OF TOXINS ARE LAUNCHED OVER A SHRUB. JACKIE WAILS IN DESPAIR. MONIX stands in the doorway, watching this.
MONIX: You okay? Jackie is about to speak, but then takes stock of his feelings. There is now an air of tranquility about him. Reborn. He's almost Euphoric.
JACKIE MOON: I'm beautiful.
MONIX: ( huddling up ) Listen up. I'll in-bound. Clarence, protect the ball and penetrate if you can. Kick it out to Scootsie or me and everyone crash the boards hard. Looking good, we're thirty seconds away from taking this one home. Let's bring it in.
JACKIE MOON: He's right guys. But remember, we want to win, but not by too much.
TWIGGY MUNSON: We don't want to win by too much?
MONIX: What the Hell is he talking about?
CLARENCE: He's worried about the corn dogs.
MONIX: If we score a hundred points, everyone gets a free corn dog. There are signs everywhere.
CLARENCE: If we score a hundred points, everyone gets a free corn dog. There are signs everywhere.
JACKIE MOON: I'm sorry, Monix, but we don't even have corn dogs.
MONIX: I don't give a shit. We're taking it to them.
JACKIE MOON: We're up by seven, Monix. Can't we just take it easy? We're talking about a lot of corn dogs here.
MONIX: I don't give a shit about the corn dogs, okay? We play hard every second. We're running the offense. Everyone got that? Everyone nods. WHISTLE!
JACKIE MOON: VAKIDIS! NO!!! VAKIDIS TAKES THE BALL AND GOES FOR A DUNK LIVE ABA RADIO ( V.0. ) Vakidis takes it up strong to the BAM! JACKIE MOON TACKLES VAKIDIS INTO THE STANDS. LIVE ABA RADIO ( V.0. ) Ooh. He gets taken out hard by the

JACKIE MOON: INT. DAIQUIRI ROOM - LATER The daiquiri room is crowded with guys. JACKIE is having a team meeting.
JACKIE MOON: I asked you up to the Daiquiri room, because this is a private ( everyone looks around ) As you know, I threw up recently.
JACKIE MOON: In this bag, is ten thousand No way. Really?
DUKES: No way. Really?
JACKIE MOON: Actually, it's twenty three hundred. But I'm going to pay you the rest. The Tropics will not let you down. From now on, I want my conscience clear.
DUKES: Wow. Thanks Jackie.
JACKIE MOON: Can I confess something to everyone? It's something I've never told anybody.
CLARENCE: What is it?
JACKIE MOON: You know my song 'Love Me Sexy?'
JACKIE MOON: I stole it.
TWIGGY MUNSON: 7 8 JACKIE MOON It's true. ( turns away, dramatic ) My Mom wrote it. Three weeks before she died. And I stole it. Even Monix is fascinated by this.
JACKIE MOON: It's true. ( turns away, dramatic ) My Mom wrote it. Three weeks before she died. And I stole it. Even Monix is fascinated by this.
JACKIE MOON: No, she wrote it on a napkin. I duped the whole world. I'm nothing but a fraud.
CLARENCE: Damn. VJ day? That's cold.
JACKIE MOON: ( ignoring Kong ) And even on that day, I don't feel like it's me who's sleeping with BEE BEE ELLIS What does that mean?
JACKIE MOON: She married me because of my song, but I didn't write it. So sometimes I feel like it's not even me who's with her. ( more emotional ) Deep down, I feel like it's really my Mom who is making love to her. When I hold Lucy's supple breasts in my hands, they are my Mom's hands. When I eat a pair of edible panties off of her, they are my Mom's teeth.
DUKES: That's pretty weird.
JACKIE MOON: I'm living in a prison, Dukes.
CLARENCE: Why don't you write a song yourself? Then you wouldn't feel like a fake any more.
JACKIE MOON: Oh please! I could never write anything as brilliant as 'Love Me ( standing tall ) Listen to me, Tropics. Today is a new day.

COMMISH: Hey Jackie.
JACKIE MOON: Oh, hey Commish. ( a little worried )
COMMISH: Listen, my office has been getting your numbers. You claim you've had over two thousand people at every home game this month.
JACKIE MOON: ( dead pan ) That's correct. The commissioner looks around, skeptical. As we scan the stands, it's clear the crowd is still not big enough.
COMMISH: Well, we've counted only nine hundred and eighty three here JACKIE MOON What, you don't think people go to the bathroom? ( Commish isn't buying it ) Saturdays can be a little slow. You should have been here the other night, it was SO PACKED.

He slowly walks toward the bedroom. KYLE'S POV: Peeking around the corner, we spy Monix and Lynn still going at it. ON KYLE: His whole body goes numb, his face turns red. We hold on his face until:
KYLE: ( BEAT ) Still undetected, Kyle settles in to watch the show, still wearing his Monix jersey. Lynn finally looks over and spots Kyle. We can't be sure, but his hand might be in his pants. Lynn can't believe her eyes.
LYNN: ( having sex, whispering off to Kyle ) Stop that.
KYLE: Stop what?
LYNN: ( in pig Latin ) Ixne-on-the-erking off-je. Monix finally notices his sex partner is having a conversation. He turns to see Kyle.

JACKIE MOON: NO. Look into my eyes. ( Clarence does ) You're the ref tonight. No matter what happens in there, do not stop the fight, okay?
JACKIE MOON: Yeah, let's do it.
BEAR HANDLER: You guys want to give me a safe CLARENCE THE REF What's a safe word?

COMMISH: JACKIE MOON Oh, hey Commish. Good game huh? And a packed house too.
JACKIE MOON: Oh, hey Commish. Good game huh? And a packed house too.
COMMISH: I need to talk to you. And the rest of your team. Alone.
COMMISH: I'm sorry, but even if you beat the Spurs on Friday, we just can't have an NBA franchise in Flint.
MONIX: What are you saying?
COMMISH: It's just not good business. Flint isn't a big enough media market, okay? This stadium is small and, frankly, it needs to be torn down before someone gets hurt. I'm sorry but nobody ever thought you guys could ever get this far.
CLARENCE: Well tough shit. This team did make it this far. Rules are rules.
COMMISH: Rules are rules. Until the expansion committee makes new rules. Then those rules are the Everyone looks at each other. Jackie's brain has slipped into a deep trance. He is no longer inside his body.
COMMISH: Don't take this personally, Jackie. These other teams have strong markets, new stadiums. It's just not going to happen for you Flint boys. I'm sorry. The devastation of what is happening is palpable. Nothing has ever hurt this bad before.
COMMISH: I know you're going to punch me, Jackie. So let's just get it over The commissioner stands brave, eyes closed, chin out. Jackie is too confused and devastated to hit anything. He stumbles out of the room like a zombie. The team follows. The commissioner opens his eyes. A long silent beat.
COMMISH: ( to himself ) How did I get out of that one? Suddenly KONG darts in and squeezes the commissioner's balls with a kung fu grip.
COMMISH: EXT. FLINT TROPICS COLISEUM - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT The team files out into the parking lot, totally devastated.
TWIGGY MUNSON: This can't be happening.
JACKIE MOON: I don't know. ( contorting his face ) I'm trying to. ( looking to the sky ) I wish I could just puke this away. ( to Monix ) Do it to my Jejunum, Monix. Help But Monix is leaving. He turns and walks off, alone down the dark street. The others walk away too.
JACKIE MOON: Wait! Monix! Where is everyone MUSIC CUE: 'IT'S TOO LATE' BY ISAAC HAYES. MONTAGE: PLAYERS OF FLINT ARE DOWN AND OUT. -CLARENCE walks alone along the river.
CLARENCE: Thought I might find you here. ( long beat ) I got traded.
MONIX: Yeah, I heard.
CLARENCE: I guess the San Antonio Spurs are picking up the players they want, before we're eligible for the expansion draft.
MONIX: Coffee Black, going to the NBA.
CLARENCE: They won't let me finish out with the Tropics. So, we'll be playing against each other in the last game. That's pretty weird.
MONIX: It won't be weird. The game doesn't Listen I'm sorry about
CLARENCE: Listen I'm sorry about
MONIX: Don't be sorry.
CLARENCE: I mean, I just want to say that, this year, you really
MONIX: DON'T. Alright? Just don't. Clarence stares at him. Then eventually stands up to leave. There are a million things he wants to say, but he says this:
CLARENCE: We worked so hard.
MONIX: Well, it was all for nothing.
CLARENCE: So, that's just it then?
MONIX: That's just it. Clarence shakes his head and walks out.
LYNN: What the fuck are you doing?
MONIX: Oh. Hey Lynn.
LYNN: I thought the deal was, you were going to sleep.
MONIX: Pshh. Relax.
LYNN: So, you're just going to sit here in my house and drink for the entire day?
MONIX: You got a problem with that?
LYNN: Yeah, I do. Maybe you could put some pants on and go piss off somebody else.
MONIX: Fine, maybe I will!
LYNN: Tell me something, Monix-
MONIX: Whatwereyou trying to accomplish thisyear?You never really gave a shitaboutthat NBA merger, did Monix doesn't say anything.
LYNN: Whatwereyou trying to accomplish thisyear?You never really gave a shitaboutthat NBA merger, did Monix doesn't say anything.
LYNN: The merger, Monix, did you ever care about it? Monix still stays quiet.
LYNN: Tell me, if you didn't care about the merger, what the Hell were you playing for!?
MONIX: I wanted fourth place! Okay? That was the whole fucking thing!
LYNN: Well, guess what! Fourth place is still sitting there, waiting for you to win it! Monix doesn't look at her.

MONIX: Over the past five weeks, we've become a team. And that is no small thing. Jackie, have you ever been on a real team before?
JACKIE MOON: No sir.
MONIX: How does it feel?
JACKIE MOON: It feels pretty good.
MONIX: All your lives, you've dreamed of playing in the NBA. Well, guess what? Tomorrow night, you are. You're playing an NBA team. And for one night, the world is going to know that you belong.
MONIX: But the truth is, I want this more than anything I've ever wanted in my whole fucked-up life.

TWIGGY MUNSON: We need to figure out what we're going to do in the second half.
JACKIE MOON: YOU WILL NOT SPEAK OF MY MOTHER THIS WAY! THIS SHOT IS MAGICAL! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? Jackie's eyes are intense and he's breathing way too hard. This dream was real. Monix tries to pacify him.
MONIX: Alright Jackie, relax, okay?

MONIX: What the Hell are you doing?
JACKIE MOON: What, you've never seen me shoot free throws before?
CLARENCE: He shoots them Granny style.
MONIX: ( to himself ) Jackie's ritual is insane. He breathes, spins the ball, turns around 360, deep knee bends, touches his left shoulder four times, then SUDDENLY WINGS THE BALL HIGH IN THE AIR.
