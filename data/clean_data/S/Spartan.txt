SCOTT: (quietly) ...you better catch her...
SCOTT: ...your Dad's napping on the sofa, your Mom's watching Let's Make A Deal, and God is Dead. What do you expect me to do...?
YOUNG MAN: (very weakly) ...I'm tired, Sir...Sir, there's no way...
SCOTT: There's always a way...Don't You tell me there's no way...
SCOTT: How 'bout that? That's called 'Adrenaline'. You said you Wanted In.
SCOTT: This is where you get in. The mugger don't care. The shooter don't care...get up...Or I will beat you to death on this fucken hill...Now: you better Catch her...
SCOTT: (responding to his look. As if to say "That's right.") There's nothing but the mission...
SCOTT: Well done.
YOUNG WOMAN (JACKIE BLACK): A signal honor to work with you, sir.
SCOTT: Thank you, Sergeant.
JACKIE BLACK: Sir: Day or Night. Black or White. You reach out for me. "Black, Jaqueline A. US 24191489."
SCOTT: I'll remember, Sergeant.
SCOTT: (of the card) What's this then?
ANTON: It was my father's, sir.
SCOTT: He carry it Over There?
ANTON: Yes, sir.
SCOTT: He come back?
ANTON: Yes, sir. He did.
SCOTT: (nods. Pause) Well, so.
SCOTT: You carry that card, son. It might save your life. (Anton nods) ...You could use it to light a fire, or something...
BLANE'S AIDE: The Candidate Cadre will fall in on the White Line...
ANTON: I just wanted to say, sir...That, to meet you...
SCOTT: (rising, as he gives the Ranger card back to Anton) You never met me. You've been up for a week. You're seeing Snakes...
ANTON: (looking after the departing, failed men) ...I can't imagine how they live with it...
SCOTT: Make sure you can't imagine it, cause, if you can, it's just one step to doing it.
SCOTT: (pause) ...they'll be back where they came from by Morning, and all this is just a Bad Dream.
ANTON: My name is...
SCOTT: Do I need to know? (pause) If I want Camaraderie, I'll join the Masons. (pause. Then, summing it all up:) There's just the mission.
BLANE'S AIDE: (as he glances down at his clipboard) Congratulations on completion of this evolution. I know you would probably like some sleep, but I do not think you'd mind sparing ten minutes for Induction.
BLANE: Thank you, Bobby.
SCOTT: Not at all, Sir...
BLANE: ...You going home?
SCOTT: ...weather permitting, Sir...
BLANE'S AIDE: (in the distance. As camera tracks with Blane and Scott) ...as I call your names: (he consults his clipboard) Grossler, Anton...
BLANE: (over his shoulder, to an Aide) ...would you bolt the door, please...?
BLANE: (to the candidates) ...are you tired, Gentlemen? (the two young men smile) This is the completion of the evolution: (beat) Only one of you may join the unit. The first man through that door will be inducted.
SCOTT: (to himself, quietly) ...yeah...you wanted to know the 'secret knowledge'...
DRILL INSTRUCTOR: (to that man) What the hell are you looking at? There ain't nobody there...
YOUNG WORKER: (into phone) ...Frontgate...
SCOTT: (of the photo, nodding to himself, as he reads) "...Betty Coed, has hair of red for Harvard..."
AIDE: (of the top photo) It's not current.
SCOTT: Why not...?
AIDE: It seems she got a makeover today. We're working on it.
SCOTT: (reads) 4PM. Cut n'Curl...
AIDE: Gave her a crewcut, dyed it platinum blonde...
SCOTT: (glancing up at the man in the chair) Met with her boyfriend at ten. Then...?
SCOTT: ...he's on Post until he turned her over to the Nightwatch...?
AIDE: He says he was...
SCOTT: Who else you got...?
AIDE: ...we got the boyfriend, Michael Blake.
SCOTT: ...where is he...?
AIDE: Was not in his dorm last night, we're shaking the trees...And... (Scott is passed another photo) Professor Gerald Sloane, notably chummy with his female students, of which she was one. Weekend home, Martha's Vineyard...
SCOTT: ...for sure...?
AIDE: Been there since Friday.
MILLER: I'm light. I'm light, people...I need another team on the Professor, I need an overwatch on the boyfriend...
MILLER: You just come from the Cadre.
SCOTT: Yes sir.
MILLER: How long since you've slept?
SCOTT: Not significant.
MILLER: You take a team, and Bulldog. Are you up for it?
SCOTT: (absently, as he looks over the materials he has been given) Sir, "this Marine pisses av gas and farts blackpowder, Sir."
MILLER: Thank you for coming, Bobby.
SCOTT: Are you kidding, sir...?
MILLER: I don't have the bodies. Call em in...call em in...
AIDE: (whispering) His post was Harvard Yard. Harvard Yard, Northeast Corner, Lowell House, across from her dorm. Nightwatch relieved him there, Midnight...
INTERROGATOR: Once more:
GAINES: She, uh. She had lunch with her father.
INTERROGATOR: Lunch with her father - you seconded to that detail?
GAINES: No, sir. I just had her.
INTERROGATOR: "...you just had her..."
GAINES: I. Uh...uh. I had her all day. Tucked her in. At Ten. And she...
INTERROGATOR: ...yeah, "she had a tiff with her boyfriend..."
GAINES: Yes. I...
INTERROGATOR: Michael Blake - (he holds up a photo of a preppy fellow)
MILLER: What was it about?
GAINES: I think it was about her...her... (he makes gestures of haircutting)
MILLER: Her haircut... (Gaines nods) So it wasn't a serious...?
GAINES: No, no. (pause) No. (pause) And then I, (he covers his mouth as he speaks) I held the post until relieved... (he gestures at his notebook, as if to support him)
MILLER: Well, then, we've got a little problem.
GAINES: (shaking his head in denial) I was there.
MILLER: (reading) 23.12 Hours, 19 May. Harvard Yard, Northeast Corner, Lowell House, reveals no Secret Service Presence, neither this post nor adjacent... (he looks through his notes) ...a second tour, 23.30, reveals, similarly...
GAINES: I was there, Sir.
MILLER: (to Gaines) Who's lying? (pause) You or him? (pause. Gaines slightly averts his head.)
SCOTT: You son of a bitch, I've got fifteen years in, and three kids, and you're gonna sit there, and lie away my Pension...
SCOTT: ...don't you tell me you were there...
GAINES: I was On Post...
SCOTT: (as he moves towards Gaines seriously) ...you lying swine...Don't you tell me you were On Post!
INTERROGATOR: Shall I tell you what's gonna happen to you, when we find you out?
GAINES: (he gets up and walks, wearily, toward the windows, and turns) I...Uh...
INTERROGATOR: Were you fucking her...? (pause) We're gonna find out...
GAINES: No, I...um...
INTERROGATOR: ...Where Is She?
MILLER: We've got until her Monday Morning Class, and then it's Meet the Press; and "Where is she...?" (he shakes his head) Who's got the Professor...? Where is he...?
AN AGENT: Martha's Vineyard.
MILLER: Who's got him?
AN AGENT: Jones and Shannon.
MILLER: (to the group) Wake him up, shake him up. He don't want to talk... (he holds out his hand, and an Aide puts some papers into it) Here's what we have him doing with his Female Students, show 'em to his wife...The Photo...? (one of the agents brings in two photographs) Here is the last known photo...of the girl.
MILLER: The lab ran it up, based on the testimony of the beauty shop. We have not told Boston or Cambridge PD, nor have we...
AN AGENT: The Professor...
MILLER: (to the associate) You had him in his home...
AN AGENT: Sir, we were in Error, we...
MILLER: Where is he...?
AN AGENT: Best guess puts him on his boat. Last seen out of West Tisbury, Martha's Vine...
MILLER: Find him. Put the guard on him. Get me an overflight. (generally) I'm light, I'm light, people. (he points to an associate) Shake the Trees. I'm light, here...I'm 25 men light. Get 'em in. Who's got the Coastguard...What's the name of his boat? Professor Gerald Sloane...
AIDE: It's the boyfriend. He's moving...
SCOTT: I've got him...
MILLER: (coming over to Scott) ...I've got two days to run in. Before the Press wakes up.
SCOTT: (as he responds to the inherent request in Miller's voice) Whatever it takes, sir...
SCOTT: Could I see your hands, son...?
SCOTT: L. Newton. (pause) You lose your mailbox key, Mr. Newton...? (pause)
BLAKE: Um.
SCOTT: You a student here?
BLAKE: Yes.
SCOTT: Could I see some identification, please...? Mr. Newton? (Scott takes out a walkie and begins to talk into it) Ten-Twelve patrol, requesting...
BLAKE: No, please...please... (pause) Please, Oh, God.
SCOTT: Calm down, Son. It's gonna be what it's gonna be...
BLAKE: One minute, could I please talk to you for one minute...Look look look: I broke up with My Girlfriend...
SCOTT: (of the letter) Laura. (he rereads the nameplate on the mailbox) Laura Newton? (pause) Laura Newton? Is that 'the' Laura Newton...?
BLAKE: We broke up. Alright? Laura Newton. They know who I am.
SCOTT: Who?
BLAKE: The Secret Service.
SCOTT: The Secret Service?
BLAKE: That's right, that's right. They know who I am. You...They've "cleared" me.
SCOTT: (gesturing to the jimmied mailbox) They didn't clear you for this.
BLAKE: You, you hear me out, and, if you want to, Then... (pause) Okay? Okay??? (pause)
SCOTT: I have to call it in.
BLAKE: Please...please. Five minutes...That's all I want. Please. Please...She would...she... (his face brightens at the new idea) Maybe she's in her room!
SCOTT: You tried the bell, you called her...
BLAKE: (as it dawns on him) Maybe she's ill...
SCOTT: ...Mzz Newton...? (pause) Mz Newton...this is Campus Security...
SCOTT: Mz Newton...? (pause)
YOUNG GIRL: Hey, Mike. Sprised to see you there. (smiles) That was some Vicious Performance...
BLAKE: ...I was just...trying to retrieve the letter.
SCOTT: ...this is not very nice language. (pause, Blake looks away) How old is this girl?
BLAKE: She's...just turned 18. (Scott shakes his head, sadly. pause) I was mad.
SCOTT: (of the letter:) ..."everything that's going to happen to her"...What was going to happen to her? (pause) You hurt her...? (pause) Did y'hit her, son...?
BLAKE: Hit her? No. I... (he gestures to the note) I called her...I called her a whore...I...
SCOTT: Why...?
SCOTT: (as if realizing "This is the question") Where is she?
BLAKE: (as if the question had not occurred to him previously) She must...she must...she must have gone home...
SCOTT: Why...?
BLAKE: (gesturing around, quietly) Because the Secret Service, isn't...
SCOTT: (of the sign on the letter,the "Picasso" sign, that is %-}. He turns the sign rightside up to show it is a 'cockeyed smile') What is this sign?
BLAKE: It's how she signs her letters. (smiles) Cause she looks at everything cockeyed...Like Picasso - she said they called her "Picasso". (pause)
SCOTT: Who called her that...?
BLAKE: You know, her, her... (remembering) He saw her yesterday! Maybe she's...maybe she's with him!
SCOTT: Why'd you fight with her, Son...?
BLAKE: (pause) She, uh, she got her hair done...She cut it off. She dyed it blonde. I said she looked like a slut...and... (pause)
SCOTT: Beautiful young girl like that. We've all seen her pictures. What'd you care how she dyed her hair? (pause) What'd you care...? Why's that make her a slut...? (pause)
BLAKE: She... (pause) Uh...
SCOTT: She seeing another fella...? (as he moves closer, confidingly) ...just between us. Off-the- record, son...
SCOTT (V.O.): ...I was young once, too.
SCOTT: I know that nothing hurts worse than that. She seeing another guy...?
BLAKE: (pause) There's this, um...Teacher...I shouldn't, I, I shouldn't tell you this: She...
SCOTT: She sleeping with a teacher...?
BLAKE: She says she isn't. I said she looked like a slut. She wants to fuck old guys, she should go to The Regency. Go all the Way.
SCOTT: The Regency, what's that?
BLAKE: (as if everyone knows this place) S'the Club, by the Fenway...it's like a joke at school, it's like a rumor: this or that girl, made a thousand bucks, went with a businessman for One Night... Look: it's a Lover's Quarrel. I said something I regret. I sent her a note which I regret, and I assure, you, Officer. If... (pause) If you would...
AGENT: No morgue. No hospital. No note.
SCOTT: The parents?
AGENT: The mother, (makes a "drinking" gesture) You know where she is...He's holding up... (as an afterthought) He was in town yesterday. To see her.
SCOTT: (as he shakes his head - to clear it) He was?
AGENT: ...we snuck him in, and out.
MILLER: (looking at a chart) "The Colophon - 36-foot sloop". Where is she...?
AIDE: ...the Coast Guard has a watch over this area: (he points to the chart) And they have scheduled the Colophon first...
GUARD: He copped to it.
SCOTT: He copped to what?
GUARD: (of Gaines) Off-post - punched out early to go boffing his girlfriend.
AGENT: Hope she was worth it...
SCOTT: Uh huh.
AGENT: We ran it up from a description of the colorist from the Beauty Parlor...
SCOTT: Gimme your coat.
SCOTT: (to Miller) I need five thousand dollars.
SCOTT: How long do we have? Sir?
MILLER: (shakes his head) It hits the papers, and we're done.
SCOTT: No...note? No...
SCOTT: (nodding) I've got it... (to Miller) Can I have some backup?
SCOTT: (to Anton) We're scraping the bottom of the barrel here, aren't we?
ANTON: Yes. Sir.
YOUNG WOMAN: I need you to sign it.
SCOTT: You sign it. (He scans the room again, shrugs, and motions to Anton) Come on, Wallflower... (Anton rises and walks over to him)
SCOTT: Now: your mouth shut. Your eyes open, and form on me...Here's where we're going...
SCOTT: Don't look at him. Don't look at the Downed Man. He's dead... (as he turns his back on the scene) Kick the fool overboard...
MILLER: ...who is the girl he went to see? Get her in...The girl he was fucking...Who's got the Coastguard...
SCOTT: I'd hate to be the Lucky Duck who frisked him... (beat)
ANTON: He was off-post when they snatched the girl?
SCOTT: (as he looks at the fallen agent) Yeah. Well, apparently, he felt bad about it...
BARTENDER: Closing up... (he points to his watch) Can't sell you booze after 3 AM.
SCOTT: (laying money on the bar) No, no. I just came buy to pay you that money I owe you.
SCOTT: (as he drinks) ...how about them Sox, huh...?
BARTENDER: Yuh. Whaddaya gonna do...?
SCOTT: "Curse of the Bambino".
BARTENDER: ...that's right. (pause)
SCOTT: Nice place you got here.
BARTENDER: You from out of town...?
SCOTT: Yeah, you know, actually, I was just looking for my Daughter...
BARTENDER: (as he smiles) ...that's what you're looking for...?
SCOTT: ...I. Uhh...
BARTENDER: ...ask, because a lot of out-of- town guys, come in, lookin, someone else's daughter.
SCOTT: No, I...Oh, no...
BARTENDER: (smiling) You sure...?
SCOTT: Abso, absolutely...
SCOTT: ...girl like that been in tonight...?
BARTENDER: ...pretty girl...
SCOTT: None prettier.
SCOTT: Yeah...I'm looking for a girl like that...
BARTENDER: ...You're sure it was your daughter...? B'cause, a lot of guys, come in here, guys your age, go home with some...some rather 'younger' girl...
SCOTT: (as he leans forward) Well, why would a, one of these 'younger girls'. What would they want to do with me...?
ZIMMER: 'Howdy, Pard'.
SCOTT: Hello. I wonder if you could help me...
ZIMMER: (as he yawns and looks at his watch, as he pushes past Scott) I love you, Baby, but the season's over...
SCOTT: (gestures at the Bartender) ...my friend says that you're...you're sort of a 'matchmaker'...
ZIMMER: Izzat what he says...?
BOUNCER: (as he walks away, to Zimmer, of Zimmer's car) I put her back in your space...
SCOTT: I was looking for a girl...a young girl...
ZIMMER: Aren't we all.
SCOTT: My, my, my, my, my, my question was: why would a young girl want to go out with an older man like me? And, if you could "answer" that...
ZIMMER: Look, Bub...
SCOTT: Don't touch the piece, don't touch the piece, don't touch the piece, th'out your gloves on...
ZIMMER: ...I think you broke my arm.
SCOTT: (as he shows the photo to Zimmer) You seen this girl before...
ZIMMER: (of his arm) ...I think it's broken...
SCOTT: You seen her tonight...?
ZIMMER: ...I think it's...
SCOTT: (to Anton) Pull him up...
SCOTT: Now it's broken. (of the picture) What's her name...? (pause. He strikes Zimmer in the face)
WHAT'S HER NAME...: (to Anton) Break his other arm...
SCOTT: You don't know her name, then who is she...?
ZIMMER: Some, some 'girl'...
SCOTT: Some 'girl', some 'pal' of yours? Where is she Now...?
SCOTT: (to Zimmer) Oh no... (pause) Oh no...this isn't Rohypnol... (pause) Is it...? (pause) Izziz Rohypnol? Is this "Rho"? (pause)
IZZIZ A ONE-SIDED CONVERSATION...?: (to Anton) Whatzisname?
ANTON: (looking at his driver's license) Donny Zimmer.
SCOTT: Donny. Donny: where's the girl...? (pause) You dose her...? (pause) Where is she? Donny...?
SCOTT: ...what is this? Ten, what is it, Fifteen thou...? For what...?
ZIMMER: I never saw that girl...
SCOTT: Oh, alright, then we've got to let you go...
SCOTT: Where'd you take the girl, Donny...? (pause. Silence. To Anton) You touch his piece?
ANTON: No.
SCOTT: Good.
SCOTT: That's not what girl...? (pause) Where'd you take her...? (Scott points to Zimmer's pistol. To Anton) Put your glove on. Pick up his pistol. Two knees, the other elbow, (he points to the head) Mozambique...
SCOTT: You bet your life.
ZIMMER: Wait...Wait...Wait...
SCOTT: ...okay, then...
SCOTT: ...beautiful night...
BUSINESSMAN: (nods) 'Less you got hayfever... (he gestures at the flowering trees)
SCOTT: ...you left something back inside.
BUSINESSMAN: ...I left my case inside.
SCOTT: ...they got some young girls up there...?
SCOTT: You see this girl...? (pause)
ANTON: Did you See This Girl...?
TECH: ...she was trying to scrub the thing...
MADAM: ...an escort service. There is no impropriety, and there is no...
MILLER: (calling back to one of his techs, who consults a computer) ...who is she?
TECH: ...Nadya Tellich, Serb. Green Card, in...
MILLER: Have you seen this girl...?
NADYA: We see a lot of girls. They apply. For the job, as Hostesses...
NADYA: ...a contact for Personal Services...They pay us so much for each call, and...The girls pay us! We are just a -
MILLER: They show you proof of their age...
NADYA: Of course, of course, I...you think I...What do you think, I...
SCOTT: (showing her the printout) Where's Number Fourteen? (pause)
NADYA: ...I don't understand you.
SCOTT: ...where's Number Fourteen? (pause)
NADYA: (pause) I want my Lawyer...
MILLER: ...is this the Girl? Is this her? Was she in here?
NADYA: I, wait, I no...I...I want to talk to my lll...
MILLER: (of the platinum-haired girl) Izzat her? It's her, isn't it. She was here. Is that her...?
BUSINESSMAN (ON TAPE): ...come over here, you little bitch...That's right, get your sweet ass over here...
SCOTT: (to an Agent) Make him watch it.
BUSINESSMAN: I...I...listen...listen: I'm a wealthy man. I am, I am not- without-friends in, in the Administration... (he takes out a business card and hands it to Scott) ...whatever it takes to...
SCOTT: This here, sir. This is a piece of cardboard.
INTERROGATOR: (as the Businessman starts to look away) Don't you look away, you son of a bitch... (he forces him to watch the video)
SCOTT: (stepping in) "I-I-I" - What are you, Carmen Miranda...?
BUSINESSMAN: (he draws Scott close, turning from Anton to the "good" cop) Listen to me: I cannot. Be caught here. You write an amount on a sheet of paper...write it on my card...
BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D): (he takes out his business card and hands it to Scott)
SCOTT: No, Baby. Today we got the Barter System. And you best pray to God you got something to trade...
BUSINESSMAN: (he takes out his wallet)
SCOTT: (he slaps the Businessman, and Anton pulls him off)
LEAVE ME ALONE, I'LL GET THE: (he picks up the man's business card) Come in here, try to buy me off? I've got Three Daughters...
ANTON: ...maybe we'd...
SCOTT: (as he looks down at the Businessman's card, and shakes his head. He moves back toward the Businessman, terrifying him) ...I thought when you wanted to pet little girls, you picked on your Daughter...Ain't that what you rich people do...now you step off the Reservation and you want to buy me?
SCOTT (CONT'D): (he shows a photo of the platinum-haired Laura to the Businessman) Where Is This Girl...
YOUNG WHORE: (looking at the photo of Laura Newton) I...She was sick...she was Not Very Well. She came in here...and...and...
FEMALE AGENT: ...who was she...?
YOUNG WHORE: I dunno...some young girl. I dunno...They took her, I told Nadya, she shunnt be here, they took her...
FEMALE AGENT: Who took her?
YOUNG WHORE: I think that was her.
FEMALE AGENT: Was she here?
YOUNG WHORE: I think that's the girl...they took her. The two, two men...they... (she draws the Female Agent closer, frightened) ...they gave her a shot...
NADYA: I am entitled to my rights, and I am entitled to a phonecall to my lll...
SCOTT: (brusquely) Your lawyer ain't going to help you...want to guess 'why'? (he looks to Miller, who nods, "Go ahead". he takes the photo of Laura with the red hair, sharply, from Miller and shows it to Nadya) Y'understand the picture...
NADYA: ...ohmigod...
SCOTT: He's with me...
MILLER: (as it dawns on him) They don't know who they've got...they just snatched "some Young Girl". When they find out, they're going to have to...
SCOTT: She was here. She was here, where is she...? WHERE IS SHE? (Scott thrusts the Laura Newton photo at her) She was here -
NADYA: ...I...I don't know if this is the...
SCOTT: She was here. (pause)
NADYA: (very softly, as she looks around, broken, for sympathy) ...they'll kill me.
SCOTT: Who did you call. How did they know, to come get her?
NADYA: I...it's just a number, I...
MILLER: (softly. To phone) ...hello...
BURCH: ...where's the girl...?
MILLER: Sir, we believe she was abducted, from this club... (as Miller speaks he passes pertinent sheets of information to Burch) That she was taken to...that she was taken to a bordello...
BURCH: ...here in Boston...
MILLER: Yessir, and, that...that...
BURCH: Come on, let's hear it:
MILLER: That she may have been...that she may have been delivered - for sale - that she may have been sent down the pipeline and overseas. (pause)
BURCH: (pause) "...just some girl..." (pause)
BURCH: How certain are you she was the girl in the whorehouse?
MILLER: (shakes his head, meaning "not positive") ...we...
BURCH: Was the girl in the whorehouse? (pause) What about your other leads?...the Boyfriend, the...Professor...?
MILLER: ...sir.
STODDARD: The Professor, where's his boat?
MILLER: The Coast Guard is on the...
SCOTT: ...we just go where we're sent and do what we're told when we get there...
BURCH: You've got the fucken Service Agent, shot himself...you're you're telling me, your best bet, some cocksuckers nabbed her, took her, took her, they don't know who she is. And they're gonna sell her down the river...?
MILLER: Sir...
BURCH (CONT'D): Now: Let's talk some commonsense: (pause) What can you do for me? (to Miller) ...who is that...? (Miller whispers to Burch. To Scott) ...Get in here... (Scott comes and stands by Burch)
BURCH: (quietly) ...what can you do for me? What can you do for me - I need it now - I need it before the Press gets it on Monday. Cause they will kill her. The jackals start a feeding frenzy, and she's red. Help me.
MILLER: Sir: This is the number of a public phone in Downtown Boston. (Burch nods) It's a cutout, between the Bordello, and the abductors. A call is placed when they have a package to deliver.
BURCH: ...you going to stake out the phone...?
MILLER: (nods) We have a watch on the phone. More importantly: N.S.A. reports calls placed to that phone. Regularly.
BURCH: They can track calls to a payphone?
MILLER: In this case they can.
BURCH: How?
MILLER: They were made from a Federal Prison. (he gestures to the Aide, who shows to Burch and the camera a photo of a smiling man in his forties, in an expensive suit. Of photo:) This is Eli Assani. He is a Lebanese National, serving life without, for kidnapping. He was the head man in a white slavery scheme.
BURCH: And where is he?
MILLER: He's in Lewisberg. We have a Plan... (pause) I hesitate to...
BURCH: Give it to me...
MILLER: They've got some action on the Payphone...
SCOTT: ...who's walking up on us...?
SCOTT: (as he loosens his jacket, over his pistol) ...who is he?
ANTON: Boston. P.D.
SCOTT: ...always a reflective surface... (then, to himself, as if reciting a litany) "...in the city, always a reflection. In the Woods. Always a sound..."
ANTON: ...and in the Desert?
SCOTT: You don't want to go into the desert.
ANTON: ...they're moving...
SCOTT: (of the hand) ...what is this...?
ANTON: (as he looks down, and then realizes the nature of the question) ...it's a wedding ring.
SCOTT: ...take it off. (pause. While Anton hesitates, not comprehending) ...the ring clicks against your riflestock, some sonobitch hears that noise, hundred yards out, and you're gonna get me killed.
SCOTT: ...where's he going...?
AGENT: One Five Four Nine, Alpha Sierra, Mass Reg. William Barak. Somerville, Mass...
SCOTT: That's where he's going?
AGENT: Also, owner of Record, In Essex...
SCOTT: Izzey going toward Essex? (Agent nods) ...what sort of place is it...?
AGENT: It...it'd be a Beach house...
SCOTT: Get me there. (to the Driver) Get on the net. Call 'em off. Everyone off. Just me. (of Anton) Just me and him.
DRIVER: ...sir...
SCOTT: Nobody out there... (to Anton) Just. Him. (to the Driver) You indicate that you heard me. (beat. The Driver nods) Put it out. (the Driver begins to speak softly, relaying his instructions on the radio. Scott turns to Anton. Softly) How you doing bright eyes...? (Anton nods. Beat, as Scott looks him over)
SCOTT: ...breathe through your nose.
SCOTT: It stills the heartrate. (pause) You got my back.
ANTON: Sir, Yes, Sir.
SCOTT: (to himself) ...alright, then...
ANTON: ...you want me to Come Through the Door...?
SCOTT: (as he checks his weapons. He shakes his head.) Don't you go through the door without an Overwatch.
MAN FROM THE SEDAN: (as he sees Scott) ...what the fuck...?
SCOTT: ...I heard the TV, so I came in... (pause)
SCOTT: ...what the hell you got the TV on for, there's nobody here...? (the man puts up his hands) I don't wanna hurt you. Why would I hurt you? I just wanna know why the TV's on.
SCOTT: ...I just wannit to know, I just came to ask you that question...
SCOTT: I'm Coming Up...
SCOTT: (to Anton) Call em in...
SCOTT: ...where's the girl...? You're dying, pal. Even it up. WHERE IS
SCOTT: You're dying. You're dying, man. Where is the girl...
SCOTT: ...well, you wanted to know... (pause. Scott kicks the dead man viciously)
SCOTT: (to himself) Yeah, everybody wants to know the Secret Knowledge...
SCOTT: ...tell it to the Chaplain.
BRUNETTE TALKING HEAD: ...apparently, had her hair restyled, and cut today, our Newsteam interviewed her stylist, and has reconstructed...
SCOTT: Ah, shit...
BURCH: (looking at a TV in the BG silently, showing photos of Laura as a brunette) ...here's the deal: (pause. He holds up a photo of Eli Assani, the Businessman, both in a suit, and in his prison garb, with a number in front of him. His name, and "Lewisberg Federal Penitentiary") ...this is the man. (pause, to Scott) ...you're covered in blood.
SCOTT: Sir, it ain't mine. (Burch looks at Anton. Scott, seeing his glance) On my team, sir.
BURCH: How deep is he?
SCOTT: (saying, in effect, this sums it up) ...He's on the team.
BURCH: Yeah, well. He may have to be a little more than On the Team... (pause. After considering) I've been speaking to the father. (pause)
BURCH: (pause) What about if we had to go "off the meter"?
SCOTT: ...With the Mission, sir.
BURCH: (to himself) ...I'm out of time...
BURCH: ...man to man.
SCOTT: The door's closed, Sir.
BURCH: I. Need. To Ask You. To do something. (he is hard-pressed to continue)
SCOTT: I am here to get the girl back.
BURCH: This man...Placed a phonecall. Yesterday. From the phonebank at Lewisberg. To the Copley Payphone. (pause) Here's the cut-off-point... (he looks meaningfully at Scott. Pause) ...here it is: This man, Eli Assani, is to be transported, tomorrow, Wednesday, with another convict. A Man on Death Row. For their medical procedures...Now:
SCOTT: Shut up.
HEAVYSET CONVICT: Yeah, two twelve sierra took all the 20 he's gonna take...Oh, man, you left him there...
HEAVYSET CONVICT (V.O.): ...yeah. You marked him Paid in Full...
ASSANI (V.O.): ...you got to pull over, you got to stop...I'm bleeding.
HEAVYSET CONVICT: Yeah, he done ate from the tree of knowledge, our Sierra Two Twelve.
ASSANI: ...help me...
SCOTT: Shut up.
SCOTT: ...drag him out... (the man does so. Scott motions for them to be quiet) ...got some business to do...
ASSANI: ...help me...
HEAVYSET CONVICT: ...yeah, I heard yah...
HEAVYSET CONVICT: Yeah, Baby. Pass some my way...
SCOTT: Sorry, my man...traveling light...
ASSANI: Don't shoot me, don't shoot me, I have what you want. I HAVE
SCOTT: Why in the world would I believe a lying convict like you...
ASSANI: Oh, ah, ah, but you do believe me...I see it...you do. I can get us out. Help me. I SWEAR TO YOU. HELP ME...and I will treat you like a brother...I...
SCOTT: My brother used to beat me (he raises the cop's service revolver and cocks the hammer) Nice guess, though.
ASSANI: No, no. Listen to me...listen...make one call. One call - go in the house. Make One Call. ONE CALL. An Aviation Company. Tell...tell them...tell them the word I say, and they will say: THE PLANE WILL MEET
YOU AT...: (Scott hesitates for a moment, and Assani attempts to capitalize on it) Yes. Yes...
SCOTT: You a fag my friend?
ASSANI: No. (pause) I am not.
SCOTT: Then why the hell you looking at me?
ASSANI: I was thinking...how fucking surprised you're going to be. (pause) Because, Baby, you just did that fucken good turn, going to Make You Rich, Fat, and Happy...
SCOTT: ...just get me on that plane.
ASSANI: Didn't they tell you...?
SCOTT: All I heard's a voice on the phone...
ASSANI: ...you like girls...?
SCOTT: Better question, where you've been so long, do you like girls?
ASSANI: We have. You will have...the most beautiful...
SCOTT: ...most beautiful women, eh?
ASSANI: Not women, Baby. Girls. You got to trust me, I'm the Doctor here...All young. All blonde...
SCOTT: And this all takes place Where...?
ASSANI: In Dubai. In Yemen...
SCOTT: Well, that's a long way from Tiperrary, pal...
ASSANI: ...what do you have here...?
SCOTT: Yeah, but I'm not cut out, to live in a fucken tent. (Assani laughs)
ASSANI: If you think you can imagine luxury...I am here to tell you, my friend... (he smiles broadly)
SCOTT: Well, may it Just Be So...
ASSANI: When we get to Maskala...
SCOTT: And, now, what's Maskala...?
ASSANI: ...when we get to Dubai, better...
SCOTT: What's Maskala...?
ASSANI: ...that's where we clean them up. We ship them Rough, we make them Smooth, and everybody's happy.
SCOTT: Well, then, you're a philosopher...huh...? How 'bout making me happy tonight...
ASSANI: If there's a girl, in the pipeline, tonight, you shall have her, what do you say to that?
SCOTT: ...I say you're a stone cold whoremaster...
ASSANI: No, no baby. Take it to the    bank. The Arabs, Man. All the oil    - all the money in the world.    What can't they have? Booze and    Pussy. How do they get it...?
SCOTT: You the candy man? Is that it?
SCOTT: Ah. Hell...
ASSANI: Yeah, no. I'm bleeding bad here, friend...
SCOTT: (he looks over) Yeah, we just, we got to get some...yeah, you need, all we need, some tailoring tools.
SCOTT: Yeah, in my wishlist, we had a drugstore, get us some morphine, some...
TV WOMAN: ...America's Number One Redhead, "She Sets the Style, She Brings a Smile", she's Betty co-ed, in College, and she's off for what her father's office says is an "extended sailing weekend". (the screen shows a sailboat) With "person or persons unknown"...yo ho, yo Ho...she "old" enough for that, our "Little Red Riding-Hood", Cathy...?
ANTON: (whispers) ...the helo just went down...
SCOTT: ...don't whisper to me, Baby, it draws heat. What helo?
ANTON: ...the assault helicopter. You've got no backup, at the house. (beat. Scott nods) You'll be in there, alone, the first few minutes...
SCOTT: Well, there you go, then.
ANTON: You said "Never go in without an overwatch".
SCOTT: That's all fine, lad, "But this is the fleet".
ANTON: You know you deliver him in the door, you know they're going to waste you.
SCOTT: ...gimme whatever nine mil you've got...
SCOTT: ...just gimme the mags... (Anton does so) ...gimme your piece.
SCOTT: Thank you...
ANTON: (calling) Mister...mister: you forgot your change...
ANTON: (sotto) ...you better take care of yourself, because...
ANTON: A...I'm alright...I'm alright...
MILLER: Your partner's going to be alright.
SCOTT: I do not look at the downed man, Sir...
MILLER: Yeah, well...
SCOTT: ...Sir...?
MILLER: (sits, acceding to Scott's request) ...Air Force Assault is airborne, five minutes out. (pause, Scott shakes his head sadly) Standing down's a bitch.
SCOTT: I stand down when the girl's back, sir.
MILLER: They'll get her out, if she's in there... (pause, as he looks at Scott) You did your part, what the fuck do you want, a Citation?
AIDE: ...sir...
MILLER: Where are you going.
SCOTT: On the dustoff.
MILLER: Forget it.
SCOTT: Sir...? Sir...?
MILLER: There's no room.
SCOTT: I'm pleading with you, sir...
MILLER: Let him hear the assault on the Net...
SCOTT: I want to see the girl.
JIM (TALKING HEAD NEWSCASTER): The death, just reported, the death of Laura Newton. The... the...
TALKING HEAD WOMAN: ...her father, on the eve of the campaign... (we switch to a video shot of this man, waving off reporters) Jim, can there be any doubt...
JIM: Tracey, the Secret Service, for obvious reasons, their records, the DNA, fingerprints... the... and, she had just been in the water a scant, less than four hours, the...apparently the boat swamped... she -
TRACEY: She was sailing with...?
JIM: With her professor, Professor...? (the video shows the Professor)
TRACEY: ...a Tragedy, such as this.
JIM: ...particularly. Particularly, Tracey, coming, right at the start of his Campaign...
TRACEY: Will he delay the start of the Campaign?
JIM: ...his grief...
TRACEY: ...he was very close to his daughter, wasn't he?
JIM: Well, indeed, he saw her, the day...that would be, the day before last. He was in Boston for the Strategy Meeting, and saw her then...
TRACEY: (sadly) ...and that would be the Last time...that...
MILLER: Her boyfriend called her a slut. She went off to prove it. Her and the Professor. Coked up, boat capsized...Both bodies washed up naked. Coast Guard dressed 'em up...full of Ecstasy...
SCOTT: ...he killed her...
MILLER: (shrugs, meaning "who knows") He was fucking her, they're stoned...the boat capsized...
MILLER: (almost to himself) ...so much death.
SCOTT: (philosophically, as if summing the whole thing up) ...rock crushes scissors...
MILLER: I'm sorry about your man.
SCOTT: He isn't my man, Sir. He's a trainee.
ANTON: ...what time is it?
SCOTT: What do you care...? (pause. We see that Anton is having difficulty formulating his thoughts)
ANTON: I fucked up.
SCOTT: ...in what way was that?
ANTON: (groggily, as he tries to move, to draw closer to Scott) ...but I was trying to help. (Scott reacts to Anton's pain.)
SCOTT: What? Do you want some more Dope? Whaddaya want, a Dr. Pepper...?
ANTON: ...but I was trying to help.
SCOTT: ...yeah, well, that's when people generally do fuck up. Wait for that to kick in. (Anton starts to lay back, and then, as if he is remembering something, he draws closer to Scott again.) You're gonna take that fight to bed for a while. You don't got to do it all now.
ANTON: (sotto) I saw the sign.
SCOTT: ...uh huh...
ANTON: (drawing him back, as if saying LISTEN:) I saw the sign...at the Cape. In the House.
SCOTT: You saw-the-sign. What sign?
ANTON: ...when I dropped the guy. The girl's Picasso sign... (he draws the sign in the condensation on the plane's window) She was there. At the Cape. The girl was there.
SCOTT: The girl wasn't there. She was on a boat. She fell off the boat. She's dead. (pause) You did what you could. You did what you were trained to do. (pause) You did what you could.
ANTON: ...I saw the sign...
SCOTT: (turning away) ...then you are Truly Blessed.
INTERROGATOR: ...from the house, a house, a holding facility, a compound? called Maskala. The girls are taken from Maskala, to the ...Royale Hotel, in Dubai. (he closes the notes, as if completing his presentation) As time passes, you may remember other aspects of...well, (the Interrogator stands) You've heard this speech before...
SCOTT: ...would be most grateful, sir, to be included on the mission. "At Such Time..." (pause)
BLANE: ...on a mission to Dubai.
SCOTT: Is it in contemplation, sir...? (pause)
SCOTT: Yes, sir. (pause) If and When, Sir...
BLANE: You need a rest, Bobby. (pause. as he extends his hand) Thank you, Bobby...
SCOTT: ...please don't touch that. (Scott picks up the duffle and puts the strap over his shoulder)
LECTURER: ...pick it up.
LECTURER: What are you studying here...? I'm talking to you, son... What are you studying?
TRAINEE: Sir, this Candidate is studying knife fighting.
LECTURER: Hold your ground, son.
LECTURER: (pointing behind him) ...you, and your friend...
LECTURER: There are two ways to fight, you can fight fair, or you can fight to win.
SCOTT: Don't you study knife fighting, son. You Learn to Kill. And then, f'you meet some other fellow, studied knife fighting, you send him to hell.
LECTURER: Next man:
LECTURER: Now: I want to see some evil intent.
GRACE: Hey, fuck it, Huh...?
SCOTT: I've always thought so.
GRACE: How'd the puppy like it out there? He piss in the punchbowl?
SCOTT: He did okay.
GRACE: I heard he caught poison ivy.
SCOTT: He did okay. Why? You goin' out?
GRACE: What?
SCOTT: You recruiting?
GRACE: Why would I be recruiting?
SCOTT: You speak Arabic, huh...?
GRACE: That's what the Arabs tell me.
SCOTT: You, reason I ask: you going in the Sandbox...?
GRACE: Ain't you overdue for some Down Time?
SCOTT: I'm just saying:
GRACE: Yeah. You Marines are a weepy bunch of motherfuckers. (Scott nods minutely in acknowledgement. And returns to watching the television) ...you get a chance to bowl in that tournament...?
SCOTT: (to himself) ...beautiful girl...
TRUCKER: ...you say something, Mister...?
SCOTT: No, I was looking at the television. (pause) I was talking to the television. (he turns to look at the girl) That girl's too good-looking for you anyway. What are you "rich"? What do you, "own" something?
SCOTT (CONT'D): (pause) Or are you "funny" or something...? (pause. Hold for a beat, on the confused face of the Trucker) Siddown. Lemme buy you a drink.
SCOTT: You peel the apple?
SCOTT: (as he starts to come down from the adrenaline rush) ...well. You should wipe off the blade.
SCOTT (CONT'D): (pause. Scott does so, cleaning the blade on a napkin) Or   else... (as if explaining the simplest and most perfect axiom of the universe) Or   else, it "rusts"... (a pause. He smiles at her. Pause) D'I   scare you...? (he closes the blade and sits on the bed, shaking his head to clear it) I'm   sorry if I frightened you. (pause)
GIRL: ...it's an odd knife.
SCOTT: Yeah. I got it from a Russian fellow.
GIRL: Was it a gift...?
SCOTT: No. As I remember, he seemed rather reluctant to part with it. (pause) It's just a knife.
PROPRIETOR: How you been, John...?
SCOTT: ...workin hard...
PROPRIETOR: ...bet you have...
SCOTT: How you, Billy...?
PROPRIETOR: ...one gallon goin to do it...?
SCOTT: (pointing at him accusingly) ...you been lookin' at my house...?
PROPRIETOR: Nope, just trine a sell you some paint... (as he puts the cup down in front of Scott. Joking) ...but, now you mention it...
NEW FARMER: ...John...
SCOTT: Mr. Reese, how are you...? (Billy goes to take care of the new customer, and turns back to deal with Scott, who is waiting to ask a question) That new saw blade come in?
BILLY: (as if just remembering) No, John. It did not. I beg your pardon. I know that's your baby...I'm gone call them up and get Right On That.
BILLY: (as an afterthought) ...'spected you back a few days ago...
SCOTT: (looking out the window, absently) I took the Long Way Home.
SCOTT: Could I see your Right Hand, please...?
ANTON: There's nothing in my right hand.
SCOTT: Could I see it, please...?
SCOTT: You put your wedding ring back on.
ANTON: (not understanding the import of the question) ...yes...?
SCOTT: Then I have to guess you're not "on assignment". (pause) You're in the wrong place, baby. (pause) How did you find me...?
SCOTT: Well, I guess I'm not as smart as I thought I was. (pause)
ANTON: I need to talk to you.
ANTON: I saw the sign.
SCOTT: "You saw the sign". You were up for a week, you coulda seen Jack Ruby, you don't know what you saw...your first-time-out.
ANTON: I saw the sign.
SCOTT: ...then, you tell me: you saw the sign, how is it, they found the girl, the DNA...why would they do that...? Her father? Her father would do that to her?
ANTON: ...maybe he doesn't know...
SCOTT: Well. You're living in a fairyland of your Own Devising. You're seeing snakes. (pause)
ANTON: Who's going to Dubai...? (pause. Scott hesitates) They've got a white slave ring, in Dubai, with American girls there - are they going in? (pause) Are they sending you in...? (pause) Ask them... (pause)
SCOTT: You Got. To Leave it for your Betters.
ANTON: Ask them.
SCOTT: Why would you want to know? (pause) Listen up, Pal. THEY don't go through the door. WE don't ask why. That's not a COST, it's a Benefit. Because we Got to Travel Light. You wanna lose sleep over it, get over it, or get out. (hold. pause) You wanted to go Through the Looking Glass. How was it? Was it more fun than Miniature Golf...?
ANTON: I want a favor.
SCOTT: Why would I do you a favor?
OLD LADY: Morning, John, who's your friend...?
SCOTT: Fella wants to buy my car.
ANTON: I saved your life.
SCOTT: Well what were they paying you for...?
ANTON: Bobby, I saw the Sign...
SCOTT: My name ain't Bobby. (pause)
ANTON: I saw the sign. (he draws the Picasso sign in the dust on the window of the country store) I Saw it. At the beach house. (pause) I'm going back.
SCOTT: Back?
ANTON: To the beach house.
SCOTT: They took it apart with a tweezers. (Anton shakes his head)
ANTON: She was there. The Girl was There. I'm going back. (pause) I want you to do something.
SCOTT: What would that be?
ANTON: The Secret Service Agent. Offed himself.
SCOTT: ...he was off boffing his girl.
ANTON: He shot himself with a hide-out pistol.
SCOTT: Yeah?
ANTON: Who frisked the sonofabitch? (pause) You ask them.
STODDARD: Number one, the girl's dead. Number two, the hide-out gun the Agent shot with's registered in his 1020 for the past five years. The man who tossed him has been sacked. His name is none of your concern. Now: what the fuck are you doing here?
SCOTT: Sir, I am not here to question...
STODDARD: Well, then, what the fuck are you doing here...?
MILLER: Sir, as he said, he is here to apprise you of a security leak...
SCOTT: ...and...
MILLER: To call your attention to what may be a problem in discipline with this...
STODDARD: Granted. Granted. (he stands) Granted. Fine. Thank you.
SCOTT: And. Sir...If I may...
STODDARD: What is it?
SCOTT: When the operation is staged in Dubai...
STODDARD: What is this...?
MILLER: He...
STODDARD: ...what the fuck are you talking about?
SCOTT: I am merely saying, when -
STODDARD: Forget it. Walk away.
STODDARD: Yeah...you're a pit bull. I said forget it. How do we contact Anton?
MILLER: ...Anton...
STODDARD: Your partner...He's gone to ground...
MILLER: Yes, sir...
STODDARD: And, wait, wait, wait, wait, what does this mean...? (of Scott) When and if, any operation is staged which may require your talents, I give you my word... (Scott shakes his head, saying "I don't believe a word of it") You impertinent motherfucker. What the fuck is with you, you've got on your "thinkingcap" all of a sudden...?
SCOTT: I'd like to finish what I started.
STODDARD: And I'm telling you to Stand Down. Where's the kid? (pause)
SCOTT: Is there no operation in Dubai...?
PASTOR: ...in the Service. In the Service of his Country. No less than had he died in Combat. George Gaines, a man who gave his life to service, to protecting those who...
DRIVER: ...sucker did the Dutch.
SCOTT: I heard it was a training accident.
DRIVER: Nope, he Ate the Gun. Didn't you know?
SCOTT: I've been out of town.
DRIVER: Punched out early, off with the girlfriend, his Principal wanders off, winds up dead: hari-kari...
DRIVER: ...rather you didn't smoke in here.
BURCH: I put myself in your hands. Didn't I...?
SCOTT: I do not follow you, sir.
BURCH: I reached out to you. (pause) I put my life into your hands. I entered into a conspiracy with you. To commit Murder. Because it needed to be done. (pause) I trusted you with my life.
SCOTT: I would never betray you, sir.
BURCH: (waving his assurances away) I trusted you with my life. And yet you cannot trust me. (pause) There are things you have not been told. That's right. (pause) And now you're all out-of-line, "Play me or trade me..." (pause)
BURCH: (almost as if against his better nature) There is an Arab World. To penetrate it makes trying to join the Mafia look like a walk in the park. How would you do it, Scott? (pause) We're dying. We're at war. And we have no intelligence. How Would you do it? How would you infiltrate their clan structure? Where is the interface? (pause) It's at the whorehouse. That's where they go to get frisky, and that's where we listen to them.
BURCH (CONT'D): For the few, priceless hints that we get from that fucking sandpile. (pause) Had the girl been there, we would have moved heaven and earth - you know we would, and, we would have got her out. She was not there. She got drugged up and fell off a boat, and drowned. She's dead. (of the funeral) That man, (Burch gestures at the photograph-on-the- easel, of George Gaines, the Secret Service man, which stands by the head of the grave) That man a sworn office of the Secret Service, went to get laid, and she died. And you are risking the lives of men and women in the field, because you won't take orders. How are you better than him? Yes. You had best look sheepish. What the fuck have you got to say?
SCOTT: No excuse, sir.
BURCH: You're goddam right. (pause) Now: where's this new kid who got you all bothered. Where's your partner?
SCOTT: ...I'll call him off.
BURCH: The fuck you will. You've got nothing to say to him. He's gone to the ground. Where is he...?
SCOTT: (beat) Terrible thing. (the man nods) Did you know him?
MAN: Did you know him...? (Scott nods. Pause. Portentiously:) Where did you know him from?
SCOTT: (pause) ...you know.
MAN: (pause. Nods) He wasn't in the accounting office. You knew that...
SCOTT: Yes. I Did.
MAN: I didn't think, he told anyone what he did. Because...because... (he looks for sympathy)
SCOTT: A few of us knew. (pause)
MAN: And all he cared    about was doing his duty...that's    all...that's all... He used to    tell me... (the man is    now overcome)
SCOTT: I'm so sorry.
MAN: He was supposed to see me that night...After his "shift"...We...His wife...
SCOTT: Did she know? His wife. Did she know?
MAN: How could she? How could she...she didn't know him... (pause) Oh, the poor children...
MAN: ...he was going to come to me that night...after...
SCOTT: ...after his shift.
MAN: ...his shift - yes...
BURLY MAN: ...excuse me...
MAN: ...after, after he'd finished driving him...
SCOTT: ...him...?
BURLY MAN: (as he puts a hand on Scott) I said...
SCOTT: (as he turns to the man, who is backing his way out of the bar) ...driving him..? Did you say "him"? (he reaches out to the effeminate man)
BURLY MAN: Yeah. It's a man's world, pal - but you're in the wrong bar.
SECOND MAN: ...what the fuck did you do to my friend...?
SCOTT: ...where are you...? No. Tell me later. Look: LOOK: Forget the boat house. Look: (pause) Yes, tell me in...tel...look: tell me when...GET OUT OF THERE.
SCOTT: ...ohmigod...
SCOTT: What the hell are you doing?
BELLBOY: (showing the package) I...I brought you...
SCOTT: Why're you screwing with the door...?
SCOTT: Why're you screwing with the door...?
BELLBOY: I took the...I took the sign off... (pause) You had the sign on the door. F'they saw me...f'they saw me, knocking on a door, the sign on...they'd... (Scott relaxes somewhat. The Bellboy proffers the package) An, I...I figured, you needed... (he hands the package to Scott, who takes out a pint bottle of booze) You told me you wanted this at Ten...
SCOTT: ...yeah. Thanks.
BELLBOY: (begins to calm down a bit) ...I don't know why you...
SCOTT: You're right, I'm wrong...I'm wrong.
SCOTT: There you go, Pal. Hold on...
BELLBOY: (pause) Sure. I just...I just wanted to help.
SCOTT: It's been...quite a while since my last confession. That...that "transpired". On the rear face of a hill, in a mortar attack. (pause) And I confessed that I was frightened. (pause) And I have to confess, I'm frightened now. (pause. He smiles weakly) 'Nother "irregular Confession".
SCOTT: ...I'm about as frightened as I'm comfortable being. (pause) And that's why...I involved you. (pause) Which, I suppose, was shameful.
JACKIE BLACK: Now: you did me the honor to Call me. Now: you tell me how I might help. (pause) There in't nobody here, but two people in Green. (pause)
SCOTT: (pointing at the paper) ...this girl's alive...
JACKIE BLACK: Then, you'd better go get her.
WOMAN (V.O.): ...terrible thing, grief...
WOMAN: ...you want to comfort them, but you don't know how. (pause) I always think it's better to Leave Them Alone...
SCOTT: (of Mrs. Newton, and the woman, talking to her) A relative?
WOMAN: A psychic. (pause)
SCOTT: Well. (pause) Can we blame her...? (he gestures, meaning, we get comfort where we can find it)
WOMAN: That's right.
WOMAN: ...who are you...?
SCOTT: (moving off) United States Secret Service.
WOMAN: Guess again, 'cause I'm the Secret Service, and you follow my directions or I will shoot you dead. Spread your hands to your sides, please... (Scott spreads his hands to his sides) Open them...
DONNY: (sotto, unable to stop her invective) ...the motherfuckers pulled the Detail off of her...He was in town. Her father was in town, they pulled the Secret Service Detail off her, to take him tomcatting. He's been doing it for years. That's what they do. They turn the Secret Service into a bunch of pimps. He took her protection, she got snatched...
SCOTT: He'd let her die?
FEMALE AGENT: ...leaving the post...
DONNY: (meaning, "this is my surmise") The start of a campaign: Your daughter got kidnapped because you were out getting laid?
SCOTT: Her father would let her die...?
DONNY: Who knows if he knows. His 'people' would let her die in a heartbeat.
SCOTT: ...her mother...?
DONNY: (pause. She takes up the earring and she begins to weep. She looks beseechingly at Scott) I'm her mother...
SCOTT: I need some money. (Donny looks up at him questioningly) I'm going to get the girl back.
DONNY: What can I do?
SCOTT: I need money. I need a lot of money.
DONNY: (of Mrs. Newton) I've been signing her checks for years.
SCOTT: Alright... (he scribbles a figure on a napkin) Can you go this high, that's what I need...
DONNY: (as   she looks down at the   figure on the paper) ...I...I   don't...is there anywhere   else you...
AVI: Didn't they tell you not to come?
SCOTT: Well, I guess I wasn't paying attention. (pause)
AVI: Five years ago they told me you were dead.
SCOTT: You want to gossip, or you want to do business...?
AVI: Bobby; this is an American girl...?
SCOTT: If that were so?
AVI: If that were so, why don't your people go and fetch her...?
AVI: ...they send a hitter to negotiate...? (pause) My question is: have you forgot your catechism...?
SCOTT: And what's the answer?
AVI: The answer is Go Home.
SCOTT: Yeah, that's a good one.
AVI: ...you're at the Big Table here.
SCOTT: I know where I am.
AVI: Well, then, you better talk to me using the Decimal System.
SCOTT: Your intel. Two men. Infil, exfil, hardware, and com.
AVI: And com to what? I cannot give you.
SCOTT: Well, you could, when you where in the Boy Scouts.
AVI: Yes, but I am not in the Boy Scouts anymore. You heard the private sector?
SCOTT: Yeah.
AVI: Well. That's where you found me. And here's what it costs.
SCOTT: (looks at the paper) ...you're out of your mind.
AVI: No, you're out of your fucking mind, and you're out of your league, and my advice to you:...before some mercantile soul shops you. (pause. In disgust, he picks up the paper, crosses out what we wrote, and puts in a new number) ...for this job, that's what it costs...
SCOTT: ...that's what it costs...?
AVI: That's what it costs you. (pause) Go home, Bobby.
SCOTT: Remember me...?
SCOTT: ...well, I guess you do have friends in High Places...I mean here you are home, n'all... (he picks up now one, now another piece of exquisite statuary, and smashes it to the ground) And now we're gonna see if you also got all that money that you spoke of. (he takes out a videotape box) This here's a Short Subject, if you know what I mean. Of you in Carnal Congress with an Underage Girl. A PROSTITUE, A MINOR, AND
SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER...: (he holds up another videotape) There's another...you know how cheap it is to make a copy...?
BUSINESSMAN: ...what do you want?
SCOTT: I want what you promised me...
BUSINESSMAN: (as if reluctant to impart the information) ...I've, I've already made a deal with...
SCOTT: Yeah, but you haven't made a deal with me...So, today is Your Lucky Day, cause you get to Do, what Most Men only Dream of: You get to make Another Human Being Happy.
SCOTT: (softly) You had your fun, now pay for it, Jim. Get your bank on the phone. We're going to transfer some money.
SCOTT: (to himself) ..."how about that".
BUSINESSMAN: ...do you know how much trouble you're in...?
SCOTT: Yes. And that's the difference between you and me.
AVI: Maskala is a suburban villa, in Dubai. The Friends of your Friend, (he gestures at a photo of Assani) Operate there, if you will, a "halfway house". For the young women they have induced, coerced or drugged into spending their short lives. As the whores of Arabian tourists. Of late the girls have been, in the main, from the former Sov-Bloc. Now and again, a North American Girl, if she is exceedingly lovely,...blonde, usually blonde... (he passes the photos of very beautiful young girls across the table, to Scott) Will, unfortunately, find her way to Dubai. They travel drugged, they are - (he searches for the word) - "tidied up", and sold. For some reason, most of them are sold to Yemen. (pause) The girls are generally held, in Dubai, until the end of the month. (he checks his watch and looks significantly at it) When the Merrymakers fly in to examine them. And take their purchases home.
SCOTT: ...and then?
AVI: (shrugs) That is "and then". (pause) This is a floor plan of the building where the girls are held, this is the security arrangements, this is the watch plan.
AVI (CONT'D): (he checks his watch and raises his eyebrows) The girls are taken from the house in Maskala, to the Royale Hotel, I presume you will hit them in transit...?
SCOTT: (reads) ..."Jameson Construction"...They know we're there...?
AVI: I hope not. (he shows documents to Scott) The conex container for the exfil, also Jameson Construction. (he gestures at the materials on the table) A passport for the Young Girl... (he shrugs) Between fifteen and twenty-five, they all look alike.
SCOTT: (as he looks at the passport) Is that your experience...?
AVI: Yes. It is. Nonetheless, we tried to match it to a Current Photo...
AVI: ...she was there twelve hours ago.
SCOTT: Who took the photo?
AVI: (shrugs) How would I know...? (pause)
SCOTT: What does the bonus cost?
AVI: (shrugs) A gesture of Friendship. But. We thought: if you see some of the Yemenins - (he shows Scott candid photos of several middle-aged, bearded middle-eastern looking men) Any of these, in particular...would you say Hello to them?
SCOTT: Who else have you done a favor for, Avi?
AVI: Bobby: the world runs on manners.
SCOTT: The last third on exfil, in Geneva. Me and the Girl. As agreed.
AVI: That's not what I was going to say.
SCOTT: What were you going to say...? (pause) ...the Last Third in Geneva... (he exits)
SCOTT: ...fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.
SCOTT: It's good. (to Jones) It's very good. (Jones nods his thanks) The charge takes the car out... (to Smith) We got the flashbangs fore and aft, You hit the driver, follow down the driver's side, the car ain't going nowhere, the muscle gets out, I cap em, I go with the girl. (he points to Jones. He points to the car. Jones nods. To Smith) You exfil on your own, we're on to the airport.
SCOTT: At the airport. When we hit the Conex. When you Seal Us In...you walk away.
JONES: I understand.
SCOTT: I cannot have heat on it. Now: I know: that you want to protect the package. But: you have to walk away. And que sera, sera.
JONES: I won't look back.
SCOTT: (as he picks the seed up, answering Smith's unspoken question) ...it's an appleseed.
SMITH: (as he cleans his firearms, generally, as if speaking of the universe) "Johnny Appleseed", eh?
SCOTT: ...yeah, I'm just a Man of Peace...
BODYGUARD: ...stay in your room, and...
LAURA: ...who...?
SCOTT: Stay by me.
LAURA: ...they said they were going to take care of me...
SCOTT: I'm going to take care of you. You hold on, now. (as Scott drives he reloads his weapons)
LAURA: (lazily) Who are you?
SCOTT: ...you remember, Baby, we went to high school together... (pause) You dropped your earring.
SCOTT: You're Picasso, right...? That's who you are...
LAURA: ...they're going to send me to a Party.
SCOTT: No, Baby, you're going Home. (pause) You're just taking the long way home.
SCOTT: ...I told you to stay on the bed.
SCOTT: ...you're going travelling.
LAURA: ...what...?
SCOTT: ...we're going to take a little trip.
SCOTT: ...put that away.
LAURA: ...I need a smoke.
SCOTT: Y'can't smoke it. American tobacco. Smell. Carry. In the desert air.
SCOTT: Put that on. Over your head.
LAURA: Whatsamatter, you don't like Blondes...?
SCOTT: Whole world likes Blondes. That's why you're here. Put the bandana on.
LAURA: (as she tries to light the cigarette) I need a smoke. (He takes it away from her, and crumbles it.) ...gimme the fucken smoke.
LAURA: I could make you give me the smoke.
SCOTT: Keep it together. (he takes a small hypodermic kit) Keep it together, or I'm gonna give you a shot and carry you out.
LAURA: Nobody Cares about me...
SCOTT: ...that's right...
LAURA: ...I'm just a whore...They wouldn't even come get me...
SCOTT: They sent me...
LAURA: Did my father send you?
SCOTT: (as he lights her cigarette) ...that's right.
LAURA: (derisively) One man.
SCOTT: One riot, one Ranger, you ever hear that?
LAURA: Leonides, the King of Sparta, when a neighboring state would beg for Military Aid. Would send One Man.
SCOTT: ...well, there you go.
LAURA: ...you ever hear that?
SCOTT: No. I think we went to different schools.
SCOTT: ...put the bandana on.
LAURA: (softly) Did you hear the one about the king who turned his daughter into Gold?
SCOTT: Yeah - I heard that one.
LAURA: ...I don't want to go home.
SCOTT: I didn't ask you.
LAURA: I don't know where we are...
SCOTT: You just keep it together.
SCOTT: (of the coveralls) You put this on.
LAURA: (groggily) ...what...?
SCOTT: You...
SCOTT: A little walk-in-the-park. (he points her to the News jet) See there...?
SECOND MAN: (giving his report) ...all of the passenger terminals, and all access-points to the Cargo and General Aviation...
LAURA: (groggily, as in a dream) No, you know what my mistake was...?
SCOTT: (as he looks around) ...what was that...?
SCOTT: ...what was your mistake...?
LAURA: (from a distance, as she begins to laugh, as at a great private joke; she stops walking) ...you think we bring our troubles on ourselves...?
SCOTT: I'm certain of it.
SCOTT: No, no...come on baby...come on, come on girl: just walk to the plane: Just Get On the Plane...WALK TO THE PLANE...
SCOTT: Shussh, baby... shussh... shussh... it's going to be alright...
SCOTT: This's going to make Everything Allright...
LAURA: No!
STODDARD: Leave her Alone. (to his men) Don't shoot him, don't shoot, you'll blow the thing sky high...
SCOTT: Laura...
STODDARD: Thank God we Found you. You know me. I work for Mister Burch. I've met you...
LAURA: (drugged and groggy) He said that he came to get me... (she shakes her head in disbelief. Then she starts to walk a step toward Scott, then turns, and proceeds toward Stoddard.)
STODDARD: That's right, Laura...Walk away from him. Walk to the Plane...He can't hurt you now. Walk to the plane...
SCOTT: (screams) No...
STODDARD: Cuff 'im...
STODDARD: (to Scott) Yes...well...
SCOTT: Let the girl go home. (pause)
STODDARD: (to his henchmen) ...wait till she lifts off, take him outside and shoot him.
SCOTT: (as he speaks he moves, slightly, continuously, to get a better view of the girl) ...why can't the Girl Go Home?
STODDARD (CU): Because she's dead. (pause) You had to know the Secret Knowledge. Didn't you?
SCOTT: What is the Secret Knowledge?
STODDARD: The Secret Knowledge is: There Is No Secret Knowledge. (turns over his shoulder, to look at Laura, walking toward the plane) You went Beyond What Was Permitted. And the Gods Are Angry.
LAURA: ...I'm so tired.
WOMAN: ...I'm going to ask you to do Just the One More Thing...
WOMAN: I'm going to ask you, now, to walk away from this plane, and come with me.
LAURA: No...leave me alone. No - I don't know you...
STODDARD: (to his men, as he, Stoddard, casts a glance outside, and then back) Alright, take him outside... (the henchman hoists Scott to his feet)
FEMALE REPORTER: Oh, my God...
STODDARD: (yells) Wait...!
JACKIE BLACK: (to Laura) Keep walking...
HENCHMAN: (to Stoddard) ...do you want me to...?
FEMALE REPORTER: Gimme an uplink Gimme an uplink... GET IT ON THE SAT. Now Now Now...
FEMALE REPORTER: (to the unseen cameraman) On her. On her, get it on the girl...Get us Out of Here...
SCOTT: The girl ain't dead, baby, you're dead. You see: that's the difference.
STODDARD: WAIT: WAIT. The girl's home. You brought her home. Now, listen to me, because I am going to tell you...now, you wanted to be "inside"...I am going to take you as far inside as you can go: Z'at what you want...? Is that what you want?
SCOTT: No, I just wanted to bring the girl back.
JACKIE BLACK: ...is she safe?
SCOTT: That's right, she's safe.
JACKIE BLACK: (weakly, almost whispering) ...well, then...
SCOTT: ...that's right, Baby...
