STEPHEN STILLS: Really? Is she hot? KIM PINE, 22, cute, bitter, sweatshirt with a zipper.
KIM PINE: How old are you now, Scott? Like I'm not playing your little games.
SCOTT: I'm not playing your little games.
KIM PINE: So you've been out of high school for like, 13 years and-
STEPHEN STILLS: And you're dating a high school girl? Not bad, not bad. YOUNG NEIL, 20, simple mind, layered T-shirts.
YOUNG NEIL: Like, did you guys 'do it' yet? SCOTT PILGRIM, 22, fresh faced and charmingly cocky with an unruly yet adorable mop of hair.
SCOTT: We have done many things. We ride the bus. We have meaningful conversations about how yearbook club went and about her friends and, um.you know.drama.
STEPHEN STILLS: Yeah, okay, have you even kissed her?
SCOTT: We almost held hands once, but then she got embarrassed.
KIM PINE: Well. Aren't you pleased as punch?
STEPHEN STILLS: So, what's her name?
SCOTT: ( pleased as punch ) Knives Chau. She's Chinese.
STEPHEN STILLS: ( under his breath ) Young Neil pauses his Nintendo DS.
YOUNG NEIL: Wicked! How'd you meet her?
SCOTT: I believe I mentioned the bus? Scott Pilgrim prepares to tell an amazing story:
MOTHER CHAU: You are seventeen year old! Time to get interested in boy!
KNIVES CHAU: Knives DROPS her bag, books scattering everywhere.
MOTHER CHAU: You drop book. Knives crouches down to pick up her books, grumbling.
KIM PINE: Is that seriously the end of the story?
SCOTT: Yes. It is. Young Neil unpauses his Nintendo DS.
STEPHEN STILLS: So when do we get to meet her?
KIM PINE: Oh please. Let it be soon. DINGY DONG! The doorbell rings. Scott smiles broadly.
SCOTT: That's for me.
SCOTT: You promise to be good?
KNIVES CHAU: Of course I'll be good!
SCOTT: No, really. Please be good.
KNIVES CHAU: Am I normally not? Stephen Stills comes to the door and peers through.
SCOTT: Oh, hey. Knives, this is Stephen Stills. He's the talent.
STEPHEN STILLS: STILLS shuts the door on a confused Knives.
STEPHEN STILLS: Is she gonna geek out on us?
SCOTT: She'll just sit in the corner, man.
STEPHEN STILLS: I mean, I want her to geek out on us.
SCOTT: She'll geek. She geeks. She has the capacity to geek.
STEPHEN STILLS: You're good.
KNIVES CHAU: Knives, that's Kim. Lemme get your coat. Scott throws Knives' coat on the floor. Knives waves.
SCOTT: Knives, that's Kim. Lemme get your coat. Scott throws Knives' coat on the floor. Knives waves.
KNIVES CHAU: Hi, sorry, what was your name?
KNIVES CHAU: You play the drums? REVEAL Kim sitting behind the drumset, sticks in her hands.
KIM PINE: KNIVES CHAU
KNIVES CHAU: That is so awesome.
SCOTT: Knives, that's Young Neil.
KNIVES CHAU: Hi. What do you play?
YOUNG NEIL: Uh, wow.Zelda.Tetris.that's kind of a big question. Knives stares blankly at Young Neil, who finally gets it.
YOUNG NEIL: Oh. I'm not in the band. I just live here. Sex Bob-Omb has geared up. Amps hum to life.
SCOTT: Let's start with Launchpad McQuack.
STEPHEN STILLS: That's not the actual title of the-
KIM PINE: WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB! 1-2-3-4! Kim BASHES the kit and Sex Bob-Omb EXPLODE INTO ROCK! GUITAR
KNIVES CHAU: You guys.are so.amazing.
KNIVES CHAU: I can't even.Sex Bob-Omb. 8 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' ROOM - EVENING 8 The band and Young Neil lounge around Stephen Stills' room.
STEPHEN STILLS: She seems nice.
SCOTT: YOUNG NEIL
YOUNG NEIL: She seems awesome.
SCOTT: KIM PINE
KIM PINE: Scott, if your life had a face I would punch it.
SCOTT: Yeaaah.wait, what?
KIM PINE: I mean, are you really happy or are you really evil?
SCOTT: Like, do I have ulterior motives or something? I'm offended, Kim.
STEPHEN STILLS: Wounded even?
SCOTT: Hurt, Kim.
KIM PINE: You? Hurt? Scott takes a breath, turns to Young Neil.
SCOTT: Neil, you were saying she seems awesome.
YOUNG NEIL: Yeah, she seems awesome.
SCOTT: 9 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 9 Scott hangs his coat up in a tiny, one room apartment. He turns to WALLACE WELLS, dark hair, arched eyebrow, disloyal.
SCOTT: Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17 year old. Wallace looks up from the NOW magazine he's reading.
WALLACE: Is he cute?
SCOTT: Ha, ha, ha, ha.
WALLACE: Does this mean we have to stop sleeping together?
SCOTT: Do you see another bed in here? TINY BOXES OF TEXT indicate the ownership of the items in the one room flat: 95% belongs to Wallace, FUTON included.
WALLACE: Yeah. You're totally my bitch forever.
SCOTT: So. The whole seventeen year old thing. Don't tell too many people.
WALLACE: Hey, you know me.
SCOTT: I mean. Don't tell my sister.
WALLACE: You know me. Wallace tosses the NOW magazine aside, starts texting.
SCOTT: Who are you texting? RINGY RING. The phone goes. Scott picks up.
SCOTT: That's not true. Who told you?
STACEY: Wallace. Duh.
SCOTT: That gossipy bitch.
SCOTT: Wallace clicks off. Scott sinks into an armchair.
STACEY: Who is this mysterious child you date?
SCOTT: Her name is Knives. Knives Chau.
STACEY: A seventeen year old Chinese schoolgirl? You're ridiculous.
SCOTT: It's a Catholic school too.
STACEY: With the uniform and everything?
SCOTT: Yeah, the whole deal.
STACEY: Oh my God, you haven't-
SCOTT: No no no. We haven't even held hands. I think she hugged me once.
STACEY: Um, Scott. Why are you doing this?
SCOTT: I don't know.it's just nice, you know? It's just.simple.
STACEY: It's been over a year since you got dumped by she-who-will-not-be-named. Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine, looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad.
SCOTT: Can I get back to you on that? A SCHOOL BELL clangs loudly.
WALLACE: I do not want to be here. At all.
SCOTT: This school has boys too.
WALLACE: I hate you. Even I would think twice about dating a seventeen year old.
SCOTT: Well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so I wouldn't call it dating, more like.
WALLACE: That doesn't sound so good either.
SCOTT: That doesn't sound so good either.
SCOTT: Hey Knives, this is my cool gay roommate, Wallace Wells. He's gay.
KNIVES CHAU: Oh, hi! Do you want to know who in my class is gay?
WALLACE: Yes. Does he wear glasses?
SCOTT: Wallace, you go now! Begone! Wallace pulls Knives close. Whispers.
WALLACE: You're too good for him. Run.
SCOTT: Did you know the original name of Pac- man was Puck-man? You would think it's because Pac-Man looks like a yellow hockey puck, but actually it comes from the Japanese phrase paku-paku which means to flap ones mouth open and closed. They changed it over here because Puck-Man is too easy to vandalize. You know, scratch out the P and turn it into an F or whatever? Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move.
KNIVES CHAU: Ohmigod, like.wow.
SCOTT: Yeah. Wow. The game ends. CONTINUE appears, counting down: 10.9.8. Scott looks at Knives. She digs for quarters.
KNIVES CHAU: Oh, I got it!
KNIVES CHAU: Tamara is into this Korean guy, Bobby, but everyone thinks Bobby has a crush on Mina.
SCOTT: I thought Derek and Tamara had a mutual like-each-other thing going, what happened?
KNIVES CHAU: I don't listen to much music. I know a lot of kids who play piano or whatever, but you guys ROCK.
SCOTT: I knew I personally rocked, but I never suspected that we rocked as a unit. Thank you, Knives.
KNIVES CHAU: I mean, you guys are gonna be HUGE.
SCOTT: Well, we're already pretty big. But it might be cool if cool people wore our T-shirt. Knives speaks to a female clerk, surly with tats and specs:
KNIVES CHAU: Excuse me, do you have anything by 'The Clash At Demonhead'?
JULIE: Have you tried the section marked 'The Clash At Demonhead'?
SCOTT: Thank you, Julie.
JULIE: Are you coming to my party Friday or will you be busy babysitting?
SCOTT: Thank you, Julie.
KNIVES CHAU: Oh, I heart them so much.
SCOTT: I hearted them too until they signed to a major label and the singer turned into a total bitch and ruined my life. But that's just me.
KNIVES CHAU: ( OBLIVIOUS )
SCOTT: Sorry, you were saying about me?
KNIVES CHAU: I mean, I've.I've never gone out with someone so talented.
SCOTT: You go out with a lot of guys?
KNIVES CHAU: Yeah, so whatever, man!
SCOTT: Yeah, so whatever, man!
KNIVES CHAU: I've never even kissed a guy. Knives blushes and looks at the ground. Scott hugs her.
SCOTT: Me neither.
KNIVES CHAU: So this is your secret lair? Can I come in?
SCOTT: My secret lair is one of those 'no girls allowed' deals.
KNIVES CHAU: Oh, okay.
SCOTT: But do you want to see the house where I grew up?
KNIVES CHAU: They literally walk across the street to a small house.
SCOTT: Here you go.
KNIVES CHAU: Yeah. Wow. Wind blows. The light snowfall turns into sand.
SCOTT: Yeah. Wow. Wind blows. The light snowfall turns into sand.
SCOTT: Oh God.so.so alone. A MYSTERIOUS GIRL rollerblades across the shifting sands. She wears fishnets, an army jacket, skirt and goggles. Her pink hair is funky but cool. She is hotter than the desert sun.
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: You're not alone. You're just having some idiotic dream.
SCOTT: Does that mean we can make out? But she's gone.
SCOTT: Oh God. Wallace wakes up to the left of Scott, rubbing his eyes.
WALLACE: What is it, Scott?
SCOTT: I had this totally weird dream.
OTHER VOICE: Oh God.
WALLACE: What is it, Scott? A scruffy, goateed guy wakes right between Scott and Wallace:
OTHER SCOTT: Can we skip the dreamtime? Color me not interested.
SCOTT: But there was this girl.
WALLACE: OTHER SCOTT
OTHER SCOTT: Was this an Envy related dream?
WALLACE: We don't use the E-word in this house.
SCOTT: No, it wasn't her. It was somebody new.
OTHER SCOTT: Yay for that. Other Scott goes back to sleep. Wallace rubs his eyes.
WALLACE: Speaking of new, weren't you supposed to take your fake high school girlfriend to the library a half-hour ago?
SCOTT: What? It's like, six in the morning. Scott opens the bathroom door. Sunlight ignites the room.
KNIVES CHAU: What's wrong?
SCOTT: Libraries remind me of grade school.
KNIVES CHAU: That must seem like a reeeeally long time ago.
SCOTT: Uh. Let's talk about something else. The hiss of ball bearings catches Scott's attention. He freezes as he sees THE ROLLERBLADING GIRL FROM HIS DREAM skating towards the desk in SEXALICIOUS SLOW MOTION.
KNIVES CHAU: Do you know that girl? The Rollerblading Girl delivers a package from AMAZON.CA to the librarian. Scott's gaze follows the GIRL as she blades out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts.
KNIVES CHAU: Scott continues to stare at the girl. Time slows to a crawl.
SCOTT!: 19 INT. STEPHEN STILLS' HOUSE - EVENING 19 Scott stands in the rehearsal room, head still in the clouds.
STEPHEN STILLS: You only played one note for that entire song.
SCOTT: It was.uh.my hand slipped.
KIM PINE: Is your girlfriend distracting you?
SCOTT: My girlfriend? A meek Knives sits next to Young Neil on the couch.
KNIVES CHAU: I'll. I'll be quieter.
STEPHEN STILLS: Let's do that one again.
SCOTT: Sorry, what are we doing?
STEPHEN STILLS: I told you like fifty times! Scott, Kim Pine, Stephen Stills and Young Neil walk down an icy Toronto street. Scott's head is still in the clouds.
KIM PINE: We're going to this party, retard.
SCOTT: YOUNG NEIL
YOUNG NEIL: At Julie's.
SCOTT: Ugh. I thought you guys split.
STEPHEN STILLS: We did. But, you know, there may be some label guys there, so.
SCOTT: Aw, man. This is going to suck.
KIM PINE: At least it will give us something to complain about.
SCOTT: Awww maaan.
SCOTT: .this sucks.
YOUNG NEIL: I'm going to go pee due to boredom. Scott exits frame.
SCOTT: I'm going to go pee due to boredom. Scott exits frame.
YOUNG NEIL: I have to pee.
SCOTT: Hey Comeau.
COMEAU: Hey Scott. Some party huh? You gettin' your drink on?
SCOTT: This is Coke Zero. I don't drink.
COMEAU: You don't drink? I remember you getting ridiculously drunk off two G&T's one time and-
SCOTT: ( QUICKLY )
COMEAU: Pretty much.
SCOTT: Do you know this one girl with hair like this? Scott sketches an incomprehensible drawing of Ramona.
COMEAU: Yeah man. Ramona Flowers. Someone said she was coming tonight actually.
SCOTT: You got the hots for her? I hear she's hardcore. Scott has already left a Scott-shaped dust cloud.
WHAT?: You got the hots for her? I hear she's hardcore. Scott has already left a Scott-shaped dust cloud.
COMEAU: You got the hots for her? I hear she's hardcore. Scott has already left a Scott-shaped dust cloud.
SCOTT: Hey, what's up?
RAMONA: Hey, you know Pacman?
SCOTT: Hey, you know Pacman?
RAMONA: I know of him. Scott begins to babble.
SCOTT: Well you know Pac-Man was originally Puckman but not because Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck and paku-paku-paku means flapping your mouth and they changed it because if you scratch out the "P" and turn it into an "F'? You know? Yeah that's amazing.
RAMONA: Yeah that's amazing.
SCOTT: Um.am I dreaming? Ramona looks at Scott blankly. He slowly skulks away.
SCOTT: YOUNG NEIL YOUNG NEIL STEPHEN STILLS YOUNG NEIL
DUDE!: YOUNG NEIL YOUNG NEIL STEPHEN STILLS YOUNG NEIL
YOUNG NEIL: SHE'S TOTALLY REAL! RAMONA FLOWERS! JUMP CUT. Scott RUNS towards Comeau.

SANDRA: Some guy back in New York.
MONIQUE: Doesn't she have the most ridiculous name?
SANDRA: I know. It's so 'Ramona Quimby, Aged 8' and yet.Flowers. The girls laugh. Scott does not.
SCOTT: Yeah. What else? JUMP CUT through a FLURRY OF FACES as Scott asks everyone
PARTYGOER #1: I heard she kicks all kind of ass.
PARTYGOER #2: She's on another level.
PARTYGOER #3: She's got men dying at her feet.
PARTYGOER #4: She's got some battle scars.
PARTYGOER #5: Not to be entered into lightly We end on the surly JULIE ( the rude clerk ) who steps in front of Scott, arms crossed. Stephen Stills is with her.
JULIE: What about Ramona Flowers?
SCOTT: You know her? Tell me. Now.
JULIE: She just moved here. Got a job with Amazon. Comes into my work.
SCOTT: Does she really?
STEPHEN STILLS: Didn't you say she just broke up with someone, Jools?
SCOTT: Did she reeally?
STEPHEN STILLS: That they had a huge fight or whatever?
SCOTT: Did they reeeally?
JULIE: .yes. But I didn't want Scott to know that, Stephen.
SCOTT: Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl, she just-
JULIE: Scott, I forbid you from hitting on Ramona. Even if you haven't had a real girlfriend in over a year-
STEPHEN STILLS: Hey whoa, whoa. Scott's mourning period is officially over. He's totally dating a high schooler.
JULIE: Dating a high schooler is the mourning period.
STEPHEN STILLS: She's got a point.
SCOTT: I thought you guys broke up.
JULIE: I don't want you scaring off the coolest girl at my party Scott. We all know you're a total lady killer wannabe jerky jerk.
SCOTT: That's garbage! Completely untrue.
JULIE: That time with Lisa-
SCOTT: That time with Hollie-
JULIE: That time with Hollie-
SCOTT: Not what it looked like!
JULIE: That time you dumped Kim for-
SCOTT: Hey, me and Kim are all good now. SCOTT looks to KIM. We hear the sound of arctic winds.
JULIE: Whatever, Ramona is out of your league, let's leave it at that.
SCOTT: ( NOT LISTENING )
JULIE: Forget it Scott!!!
WALLACE: Guess who's druuunk?
SCOTT: I guess Wallace.
WALLACE: You guess right. Wallace flops onto the futon, landing next to Scott.
SCOTT: So, that girl. From my dream.
WALLACE: Girl. Okay.
SCOTT: I saw her at the library.
WALLACE: Library.can I pretend we're talking about a guy?
SCOTT: So then I'm at this party, and hey! There she is.
WALLACE: There he is.
SCOTT: I think she's.
WALLACE: You think he's.
SCOTT: I think she's the girl of my dreams.
WALLACE: Mmm. Then you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend.
SCOTT: I've never been so sure about Then you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend.
WALLACE: Then you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend.
SCOTT: What's that?
WALLACE: I'm not getting it, friend. Wallace drifts off. RINGY RING! Scott answers. INTERCUT with STACEY sitting on a bus on her cellphone.
SCOTT: I'm not getting it, friend. Wallace drifts off. RINGY RING! Scott answers. INTERCUT with STACEY sitting on a bus on her cellphone.
STACEY: You're thinking of juggling two chicks!?
SCOTT: Not even!
STACEY: Well, you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend.
SCOTT: Wait. Who told you?
STACEY: Duh. Wallace.
SCOTT: He's not even conscious!
STACEY: Whatever. You of all people should know how sucky it is to get cheated on.
SCOTT: Don't you have a job to do?
STACEY: You're right. I should send out a mass text about this. Bye. Scott looks to Wallace, who is out cold, cellphone in hand.
SCOTT: Wallace, how do you do that? HARD CUT to MORNING LIGHT filling the room!
WALLACE!: Wallace sits bolt upright. Scott sits at Wallace's computer.
WALLACE: Awesome! I have to order something reeeally cool.
SCOTT: Awesome! I have to order something reeeally cool.
COMPUTER: "You've got mail!"
SCOTT: Dude! This thing claims I have mail!
WALLACE: It's amazing what they can do with computers these days.
SCOTT: Dude! Now I'm reading it!
WALLACE: I'm so happy for you.
SCOTT: "Dear Mr. Pilgrim, It has come to my attention that we will be fighting soon. My name is Matthew Patel, and I'm" blah blah 'fair warning' blah blah.hmm. This is.this is.THIS IS.!!!

SCOTT: This is boring. Delete! 'CLICK.' Scott walks to the front door. Moments pass.
WALLACE: Scott. Are you waiting for the package you just ordered?
SCOTT: It's the weekend. It won't ship until Monday at the earliest.

SCOTT: You were saying? Scott opens the door. It's KNIVES CHAU!
SCOTT: KNIVES CHAU
KNIVES CHAU: Attack hug! Knives smothers Scott.
SCOTT: Attack hug. That's cute. He plasters on his best fake smile.
KNIVES CHAU: Remember you were supposed to meet me at the bus stop a half-hour ago?
SCOTT: How could I possibly forget?
KNIVES CHAU: Yearbook club is getting SO boring. I cannot believe the music they put on while we work.
SCOTT: That's sucky.
KNIVES CHAU: Hannah broke up with Alan and now she's all into Derek.
SCOTT: Uh huh.
KNIVES CHAU: .but Tamara claims she has dibs on Derek.
SCOTT: I tell ya'.
KNIVES CHAU: Knives goes to flip over Scott, but he messes up. THE MIRROR IMAGE of Scott's videogame avatar appears on screen.
KNIVES CHAU: Uh oh, NegaNinja. NEGANINJA - squares up against Scott's avatar.
SCOTT: I can never get past that guy. Scott has his little videogame head cut off. The 'CONTINUE?' countdown comes up.10.9.8.
KNIVES CHAU: Do you want to keep going? Scott takes a long look at Knives.
SCOTT: Um, I think.I think. Scott takes a deep breath. This is never easy. 3.2.1.
STEPHEN STILLS: Game on, everybody. Game. On. An excited Stills addresses Sex Bob-Omb. Scott tunes his bass, alone by the window, staring out.
STEPHEN STILLS: I got us a show.
STEPHEN STILLS: Wednesday, The Rockit. And even better? It's the T.I.B.B.
KNIVES CHAU: The Toronto International Battle of The Bands?!
STEPHEN STILLS: S'right. This guy at work was like "Steve, do you know anyone in a band?" and I was like 'I'm in a band' and he was like 'You're in a band?' and I was like 'Yeah I'm totally in a band'-
KIM PINE: Great story, man.
KNIVES CHAU: Is there a prize or something?!
STEPHEN STILLS: Only a record deal with G-man Graves!
SCOTT: What? Who?
KNIVES CHAU: You don't know?
STEPHEN STILLS: Indie Producer of the millennium?!
SCOTT: YOUNG NEIL
YOUNG NEIL: Stills gestures to Knives' home-made Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt.
STEPHEN STILLS: If we win.it won't just be Knives wearing a Sex Bob-Omb shirt. It'll be the cool kids too. Knives can barely contain herself. She grabs Scott.
KNIVES CHAU: I will do everything I can to get out of study group and come.
SCOTT: Sure. Great. We follow Scott as he walks in a daze to the bathroom.
KIM PINE: Yeah that's the one.
YOUNG NEIL: I hate them!
SCOTT: Hi, um, I was thinking about asking you out, but then I realized how stupid that would be.
RAMONA: Um, no, that's okay. You just have to sign for this alright?
SCOTT: I just woke up, and you were in my dream. I dreamt you were delivering me this package. Is that weird?
RAMONA: It's not weird at all.
SCOTT: It's not?
RAMONA: No, it's just like, you've got this really convenient subspace highway running through your head that I like to use. It's like three miles in fifteen seconds.
SCOTT: ( CONTINUED ) 31 CONTINUED: 31
RAMONA: Oh yeah. I forgot you guys don't have that in Canada.
SCOTT: You don't remember me do you? I met you at the party the other day.
RAMONA: Were you the Pac-Man guy?
SCOTT: No. Not even. That was some total ass. I was the other guy. You're Ramona Flowers right?
RAMONA: That's me.
SCOTT: So, you're like American?
RAMONA: Why, am I coming off as rude?
SCOTT: Not at all. Noooooo. Scott stands in awe of Ramona. She gives him a pen.
RAMONA: You know.you need to sign for this. Whatever this is?
SCOTT: It's something really cool. You'd be impressed.
RAMONA: You still have to sign.
SCOTT: But if I sign for it, you'll leave.
RAMONA: Yeah. That's how it works.
SCOTT: Okay well, can we just maybe just hang out sometime? Get to know each other? You're the new kid on the block, right? I've lived here forever. I mean.there are reasons for you to hang out with me?
RAMONA: You're all over the place.
SCOTT: You are like.my dream girl.
RAMONA: I need to find a new route.
SCOTT: Either that or you need to start hanging out with me.
RAMONA: You want me to hang out with you?
SCOTT: Um.you know.if that's cool.
RAMONA: If I say yes, will you sign for your damn package? Scott finally signs on the dotted line. And throws the package straight in the trash.
SCOTT: Done. So, yeah. Eight o'clock?
SCOTT: Why are you just standing there?
RAMONA: Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.
SCOTT: Sorry, I just assumed you were too cool to be on time.
RAMONA: Well. You assumed wrong.
SCOTT: So what do you want to do? We could get a slice at Pizza Pizza or flip through some records at Sonic Boom. Oh, or there's this awesome game called Ninja Ninja Revolution at-
RAMONA: I'm not into simulated violence.
SCOTT: I'm cool with whatever you want to do.
RAMONA: This is good. Scott and Ramona trudge through the snow in the empty park.
SCOTT: This is good. So how'd you end up in Just needed to escape I guess.
RAMONA: Just needed to escape I guess.
SCOTT: Oh yeah?
RAMONA: I got this job here. And Gideon had always said Toronto was one of the great cities so.
SCOTT: Is Gideon.is he your boyfriend?
RAMONA: He's.a friend.
SCOTT: Was he your boyfriend?
RAMONA: Do you mind if we don't get into that right now?
SCOTT: It's so not interesting to me. They sit on some swings in the park.
RAMONA: So what about you? What do you do?
SCOTT: I'm between jobs.
RAMONA: Between what and what?
SCOTT: My last job is a long story filled with sighs.
RAMONA: I know plenty of those.
SCOTT: Is that why you left New York?
RAMONA: Pretty much. It was time to head somewhere a little more chilled.
SCOTT: Well, it's certainly chilled here.
RAMONA: Uh. Chilled as in cold.
RAMONA: I'm totally obsessed with you.
SCOTT: I'm totally obsessed with you.
RAMONA: I didn't mean to get you obsessed.
SCOTT: I just haven't been obsessed with a girl for a long time. It's weird.
RAMONA: That's probably because you sleep with a guy.
SCOTT: I was guessing from your apartment, but you totally do!
RAMONA: I was guessing from your apartment, but you totally do!
SCOTT: It's. we're just poor! We can't afford two beds! We're not gay! Actually. no. Wallace is pretty Dude, relax. I believe you. You're too desperate to be gay.
RAMONA: Dude, relax. I believe you. You're too desperate to be gay.
SCOTT: I feel so stupid.
RAMONA: Aw. you're probably not that Laughing, Ramona hops off her swing.
RAMONA: Well, you're definitely stupid if you want to go out with me.
SCOTT: Exactly, yeah. The snowfall gets heavier.
RAMONA: This is ridiculous. Isn't it like April?
SCOTT: Yeah. I can barely see you. This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster.
RAMONA: I think 'act of God' is a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date.
SCOTT: So this is a 'date', eh?
RAMONA: Did I say 'date'? Slip of the tongue.
SCOTT: The snow gets heavier still. Ramona walks away.
RAMONA: Anyway, night's not over yet. I think there's a thingy up here somewhere.
SCOTT: A thingy?
RAMONA: A door.
SCOTT: A door? I. I. I can't see you. I'm blind. Help me.
RAMONA: What kind of tea do you want?
SCOTT: There's more than one kind?
RAMONA: We have blueberry, raspberry, ginseng, sleepytime, green tea, green tea with lemon, green tea with lemon and honey, liver disaster, ginger with honey, ginger without honey, vanilla almond, white truffle, blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut, constant comment and earl grey.
SCOTT: Did you make some of those up?
RAMONA: I think I'll have sleepytime.
SCOTT: That sounds good to me.
RAMONA: Let me get you a blanket.
SCOTT: That would actually be awesome. Ramona exits. After a moment alone, Scott ventures upstairs. He wanders towards a half open door. Pushing it open, he finds Ramona in her bedroom in her bra and skirt.
RAMONA: Dude! I'm changing. Scott covers his eyes and our screen goes BLACK.
RAMONA: I guess.
SCOTT: Maybe.maybe we should both get under it.since we're so cold.
RAMONA: Well.what about our tea?
SCOTT: I can.not have tea. The slinky bassline continues as Ramona takes her skirt off, revealing black panties to complement black bra. Scott takes his shirt off. They tumble onto the bed and make out. Then-
RAMONA: I changed my mind.
SCOTT: Changed it to what? From what?
RAMONA: I don't want to have sex with you, Pilgrim. Not right now.
SCOTT: It's not like I'm gonna send you home in a snowstorm or anything. You can sleep in my bed. And I reserve the right to change my mind about the sex later. Ramona curls up next to Scott.
RAMONA: It's not like I'm gonna send you home in a snowstorm or anything. You can sleep in my bed. And I reserve the right to change my mind about the sex later. Ramona curls up next to Scott.
SCOTT: This is cool, just this. It's been like a really long time, and this is.I think I needed this. Whatever this is. So, thanks.
RAMONA: You're welcome. They exchange a smile. Then without warning we jump cut to -
'NO RAMONA': Another arrow point out that-
RAMONA: I have to work.
SCOTT: You have to leave.
RAMONA: You have to leave.
SCOTT: Hey, can this not be a one night stand? For one thing, I didn't even get any.that was a joke.
RAMONA: What did you have in mind?
SCOTT: Umm.oh, come to the first round of this battle of the bands thing.
RAMONA: ( TOTALLY UNIMPRESSED )
SCOTT: Yeah, we're terrible. Please come.
RAMONA: ( CONTINUED ) 37 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 37
SCOTT: Wait! Can I get your number? SSSSHHHOOP! Ramona skids to a stop, right back next to Scott. She hands him a note. 'RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx'
SCOTT: Wow, girl number. Scott looks back up. Ramona is already skating far, far away.
RAMONA: See you at the show, Scott Pilgrim.
SCOTT: Oh, hey! It's tonight.At The-
SCOTT: You totally came!
RAMONA: Yes. I did totally come. Scott is so amazed at her presence, his social skills vanish.
STACEY: Excuse my brother. He's chronically enfeebled. I'm Stacey.
RAMONA: And this is Wallace, his room-mate.
STACEY: And this is Wallace, his room-mate.
WALLACE: And this is my boyfriend Jimmy.
STACEY: And this is my boyfriend Jimmy.
WALLACE: ( staring at Jimmy ) And this is Knives, Scott's- Scott goes white. He didn't even see Knives come in.
STACEY: And this is Knives, Scott's- Scott goes white. He didn't even see Knives come in.
SCOTT: KNIVES CHAU
HEYYYYYYYY!: KNIVES CHAU
KNIVES CHAU: Knives pecks Scott on the cheek. He pushes her away. Knives looks kinda sexy, wearing makeup and new clothes.
KNIVES CHAU: Do you like?
SCOTT: LEONE STAREDOWNS all around. Stacey stares at Scott. Knives and Ramona stare at each other. Wallace stares at Jimmy.
STEPHEN STILLS: This is a nightmare. Is this a nightmare? Wake up, wake up, wake up.
KIM: Once we're on stage you'll be fine.
STILLS: We were just on stage. For sound check. The sound guy hated us.
SCOTT: It's just nerves! Pre-show jitters. People love us. Right? Scott sounds less than convincing. He looks up at Ramona and Knives sitting with Wallace, Jimmy and Stacey in the BALCONY.
WALLACE: Jimmy. Do they rock or suck?
JIMMY: They.haven't started playing yet.
WALLACE: That was a test, Jimmy. You passed.
CRASH: Good evening. I am Crash, and these are the Boys.
WALLACE: IS THAT GIRL A BOY, TOO? TRASHA, 8 year old girl drummer, gives Wallace the finger.
CRASH: TRASHA, 8 year old girl drummer, gives Wallace the finger.
KIM PINE: They have a girl drummer?
CRASH: This is called "I am so sad. I am so very very sad." And it goes a little something like this. Crash and the Boys play a whole song in .04 seconds.
CRASH: Thank you. Wallace yells from the balcony.
WALLACE: IT'S NOT A RACE, GUYS! This song is for the guy who keeps yelling from the balcony, and it's called "We Hate You, Please Die."
CRASH: This song is for the guy who keeps yelling from the balcony, and it's called "We Hate You, Please Die."
WALLACE: Sweet! I love this one!
STEPHEN STILLS: These guys are good. Are these guys Kim Pine scowls harder than ever.
STEPHEN STILLS: These guys are good.
CRASH: This is called "Last Song Kills Audience". It'll be our last song tonight and your last song EVER. Sound explodes from the stage. The audience are stunned.
STEPHEN STILLS: How are we supposed to follow this? We're not going to win, we're not gonna sign with G-Man and we'll never play opening night at the Chaos Theatre.
STACEY: So, how do you know Scott?
RAMONA: He's.um. He's a friend.
STACEY: Hard for me to keep track sometimes. He has so many friends. Ramona arches an eyebrow. Stacey turns to Knives and Tamara.
STACEY: So Knives, how did you meet Scott?
SCOTT: We gotta play now and loud!
KNIVES CHAU: Well, I was on the bus with my Mom- Knives freezes, staring at the stage.
RAMONA: Is that seriously the end of the story?
KNIVES CHAU: OH MY GOSH, they're on!
PROMOTER: This next band is from Toronto and.yeah. So give it up for SEX BOB-OMB walk on. Wallace and Knives give the only cheers.
STEPHEN STILLS: Scott.you ready? Scott nods vigorously.
STEPHEN STILLS: Kim.you rea-
KIM PINE: WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB. ONE, TWO. ANGLE on Knives. She faints in the excitement.
THREE, FOUR!: Sex Bob-omb rock out, barely into the first verse when a chunk of ceiling CRASHES down and a SPINDLY INDIAN HIPSTER KID DIVES HEAD FIRST through the hole, finger pointed at Scott as he sails towards the stage!
MATTHEW PATEL: Mr. Pilgrim. It is I, Matthew Patel. Consider our fight.begun!
SCOTT: What did I do? Matthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott.
SCOTT: What do I do?!
WALLACE: Scott throws his bass to Young Neil and BLOCKS Patel with his left arm, then PUNCHES him across the floor with his right. Patel LANDS like a cat, FLIPS his fringe and GLARES at Scott.
FIGHT!: Scott throws his bass to Young Neil and BLOCKS Patel with his left arm, then PUNCHES him across the floor with his right. Patel LANDS like a cat, FLIPS his fringe and GLARES at Scott.
MATTHEW PATEL: Alright. Alright.
WALLACE: Watch out! It's that one guy!
SCOTT: Thank you, Wallace! Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle.
MATTHEW PATEL: You're quite the opponent, Pilgrim.
SCOTT: Who the hell are you anyway? The LIGHTING GUY spotlights the fighters.
MATTHEW PATEL: My name is Matthew Patel and I'm Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend!
SCOTT: You're what?
MATTHEW PATEL: Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend! All eyes WHIP up to Ramona.
RAMONA: Anyone need another drink? Patel attacks Scott with spin kicks. Scott blocks. Patel punches. Scott blocks, then holds his hand up for a time-out.
SCOTT: We're fighting because of Ramona?
MATTHEW PATEL: Didn't you get my e-mail explaining the situation?
SCOTT: I skimmed it.
MATTHEW PATEL: You will pay for your insolence! Patel attacks, landing kicks and punches. Scott evades and counter-attacks. Patel evades, then lands more punches. Scott jump-spins away from danger. They pause, breathing heavy.
WALLACE: What's up with his outfit?
OTHER HECKLER: Yeah! Is he a pirate? Scott looks at Patel's outfit.
SCOTT: Are you a pirate?
MATTHEW PATEL: Pirates are in this year! Patel attacks again. They exchange furious blows, until Patel puts Scott in a choke hold. Scott looks up to Ramona.
SCOTT: You really went out with this guy?
RAMONA: Yeah, in the seventh grade. The Lighting Guy SWINGS the spotlight to Ramona in the balcony. We see a sketchy childlike ANIMATED FLASHBACK.
SCOTT: Dude, wait.mystical powers? Patel levitates into the air and points at Ramona.
MATTHEW PATEL: You'll pay for this, Flowers! Patel SNAPS his fingers and launches into a BOLLYWOOD SONG!
SCOTT: That doesn't even rhyme. Scott rolls across the stage, GRABS one of Kim's CYMBALS and throws it Captain America style. It hits Patel square in the eyes. POOF, the Demon Hipster Chicks vanish.
MATTHEW PATEL: This is impossible, how can it be?! Scott leaps into the air. Patel opens his eyes just in time to see Scott Pilgrim's FIST racing towards his face.
SCOTT: Open your eyes. Maybe you'll see.
SCOTT: Sweet. Coins.
RAMONA: Well, it was great meeting you. Tell your gay friends I said bye.
STACEY: Gay friends? Stacey turns to see Wallace and Jimmy making out.
STACEY: WALLACE?! Not again! Ramona passes Knives, who is being resuscitated by Tamara.
SCOTT: Aw man. $2.40? That's not even enough for the bus home.
RAMONA: I'll lend you the 30 cents. Ramona yanks Scott away. The Promotor ambles back onstage.
PROMOTER: Yeah.so like, Sex Bob-Omb wins.
SCOTT: A bemused Scott and mortified Ramona sit on the bus home.
SCOTT: What was all that all about?
RAMONA: Uh, I guess. Ramona takes a breath. Looks deep into Scott's eyes.
SCOTT: You have seven evil ex-boyfriends?
RAMONA: Seven ex's, yes.
SCOTT: So I have to fight-
RAMONA: -defeat your seven evil ex's if we're going to continue to date.
SCOTT: -defeat your seven evil ex's if we're going to continue to date.
RAMONA: Pretty much.
SCOTT: So, what you're saying is.
RAMONA: Uh, I guess.
SCOTT: Cool. Do you want to make out?
RAMONA: Scott kisses Ramona. The studio audience 'awwww's.
WALLACE: Someone's happy.
SCOTT: Well, someone got to second base last night. And someone has a second date tonight.
WALLACE: Someone's lucky then.
SCOTT: You know when I say 'someone', I mean me, right? I got to second base last night.maybe first and a half. Wallace shoots a look at the idiotically upbeat Scott.
WALLACE: Okay, Scott. But in return I have to issue an ultimatum.
SCOTT: One of your famous ultimatums?
WALLACE: It may live in infamy.You have to break up with Knives. Today. Okay? Scott huffs and helps himself to some of Wallace's bacon.
SCOTT: But.but.it's HARD.
WALLACE: If you don't do it, I'm going to tell Ramona about Knives. I swear to God, Scott.
SCOTT: But you.you're. At this point a sleepy JIMMY wanders out of the bathroom and helps himself to coffee.
JIMMY: Scott points bacon at Wallace accusingly.
DOUBLE STANDARD!: I didn't make up the gay rulebook. If you have a problem with it, take it up with Liberace's Ghost.
WALLACE: I didn't make up the gay rulebook. If you have a problem with it, take it up with Liberace's Ghost.
SCOTT: You're a monster.
WALLACE: Now put the bacon down and go do your dirt while I watch the Lucas Lee marathon on TBS Superstation.
SCOTT: Who's Lucas Lee? Wallace points to a hunky actor on the cover of NOW magazine.
WALLACE: He was this pretty good skater and now he's this pretty good actor.
SCOTT: They make movies in Toronto?
WALLACE: Yes. I am stalking him later.
SCOTT: So, this Lucas Lee-
WALLACE: Lucas Lee is not important to you right now! Get out.
SCOTT: You suck. Surprising no one. Scott grumbles off. Wallace turns the television way up. We see Lucas Lee on a payphone in some crummy thriller.
SCOTT: Oh, hey, Knives. Um, do you want to, like, talk or whatever?
SCOTT: Scott checks what he's wearing. SPOOKY MUSIC underscores.
SCOTT: It's not dorky! Why are you psychic? A beaming Knives knocks on the payphone glass.
KNIVES CHAU: I can't believe they're coming to town. Will you take me to the show?
SCOTT: Yeah, listen- The SPOOKY MUSIC gets louder, pounding inside Scott's head.
KNIVES CHAU: Oh, hey, I wanted to invite you over for dinner.
SCOTT: Like, Chinese food?
KNIVES CHAU: Hmm. It's not my favorite.
SCOTT: Hmm. It's not my favorite.
KNIVES CHAU: Yeah. Well, to meet my parents. It's my birthday dinner.
SCOTT: Uh.I think that's a really bad idea. Like, really, just so bad.
KNIVES CHAU: No, it's okay. Why?
SCOTT: Well I mean, I'm too old for you!
KNIVES CHAU: No you're not! My Dad is nine years older than my Mom.
SCOTT: And.and.are you even allowed to date outside your race or whatever?
KNIVES CHAU: I don't care. I'm in.LOVE!
SCOTT: Um, listen.I was thinking we should break up or whatever.
KNIVES CHAU: Yeah.um.it's not going to work out.
SCOTT: Yeah.um.it's not going to work out.
KNIVES CHAU: Scott walks out, leaving Knives in the aisle.
KIM PINE: Where's Knives? Not coming tonight?
SCOTT: Oh. No. We broke up. Young Neil PAUSES his DS. Kim and Stills share a look.
KIM PINE: Scott, you are the salt of the earth.
SCOTT: Aw, thanks.
KIM PINE: Wait. I meant scum of the earth.
SCOTT: Aw, thanks.
YOUNG NEIL: You.you broke up with Knives?
SCOTT: Yeah, but don't worry, maybe you'll meet my new new girlfriend soon.
YOUNG NEIL: Kim mimes shooting herself. Stills unplugs Scott's amp.
STEPHEN STILLS: Okay! From here on out, no GIRLFRIENDS or GIRLFRIEND talk at practice, whether they're old, new or new-new. We were lucky to survive that last round. This is sudden death now. Okay?
SCOTT: DINGY DONG. That's for me. Scott opens the door to see Ramona, now sporting BLUE HAIR.
RAMONA: Yes. Like you said. Is it not cool? Scott ushers her in, weirded out by this hair development.
SCOTT: You know your hair?
RAMONA: I know of it.
SCOTT: It's all blue.
RAMONA: Yeah. I just dyed it. Are you going to introduce me?
SCOTT: Oh yeah, this is Stephen Stills, Young Neil, that's. Kim.
RAMONA: Hey everyone. Everyone mumbles back. Scott still stares at Ramona's hair.
SCOTT: Is it weird not being pink anymore?
RAMONA: I change my hair every week and a half, dude. Get used to it. ( to Sex Bob-Omb ) So.uh.how do you guys all know each other?
YOUNG NEIL: High school, I guess?
STEPHEN STILLS: What Neil said.
YOUNG NEIL: I'm Neil.
KIM PINE: Believe it or not, I actually dated Scott in high school.
RAMONA: Got any embarassing stories?
KIM PINE: Yeah. He's an idiot. Scott fake laughs. Starts ushering Ramona out again.
SCOTT: Okay. Cool. See you guys tomorrow.
STEPHEN STILLS: Uh, what about rehearsal?
SCOTT: Neil knows my parts.
YOUNG NEIL: ( TO STILLS )
WALLACE: Are you doing okay there?
SCOTT: Yeah, good. Good. Ramona goes to the bathroom. Scott drops the act.
SCOTT: She changed her hair.
WALLACE: So? It looks nice blue.
SCOTT: I know, but she changed it without even making a big deal about it. She's spontaneous. Impulsive. Fickle. Oh my god, what do I do?
WALLACE: I can't believe you were worried about me gaying up the place. Ramona returns. Wallace pulls on a jacket.
RAMONA: How's dinner coming along?
SCOTT: Yeah, good. Good.
WALLACE: I'll leave you lovebirds to it. I'm heading up to Casa Loma to stalk my hetero crush. Scott stops Wallace at the door, with a panicked whisper.
SCOTT: Don't go.
WALLACE: Will you man the hell up? You could get to 2nd and a half base.
SCOTT: You think so?
WALLACE: Well, if you strike out in the next hour, come find me at the Castle.
SCOTT: 'If I strike out'?
WALLACE: Okay, 'when'. See you in sixty.
RAMONA: This is actually really good garlic bread.
SCOTT: Garlic bread is my favorite food. I could honestly eat it for every meal. Or just all the time without even stopping.
RAMONA: You'd get fat.
SCOTT: No. Why would I get fat?
RAMONA: Bread makes you fat.
SCOTT: Bread makes you FAT??
SCOTT: So I wrote a song about you.
RAMONA: Oh yeah?
SCOTT: Yeah, it goes like this: Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ra-mona, Ra-mona, Ra-ra-ra, Mona, Ooooh.
RAMONA: I can't wait to hear it when it's '15 MINUTES LATER' Scott makes out with Ramona on the futon. Scott smiles as she runs her hands through his hair.
SCOTT: '15 MINUTES LATER' Scott makes out with Ramona on the futon. Scott smiles as she runs her hands through his hair.
RAMONA: Your hair's pretty shaggy.
SCOTT: OH GOD! I NEED A HAIRCUT DON'T I?!? Scott sits up like a shot. Ramona is taken aback.
RAMONA: ( CONTINUED ) 58 CONTINUED: ( 4 ) 58
SCOTT: Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I got. I got a bad haircut right before me and my big ex broke up. But it's so long ago, I can barely remember it. A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep.
NARRATOR: Scott is acutely aware that his last salon haircut took place exactly 431 days ago, three hours before his big breakup. He blames this largely on the haircut and has been cutting his own hair ever since.
RAMONA: Sounds like a bad time.
SCOTT: Not really.
NARRATOR: It was.
SCOTT: It was a mutual thing.
NARRATOR: It wasn't.
SCOTT: I mean, she told me it was mutual.
NARRATOR: She dumped him. It was brutal.
RAMONA: What was her name?
SCOTT: She was Nat when I knew her. But she stopped liking that name. Then.she stopped liking me.
RAMONA: Your hair is cute. I like it long.
SCOTT: But it'd be cuter short! Wouldn't it?! Scott disappears and just as quickly reappears, now wearing his dorky SNOW HAT, hair tucked tightly beneath the flaps.
RAMONA: What? Why are you wearing that?
SCOTT: I thought we could go for a walk.
RAMONA: Tell me we didn't come out here just so you could cover your hair with that hat.
SCOTT: Nooo. I just love me some walking. Putting one leg in front of the other.
RAMONA: You seem a little.heightened.
SCOTT: Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not that I do drugs, unless you do, in which case I do drugs all the time, every drug, but.you make me feel.I don't know. Things seem a little brighter around you or something. Ramona and Scott finally reach the top of the stairs and NIGHT TURNS TO DAY, as if crossing a magical line.
RAMONA: What is this place?
SCOTT: A totally awesome castle. They're shooting this movie up here. Ramona looks up at the looming CASA LOMA, a castle surrounded by big, bright movie set lights.
RAMONA: Who's in it?
SCOTT: Winifred Hailey and some actor guy.
RAMONA: Oh, who?
SCOTT: I forget. Let's find out.
RAMONA: Did you find the guy you're stalking?
WALLACE: I think I'm about to right now.
RAMONA: Mr. Lee?
WALLACE: Lucas Lee.
RAMONA: The UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FANFARE announces LUCAS LEE as he exits his trailer, smoking a cigarette ( blacked out ). He skates towards the set, doing kickflips. The spectators go 'oooh'.
SCOTT: The UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FANFARE announces LUCAS LEE as he exits his trailer, smoking a cigarette ( blacked out ). He skates towards the set, doing kickflips. The spectators go 'oooh'.
WALLACE: I want to have his adopted babies.
RAMONA: Oh, man. We gotta go.
SCOTT: What? Why?
RAMONA: I used to date that clown.
WALLACE: Wallace. I am not a slut.
RAMONA: Wallace. I am not a slut.
WALLACE: I can think of no higher accolade. Lucas steps to his mark and puffs up into action hero mode.
LUCAS LEE: Lucas Lee points his board at the GOON.
SCOTT: LUCAS LEE
LUCAS LEE: Hey. The only thing keeping me and her apart is the two minutes it's gonna take to kick your ass.
SCOTT: .you dated a FAMOUS guy?!
RAMONA: In 9th grade. We had drama. Actually, it might have been math. I just remember there being lots of drama.
LUCAS LEE: Lucas Lee points at Scott, who remains oblivious.
HEY!!!: Lucas Lee points at Scott, who remains oblivious.
RAMONA: He just followed me around. He was a little snot nosed brat.
SCOTT: He had snot? In his nose? But he's It's not a big deal. I only dated him for a week and a half-
LUCAS LEE: It's not a big deal. I only dated him for a week and a half-
HEY!!!: It's not a big deal. I only dated him for a week and a half-
RAMONA: It's not a big deal. I only dated him for a week and a half-
LUCAS LEE: I'm talking to you Scott Pilgrim! Lucas Lee stomps towards Scott, who gasps.
SCOTT: He's famous and he talked to me!
LUCAS LEE: The only thing keeping me and her apart is the two minutes it's gonna take to kick your ass!
SCOTT: Can I get- POW! Lucas Lee punches Scott, flooring him. Scott comes back up with a pen and paper, wobbly.
SCOTT: Can I get your autograph? POW! Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He nods to Ramona.
LUCAS LEE: Sup. How's life? He seems nice. Lucas Lee THROWS Scott up into a castle turret, crumbling it. Scotts CRASHES down through scaffolding onto the set. Lucas holds up his hands for a quick continuity photo, then stomps over to pick up a dazed Scott from the ground.
WALLACE: Scott. Evil ex. Fight.
LUCAS LEE: Think you stand a chance against an A-lister, bro? Lucas Lee PUNCHES Scott again. He slides across the wet-down ground. A SET NURSE sprays Lucas' knuckles with antiseptic.
LUCAS LEE: Some competish you are. Lucas Lee wanders off. Scott staggers to his feet, punchy.
SCOTT: Hey. hey. hey! I'm not done- Scott spins Lucas around, only to find an identical STAND IN!
LUCAS LEE: He's good, right? Sometimes I let him do wide shots if I feel like getting blazed back in my winnie. Scott stands to fight the double. Suddenly, COUNTLESS STUNTMEN fan out behind the STAND IN, all identically dressed, all carrying skateboards and ready to rumble.
LUCAS LEE: I'm nothing without my stunt team. The Stuntmen ATTACK Scott Pilgrim with a howl. Scott PUNCHES through a couple of the boards, Tae Kwon Doe style.
WALLACE: Ask them how it feels to always get his sloppy seconds!
SCOTT: How does it feel to- KROW! Scott takes a skateboard to the face, followed by a barrage of crippling skateboard blows to his knees and ribs.
LUCAS LEE: I'm gonna get coffee. You homies want anything? We follow the smirking Lucas to the coffee station. We hear the noise of punching and kicking slowly subside to nothing.
SCOTT: You're needed back on set. Scott CHARGES Lucas Lee and leaps into a FLYING KICK. Lucas GRABS his foot and hurls him through the backdrop. RRRIP! Scott lands in a CRUMP, framed through the torn skyline. Lucas stomps over to him, preparing for the deathblow.
LUCAS LEE: Prepare. prepare to feel the wrath of the League of Evil Exes!
SCOTT: The League of Evil Axes?
LUCAS LEE: You really don't know about the "The League"?
SCOTT: LUCAS LEE
LUCAS LEE: Seven evil exes? Coming to kill you? Controlling the future of Ramona's love life?
SCOTT: LUCAS LEE
LUCAS LEE: Oh, well then don't worry about it.
SCOTT: LUCAS LEE
LUCAS LEE: Yeah, bro. Let's get a beer. Lucas offers a hand. Scott goes to shake it. POW! Lucas gets him square in the mouth. Scott smiles through his aching jaw.
SCOTT: You are a pretty good actor.
LUCAS LEE: I'm going for the Oscar this year.
SCOTT: But are you a pretty good skater?
LUCAS LEE: I'm more than pretty good, ese. I have my own skate company. Lucas pulls down his shirt, revealing a skate company tattoo.
SCOTT: So you can sell them, but can you do a thingy on that rail? Scott points to the LONG HANDRAIL on the stairs.
LUCAS LEE: It's called a grind, bro.
SCOTT: So can you do a grind thingy now?
LUCAS LEE: Are you serious? There's like 200 steps and the rails are garbage.
SCOTT: Hey, if it's too hardcore.
LUCAS LEE: You really think you can goad me into doing a trick like that?
SCOTT: There's girls watching.
LUCAS LEE: Somebody get me my board. Wallace taps Lucas' shoulder and hands him his skateboard.
WALLACE: Hi. Big fan.
LUCAS LEE: Why wouldn't you be? CLACK! Lucas GOES FOR IT, a perfect ollie onto the rail. Scott and Wallace watch as Lucas disappears from sight, sparking down the ENDLESS RAIL.HSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. Cut back to Scott & Wallace, impressed at Lucas.
SCOTT: Cut back to Scott
SCOTT: Cut back to Scott BOOOOOOOOM! A fireball appears from the bottom of the stairs.
WALLACE: Wow, he totally bailed.
SCOTT: Fist bump. Scott smacks his forehead.
SCOTT: I didn't get his autograph.
SCOTT: Where's Ramona? Is she still here?
WALLACE: No, she totally bailed.
SCOTT: What's the deal? Seriously.
SCOTT: Hey. It's me, Scott again. Call me back. Scott Pilgrim.
WALLACE: Yeah, you said that last night.
SCOTT: You know what really sucks though?
WALLACE: Come on guy, you can't say you didn't see this coming. It was right under your nose. Wallace points to the NOTE Ramona scribbled which is pinned literally under Scott's nose on the refrigerator: RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx
SCOTT: Come on guy, you can't say you didn't see this coming. It was right under your nose. Wallace points to the NOTE Ramona scribbled which is pinned literally under Scott's nose on the refrigerator: RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx
WALLACE: Come on guy, you can't say you didn't see this coming. It was right under your nose. Wallace points to the NOTE Ramona scribbled which is pinned literally under Scott's nose on the refrigerator: RAMONA FLOWERS, 212 664-7665, xxxxxxx
WALLACE: What did you think these were?
SCOTT: Kisses? Seven little kisses?
WALLACE: Seven deadly X's.
SCOTT: Why does everything have to be so Wallace crouches down to join Scott on the floor.
WALLACE: If you want something bad, you have to fight for it. Step up your game. Break out the L-word.
SCOTT: The other L-word.
WALLACE: The other L-word.
SCOTT: Okay, it's 'love'. I wasn't trying to trick you or anything. Look, if she's really the girl of your dreams, then you have to let her know. You have to overcome any and all obstacles that lie in your path. You have the spirit of a warrior, Scott. You can do it! Be with her! It's your destiny!
WALLACE: Okay, it's 'love'. I wasn't trying to trick you or anything. Look, if she's really the girl of your dreams, then you have to let her know. You have to overcome any and all obstacles that lie in your path. You have the spirit of a warrior, Scott. You can do it! Be with her! It's your destiny!
SCOTT: What? Why? Are you moving in with Other Scott or Jimmy or someone?
WALLACE: Or someone. Either way, I'm kind of banking on her calling you back so I won't have to evict you and feel all guilty and shit. RINGY RING. Scott and Wallace look at the phone.
WALLACE: I have a feeling that's for you, guy. Scott picks up. A SEXY, NON-RAMONA VOICE REPLIES.
SCOTT: Oh, shit.
WALLACE: Oh, shit.
SCOTT: ENVY ( O.S. ) A year I think?
SCOTT: ENVY ( O.S. ) How are you?
SCOTT: I'm not doing so good right now.
SCOTT: What? No, stop. I've been-it's been different. You have no idea.
SCOTT: Yes, you should. I have this totally awesome girlfriend who calls me all the time. And she's America. Uh. She's American.
SCOTT: I'm not telling you that. Ramona.
SCOTT: What? Do you know her?
SCOTT: It sounded like you did.
SCOTT: CLICK.Scott slumps to the floor. Wallace appears over him.
WALLACE: Okay. Everything does suck. Scott grunts. RINGY RING. Wallace grins and grabs the phone.
WALLACE: Or does it? Scott sits bolt upright, expectant.
WALLACE: Oh, hey Knives. Scott lays back down. FUCK.
WALLACE: What's that? You're outside? Scott sits bolt upright again. FUCK! Wallace opens the door a crack. Knives shivers outside, pale and broken looking.
KNIVES CHAU: Is Scott here?
WALLACE: You know what? Behind Wallace, we see Scott LEAP through a window head first. GLASS SMASHES.
SCOTT: WHOOSH - another blast of air whizzes by.
SCOTT: ( CONTINUED ) 62 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 62
SCOTT: I'm really not in the mood. SHWAA - SOMETHING slices the air in front of Scott.
SCOTT: Okay, enough! Scott punches the air in front of him. Hits SOMETHING. A DIMINUTIVE DIRTY BLONDE dressed in a punk rock kung fu get up lands on the ground with a thump. She spins to face Scott.
MYSTERY ATTACKER: You punched me in the boob. Prepare to die, obviously.
SCOTT: Listen, I've had it today. Can we not do this right now?
MYSTERY ATTACKER: ( DIXIELAND ACCENT )
SCOTT: What's that from?
MYSTERY ATTACKER: ( OWN VOICE )
SCOTT: Well whatever this is about, can it wait till I'm in the right frame of Nuh uh. This is one nightmare you can't wake up from.
MYSTERY ATTACKER: Nuh uh. This is one nightmare you can't wake up from.
SCOTT: Wait, am I asleep right now?
MYSTERY ATTACKER: So, technically this is not a So how can I not wake up? If I'm not actually asleep.
SCOTT: So, technically this is not a So how can I not wake up? If I'm not actually asleep.
MYSTERY ATTACKER: So how can I not wake up? If I'm not actually asleep.
SCOTT: So how can I not wake up? If I'm not actually asleep.
MYSTERY ATTACKER: Don't question me! Scott shakes his head, baffled.
SCOTT: Well, I'm really, really not up for this. Whatever it is.
MYSTERY ATTACKER: Okay little chicken, then I'll see you later. But you won't see me. Because I'll be deadly serious next PAF - the Mystery Attacker vanishes. Scott looks to the sky.
SCOTT: MYSTERY ATTACKER
MYSTERY ATTACKER: PAF - the Mystery Attacker vanishes. Scott looks to the sky.
SCOTT: Oh man. Someone help me.
SCOTT: It's Scott.
SCOTT: No, it's Scott. It's actually me.
SCOTT: I didn't do anything. It's everyone else that's crazy.
SCOTT: Cool, I'm coming in. Scott hangs up the phone and walks two steps into-
SCOTT: Think I'll make it a decaf today. Stacey turns around, revealing herself to be JULIE!
JULIE: SCOTT PILGRIM! AH! What did you do with my sister? Stacey taps on the window outside, mouthing that she has to go. Scott turns back to Julie, not happy.
SCOTT PILGRIM!: AH! What did you do with my sister? Stacey taps on the window outside, mouthing that she has to go. Scott turns back to Julie, not happy.
SCOTT: AH! What did you do with my sister? Stacey taps on the window outside, mouthing that she has to go. Scott turns back to Julie, not happy.
JULIE: What can I fucking get you?
SCOTT: Is there anywhere you don't work?
JULIE: They're called 'jobs', something a fuckball like you wouldn't know anything about. And by the way, I can't believe you fucking asked Ramona out after I specifically told you not to fucking do that! ( Note to concerned reader: Everytime Julie says "FUCK", a black bar comes out of her mouth and the sound is bleeped. )
SCOTT: How do you do that with your mouth?
JULIE: Neverfuckingmind how I do it! What do you have to say for yourself?
SCOTT: Uh. Can I get a caramel macchiato?
JULIE: Maybe it's high fucking time you took a look in a mirror before you wreak havoc on another girl.
SCOTT: Me? Wreak havoc? Julie points at THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD poster behind the counter with concert dates at the bottom.
JULIE: Fucking speaking of fucking which, I hear the girl that kicked your heart in the ass is walking the streets of Toronto again.
SCOTT: So I can pick up my coffee over Scott retreats away from Julie and bumps right into. RAMONA. They share an awkward moment. She looks at the floor.
RAMONA: Sorry that got a little crazy last Yeah. You kind of disappeared.
SCOTT: Yeah. You kind of disappeared.
RAMONA: Yeah, I do that. Listen, I know it's hard to be around me sometimes. I'll understand if you don't want to hang anymore.
SCOTT: No. No, I want to hang. The whole evil ex-boyfriend thing. No biggie.
RAMONA: I mean, I know it's early days, but I don't think anything can really get in the way of how I SHIT! Scott hides behind Ramona as a lithe figure emerges from the steamed-milk mists of the coffee shop.the singer from THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD has seemingly stepped out of the poster.
SCOTT: I mean, I know it's early days, but I don't think anything can really get in the way of how I SHIT! Scott hides behind Ramona as a lithe figure emerges from the steamed-milk mists of the coffee shop.the singer from THE CLASH AT DEMONHEAD has seemingly stepped out of the poster.
RAMONA: The big one? Scott nods. LEONE STAREDOWN between Envy and Ramona.
RAMONA: I'm gonna.excuse me. Ramona goes to order coffee, leaving Envy to fix on Scott.
ENVY: Your hair is getting shaggy. REVERSE: Scott is instantly wearing his DORKY HAT.
SCOTT: So. That's Ramona?
ENVY: So. That's Ramona?
SCOTT: Okay, I'm jealous.
ENVY: Okay, I'm jealous.
SCOTT: YOU'RE jealous?
ENVY: I'm allowed.
SCOTT: You left me! For that cocky pretty boy!
ENVY: You've never even seen him.
SCOTT: Yeah. I know. You left me for a guy I've never even seen.
ENVY: Maybe you'll see him soon. We're playing Lee's Palace. You guys should like, so totally come.
SCOTT: That's so not going to happen.
ENVY: Great. You're so on the list.
JULIE: Caramel Fuckiato for fuck Pilgrim!
SCOTT: ( TO RAMONA )
RAMONA: So.that was Nat?
SCOTT: No, that was Envy.
RAMONA: So.what did you guys talk about?
SCOTT: She's totally jealous of you.
RAMONA: Envy's jealous? How about that?
SCOTT: Yeah. How. About. That.
RAMONA: What happened with the two of you?
SCOTT: Do you mind if we don't get into that right now?
RAMONA: And two weeks later, you heard they were sleeping together I guess?
SCOTT: I dated a Todd once. That didn't end well either.
RAMONA: I dated a Todd once. That didn't end well either.
SCOTT: I can see how it sucks. Having the past come back to haunt you.
RAMONA: Is it wrong that I try not to think about it?
SCOTT: What do you want to think about?
RAMONA: How warm my place is right now. Ramona stops and kisses him.
OTHER SCOTT: And you didn't bang her? Are you gay?
SCOTT: I couldn't stop thinking about my stupid ex-girlfriend. A bleary Jimmy sits up between them all.
JIMMY: Is that the Uma Thurman movie?
WALLACE: Scott. Just because Envy's back in town doesn't make it not over.
SCOTT: Double negative. Tricky.
OTHER SCOTT: It's over. Move on.
WALLACE: Scott stands ( no pants ). Music swells.
JIMMY: Scott stands ( no pants ). Music swells.
SCOTT: Right. I'm not gonna let her toy with me. From this moment on, I will think of Envy Adams no more!
STEPHEN STILLS: I have distressing news. A deadly serious Stephen Stills addresses Kim, Scott and Young Neil. Ramona lounges on the couch.
KIM PINE: Is the news that we suck? Because I really don't think I can take it.
STEPHEN STILLS: No. The Clash At Demonhead are doing a secret show tomorrow night. And Envy asked us to open for them.
SCOTT: I hate you.
STEPHEN STILLS: A gig is a gig is a gig. Is a gig. Maybe you can put your history aside until we get through this thing. You know, for the band? For the band. For the band?
SCOTT: Can't we do our own secret shows?
KIM PINE: All our shows are secret shows.
STEPHEN STILLS: We're doing it. G-man might be there! We play the next round of the battle Saturday. We need to get some buzz going. We need groundswell. We need stalkers. Stills paces past the window to reveal.KNIVES CHAU OUTSIDE. CRASH ZOOM on her tearful face, pressed against the window. TOTALLY CRUSHED to see Scott cuddling with Ramona.
SCOTT: What would you do? If your ex was in a band and they wanted you to open for them?
RAMONA: If my ex was in the band?
SCOTT: It might be a little awkward. But maybe it's the grown up thing to do.
RAMONA: It might be a little awkward. But maybe it's the grown up thing to do.
SCOTT: Yeah, we're all adults right?
KNIVES CHAU: He's dating a fat-ass hipster chick! I hate his stupid guts! I'm gonna disembowel him!
KNIVES CHAU: He only likes her cause she's old! She's probably like 25! She's just some fat-ass white girl, you know?
TAMARA: I think you mentioned she was fa-
KNIVES CHAU: She's got a head start! I didn't even know there WAS good music until like two months ago! Okay, this really burns.
TAMARA: We should rinse-
KNIVES CHAU: I mean, he knew I was cool but he thought I was too young, so he tried to find someone cool but old.
TAMARA: She's cool? I thought she was fat-
KNIVES CHAU: Well she THINKS she's cool. This is all her fault.
TAMARA: Tamara turns the faucet on and rinses Knives hair.
KNIVES CHAU: It MUST be her fault. Obviously it's just a twist of fate or whatever, isn't it? Star crossed lovers! Born too late! Knives looks in the mirror: HER HAIR IS EXACTLY LIKE RAMONA.
TAMARA: We see a TEXT MESSAGE typing onscreen:
STEPHEN STILLS: Thank you. We were Sex Bob-Omb. Wallace and Other Scott clap and cheer, drunk. The other snobbish kids in the audience shrug and disperse.
STEPHEN STILLS: We got some merch out the back, so- ( to Scott and Kim ) Okay. Bar. Now.
STEPHEN STILLS: Level with me. Did we suck?
RAMONA: I don't know. Did you?
STEPHEN STILLS: She has to go. She knows we suck. Ramona excuses herself.
KNIVES CHAU: Hey Ramona.
RAMONA: Ramona exits, confused. Knives follows.
RAMONA: What the hell?
KNIVES CHAU: Hey Scott. Knives heads into Young Neil's arms at the other end of the bar. Scott struggles with something resembling jealousy.
SCOTT: What the hell?
KIM PINE: Look who Knives is hanging with.
RAMONA: Who is that girl again?
STEPHEN STILLS: Briefly. Briefly.
SCOTT: Briefly. Briefly.
KIM PINE: I bet Young Neil will date her even How old is she? A 'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' spins INSIDE SCOTT'S HEAD, with selections such as 'It was nothing' and 'She was nobody.' The wheel sticks between 'I gotta pee.' and 'Who, her?'
RAMONA: How old is she? A 'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' spins INSIDE SCOTT'S HEAD, with selections such as 'It was nothing' and 'She was nobody.' The wheel sticks between 'I gotta pee.' and 'Who, her?'
SCOTT: I gotta pee on her. ( turns beet red ) I mean, I gotta pee. Pee time.
SCOTT: That guy on bass? That's Todd.
RAMONA: I know.
ENVY: Oh yeah.
SCOTT: You know?
ENVY: Oh yeah. Todd flips his fringe from his eyes. Stares at Scott.
SCOTT: Oh no. Envy lets her coat slip off, revealing a stunning figure.
ENVY: OH YYYEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! 76 INT. LEE'S PALACE - LATER 76 Sex Bob-Omb, Knives and Ramona hang near the BACKSTAGE doors.
OH YYYEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!: 76 INT. LEE'S PALACE - LATER 76 Sex Bob-Omb, Knives and Ramona hang near the BACKSTAGE doors.
KNIVES CHAU: Oh my God. Just oh my God.
YOUNG NEIL: Man, you have to see them live. They're so much better live. Oh.
SCOTT: I think I'm going to throw up. Julie opens the backstage door and huffs.
JULIE: I can't believe I'm even saying this, but Envy Adams would like all of you to come backstage.
SCOTT: All of us?
JULIE: Did I fucking stutter? The group shuffles backstage. Scott hangs his head like a condemned man.
KNIVES CHAU: How do you know Envy???
YOUNG NEIL: Knives makes a face that looks like this: >:O !!!!
TODD INGRAM: Hey Ramona.
RAMONA: Hey Todd.
TODD INGRAM: Been a while.
RAMONA: Mmm hmm.
TODD INGRAM: Mmm hmm.
RAMONA: ( whispers to Scott ) I think we should get out of here.
JULIE: How was the tour? You played with The Pixies? You're a superstar now!
ENVY: It's-yeah, it's not something I can really put into words.
KNIVES CHAU: Um.Envy? I read your blog. Todd and Julie glare at Knives.
ENVY: So.Scott and Ramona eh?
RAMONA: What of it?
ENVY: You guys are a cute couple, you know? You suit each other.
STEPHEN STILLS: So what's your ulterior motive Envy, in general?
JULIE: She doesn't need ulterior motives, Stephen. She's got a write-up in You're my role model Envy.
KNIVES CHAU: You're my role model Envy.
ENVY: Just saying, cute couple. I like your outfit Ramona. Affordable?
JULIE: I was going to say, Envy. Did you get those jeans in New York, they're-
ENVY: I'm talking to Ramona right now.
JULIE: Ramona lived in New York.
ENVY: I was just there. We played the Chaos Theatre for Gideon. You know him, right?
KNIVES CHAU: I'VE KISSED THE LIPS THAT KISSED YOU! Envy nods at Todd. He PUNCHES KNIVES SQUARE IN THE JAW! OMFG! Scott jumps to his feet, FACING OFF against Todd Ingram.
SCOTT: Young Neil rushes to Knives' aid. Scott boils. Todd smirks.
TODD INGRAM: That's right. I'm not afraid to hit a girl. I'm a rock star.
YOUNG NEIL: You punched the highlights out of her hair! ANGLE on Knives. Her hair is black and plain as before.
YOUNG NEIL: He punched the highlights. Out. Of. Her. Hair.
ENVY: You're incorrigible.
TODD INGRAM: I don't know the meaning of the word. Young Neil escorts Knives out. Todd sits back down like nothing happened. Scott's face is a bright shade of rage.
JULIE: So, are you guys doing anything fun while you're in town?
TODD INGRAM: Fun? In Toronto?
SCOTT: That is IT, you cocky cock! YOU'LL PAY
SCOTT: KK.my neck.yy.your hair.
ENVY: Didn't you know? Todd's Vegan.
TODD INGRAM: It's not a big deal.
SCOTT: No kidding.anyone can be.vegan.
TODD INGRAM: Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.
SCOTT: Ovo what?
TODD INGRAM: I partake not in the meat nor breastmilk or ovum of any creature that has a face.
ENVY: Short answer: Being vegan just makes you better than most people.
TODD INGRAM: Todd lifts up Scott telekinetically and throws him miles into the air. Scott sails out of shot and into space.
STEPHEN STILLS: Hey man, question. I always wondered, how does not eating dairy products give you psychic powers?
TODD INGRAM: You know how you only use ten percent of your brain? Well, it's because the other 90% is filled up with curds and whey.
KIM PINE: Did you learn that at Vegan Academy?
TODD INGRAM: Go ahead and get snippy baby, if you knew the science, maybe I'd listen to a word you're saying. Scott returns to earth with a THUMP. He moans in pain. While the others bicker, Ramona helps Scott to his feet.
SCOTT: If I peed my pants, would you pretend I just got wet from the rain?
RAMONA: It's not raining.
SCOTT: Oh. How about you give me the Cliff Notes on how and why you ended up dating this a-hole?
RAMONA: Is that really important right now?
SCOTT: If there's a key element in his backstory that can help me out in a critical moment of not dying? Yes. A brief, scrappy ANIMATED FLASHBACK of Young Todd and Ramona.
SCOTT: Have you dumped everyone you've ever been with? You've never been the dumpee? Ramona shrugs.
RAMONA: Look, I've dabbled with being a bitch. It's part of the reason I moved here. I was really hoping to put it all behind me.
TODD INGRAM: We have unfinished business, I and he! Scott stands up - sort of ready for another round.
SCOTT: He and me.
TODD INGRAM: Don't you talk to me about grammar!
SCOTT: I.dislike you. Capiche? Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.
TODD INGRAM: Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.
SCOTT: TODD INGRAM
TODD INGRAM: Because you'll be dust by Monday.
SCOTT: TODD INGRAM
TODD INGRAM: Because I'll be pulverizing you in two seconds. And the cleaning lady.cleans up.dust. She dusts.
SCOTT: Sorry, so what's on Monday?
TODD INGRAM: Cos it's Friday now and she has weekends off, so.Monday. Right?
ENVY: Basically, you can't win this fight and you'll have to give up on this girl, 'cos Todd is going to kill You used to be so.nice! Scott CHARGES at Todd, who PSYCH-THROWS him back into the club. We hear a distant CRUMP. Stills calls through the hole.
SCOTT: You used to be so.nice! Scott CHARGES at Todd, who PSYCH-THROWS him back into the club. We hear a distant CRUMP. Stills calls through the hole.
STEPHEN STILLS: Uh, we're going to Pizza Pizza for a slice, call us when you're done.
ENVY: Oh, he'll be done real soon.
ENVY: Sorry, baby. Crummy way to end things, I know. Suddenly, the bass-line from FINAL FANTASY 2 rumbles through the walls. Todd calls to a roadie.
TODD INGRAM: Get me my bass. The good one.
TODD INGRAM: You're going down. Vegan Style! Todd lands in front of Scott. BASS OFF! PICKS STRIKE STRING! Todd easily out-basses Scott, shredding him into oblivion. The enormous reverb LAUNCHES club debris towards Scott.
SCOTT: The reverb is hurting my soul!!! Scott slides across the floor and slams right into the wall. Todd LEVITATES, fauxhawk rising. He hovers next to him.
TODD INGRAM: That's right, Pilgrim. I actually know how to play bass. Todd DETUNES his bass and delivers a death note that BLOWS Scott right through the stage wall.
TODD INGRAM: I can read your thoughts. Your bass hand is badly injured. You're through. Scott turns around on his knees, cringing, holding a cup of MILKY LOOKING COFFEE in either hand as a peace offering.
SCOTT: What say we drink to my memory? Fair trade blend with soymilk?
ENVY: I'm sorry, but that's pathetic.
TODD INGRAM: Dude. I can see in your mind's eye that you poured Half & Half into one of these coffees in an attempt to make me break vegan edge. I'll take the one with soy. Thanks, tool. Todd floats to the ground, takes one of the cups and drinks.
SCOTT: Actually, I poured soy in this cup, but thought real hard about pouring it in that one. You know, in my mind's eye or whatever.
TODD INGRAM: What are you talking about?
SCOTT: You just drank Half TWO TRENDY POLICE TYPES BUST IN THROUGH THE WALL, making two more holes and pointing their fingers like deadly weapons.
TODD INGRAM: That's bullroar!
TODD INGRAM: But this is a first offense! Don't I get three strikes? Vegan Police Officer #2 flips open his CODE VIOLATION book.
TODD INGRAM: Gelato isn't vegan?
TODD INGRAM: Chicken isn't vegan?
TODD INGRAM: Scott rises into a stance to deliver his killer line.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!: Scott rises into a stance to deliver his killer line.
SCOTT: You once were a vegone, but now you will be gone!
TODD INGRAM: Scott HEADBUTTS TODD, exploding him! POOM! Scott dusts himself off as COINS rain down. Envy stares, jaw ajar.
SCOTT: Uh, sorry I guess.
ENVY: Sorry? You just headbutted my boyfriend so hard he burst.
SCOTT: You kicked my heart in the ass. So I guess we're even. Natalie.
ENVY: No one calls me that anymore.
SCOTT: Maybe they should. Now let's get out of here. A battle worn Scott limps through the hole in the wall. Ramona follows, shooting Envy a look on the way out.
RAMONA: Crummy way to end things, I know. Envy blinks, in shock. Julie pops into shot.
JULIE: For the record, I am so pissed off for you right now.
ENVY: Shut the fuck up, Julie.
WALLACE: Envy Adams. I hate that bitch so much I kind of love her.
OTHER SCOTT: Yeah. That Todd guy was cool too. And hot. I liked him. Scott sighs and holds a cold Coke Zero on his forehead.
RAMONA: Are you okay?
SCOTT: Uh huh.
RAMONA: You sure about that?
SCOTT: Do I look like I'm not okay? Scott does not look okay. Stills coughs.
STEPHEN STILLS: We're still going to the after show I'm not sure it's gonna be much of a party, I think a third of the band just went 'poom'.
KIM PINE: I'm not sure it's gonna be much of a party, I think a third of the band just went 'poom'.
STEPHEN STILLS: Cool bands never go to their own after parties. It's just the desperate people trying to rub elbows with label guys.
KIM PINE: Then why would we.oh.
STEPHEN STILLS: Neil, you down?
RAMONA: Do you want to go?
SCOTT: I kind of almost died back there, so.
RAMONA: I'm not saying I want to go.
SCOTT: Hey, we can totally go.
RAMONA: I'll do whatever you want to do.
SCOTT: So let's go. Scott takes another bite. Other Scott whispers to Wallace.
OTHER SCOTT: Are Scott and Ramona fighting?
WALLACE: Not to my knowledge.
OTHER SCOTT: I mean, not with fists.
WALLACE: I mean, not with fists.
OTHER SCOTT: OTHER SCOTT
WALLACE: OTHER SCOTT
OTHER SCOTT: 81 EXT. AFTER PARTY - NIGHT 81 The whole gang trudge to the after party. Scott limps a bit, lagging behind. Ramona falls back with him.
RAMONA: We really don't have to go to this thing. It'll probably be a bad scene all around and we've already had a full night.
SCOTT: No, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just-
RAMONA: It's just.?
SCOTT: Well, not that fighting harder and harder battles for your love is getting old or anything.but have you ever dated someone who wasn't a total ass?
RAMONA: So far you're not a total ass.
SCOTT: But I'm part ass?
RAMONA: If it makes you feel better, you're the nicest guy I've dated.
SCOTT: Wait.is that good?
RAMONA: It's what I need right now.
SCOTT: But not.later?
RAMONA: Scott, I don't have all the answers. I'd just like to live in the moment if I can.
SCOTT: Yeah, I'd just like to live. Scott and Ramona enter a big, fartsy, artsy WAREHOUSE.
RAMONA: Okay, I know Todd was bad news. But are you saying Envy wasn't? We all have baggage.
SCOTT: My baggage doesn't try and kill me every five minutes. What did you do to your ex-boyfriends to make them so insane?
RAMONA: ( CONTINUED ) 82 CONTINUED: 82
SCOTT: ( CONTINUED ) 82 CONTINUED: 82
RAMONA: No break up is painless. Someone always gets hurt. What about you and that girl Knives?
SCOTT: Who broke up with who?
RAMONA: Who broke up with who?
SCOTT: I believe.I broke up with her.
RAMONA: And was she cool with that?
SCOTT: Knives is with Young Neil now, she's totally cool with it. They pass Knives and Young Neil. She seemingly has no interest in her date and simply stares at Scott lovingly.
RAMONA: You sure about that?
SCOTT: Yeah. She's very mature for her age. It was a very healthy break up. We're all peaches and gravy. We hear an offscreen distant 'nooooo' from Knives.
RAMONA: And what about you and Kim? They pass Kim. She's also staring at Scott. Not lovingly.
SCOTT: Me and Kim? I can barely remember. Why, is it important?
RAMONA: Hey, you want to know everything about my past, dude.
SCOTT: It was just.yeah. I don't know. It was high school. She had freckles. It was cool, I guess.
RAMONA: That's it?
SCOTT: Yeah, it kind of ended. We changed.
RAMONA: That's really the whole story?
SCOTT: OKAY! I had to fight a dude to get with her! I fought a crazy eighty foot tall purple suited dude! And I had to fight 96 guys to get to him, too! He was flying and shooting lightning bolts from his eyes! He was totally awesome and I kicked him so far he saw the curvature of the earth! Does that make you feel any better?
RAMONA: Well now you are being a total ass. Welcome to the club. In the back glass of the bar, Scott sees his reflection: fringed hair, wicked glare. He catches himself.
SCOTT: Sorry. I'm not usually like this.
RAMONA: Hey, don't worry. I don't know what I'm like anymore.
SCOTT: I guess this whole ex-boyfriends thing is really messing with my head.
RAMONA: Why do you keep saying- PAF! A foot appears out of nowhere and KICKS Scott in the head, sending him flying across the dance floor. Scott looks up at his opponent, the MYSTERY ATTACKER!
SCOTT: Why do you keep saying- PAF! A foot appears out of nowhere and KICKS Scott in the head, sending him flying across the dance floor. Scott looks up at his opponent, the MYSTERY ATTACKER!
RAMONA: Scott gets up. The three square off in a triangle.
SCOTT: You know this girl?
ROXY: Oh boy, does she know me.
SCOTT: What.is.she.talking about?
ROXY: He really doesn't know?
SCOTT: ( ping! ) You and her?!
RAMONA: It was just a phase.
ROXY: Just a phase?
SCOTT: You had a sexy phase?
RAMONA: I didn't think it would count! It meant nothing.
ROXY: It meant nothing???
RAMONA: I was just a little bi-curious.
ROXY: Well honey, I'm a little bi-furious! Roxy throws a SCORPION KICK at Scott's face. Ramona CATCHES her foot mid-air. Roxy flips out of the hold.
RAMONA: Do that again and I will end you.
ROXY: Back off hasbian. If Gideon can't have you, no one can. The League hath spoken. The girls square off, clearing the busy dance floor.
RAMONA: Then Gideon best get his pretentious ass up here, 'cos I'm about to kick yours out of the Great White North.
ROXY: You unbelievable bitch. RAMONA pulls a LARGE HAMMER from her purse.
RAMONA: Believe it. An embarrassed Scott watches with the rest of the crowd.
SCOTT: Uh huh?
WALLACE: Uh huh?
SCOTT: This is happening right?
WALLACE: Uh huh.
SCOTT: I mean, this is live?
WALLACE: Oh yeah. KICK HER IN THE BALLS,
RAMONA!: With blinding speed, Roxy slips her belt off and WHIPS A RAZOR SHARP FLYING GUILLOTINE BELT BUCKLE at Ramona! Ramona CARTWHEELS as the buckle sails between her legs and SMASHES into a DISCO BALL. Mirrored shards fly everywhere. PAF! Roxy vanishes as Ramona SWINGS the hammer at her. It smashes a speaker. Sound on one side of the room cuts out. Ramona turns around just in time to see Roxy's deadly belt SAILING towards her. She BLOCKS with the hammer. The belt wraps around it. Roxy HURLS the hammer out the window.
ROXY: I'm sending you back to Gideon in a thousand pieces, you slag. Ramona springs off of various pieces of furniture, LEAPING towards Roxy and PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE. Roxy REELS and SLAMS into the wall, leaving a dent in it.
RAMONA: I'd rather be dead than go back. He's a creep, you're a bitch and you all deserve each other.
ROXY: Give it a rest, Ramona. This is a League game.
RAMONA: Roxy points an accusing finger at the mortified Scott.
ROXY: Meaning your precious Scott must defeat me with his own fists. Or possibly feet.
SCOTT: I'm not sure I can hit a girl. They're soft.
RAMONA: You don't have a choice. Ramona positions Scott into a fighting stance as Roxy CHARGES with deadly intent. Ramona puppeteers Scott into a furious volley of PUNCHES on Roxy. She staggers, winces.
ROXY: Fight your own battles, lazy ass! PAF! Roxy disappears then REAPPEARS between Scott and Ramona, kicking them apart with the splits. Roxy then KICKS Scott into the ceiling. He lands HARD on the floor.
RAMONA: Her weak point's the back of her knees!
SCOTT: What? How does that work?
RAMONA: Whenever we were making out, I-
SCOTT: As Roxy's leg descends, Scott reaches up with one finger and lightly TICKLES the back of Roxy's knee.
ROXY: Roxy falls, still in the splits, throbbing with orgasmic meltdown. Scott watches as Roxy giggles between spasms.
RAMONA: Two gin and tonics please.
SCOTT: Two gin and tonics please.
RAMONA: I thought you didn't drink.
SCOTT: Only on special occasions. Why? Did you want one? Scott swigs down his drink. Ramona tries to lighten things.
RAMONA: I guess we really don't know that much about each other do we? Scott seems immediately drunk.
SCOTT: Maybe you could just give me a list of all your exes so at least I know who's going to beat my ass into the ground next.
RAMONA: Oh, like a handy little laminate or something? Let me see if I can find one. ( looks through bag ) Maybe we could exchange our information. Scott has already downed his second drink.
SCOTT: Just out of sheer curiosity and concern for my mortal well-being, is there anyone at this party you haven't slept with?
HEY!: Ramona stops. Looks hurt. She touches her hair.
RAMONA: I really think we should split.
SCOTT: As in 'get out of here'? Or as in 'split split'?
RAMONA: I'd hope you could figure that out. Or did you miss the part where I saved your ass?
SCOTT: How could I not? I feel like we just washed our sexy laundry in public.
RAMONA: Dirty laundry. You're drunk.
SCOTT: ( holds up 2 fingers ) I've had like one drink.
RAMONA: Well I'm sorry I cared. I don't enjoy all this Scott. In fact I'm sick of it. I thought you might be more understanding.
SCOTT: I JUST-
RAMONA: You're just another evil ex- boyfriend waiting to happen. Ramona walks off and loudly announces.
SCOTT: Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?
STEPHEN STILLS: You don't know?
STEPHEN STILLS: They're the next band in the battle and they are badass.
KIM PINE: Ramona dated twins?
SCOTT: YOUNG NEIL
YOUNG NEIL: At the same time?
SCOTT: You know what? I don't know and I don't want to know.
STEPHEN STILLS: Good. You know how I feel about girls cockblocking the rock.
SCOTT: Good. I play better in a bad mood.
STEPHEN STILLS: If it's gonna be an issue though, Young Neil can fill in for you.
SCOTT: It's not an issue. You know bands, I know battles. We got it covered.
STEPHEN STILLS: Well, we'd understand if you didn't want to take part.
SCOTT: Not only do I want to take part. I want to take them apart.
STEPHEN STILLS: Okay. I'm getting tingles.
YOUNG NEIL: 84 EXT. THE NINTH CIRCLE - NIGHT 84 Sex Bob-Omb and Young Neil load their gear at the venue.
STEPHEN STILLS: Okay. We're doomed.
YOUNG NEIL: ( CONTINUED ) 84 CONTINUED: 84
KIM PINE: That flyer needs more exclamation marks.
STEPHEN STILLS: Oh, we are going to get killed.
YOUNG NEIL: Come on. You're onstage in five.
SCOTT: Aren't the Katamaris or whatever on I think you're both on first?
YOUNG NEIL: I think you're both on first?
STEPHEN STILLS: Wait.amp versus amp? We're going on stage at the same time?
SCOTT: That's impossible-
'ACTUALLY, NO': Two stages sit on either side of the auditorium. On one: a MONOLITHIC WALL OF ELK AMPLIFIERS. On the other, SEX BOB-OMB, with their dinky LAME BRAND amps behind them.
SCOTT: Okay. My bad.
KIM PINE: Your bad is saying my bad. Sex Bob-Omb stare up at the Katayanagi amps, sweating behind their instruments. Stills looks into the audience positioned between the bands: a legion of identical INDIE TEENS.
STEPHEN STILLS: We shouldn't even be here. We shouldn't even be here. Stills tries to run. Scott grabs him and pulls him back.
SCOTT: Come on man! I put aside my problems for the music. If I can do that, we can do anything.
KIM PINE: Did you speak to Ramona then?
SCOTT: What? No. I haven't seen her since the other night.
KIM PINE: Oh. She's totally here.
KIM PINE: Scott? Not that I care.but you should talk to her before she's gone.
SCOTT: THANKS KI- KIM PINE
KIM PINE: And I really don't care. Scott nods at Kim's advice. He looks back to the crowd to find the MYSTERY GEEK staring right at him. Then- Disorienting LIGHTS and LASERS flash on the opposite stage. A wall of FEEDBACK builds.THE KATAYANAGI TWINS appear, sliding onstage behind their respective keyboard stands. KYLE KATAYANAGI, 23, is very serious and Japanese. KEN KATAYANAGI, 23, is serious and very Japanese. Scott, Stephen Stills and Kim share a nervous look.
STEPHEN STILLS: Okay gang. Can we do this? I mean, we can do this. Right?
KIM PINE: STEPHEN STILLS
STEPHEN STILLS: Scott is distracted again by the Mystery Geek staring at him.
KIM PINE: Kyle Katayanagi hits a SINGLE NOTE on the keyboard, blasting an enormous wave of sound at Sex Bob-Omb. It's so loud that it shakes the foundations and rips the lighting rig from the ceiling, leaving a huge hole in the roof. The crowd cheers.
SCOTT: WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB! WE ARE HERE TO MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT DEATH AND GET SAD AND STUFF! 1-2-3-4! Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT, their sound blowing a mass of snow towards the Katayanagis. For once, they sound awesome. Kyle looks at Ken. They share a nod. Ken turns their amps up to the Japanese character for '11'. Their waveforms transform the swirling snow into a TWO HEADED WHITE DRAGON! Katayanagi SLAM their Moogs. Heavy weirdness EXPLODES from the amps! The Dragon blows a BLAST of snowy fire that BLOWS SEX BOB-OMB OFF THE STAGE. The crowd ERUPTS into cheers. Scott, Kim and Stills lie in a heap under their instruments.
STEPHEN STILLS: Let's break up now and get it over with. We screwed the pooch in front of Gideon Graves. We're done.
SCOTT: Gideon.is here? Where? Stills points to the 'Mystery Geek', who smirks and whispers in Ramona's ear. This is GIDEON GRAVES, 37, ASSHOLE.
SCOTT: That's Gideon? Scott's eyes reflect Ramona's hair and turn GREEN. He struggles to his feet. The crowd slowly stops clapping as Scott pulls Stills to his feet, then helps Kim up.
SCOTT: Alright. Let's do this! Kim, inspired by Scott's new hardcore attitude, comes in heavy on the kick drum. BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! Heads nod in time as Sex Bob-Omb ROCK OUT! Their waveforms transform a mass of snow into a GREEN EYED YETI! The Katayanagis fight back with their future sounds and their Sonic Dragon stalks towards Sex Bob-Omb, slinking on perfect beat with the Katayanagis' spooky music. The Yeti and the Dragons CLASH at center stage, fighting in time to the music! Scott and Stills bring their pick hands down like fierce PUNCHES. The Yeti brings it's fists down on The Dragon. Sex Bob-Omb HAMMER DOWN THE FINAL NOTE:
'+999 ROCKING': KIM PINE
KIM PINE: That.was epic. The crowd goes bazooky. A DISEMBODIED SCOTT HEAD appears, hovering next to Scott. Scott looks for Ramona in the crowd, but she and Gideon are gone. Scott hands his bass to Young Neil.
STEPHEN STILLS: Scott. What are you doing?
SCOTT: Getting a life. Scott swipes the SCOTT HEAD and jumps into the still- applauding crowd. He can't find Ramona, but comes upon KNIVES standing alone in her homemade Sex Bob-Omb T-shirt.
KNIVES CHAU: I just came to see the show. I'm not even stalking you. Knives's unusally composed demeanor gives Scott pause.
SCOTT: You seem. different. Knives shrugs, different.
KNIVES CHAU: I feel like I know stuff now. Scott and Knives lock eyes. Scott suddenly spots a flash of GREEN HAIR exiting the building.
SCOTT: Scott follows. Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing.
SCOTT: Ramona. I have something I need to tell you.
RAMONA: Yeah, I have something to-
SCOTT: ( RUSHED )
RAMONA: I really, really mean it.
SCOTT: I really, really mean it.
RAMONA: Oh. Okay.
SCOTT: What did you want to tell me?
RAMONA: That we have to break up.
SCOTT: Yeah.it's not going to work out.
RAMONA: Yeah.it's not going to work out.
SCOTT: Oh okay. A sleek black '61 Lincoln Continental pulls up behind.
RAMONA: It's Gideon. I just.I can't help myself around him.
GIDEON GRAVES: The good news, Scottie, is I'm officially loving the Sex Bombs.
SCOTT: GIDEON GRAVES
GIDEON GRAVES: Three piece rock outfit with a semi- attractive female drummer? Music to my earholes. Scott glowers. Ramona looks at the floor. Stills is ga-ga. TEXT: An arrow points to Stills' crotch, captioned 'PEE'.
GIDEON GRAVES: You know, I'm not even going to wait to see how you guys do in the final. I'm signing you right now for a three album deal. Gideon produces a CONTRACT and clicks a pen.
GIDEON GRAVES: See? I'm not such a bad guy after Scott GRABS the contract and throws it onto the sidewalk.
SCOTT: You think we're gonna sell our souls to you? Well then guess- We hear SCRIBBLING. Stills has picked up the contract and is furiously signing it using Scott's back. Kim shrugs and signs it too, before trying to hand it back to Scott.
SCOTT: Nuh-uh. I can't be part of the band with this douche-in-charge.
GIDEON GRAVES: Scottie, buddy, can I just say, keep your emotions in check. Don't let what's past screw up your Scott watches Ramona get into the Continental. She rolls the mirrored window up so Scott stares at his own reflection.
STEPHEN STILLS: The people need to hear us, Scott.
SCOTT: Then you're going to need to find someone else to play bass. A cough. A meek Young Neil slides into view, bass in hand.
GIDEON: Looks like we're all set. Young Neil signs the contract. There are hand shakes all round. Gideon turns to Scott and pats him on the shoulder.
GIDEON: Oh and Scott, we should really be thanking each other. I mean, if it wasn't for me, you would have never been with Ramona, but if it wasn't for you, she wouldn't be back with me. So I guess it all shakes out. Gideon walks around to the driver side of the Lincoln.
GIDEON: And hey, the whole League of Evil Exes thing? I was in a dark place when I put that together. Forgiven? Gideon disappears into the Lincoln and drives off and Sex Bob-Omb drift away. Scott stands alone. He slaps his head-
SCOTT: I said 'lesbians'!
SCOTT: The wha?
STACEY: I mean, did you really see a future with this girl?
SCOTT: Like.with jetpacks? Stacey stands to go, gives Scott a hug.
STACEY: Time heals all wounds, little brother. Maybe next time let's not date the girl with eleven evil ex- Oh. Well that's not so bad. Stacey heads off. Scott looks at the camera.
SCOTT: Oh. Well that's not so bad. Stacey heads off. Scott looks at the camera.
STACEY: Oh. Well that's not so bad. Stacey heads off. Scott looks at the camera.
SCOTT: WALLACE ( O.S. ) TURN OFF THE LIGHT! Scott flicks the light off. Over PITCH BLACK.
WALLACE: Scott, you know I love you. But I need my own bed tonight. For sex.
SCOTT: I may need it the rest of the week too.
WALLACE: I may need it the rest of the week too.
SCOTT: And the year.
SCOTT: I get it.
WALLACE: Maybe you can move in with Ramona. Scott stares deep into his cocoa and shakes his head.
SCOTT: She's with Gideon.
WALLACE: Ah. That sucks. But you know, it's probably just because he's better than you.
WALLACE: He'll certainly have better hair. Scott nods.
WALLACE: Either way, I think this fight is over. Scott nods.
WALLACE: You can sleep on the floor until you get somewhere else to stay. I got you muffs and blinkers in case this might happen. Wallace produces earmuffs and a sleep mask.
SCOTT: RINGY RING. Scott stares at the phone. Some guy picks up.
SOME GUY: It's for Scott.
SCOTT: ( TAKES PHONE )
SCOTT: Is Ramona with you?
GIDEON GRAVES: I don't know. Are you with me?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!: GIDEON GRAVES
GIDEON GRAVES: Geez buddy, it's gonna be alright.
SCOTT: No, I just spilled cocoa on my crotch.
SCOTT: ( GRIM )
SCOTT: GIDEON GRAVES
GIDEON GRAVES: Okay laters. WALLACE ( O.S. ) What a perfect asshole. Scott turns, alarmed. REVEAL Wallace on the other cordless.
WALLACE: Forget what I said earlier. Finish him.
HIPSTER KID: Scott shrugs.
SCOTT: HIPSTER KID
HIPSTER KID: The Hipster Kid waves Scott in.
HIPSTER KID: Second password? Scott gives the slightest shrug.
HIPSTER KID: Scott steps into the elevator. So far so good.
COMEAU: Yeah, their first album is so much better than their first album. Scott pushes through the idiot hordes. SEX BOB-OMB are playing onstage, now using SWEET BRAND amps, YOUNG NEIL on bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song.
STEPHEN STILLS: Scott pauses, looking up at his former bandmates.
SCOTT: What if I want the satisfaction?
STEPHEN STILLS: Well, then you're doomed.
GIDEON GRAVES: Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos Theatre. Somebody get this man a drink! Coke Zero right? A COCKTAIL WAITRESS with a fringe appears with a Coke Zero. Scott takes the beverage and THROWS THE CUP TO THE FLOOR!
SCOTT: I'm not here to drink.
GIDEON GRAVES: I got no beef with you.
SCOTT: What if I have a beef.with you?
GIDEON GRAVES: Are you still mad about that whole thing with the Guild?
SCOTT: You mean 'The League'?
GIDEON: Guild, League, whatever. It's ancient history. Gideon puts his arm around Ramona.
SCOTT: I'll show you how ancient of history it is. Scott gets into a fighting stance. Gideon loses his cool.
GIDEON GRAVES: No use crying over spilt Coke, buddy. The lady made her choice and we're all gonna have to move on.
SCOTT: Well I ain't moving.buddy.
GIDEON GRAVES: You want to fight me for her?
SCOTT: Was that not clear? ( to Sex Bob-Omb ) Was that not clear? Sex Bob-Omb shake their heads. Gideon stands up, flexes.
GIDEON GRAVES: Now why on earth do you want to do that?
SCOTT: Because, I'm in love with her. Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T- shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest.
GIDEON GRAVES: I think this deserves a song. Kim scratches her head with her middle finger before grudgingly launching into a number.
KIM PINE: We are Sex Bob-Omb, we are here to make money, and sell out and stuff. Kim clicks out a fast tempo. Sex Bob-Omb begin to ROCK OUT.
GIDEON GRAVES: Ramona. My cane. Ramona hands Gideon a cane with G-MAN engraved on the handle. He unsheathes a SWORD that could not have fit in there. Scott and Gideon LEAP towards each other.Gideon descends like a vulture and SMASHES the sword out of Scott's hands. Scott hits the ground HARD, rolling to a stop.
SCOTT: Your club sucks, by the way. Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow.
GIDEON: If my cathedral of cutting edge taste holds no interest for your tragically Canadian sensibilities, then I shall grant you a swift exit from the premises. And fast entrance into HELLLLLLL. Gideon raises his sword. Then from above.
SCOOOOOOOOOTT!!!: KNIVES CHAU sails into frame and KICKS the sword out of Gideon's hands. She lands awkwardly, tripping and falling down the side of the pyramid. Gideon chuckles.
GIDEON GRAVES: That is priceless. Scott looks to Knives, both concerned and amazed. She quickly recovers and POINTS a furious finger.
KNIVES CHAU: You'll pay for what you did to him!
GIDEON GRAVES: Listen, Kung Pao Chicken, your old old boyfriend brought this all on himself. He was warned plenty of times. But did he listen? Did he f-
KNIVES CHAU: I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to HER! Angle on a confused RAMONA standing behind Gideon.
RAMONA: KNIVES CHAU
KNIVES CHAU: YOU BROKE THE HEART THAT BROKE MINE! GET READY TO CHAU DOWN! Knives leaps up the pyramid toward a shocked Ramona!
RAMONA: You're kidding right? Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges! Ramona fights defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her.
GIDEON: You can't say I don't know how to put on a show. GIDEON lashes out at Scott. He can barely block Gideon's tremendous blows, distracted by his duelling exes.
RAMONA: What the hell is your deal?
KNIVES CHAU: You stole him with your advanced American slut technology. DUAL DUEL! The fighters weave in and out of each other, throwing blocks and punches, KUNG FU STYLE.
RAMONA: I don't know what you're talking about, I didn't steal anyone. Scott lands a KICK to Gideon's chest, sending him flying off the edge of the pyramid. He then BLOCKS a punch from Knives to Ramona and spins her away, separating them.
SCOTT: Can we please stop all this fighting! Nobody stole anybody. Knives, I dated you and then I dated Ramona. Okay?
KNIVES CHAU: Then you cheated on me, Scott!
RAMONA: You cheated on me with Knives?
SCOTT: No! I cheated on Knives. With you.
RAMONA: Is there a difference?
SCOTT: You weren't wronged? Scott breaks into a flop sweat.
SCOTT: Knives and Ramona stare at Scott.
GIDEON GRAVES: Scottie. You can cheat on these ladies all you want, but you Scott slides off Gideon's sword and falls to the ground.
SCOTT: Ramona appears out of nowhere; fainter than before.
RAMONA: I'm sorry. Dying probably sucks.
SCOTT: You know what sucks? Getting killed by THAT guy. Why him?
RAMONA: It's complicated.
SCOTT: Well, maybe now would be the time to get into it. Seeing as I'm about to die.
RAMONA: Alright. the truth is, it was me who was obsessed. I was crazy about him. But he ignored me. I was more alone when we were together than I ever was on my own. That's why I had to leave. and that's when he started paying attention.
SCOTT: So why go back?
RAMONA: I can't help myself around him, Scott. He just. has a way of getting into my head.
SCOTT: Well, that's legitimately disappointing. I really will leave you alone forever now.
RAMONA: No. I mean, he literally has a way of getting into my head. Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a blinking CHIP implanted on her skull.
SCOTT: That is evil.
RAMONA: He's like that. Ramona covers the chip, self-consciously touching her hair.
SCOTT: So this kinda sucks for everybody, eh?
RAMONA: I'm sorry it had to end this way. We had a good run, I guess.
SCOTT: You can't say I didn't try. I really fought for you back there.
RAMONA: The winds blow harder, Ramona seeming to fade away.
RAMONA: But someone was fighting pretty hard for you back there. Scott's eyes go wide with epiphany,
SCOTT: I wish I was ever as fanatically devoted to anything as that girl is to you. Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand.
RAMONA: I wish I was ever as fanatically devoted to anything as that girl is to you. Ramona slowly dissolve away in the sand.
SCOTT: I feel like I learned something. Which would be great if I wasn't dead. Ramona is gone. Scott slumps to his knees.
SCOTT: So.so alone. DA-DING. The PILGRIM-HEAD appears and rotates around Scott.
SCOTT: We FLASH BACK to Scott swiping the PILGRIM HEAD, then FAST FORWARD through the breakup with Ramona and Sex Bob-Omb. We hear Scott screaming throughout this magical restart.
SCOTT: 96 INT. WALLACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 96 We FAST FORWARD all the way to Wallace's apartment, as Scott enters. He flicks the light on.
SCOTT: .AAAAAAAAAHHH! I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAD TO SEE THAT AGAIN! SOME GUY ( O.S. ) WALLACE ( O.S. ) Turn off the light! Scott flicks the light off. On PITCH BLACK.
SCOTT: Wallace, when my journey began, I was living in an ordinary world. Ramona skated through my dreams and it was like a call to adventure, a call I considered refusing. But my Mentor, that's you, told me if I want something bad enough I have to fight for it. So I did. There were tests, allies, enemies. I approached a deep cave and went through a crazy ordeal, during which I totally seized the sword. Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected! Now I realize what I should have been fighting for all along. But before I do that, I need to ask one final favor of you.
SCOTT: Could you put a robe on and hand me the phone? Wallace flicks on a bedside lamp, hands him the phone.
SCOTT: Toronto. Chaos Theatre. Gideon Tell him Scott Pilgrim is calling.
SCOTT: Hey, pal. I feel terrible about everything. I don't want any hard feelings, so I figure why not be the bigger man and give you a call.
SCOTT: Sorry, what I meant to say is 'I'm coming over to kill you'. Scott hangs up and heads for the door, hardcore.
WALLACE: GO KICK THAT GUY'S ASS! Wallace stands to high five Scott, exposing his junk.
SCOTT: You seen one.
SCOTT: Your hair looks stupid. The Hipster Kid EXPLODES into COINS.
HIPSTER KID: Scott SPLIT KICKS them in the faces, knocking them out.
SCOTT: Scott SPLIT KICKS them in the faces, knocking them out.
COMEAU: Yeah, their first album is so- Scott KNOCKS DOWN Comeau and looks to Sex Bob-Omb.
STEPHEN STILLS: Scott! Let it go.
SCOTT: Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Stephen, the new line-up rocks. You guys sound better without me. Young Neil? You have learned well. From this point forward, you shall be known as 'Neil'. And Kim? Kim looks at Scott, deadpan as ever.
SCOTT: Save it. You're pretentious, the club sucks, I have beef, let's do it. Scott goes straight into fight mode.
GIDEON GRAVES: You want to fight me for her? Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A strange new power overcomes Scott, different than before.
SCOTT: No.I want to fight you for me. Scott reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty T- shirt and pulls a FLAMING RED SWORD from his own chest.
SCOTT: KIM PINE
KIM PINE: WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB, AND WE ARE HERE TO WATCH SCOTT PILGRIM KICK YOUR TEETH Kim drives a hardcore beat. Sex Bob-Omb ROCK THE FUCK OUT. HIPSTERS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM to the BEAT. Scott swings his FLAMING RED SWORD, exploding each attacker into COINS.
IN!: Kim drives a hardcore beat. Sex Bob-Omb ROCK THE FUCK OUT. HIPSTERS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM to the BEAT. Scott swings his FLAMING RED SWORD, exploding each attacker into COINS.
GIDEON GRAVES: Ramona. My cane. Ramona hands Gideon his cane. He unsheathes his SWORD. Scott and Gideon RUN towards each other, LEAPING in the air. They pass in the air and Scott SLASHES. They land on opposite sides of the platform, backs to each other.
SCOTT: How's it going back there?
GIDEON GRAVES: You dick.
SCOTT: Knives! I know you're in here! Don't attack Ra- Knives SAILS through the air and KICKS Ramona in the head SUPER HARD. We hear a METALLIC KLONK. They square off, Ramona staggered, Knives pulling KNIVES.
KNIVES CHAU: Steal my boyfriend, taste my steel. Scott jumps between them, hands held out.
ENOUGH!: Knives tries to go around him. Scott GRABS her wrists. She kicks him in the face.
KNIVES CHAU: No, Scott! This fat ass hurt me and I will have my revenge!
SCOTT: No, Knives. I hurt you. I cheated on you. Knives steps back, stunned.
KNIVES CHAU: You cheated on me Scott?
SCOTT: I cheated on both of you. And I'm sorry. I was a different guy back Knives' frown melts. Scott turns to Ramona.
RAMONA: Never felt better.
SCOTT: Oh, you got a fight alright. Scott steps into a fighting stance. Knives joins him.
GIDEON: Ramona. Are you with me? Ramona looks to Gideon, then joins Scott and Knives and STRIKES A FIGHT POSE, the three of them ready to rumble.
RAMONA: Let's both be girls. Ramona knees Gideon in the balls. Gideon SWINGS his sword at Ramona. Knives whips off her scarf, uses it to wrap up Gideon's sword arm and disarms him. Scott and Knives punch Gideon in the face in a volley of
GIDEON: You made me swallow me gum. That's going to be in my digestive tract for seven years! Gideon throws a series of Wushu moves that give him a POWER UP - his glasses glow, his HEALTH BAR increases. He makes an 'X' with his fingers and a draws a NEW POWER UP SWORD. He cuts big arcs at Scott, Knives and Ramona. They barely dodge him. Scott SPIES his sword and picks it up just in time to BLOCK Gideon's attack. The swords create an 'X'. Ramona KICKS. Gideon BLOCKS, knocking her down. Gideon swings at Scott. Scott ducks. Knives attacks and scores a hit. Gideon hits her back, dropping her. SCOTT ATTACKS. They fence. Gideon spins low. Scott leaps in the air. Gideon spins again and swings upward. Scott blocks with his sword and is sent UP into the air. Gideon jumps after him. They CLASH in the air. Scott's sword SHATTERS.
SCOTT: You're right. I'm not cool enough for Ramona. And you got another thing right. You are blowing up. Right now. Scott spins and BACK HEELS Gideon in the face. Gideon's head EXPLODES, his glasses SAILING down the steps of the pyramid. Then his body follows suit in an almighty-
POOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!: SHIMMERING COINS rain down. Scott and Knives kiss.
YOUNG NEIL: KIM PINE
KIM PINE: There goes our deal.
STEPHEN STILLS: We're still getting paid, right? Kim points to the falling coins.
KIM PINE: There goes our deal.
YOUNG NEIL: Stills jumps off stage and picks up coins. The coin rain continues, silhouetting Scott and Knives in their kung fu poses. They share a smile.
SCOTT: ( CONTINUED ) 99 CONTINUED: ( 9 ) 99
RAMONA: ( CONTINUED ) 99 CONTINUED: ( 9 ) 99
KNIVES CHAU: NEGASCOTT walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona. Fringed hair. Dark clothes. Evil face. Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance.
SCOTT: No. This is something I have to face on my own. The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward to confront his dark side. Scott and Negascott face off. Both take a step forward.
KNIVES CHAU: What happened?
SCOTT: Aw, nothing. We just shot the shit. He's a super-nice guy. We actually have a lot in common. Scott runs his fingers through his hair.
KNIVES CHAU: Your hair.
SCOTT: ( CONTINUED ) 104 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 104 KNIVES CHAU
KNIVES CHAU: It's getting really shaggy. Scott's HAT appears on his head! He looks totally freked.
SCOTT: KNIVES CHAU
KNIVES CHAU: I like it. Knives removes the hat from Scott's head, literally taking his guard down. Ramona sees this and smiles.
SCOTT: You do? Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness. Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives.
SCOTT: Hey. Where are you going? Ramona, hoping to slip away, stops and turns back.
RAMONA: I dunno. I should probably After all that?
SCOTT: After all that?
RAMONA: It's hard, you know? I came here to get away, but the past keeps catching up. I'm tired of people getting hurt because of me. Ramona looks at Knives as she says this.
SCOTT: I think I understand. Snow begins to fall. Ramona straightens his parka tenderly.
RAMONA: I should tahnk you, though.
SCOTT: For what?
RAMONA: For being the nicest guy I ever That's kind of sad.
SCOTT: That's kind of sad.
RAMONA: ( ALMOST LAUGHING )
RAMONA: Well. Bye and stuff.
SCOTT: Yeah. And stuff. She turns to walk off again. Scott watches, then hears-
SCOTT: You earned it. You've been fighting for her all along.
KNIVES: You earned it. You've been fighting for her all along.
SCOTT: But what about you?
KNIVES: ( totally sweet and sad ) I'll be fine. I'm too cool for you She grins and kisses his cheek.
KNIVES: There's someone out there for me. We hear a COUGH - Young Neil sidles into frame behind her. Guitar still in hand. We hear a 2ND COUGH - Nega Scott also sidles into frame. Knives doesn't look back, but urges Scott to-
KNIVES: Go talk to her. Before she's gone. Ramona walks on into the night alone, but then-
RAMONA: You want to come with me?
SCOTT: ( HOPEFUL )
