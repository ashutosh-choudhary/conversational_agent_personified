STARLA: When Darwin said 'fittest,' he didn't necessarily mean the strongest or the most intelligent, or any one trait he merely meant those organisms most well-suited to their environment.
STARLA: We humans think we're more fit, more evolved, because we're smarter. But we're neophytes. We've been around two million years, give or take. The cockroach has been here for 350 million. You tell me who's the more successful species.

STARLA: That's not true Where are you-?
GRANT: INT. HENENLOTTER'S SPORTS BAR - LATER Grant sits at the bar, knocking back a shot of tequila. He's getting drunk. He taps his glass.

CAMPER: Hey, man. You all right?. Dude?. Oh shit.
CAMPER: I think he's d
GRANT: It's taking. my. brain.
CAMPER: Grant's eyes glaze over, and he eases off. He heaves there, momentarily confused. His eyes dart around, as if seeing his surroundings for the first time. Grant stands.
CAMPER: You all right, man?
CAMPER: That might of been a stroke, buddy. You better take it easy.
NEIGHBOR: What were ya', night-fishing again? You catch anything?
GRANT: I caught a little somethin', yeah.

STARLA: He was. considerate. Maybe this is the start of a real change in
MOMENTS LATER: Grant assembles a sandwich at the table. Two pieces of bread and some cheese. He starts putting the meat on. But he can't stop, piling more and more on until he has a little sandwich tower.
GRANT: After contemplating it for a moment, Grant stands and carries off the pile of meat.
LATER: Grant flips through his alphabetically-filed meat: from "BALONEY" through "TURKEY." But he doesn't look satisfied.
GRANT: Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
BUTCHER: Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
GRANT: Sure thing, killer.
BUTCHER: What can I do you for?
GRANT: Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
BUTCHER: How many you need?
GRANT: Well. having us a little dinner party. I'd say. eight. No, no. fourteen.
GRANT: Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
BUTCHER: All the rib eyes?
GRANT: Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings. some pork loins. and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?.

MOMENTS LATER: Grant rolls slabs of beef over the dirty floor and into a SOMETHING skitters across the garage and around the pile. Grant peers around the pile and sees a RAT nibbling on some ribs. He realizes something.
GRANT: You're meat.
GRANT: Welcome home.
STARLA: Grant? Why are there did you put locks on the garage?
STARLA: You drilled into the driveway.
GRANT: Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about. your present.
STARLA: My present?
GRANT: You're my princess, aren't you?
STARLA: I got a super-special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
GRANT: I got a super-special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
STARLA: All right. I have to clean up before dinner.
GRANT: You're meat.
STARLA: Grant snaps himself out of it.
GRANT: Oh, nothin'. Nothin'. See you in a sec.
GRANT: He HEARS a BARKING. Grant turns to see the beagle next door, tied to the tree, YAPPING at him.
STARLA: Roscoe's gone?
BOY: You haven't seen him, have you?
STARLA: I'm sure he'll show up, Tim.
MOMENTS LATER: Grant gathers large fronds and other foliage in his arms.
STARLA: Grant, are you almost ready?
GRANT: Yeah, hon, I'll be right there!
STARLA: What are you doing?
GRANT: You're pretty.
GRANT: Who's that?
STARLA: It's just one of my students, Grant.
TREVOR: What's she see in that douchebag?
BILL: That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
MARGARET: Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt-poor.
TREVOR: Gold-digger, huh?
BILL: Hell, you don't know that, Margaret.
JACK: Bill, you're Chief of police now.
BILL: You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
STARLA: Janene LAUGHS heartily and the two embrace
JANENE: Hey, Grant.
GRANT: Why don't you two catch up? I'll go see what the boys are doing.
STARLA: He's been strange the past couple
BRENDA: Must be fate, us meeting again like this.
GRANT: Well, you might be right.
GRANT: You're lookin' awful pretty.
BRENDA: Shut up.
GRANT: Where's the old half-Mexican?
BRENDA: Took the kids to his Mom's for the
BRENDA: Where you takin' me, you bad boy!
GRANT: Take off your shirt, doll.
GRANT: Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
BRENDA: Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
GRANT: Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
GRANT: Grant unbuttons his shirt as well. As he removes it completely, he turns toward her.
BRENDA: Grant!? What ?!
BRENDA: No, no, we
STARLA: Hey, Bill!
BILL: Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
STARLA: That's not funny.
BILL: Whatcha' doin'?
STARLA: Whatcha' doin'?
BILL: Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
BILL: What you up to?
STARLA: Just checking out the lights.
BILL: Pretty, ain't they?
STARLA: I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
BILL: Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
BILL: There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
STARLA: Oh, yeah?
BILL: Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. I'll get Wally to show me sometime
STARLA: I'll get Wally to show me sometime
BILL: Oh, will you now?
STARLA: Grant, where'd you go?
BILL: Hey, Grant.
GRANT: You ready, sugarplum?
STARLA: Bill watches Grant and Starla head off, as he downs the rest of his beer. Wally walks up beside him.
WALLY: Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
BILL: Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you.
WALLY: Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
BILL: Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
MARGARET: Sir, may I help ?
BRENDA'S HUSBAND: My wife, Brenda. I think something has happened to her!
STARLA: No answer. Starla tries to turn on the lights, but nothing
STARLA: Damn fuse.
STARLA: Again, no one's here. She sees a potted flower on the counter. A green INCHWORM is crawling up the stem, little by little. She stares at it, as if it's a portent.
STARLA: Grant, where are y ?
STARLA: Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your ?
GRANT: Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
GRANT: Don't look at me like that, baby. Please? I'm gonna go get my. prescription filled.
STARLA: I'll get if for you.
GRANT: No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
BRENDA: Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna Brought you munchies.
GRANT: Brought you munchies.
GRANT: Been saving for a rainy day.
BRENDA: Grant, I'm sorry if I did something wrong! I think I gotta I think I should go to a hospital!
WALLY: Grant around?
STARLA: No. He went to the pharmacy.
WALLY: He's got a. rash.
STARLA: He's got a. rash.
BILL: Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?
BILL: Maybe she's ever called the house, or ?
STARLA: No. What.?
BILL: She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
WALLY: Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
BILL: The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
BILL: The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me, we also saw him that night, with mud all over his slacks.
BILL: Have him call me right away, okay?
STARLA: Bill, it's Starla!
STARLA: It's I think you better come over right away I think Grant's sick, he
GRANT: Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
STARLA: Grant, no!
GRANT: I loved you. I loved
STARLA: Grant, you're sick!
GRANT: I wanted you by my side, but you I can't trust you now!
STARLA: Starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her. She SLAMS the table into Grant's head. This hurts and surprises him sufficiently to let Starla get out from under him.
TREVOR: The cops, freaked out, pull their guns. Grant makes a SCREECHING SOUND at them. They SHOOT at Grant, nicking Grant jumps away from Starla, back into the shadows, SCREECHING in anger and pain. Starla falls to the floor.
PASTOR: Our sister. Our daughter. Our mother. Our wife.
PASTOR: And we ask that you keep your light alive in her heart, wherever she may be. We ask all this in your name, Lord. Amen
BILL: I talked to the CDC. They didn't have nothin' on file consistent with Grant's. symptoms.
STARLA: How about Brenda?
BILL: New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
BILL: You all right?
STARLA: She moves away from him.
JACK: Bill spots him, moving quickly toward him.
BILL: Bill, we need to talk!
JACK: Bill, we need to talk!
BILL: 'Mornin', Jack.
JACK: Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
BILL: Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
JACK: Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit
BILL: Don't worry, we'll find him. Anything new?
JACK: How are you going to find him?
BILL: Dude's a half-squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World,
JACK: That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
BILL: Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
SHERRY: Not today, Bill.
JACK: Still, quit that talk! You yourself said it was dark in there! You don't know what you saw!
TREVOR: We saw his arm was all bendy.
JACK: Bastard obviously got lyme disease!
BILL: Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
JACK: Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
BILL: And that makes you look like a I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
JACK: I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
JACK: Well, screw you all for laughin'.
SHELBY: Another ranch attack! Up at the
JACK: 'Ranch a -'? What 'ranch attacks'?
BILL: What do you see? I see a butterfly.
WALLY: What do you see? I see a butterfly.
BILL: I see we're fucked. Three ranches in three days.
MARGARET: So, I think I got it part-way figured. You want to hear it?
MARGARET: So Grant I mean, we're saying this is Grant, right?
MARGARET: Grant kills a cow right about here. See there's the blood, musta slit its neck.
MARGARET: So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
TREVOR: He knocked this'n's head clear over here!
WALLY: Put that down, numbnuts!
MARGARET: So the dogs attacked, somehow he slew 'em all, and he stole off with the cow into the forest.
BILL: He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
TREVOR: Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
WALLY: It's a hundred thousand acres. Be finding a needle in a fuckstack.
BILL: Wally, come on. Trevor and Margaret, get some folks together. I think I know where he's gonna hit next.
BILL: So the night after Grant ran off, a calf went missing from here, the Raglans' ranch.
BILL: Two nights ago, a mare was stolen from this property, run by Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with the cleft palate.
WALLY: Looks like a chipmunk.
BILL: Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
BILL: And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit-storm took place.
TREVOR: I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
BILL: And if he sticks to that pattern he'll be here next. Belongs to a family, the Strutemyers'. Now I know y'all are tired and you've barely seen your families. But we're gonna have to go there tonight, lie low and wait.
REDNECK: Let's get that son-of-a-bitch, Just remember, we don't know what we're up against here. So let's be careful.
BILL: Just remember, we don't know what we're up against here. So let's be careful.
TREVOR: Hey, Bill, we got that grenade we confiscated from them jokers wanted to use it fish for trout?
BILL: Can't hurt.
JACK: I didn't know the Russkies were invading there, folks.
MARGARET: You seen this guy, you'd wished they was.
STARLA: Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
BILL: Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
STARLA: Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him
BILL: He tried to kill you, Starla.
STARLA: He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could
STARLA: Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
BILL: Starla, it ain't
STARLA: It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away. But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening. If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
KYLIE'S MOM: Kylie! What'd you do to your
KYLIE: Kiri Goshima done 'em. She's Looks like Pokemons done 'em to
KYLIE'S DAD: Looks like Pokemons done 'em to
KYLIE: Foreign stuff is classy if you knew something.
KYLIE'S DAD: Oh. There's Jack. I want y'all to stay inside tonight. All right?
JACK: This turns out to be a mountain lion we're gonna look like a damn bunch of idiots.
REDNECK: Didn't know it was date night.
REDNECK: I'll be expecting you toss my salad at the end of all this then, Shut up.
BILL: Hey, Starla, remember that time when you were a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night?
BILL: Starla here's twelve. Guess I was fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what the hell you doing out there?' She tells me she's running away to Hollywood to become a big star. She said she knew I was in ROTC, and she was gonna need a bodyguard. Invited me along.
BILL: I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody can take care of herself, I think it's you. I'm gonna have to How far'd you get?
WALLY: ( to Starla ) How far'd you get?
STARLA: About the bus stop. Ranger Rick here called my dad.
WALLY: Ha! A cop from the get-go! You You fucked up our fame and fortune, Bill Pardy.
STARLA: You fucked up our fame and fortune, Bill Pardy.
BILL: Yeah, maybe I did.
STARLA: EXT. STRUTEMYER RANCH - NIGHT Jack and Trevor watch in amazement as Grant slithers across the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out prey. Jack turns to Trevor, pissed, and whispers:
JACK: You said 'squid'!
TREVOR: It got worse.
WALLY: What we gonna do now, Bill? Cuffs won't even fit on 'im.
BILL: Starla, where you.?
STARLA: Grant turns and looks at her with his half-human eyes. His breathing is loud, raspy, and sick. He sees, in a wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up, their guns at the ready.
STARLA: Grant? It's okay.
STARLA: You're just sick is all. But we'll take you to get help right now. I'll stay by your side, Grant, just like I swore I would. For better or worse. Remember?
STARLA: The posse inch in closer, tightening the circle.
STARLA: Okay, Grant? It's gonna be all
BILL: Fire! Fire!
WALLY: There he is! Over there!
TREVOR: Where'd he go?
MARGARET: We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
REDNECK: I'll kill that asshole what he did to Charlie.
BILL: Starla, get the hell out of here!
MARGARET: Bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him. He falls back; the tentacle slashes inches from his face.
TREVOR: What the hell's that smell?
WALLY: It's something dead.
JACK: It's coming from in there, ain't
MARGARET: Think he's inside?
BILL: It's Brenda. And she doesn't look good. Her weepy little head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is what her body has become. This enormous ball of flesh is nine or ten feet tall. Vestigial fingers protrude from the sides. She is utterly immobile. Her flesh sloshes, slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin. The woman is in great pain. She SOBS. Her mouth and chin are stained with blood.
OLDER COP: Oh, shit!
BRENDA: Something's wrong with me.
WALLY: Uh, yeah.
BILL: Brenda, um.
BRENDA: I didn't want no one to be seeing me like this.
BRENDA: How are my boys, Bill? Are they all right?
BILL: Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's what's happening here, exactly?
BRENDA: I'm so fucking hungry, Bill. I'm so hungry. I just never knew anybody could be so hungry.
BRENDA: Would you mind handing me a piece of that possum there at your feet? Little bit?
BILL: I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
WALLY: What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
OLDER COP: Why's she doing that?!
REDNECK: Her tumors is moving.
JACK: Bill, get her to stop that shit!
BRENDA: It hurts!
BRENDA: Help me!! Help!!
STARLA: Little fuckers are tearing me aparrrr- !
BRENDA: Little fuckers are tearing me aparrrr- !
BILL: He led us here.
BILL: Margaret, cover your mouth!
BILL: Don't let 'em in your mouths!
TREVOR: They wanted us to eat 'em! Why would they want that!?
KYLIE'S MOM: Kylie! You're gonna turn into a plum in there!
KYLIE: Prune, Mom. Plums turn into prunes.
KYLIE'S MOM: I know what turns into what. You got school tomorrow. Finish up in there and get to bed.
KYLIE'S MOM: Time to turn in, ladies.
KYLIE'S MOM: Come on now.
KYLIE'S MOM: KYLIE'S SISTER 1 KYLIE'S SISTER 2 Night, Mom. Night.
KYLIE'S MOM: Sleep tight. Don't let the bed bugs bite.
KYLIE: The parasite winds toward her lips. Kylie goes to grab it with both hands, but it slips through them. The thing slides into Kylie's mouth as she looks down at it.
KYLIE'S VISION: We are RUSHING through some amoebic landscape, PAST microbes and cytoplasm and cells, and to:
KYLIE: Kylie drops the iron. She quickly steps into her clothes lying on the floor. She runs out of the bathroom and INT. STRUTEMYERS' HALLWAY - NIGHT Kylie runs to the stairway.
KYLIE: Mom!! Mom!!!
KYLIE: Emily!! Jenna!!
KYLIE: No!! Nooo!!
BILL: 11-41. We're gonna need paramedics out here right away. We got four men down.
BILL: Shelby, you there?
BILL: Shelby, this is Bill. We got an emergency here.
BILL: Bill steps outside the doorway, to see if he can get reception. Trailing off:
BILL: Starla sees Wally's body on the floor. His skin is white and corpse-like. His mouth is streaked with blood. Starla crouches beside him, and takes his pulse. Her hands are visibly shaking.
MARGARET: Is he alive?
MARGARET: Praise Jesus.
TREVOR: 'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
TREVOR: What the hell were those things?! You ever seen anything like that? You ever heard of anything like
TREVOR: Me neither. And I watch 'Animal Planet' all the fuckin' time!
BILL: No reception out here.
STARLA: Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
MARGARET: That's a long ways. Them worms are out there.
STARLA: I'll keep my mouth covered.
BILL: No. I'll go. The three of you, you wait here. Get these folks, out of the barn. The stench and rot can't be any good for 'em.
STARLA: Be careful, Bill.
TREVOR: It's got to be some Goddamn biological weapons. Government's testin' 'em out on us! 'Cause who gives a shit if Wheelsy disappears,
TREVOR: I hope it ain't contagious. I'll be pissed as hell I turn into a big mollusk. I'll fuckin' sue, I swear to God.
WALLY: Hey, sugarplum.
STARLA: Wally speaks with Grant's cadence.
WALLY: Marriage. It's a sacred bond. Just like you said.
WALLY: I'm sorry 'bout trying to strangle you and all. I lost Lost my head. I didn't want to do none of the things I done. Not kill them pets. Not make Brenda a womb. But it's my nature, ain't it? How can you blame a one for actin' according to his nature?
WALLY: I wanted to tell you what was going on. But I didn't - didn't think you'd love me no more. I never knew. love, Starla, I
MARGARET: Wally turns and stares at her like some angry animal.
MARGARET: You all right?
MARGARET: Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
TREVOR: Trevor's staring at something. Margaret follows his eye line. Jack and the Older Cop are sitting up, staring at her, just like Wally.
KYLIE'S DAD: Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on
KYLIE'S MOM: Open the door, sweetie. I know we don't look so good, but your mommy and daddy love you.
KYLIE: Get away!!
KYLIE'S MOM: Now, Kylie, there's no excuse why not to be with your family. This is family fun day, isn't it?
BILL: The Strutemyers stop, mid-swing. They turn toward him.
BILL: What's ?

KYLIE'S DAD: Well, hello there, Pardy.

OLDER COP: The Older Cop buries his fingers into her neck. The puffy flesh comes off easily; it's soft, almost creamy. He stuffs the flesh into his mouth, eating it.
STARLA: Trevor, come on.
STARLA: What'd you do to her?!
JACK: There you go, sugarplum! Why you choosing camps 'fore you hear
STARLA: Why are you talking like Grant?!
WALLY: 'Cause I am Grant!
JACK: You swore to honor and obey
STARLA: Don't come any closer. I'll. You ain't gonna shoot me! You always needed me to protect you! You for damn sure ain't got the balls to
WALLY: You ain't gonna shoot me! You always needed me to protect you! You for damn sure ain't got the balls to
TREVOR: Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit!
BILL: Shit. Ammo's in the trunk.
BILL: Trevor! Margaret!
TREVOR: They killed Margaret!
BILL: ( into radio ) Where are you?!
KYLIE: Go! Go! Please!
BILL: My friends are still in the forest.
BILL: We need their weight.
BILL: Bill rushes toward the trees of the forest.
BILL: Come on!
OLDER COP: EXT. ROAD AWAY FROM FOREST - MOMENTS LATER The police car pulls up and out of the forest. The car is in bad shape. Steam rises from the smashed grill.
BILL: Nothing. STATIC. Everyone notes this, worried. Bill tries again:
BILL: Shelby, you there?
SHELBY: You dig that rat out of the hole?
BILL: Listen, you got any reports of. I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
SHELBY: Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
BILL: Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog -
SHELBY: Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog -
BILL: Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All
BILL: Are you nodding?
SHELBY: I can't hear when you're nodding.
BILL: I can't hear when you're nodding.
SHELBY: We'll be there in ten minutes.
BILL: We'll be there in ten minutes.
KYLIE: The worms are in their brains.
STARLA: She's right. We saw one one came out of Wally's head.
TREVOR: Yeah. Sort of his eye, it came out there
STARLA: Kylie, how do you
STARLA: Kylie, how do you know that?
BILL: Kylie, honey. Please.
KYLIE: I was in the bath. It tried to go inside me and I for a minute I became it.
BILL: The worm?
KYLIE: I got it out.
TREVOR: What are they?
KYLIE: Part of him.
BILL: ( pause ) Mrs. Grant's husband.
KYLIE: Mrs. Grant's husband.
KYLIE: But not always. I was He was. other stuff too.
STARLA: What other stuff?
TREVOR: He's a fucking Martian?!
BILL: A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
KYLIE: For real it looks like a needle. Its real face. But it always gots He goes from place to place, worlds. planets. killing 'em. He takes over half of what's alive and eats the other half. Till they're gone.
KYLIE: Now he's here. He went in Mr. Through a wound on his stomach?
STARLA: Through a wound on his stomach?
KYLIE: He took him over. His body. His his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before - amoeba-things, and rhino-things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
STARLA: And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one When one sees you they all see An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living So the way to stop this thing is to stop Grant?
KYLIE: When one sees you they all see An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living So the way to stop this thing is to stop Grant?
STARLA: An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living So the way to stop this thing is to stop Grant?
BILL: ( to Kylie ) So the way to stop this thing is to stop Grant?
BILL: The car slows, and comes to a stop.
BILL: Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us I got to leave my post.
BILL: Do it.
MOMENTS LATER: The foursome walks down the road, toward the city. Starla and Bill are in the lead.
BILL: Hey, Starla.
BILL: Was always curious why you. married Grant in the first place. Just never seemed outta love.
STARLA: I know what people say, Bill. I. Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
STARLA: Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
BILL: Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
STARLA: My father, he was he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart-mouthing. he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things. well, they got worse.
BILL: When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
STARLA: That wasn't a good night, no.
BILL: I'm sorry.
STARLA: Anyway, Grant rolls in one day. I fill his tank with like an eighth- a-gallon as usual. And he notices my lip's all swollen up, and starts asking me how it happened. I don't know why I chose then, why Grant I guess I saw an opportunity. And I told him everything, first time I told anyone. Grant was furious. He picked up a tire iron, walked straightaway into the garage, and beat my father half to death. You say it's not about love, Bill. But that was the closest thing to it I ever knew.
STARLA: Grant asked me to marry him a few weeks later. I felt. safe with
STARLA: After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
BILL: Hell, Starla. I always regretted
TREVOR: Don't worry, kid. Pretty soon, we'll be in town, everything'll be
STARLA: What's that?
TREVOR: They musta hit a deer. Probably got out to see if it's okay.
BILL: Fuck me.
TREVOR: Trevor aims his pistol at a DEER jumping toward him. He SHOOTS, misses. The deer knocks him down. The deer stomps his feet, rearing up and down on Trevor's ribs, almost like a little dance. The deer tears at Trevor's sleeve with decidedly carnivorous teeth, forcing him into letting go of his gun.
STARLA: Get in!
BILL: Trevor looks out the window, watching the deer fade away behind them.
TREVOR: When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
BILL: SHELBY ( O.S. )
BILL: Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right Don't worry, Chief.
SHELBY: Already on our way.
DISEASED TOWNSFOLK: Bill and Trevor limp up behind Starla, pulling her toward a door on the back wall.
BILL: Come on.
TREVOR: What the hell are we going to do?!
BILL: Just block the doors, any way you
TREVOR: Goddamn snakes!!
STARLA: This is stupid.
BILL: What are you doing?!
STARLA: We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
BILL: He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
STARLA: He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
BILL: No, Starla! No!
BILL: Bill grabs Trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him away from them. But Trevor SCREAMS in agony; the liquid has made his flesh too soft. His entire body splits apart like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them.
BRENDA'S HUSBAND: You like Pardy better'n me? That's who you want to screw now?!
STARLA: Grant. Please.
STARLA: I'm sorry. I know I haven't behaved how you how you want. I know. Don't. hurt. me.
STARLA: We need. to. talk.
STARLA: Not here, though, okay? Not all of you. I'm not used to I want to talk to your face, Grant. Your more real face. Your
PASTOR: We've surrounded the town, you prick! Ain't no way outta here!
STARLA: Starla can see into the shambles of a kitchen from here.
STARLA: Grant? We should talk.
STARLA: She starts to ascend the stairs. They CREAK beneath her INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT Bill peeks out the window, careful not to be seen by the diseased humans around Grant's. Bill can see Starla in the home next door, walking up the stairs.
STARLA: Hey, Grant.
STARLA: You did some real interesting decorating here.
STARLA: Starla walks by a window.
STARLA: Look, the sun's starting to come
STARLA: Sorry. I didn't I didn't know you wanted it dark.
STARLA: You like these memories, huh, Grant?
STARLA: You like being called Grant, don't
STARLA: I think you do. You really do. You like being Grant. Like when we danced. And when you. made love to me here on the bed. Remember that?
STARLA: I know you've been alone, Grant. Almost forever. From here to there to there to here, there's never been another one for you.
STARLA: Grant. Grant, I could help you. Be with you the way you want. See, I want to live. I've never had much use for this world, not really. You and I, together, we
STARLA: You don't trust me, I know. That's why I brought you someone, Grant.
STARLA: It's Bill. He's in the house next door. Just look.
STARLA: See? I brought him here for you! As an offering! To prove I love you more than him!
STARLA: Now, Bill!! Kill the motherfucker!!
GRANT: It EXPLODES.
STARLA: Bill smiles too.
BILL: EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY Bill and Starla hobble down the town center. The leather bag is slung over Bill's shoulder. Everything around them is dead: the victims who were being feasted on, as well as the various diseased. The torture is over, but no life remains.
BILL: Starla, over here.
STARLA: We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up Yeah. Good.
BILL: Yeah. Good.
CASHIER: Comes to 32.87.
BILL: There you go.
STARLA: Shit. I- I forgot. I wanted to get aspirin.
BILL: I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or
STARLA: Bill smiles, and goes back inside. Starla moves quickly with the bag of stuff toward the car.
BILL: We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
STARLA: Bill turns to smile at Starla. She's aiming the .38 at his face. Tears are streaming down her cheeks.
BILL: Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody
STARLA: You took Bill.
BILL: It's my nature.
STARLA: And this is mine.
