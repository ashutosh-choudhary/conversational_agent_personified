SHOOTING DRAFT: FADE IN: OPEN ON: MONTAGE OF VARIOUS SHOTS OF SAN FRANCISCO - DUSK Over this we hear a recording of Jack Kerouac's poem, San Francisco which is accompanied by a BE-BOP trio. Kerouac's poetry coincides with the various shots of San Francisco. We come to a sign for Jack Kerouac Street. We PAN OVER to "THE CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE" and continue along to the ALLEYWAY where there is a large high-contrast black and white sign depicting Jack Kerouac in his famous "I'm looking into the distance, having a brilliant thought" pose. CHARLIE MACKENZIE, in his late twenties, wearing a flannel shirt and torn jeans, walks INTO THE FRAME, right in front of the picture of Jack Kerouac and inadvertently strikes the exact same pose. We PULL BACK to reveal that Charlie has a bag of garbage in his right hand, which he deposits in the alleyway. We FOLLOW Charlie into.
CHARLIE: ( sotto )
O' SCOTLAND: YOUR SUCKLED TEET OF SHAME
CUSTOMER: Do you have the book On The Road by Jack Kerouac? Do you have a copy of On The Road by Jack Kerouac?
TOURIST: Do you have a copy of On The Road by Jack Kerouac?
TOURIST: EXT. CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE - NIGHT Charlie puts the "CLOSED" sign on the door and proceeds to walk home.
HIS STREET: He approaches a 3-story Victorian home, in which he has an apartment on the second floor, he notices a light on in his window. A CRASHING sound from within.
HANDS: taking papers out of a desk drawer.
CHARLIE: carefully opening the front door and then gingerly closing it. He reaches for a baseball bat in a nearby umbrella stand. Sound of BREAKING GLASS from his apartment upstairs.
CHARLIE: finishing off the last two steps nearing the front door of his apartment, bat raised above his head ready to swing.
THE HANDS: clasp a jewelry box on the top of the dresser and stuff them into a dufflebag; the jewelry is followed by CD's.
CHARLIE: pushing open his apartment door in a mock SWAT maneuver, then stealthily stalking toward the sound of the intruder in the bedroom. He stubs his toe on a spring loaded doorstop making a loud metal VITTSWINGGGG's sound. He freezes, THE BEDROOM where the HANDS, freeze.
THE BEDROOM: where the HANDS, freeze.
CHARLIE: Like a coiled jungle cat ready to pounce, waits two beats. then springs Samurai style into.
THE BEDROOM: He freezes.
CHARLIE: Sherri! What are you doing?
SHERRI: I'm leaving you.
CHARLIE: Oh, thank God. I thought you were robbing our own home, because frankly, that's insane. I mean, what could you possibly gain by robbing your own home? I don't mean to meddle, but isn't it better to rob other peoples' homes? Start accumulating their wealth as opposed to just reaccumulating your own wealth.
SHERRI: That's not funny, Charlie. I'm really
CHARLIE: What?! Just because we had a fight last night?
SHERRI: We've had a fight every night for two months. Ever since I brought up the subject of marriage, you've found fault with everything I do. Why couldn't we have gotten married, I'm too young to get married. I'm only twenty-nine and a half. We love living together.
CHARLIE: ( beat ) I'm too young to get married. ( begins putting her things back ) I'm only twenty-nine and a half. We love living together.
SHERRI: It's been two years now. I need something more.
CHARLIE: See, Sherri, this is frustrating for me, okay. When we first started going out I thought we agreed that we weren't the sort of people who got That's like saying we're not the sort of people who are going to grow old. We're not going to fall into that "growing old" trap. Face it, you've got a problem with commitment, Charlie. Take a look at your other girlfriends. Every time you get close to a commitment there's something wrong with them.
SHERRI: That's like saying we're not the sort of people who are going to grow old. We're not going to fall into that "growing old" trap. Face it, you've got a problem with commitment, Charlie. Take a look at your other girlfriends. Every time you get close to a commitment there's something wrong with them.
CHARLIE: Hey, I broke up with them for good What about Sandy?
SHERRI: What about Sandy?
CHARLIE: Sandy was an alcoholic.
SHERRI: No-no-no. You thought she was an alcoholic. She just drank more than you drank. What about Jill?
CHARLIE: She hated my family.
SHERRI: You thought she hated your family. Nobody hates your family. Everybody loves your family. What about Julie?
CHARLIE: She smelled like soup.
SHERRI: What does that mean?
CHARLIE: She smelled exactly like Campbell's Beef Vegetable soup. She was dirty, physically dirty.
SHERRI: Well, Charlie, I wonder what you're gonna say were my problems? Are you gonna tell your friends that I was a junkie, that I wasn't supportive enough or that I smelled like relish? Charlie, I loved you. It could have worked out. Think about it.
CHARLIE: Tony, Teenage Fan Club, they're Scottish you know?
TONY: I had that dream again.
CHARLIE: I had that dream again.
TONY: Oh, is that the one where you suspect that a fat man in a diaper, on a lazy susan has interfered with your plans for the evening?
CHARLIE: No, but I have had that one. No, in this one I'm in love.
TONY: And I say to myself, 'I've finally found somebody that I'm truly comfortable with.' You know when you're so comfortable that you'll let them put makeup on you to see what you would look like if you were a girl. Anyways you know what I do in the dream next?
CHARLIE: And I say to myself, 'I've finally found somebody that I'm truly comfortable with.' You know when you're so comfortable that you'll let them put makeup on you to see what you would look like if you were a girl. Anyways you know what I do in the dream next?
TONY: You propose?
CHARLIE: ( after a pause ) No. I die.
TONY: But Charlie, you're a normal suburban guy at heart, from a normal suburban family. Didn't you tell me you always wanted to get married and have a Yes, but, I'm afraid, okay? There are seven main rites of passage in a man's life. Birth, first day of school, last day of school. Marriage. Kids. Retirement. Death. I'm at marriage. I'm two rites of passage away from death.
CHARLIE: Yes, but, I'm afraid, okay? There are seven main rites of passage in a man's life. Birth, first day of school, last day of school. Marriage. Kids. Retirement. Death. I'm at marriage. I'm two rites of passage away from death.
TONY: I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
TONY: Christ. It's the cops.
CHARLIE: Tony, you are a cop.
TONY: I know. Isn't it awful? I work with those guys. They're assholes.
TONY: Salve zio mio.
UNCLE: Allora? Che catzo fai, Charlie?
CHARLIE: Hi, Uncle Giuseppi.
UNCLE: Tony, come' stai bello il tuo pappa e' in galera per la terza volta.
UNCLE: I'll have the waitress bring you What did your uncle say?
CHARLIE: What did your uncle say?
TONY: He says my Dad's back in jail again.
CHARLIE: Ah, I'm sorry, man.
TONY: You know, it's funny I don't even feel related to my parents anymore. I feel like your mom and dad are more like my parents. I feel more Scottish than Italian.
CHARLIE: Tony Spiletti, I don't think you could get more Italian than that. Unless of course your name was Tony Italian Guy.
CHARLIE: I'm so bummed. Sherri was great, wasn't she? I'm an asshole, aren't
I?: You've got to help me get through this night.
TONY: You've got to help me get through this night.
CHARLIE: You've got to help me get through this night.
TONY: You've just got to get back on the
CHARLIE: Waitress, I'm sorry, there seems to be a mistake. I ordered the large
CHARLIE: ( to the girls ) Do you think these cups could be larger? They're practically bowls.
CHARLIE: I feel like I'm having Campbell's Join us in a cup of coffee? There's enough room?
TONY: Join us in a cup of coffee? There's enough room?
GIRLS: The girls come over.
SUSAN: My name's Susan and this is June. We think you're funny.
TONY: My name's Tony. This is my friend Look, Tony, I'm going home. See you later, girls.
CHARLIE: Look, Tony, I'm going home. See you later, girls.
TONY: You really don't understand, do you? When a girl comes over to your table and says, 'I think you're funny.' It means you've pretty much been given the keys to the city. Charlie, this is big.
CHARLIE: Perhaps you've confused me with someone who gives a shit. Here's what's gonna happen, Tony. We'll end up going out with them tonight, maybe even home with them. Well go out for two months. Soon she'll move in, we'll be happy, She'll want more of a commitment. I'll be terrified and I'll do something to ruin it. Just like I did with Sherri.
JUNE: Poor, guy. He seemed so nice.
TONY: ( talking, choked up ) I just broke up with somebody as well. She left me high and dry.
CHARLIE'S FACE: He looks out and is struck by an idea and begins to write.
CHARLIE'S FACE: Again he looks out, finds his inspiration and continues to IN THE JOURNAL CHARLIE'S FACE A gentle tear rolls down his left cheek. He pauses, then finishes off the stanza.
CHARLIE'S FACE: A gentle tear rolls down his left cheek. He pauses, then finishes off the stanza.
HARRIET: ( angry ) Goddamn shoplifter. ( conscious of Charlie's presence; holding up bloody meat ) But I got him! ( smiles ) You're next.
CHARLIE: ( backing out the door; terrified ) I've come at a bad time.
HARRIET: No stay!
CHARLIE: No, no, really. Obviously you've got things you have to do. You've got to dismember the rest of his bloody torso. Dig a makeshift shallow grave. Cover the body with quick lime. Really so much to do, so little time and I'm only in the way here, I'm just gonna go. Good luck.
HARRIET: ( referring to meat in hand ) Oh, this! Oh, no, this is what he stole. This isn't a piece of him or anything. This is Icelandic Shank.
CHARLIE: I bet it goes well with a nice Chianti. Fittfittfitt.
HARRIET: ( laughs ) Can I help you?
CHARLIE: Yes. Do you have haggis?
HARRIET: Yes, we do. It's over here in our Scottish Cuts section. One?
CHARLIE: Yes! I've never been able to find haggis anywhere, except at my parents' house. They're Scottish.
HARRIET: ( ringing up his order ) That'll be fifteen, seventy-nine. Will there be anything else?
CHARLIE: Yes. I know it's a long shot, but you wouldn't by any chance happen to have any Prussian Venison?
HARRIET: Now where in the world would I get Prussian Venison?
CHARLIE: ( calling up ) Mom, Dad, I'm here.
ALL: ( singing )
STUART: ( noticing Charlie ) Come give your old man a kiss or I'll kick your teeth in.
MAY: Charlie, put on Charlie Pride, would ya? Oh, I love Charlie Pride.
STUART: May, shut it.
CHARLIE: Hey, William.
WILLIAM: ( on his stomach on the floor; watching
TV ): Hey, Charlie.
STUART: SCORES! MAGIC GOAL!
TONY: Aye magic.
STUART: Let's have a look at the re-play. William, move your head. Look at the size of that ooy's heed. I'm not kidding. It's like an orange on a tooth pick.
MAY: Stuart, you're going to give the boy a complex.
STUART: I'm not kidding. That's a huge noggin'. It has it's own weather system. It's a virtual planetoid. Heed! Move!
MAY: Is that enough potatoes, Charlie?
CHARLIE: Enough to recreate Devil's Tower in "Close Encounters".
STUART: ( sniffs the air ) Do I smell haggis?
CHARLIE: Aye, you do.
MAY: ( taking it ) I'll put it in the frig.
CHARLIE: Dad, what are you doing to Tony now? Why do you abuse his mind like this?
STUART: That's the latest report from Lyndon H. LaRouche, outlining how the Queen and the Rothschilds masterminded the Soviet overthrow, so that they could reclaim lands they had annexed during the Holy Roman Empire.
TONY: ( goading Charlie ) You know a lot of this makes sense.
CHARLIE: I think you're suffering from the Stockholm Syndrome, where the hostages start to relate to their captors.
STUART: Listen, Sonny Jim, it's a known fact there's a society of the five wealthiest people in the world, called the Pentaverate, who run everything and meet three times a year at a secret country mansion in Colorado, known as "The Meadows."
CHARLIE: ( sarcastic ) And that's obviously why we haven't heard about it in the newspapers.
STUART: ( inappropriately angry & loud ) That's right. They fuckin' own the papers, smartass. And everything else. Why do you think Scotland's not been able to get independence? Because the Queen the Pentavirate and those English dome heads in West Minster won't have it.
CHARLIE: Who are the other members of this The Queen, the Rothchilds, the Gettys, the Vatican, and Colonel Sanders before he went tits up. Oh, I hated the Colonel with his wee beady eyes. And that smug look on his face.
STUART: The Queen, the Rothchilds, the Gettys, the Vatican, and Colonel Sanders before he went tits up. Oh, I hated the Colonel with his wee beady eyes. And that smug look on his face.
CHARLIE: Dad how can you hate "the Colonel?"
STUART: Because the Colonel puts an addictive chemical in it that makes you crave it fortnightly.
CHARLIE: Interesting. coo-coo
MAY: Would anyone like a juice? Charlie, did I tell you, we bought a Juice A Juice Tiger?
CHARLIE: A Juice Tiger?
MAY: Aye, it's a juicer. It's part of my National Enquirer, Garth Brooks diet. Would you like potato juice?
CHARLIE: Thank you, no.
MAY: Sherri's late.
CHARLIE: Yeah, uh, Sherri and I broke up.
MAY: Oh, you didn't. Sherri was the daughter your father was never able to give me.
CHARLIE: I'm just not ready for marriage. I'm twenty-nine and my poems haven't even been published yet.
STUART: But it's not just the poetry is it son? You're afraid if you get married you'll lose your muse. Look at me, I was a strapping young butcher, at the height of my creative powers. When it came to de-boning a side of beef, there was nobody that could touch me. Then I married your mother. And people would still stand in awe as I filleted a shoulder of lamb.
MAY: Maybe it's just as well not to get married, look at the news. Where did I put it?
STUART: Heed. Move that melon of yours into the bathroom and get the paper for your mother.
CHARLIE: That's not news, Dad. That's bullshit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with that What are you talking about? It's the fifth highest circulating paper in the United States, I'll have you Oh, here it is. Mrs. X. The Honeymoon Murderer. She marries men under fake identities, and then murders them. She killed some German martial arts expert, and some plumber named Ralph Elliot. Her whereabouts are unknown.

STUART: Scores! Two nil. Magic!
TONY: Ah, beautiful goal. We HOLD on the TV set.
STUART: ( singing Rod Stewart's song )
MAY: Ah, you're steaming. See you later, Mrs. MacKenzie.
TONY: ( pulling away ) See you later, Mrs. MacKenzie.
MAY: Oh, you've turned into a sexy Italian See you later, mom. See you later, Dad.
CHARLIE: See you later, mom. See you later, Dad.
STUART: Fine. Go! You've stayed your hour.
THE HALLWAY: where they find William sitting on the stairs waiting for
WILLIAM: Take me with you.
MAN: Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to
MAN: ON THE PAD Charlie writes.
THEMSELVES: FOR A CHANCE TO BE TOUCHED BY YOUR FINGERS CHARLIE'S FACE She's on his mind.
WILLINGLY: FOR A CHANCE TO BE TOUCHED BY YOUR FINGERS CHARLIE'S FACE She's on his mind.
CHARLIE'S FACE: She's on his mind.
HARRIET: ( spotting Charlie in the crowd ) Oh, hi haggis, right?
CHARLIE: It was a big hit.
HARRIET: ( finishing up with a customer ) I remember you told me you were Scottish, but do you really like No. I think it's repellent in every way. In fact, I think most Scottish cuisine is based on a dare.
CHARLIE: No. I think it's repellent in every way. In fact, I think most Scottish cuisine is based on a dare.
HARRIET: ( to the next customer ) Can I help you? ( to Charlie ) Sorry, I'm really busy.
CHARLIE: Look, um, my dad's a butcher, do you need a hand?
HARRIET: Well, actually, Yes.
HARRIET: Can you get me four Belgian porterhouses? Do you know what a porterhouse looks like?
CHARLIE: I'm meat literate.
CHARLIE: I'll check. You want blubber, right?
CUSTOMER: We see Charlie's POV of an Eskimo with a "lower forty-eighth" The Eskimo exits, there are no customers left.
CUSTOMER: My parents are coming to town. You know how parents are. They'll drive you nuts.
HARRIET: Look, I'm really grateful. Can I offer you some meat as payment? Please, help yourself to some meat.
CHARLIE: I'm trying to be a vegetarian.
HARRIET: Trying to be a vegetarian?
CHARLIE: Yeah, the problem is I really love I think the meat industry invented hot-dogs to stop people from becoming vegetarians. There's got to be something I can do to repay you.
HARRIET: I think the meat industry invented hot-dogs to stop people from becoming vegetarians. There's got to be something I can do to repay you.
CHARLIE: You could take me to a nice romantic
CHARLIE: ( sniffing the relish ) This reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.
HARRIET: I hate talking about old Then let's not and say we did.
CHARLIE: Then let's not and say we did.
HARRIET: ( she laughs ) That was easy What a nice guy. You've probably never done a mean thing in your life.
CHARLIE: You'd be surprised.
HARRIET: I'd like to hear. Name me something bad you've done in your life.
CHARLIE: Are you kidding me?
HARRIET: No. Did you ever steal anything? You ever hit someone?
CHARLIE: Well, I've been in fights. Let me Not one bad thing, Charlie?
HARRIET: ( as Charlie thinks ) Not one bad thing, Charlie?
CHARLIE: Tell me something bad you've done. And it better be bad. I mean, evil.
HARRIET: How evil?
CHARLIE: Really evil. Like how many people have you brutally "Brutal" is such a subjective word. I mean, what's brutal to one person might be totally reasonable to
HARRIET: "Brutal" is such a subjective word. I mean, what's brutal to one person might be totally reasonable to
CHARLIE: This just reminded her of that scene in "Brian's Song".
HARRIET: Actually, he just proposed to her. Those are tears of joy.
HARRIET: The man and woman smile and nod.
MAN: Danke, Fraulein.
CHARLIE: You're very smart. It's a shame I'm going to have to destroy you.
HARRIET: Do bright women intimidate you?
CHARLIE: No, not at all.
HARRIET: Really, what do you look for in women you date?
CHARLIE: ( thinks ) Well, I know everyone always say "sense of humor", but I'd have to go with breast size. ( she laughs ) How about you? In a guy.
HARRIET: Income of course, and then.
CHARLIE: Me likey how you thinkey.
HARRIET: I'll make us some tea.
CHARLIE: Hey, you know what this apartment needs? A really large oversized poster of Atlantic City.
HARRIET: I used to live there. That's where I had my first supermarket job.
HARRIET: It's North-South. For health reasons. See. I had this friend, he was a martial arts expert. Anyways, he used to sleep North-South. I don't know. It's a martial arts thing and it just sort of became a habit with me.
CHARLIE: ( walking into living room ) You know Scotland has it's own martial arts. It's called FUCKU. It's mostly head butting and kicking people when they're on the ground.
HARRIET: No. No. Not for me.
CHARLIE: No. No. Not for me.
HARRIET: Who for then?
CHARLIE: Who for then what?
HARRIET: Well, you looked at your watch and said it wasn't late for you. I wondered who it was late for.
CHARLIE: Not me. No, Sir. Not here. Maybe it is late.
CHARLIE: Look, the truth is, yes, I had a great time, and I'd like to kiss you, but if we do kiss, then we'll kiss on the couch and if we kiss on the couch, then we'll kiss in the bedroom, and once you're in the bedroom Well, the thing is, I always rush it. And this time I feel like maybe I should wait. Maybe we should let it build naturally and grow, instead of just immediately spending the night together.
HARRIET: I want to spend the night together.
CHARLIE: ( sold ) I have no problem with that.
HARRIET: Yes! Yes!
HARRIET: Yes Ralph. I will. Ralph. Now now Ralph!
CHARLIE: ( waking her ) Harriet.? Harriet.? ( as her eyes open ) You were having a dream, or.? You kept saying the name Ralph.
HARRIET: Ralph. I heard you say it.
CHARLIE: Ralph. I heard you say it.
HARRIET: ( sleepily ) That's odd. Just today I was thinking about, her. She's a friend.
CHARLIE: ( starting to leave ) Is she nice ? Ralph.
HARRIET: Yeah. She's great.
CHARLIE: You know. with this drought in California total strangers are urged to shower together.
ROSE: Go away.
CHARLIE: Oh God. I'm sorry. Jesus. Excuse me.
CHARLIE: Hi. I'm really sorry. I must have scared the. I'm Harriet's friend, Charlie, and you must be. I'm Harriet's sister, Rose. And this is Harriet's note.
ROSE: I'm Harriet's sister, Rose. And this is Harriet's note.
ROSE: ( reading ) 'Dear Charlie, I didn't want to wake you, make yourself at home, thanks for making me smile.' Harriet.
CHARLIE: That's a very nice note.
ROSE: I'll make you some breakfast.
CHARLIE: Gee, I'd love to but I'm running What would you say to blueberry pancakes, bacon, fresh squeezed grape juice and Kona coffee?
ROSE: What would you say to blueberry pancakes, bacon, fresh squeezed grape juice and Kona coffee?
ROSE: I'm sorry I didn't have any of those other things.
CHARLIE: Hey, that stuff'll kill you while Fruit Loops are light and probably reasonably high in Fiber. I like Apple Jacks too.
ROSE: Got 'em.
CHARLIE: So this is your apartment?
ROSE: Yes. She's been here the past three months. ever since she came back from Miami. I used to visit her occasionally. She didn't speak of She told me about a martial arts guy and there was some discussion about She spoke of them.?
CHARLIE: ( shakes his head, no ) She told me about a martial arts guy and there was some discussion about She spoke of them.?
ROSE: She spoke of them.?
CHARLIE: She spoke of the martial arts guy and screamed about Ralph.
ROSE: ( affectionately ) Well, you know Harriet.
CHARLIE: Actually, I really don't.
ROSE: ( puzzled ) But you did have sex with her?
CHARLIE: ( taken aback ) Yet you still don't know her. ( contemplates this ) See, that's the problem with sex. It's not very revealing.
ROSE: Yet you still don't know her. See, that's the problem with sex. It's not very revealing.
CHARLIE: My, look at the time.
ROSE: ( after a pause ) You should be careful, Charlie.
CHARLIE: I am. usually. I just. You should know, this is very unusual that I would do this so soon, in this day and age particularly, but. We just really hit it off. We did. And.
ROSE: I'm gonna go now. I won't tell Harriet that anything happened.
CHARLIE: But. nothing did happen.
ROSE: Exactly. Or she would be jealous. And when she gets jealous, we both know what she's capable of.
CHARLIE: No, we don't. You do, like I said, I just met her.
ROSE: You'll be okay, Charlie. Just be
FRED: Hey, Charlie. How you doin'?
CHARLIE: Good. Good. Look, Fred. You got a lot of girlfriends, right? You know any girls named Ralph?
FRED: Ralph? Gee, Charlie. Isn't that a guy's name?
CHARLIE: Well, not necessarily, but. Never mind. Thanks, Fred.
CHARLIE: Hey Penny, I wanted to ask you you know some girls named Ralph, right? I mean, that's a girl's name also, isn't it?
PENNY: ( confused ) I don't think so, Charlie. Uh.
CHARLIE: ( walking away ) Forget it. Thanks.
ALCATRAZ: We open on the LOUD BANGING of a CELL DOOR. We find our tour group in the holding area. The PARK RANGER is a beefy man in his late fifties and talks with emotionless, military They are led out. We see that Alcatraz is a sinister place. Cold and unforgiving. The Park Ranger leads them to the center of a cell block.
PARK RANGER: Hello, everyone I'm a park ranger and I will be leading you on the tour. All the park rangers here at Alcatraz were at one time guards, myself included. My name is John Johnson, but everyone here calls me Vicki. Will you please follow me?
TONY: You're glowing, Charlie. The man's in love.
CHARLIE: Sssh. Stop it. I'm trying to listen.
PARK RANGER: This is the main cell block area. Home to such famous criminals as Al Capone, Micky Cohen, Joseph "Dutch" Critzer, and Robert Stroud, the famous Bird Man of Alcatraz. Follow me,
A CELL: PARK RANGER
PARK RANGER: This is the cell for solitary confinement, that over the years has come to be known as Times Square.
TONY: So did you and Harriet?. you know.
CHARLIE: ( grinning ) Sssh I don't want to talk about it.
TONY: With that look, you don't have to talk about it. The grin alone could get you five to seven years.
CHARLIE: Tony, get your mind out of the gutter. All you need to know is that she's a sweet, kind and loving person.
PARK RANGER: Now this is something none of the other tour guides will tell you. In this particular cell block Machine Gunn Kelly had, what we call in the prison system, a "bitch." And one day, in a jealous rage, Kelly took a makeshift knife, or "shiv," and cut out his "bitch's" eyes.
CHARLIE: Look, what can I tell you. I'm smitten. I'm in deep smit. I dunno. I just don't wanna talk about it, because then I start analyzing and that's not good for me.
TONY: Good. I think that's good. Just let it happen.
CHARLIE: Exactly. That's what's gonna be different this time. Something strange happens, let it go. It's not my business. Like Ralph. She says Ralph in her sleep.
TONY: Who's Ralph?
CHARLIE: I don't know who Ralph is. Moreover, I don't want to know.
TONY: PARK RANGER
PARK RANGER: And as if blinding his "bitch" wasn't enough retribution for Kelly, the next day he and four other inmates took turns pissing into the "bitch's" ocular cavity.
CHARLIE: ( beat ) Tony, I'm happy. Don't let me screw this one up.
ROSE: Did you have a nice date last night?
HARRIET: Rose, I don't really
ROSE: He disturbed me while I was naked in the shower this morning.
HARRIET: Yeah, he stayed over?
ROSE: I didn't mind. Charlie and I laughed about it over breakfast.
HARRIET: That's good.
ROSE: He said you had great sex last night.
HARRIET: He did? He seems really stuck on you. I hope for you that it lasts.
ROSE: He seems really stuck on you. I hope for you that it lasts.
HARRIET: Rose he's a sweet, kind and loving person. We like each other, but I don't want to think any further. It's taken me a long time to get back to dating, and I want to take things real steady this time.
ROSE: Well, you can trust me not to tell him anything.
HARRIET: He was quite happy not to talk about the past.
ROSE: I did a sketch of him.
HARRIET: ( looking at the picture ) That's good.
ROSE: Think I've caught him?
HARRIET: The eyes are good.
ROSE: Charlie really liked it.
HARRIET: It's a good likeness.
ROSE: Boy, I really hope it works out.
HARRIET: Rose, I don't wanna screw this one
CHARLIE: Hey, uh. Ralph.?
DELIVERY GUY: ( turning around ) I'm Gilbert.
CHARLIE: HARRIET'S DOOR - MOMENTS LATER She opens the door enough to see that she is wearing only a blouse that goes below her hips. She looks fantastic. He hands her the poetry books.
HARRIET: ( teasing him ) Charlie, they're beautiful. I'll put them right in water.
CHARLIE: You look great.
HARRIET: I was just getting dressed. What do you think of this skirt?
CHARLIE: ( pulls her close ) I'd leave it off.
HARRIET: So then you think I could go to a poetry concert like this?
CHARLIE: Let's forget the poetry concert. It's already been nine hours since I last made love to you.
HARRIET: ( smiling; walking away ) Come on we're meeting your best friend. I wanna look good. The second I go to the ladies room he's gonna tell you what he really thinks of
HARRIET: Come on, Charlie. We have to be there in fifteen minutes.
CHARLIE: ( following her into bedroom ) Fifteen minutes. Perfect.
CHARLIE: ( through door ) Maybe later.
CHARLIE: ( startled )
ROSE: ( after a pause ) To warn you, Charlie. ( after a pause ) There are just some things you should know, about Harriet.
CHARLIE: About Harriet?
ROSE: About her past.
CHARLIE: I don't wanna know. I mean, look everyone has some skeletons in their past. I only care about the future. Not the past.
ROSE: Here's the thing. I may have to tell Tell her what?
CHARLIE: Tell her what?

HARRIET: Actually, Miami.
CHARLIE: Was that before Atlantic City, or Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic City was recent. I didn't care for Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers and lounge singers.
HARRIET: Oh, that was years ago. Atlantic City was recent. I didn't care for Atlantic City. A town full of gamblers and lounge singers.
DESK SERGEANT: Hey Charlie!
CHARLIE: Is Tony back there?
CAPTAIN: O.K., Tony. Do you have the K673 form completed yet, that street vendor incident on Powell Street?
TONY: ( really bummed ) Yes, Captain.
CAPTAIN: Tony, do you mind my saying that you seem a little down?
TONY: Captain. It's about my work. About being a policeman.
CAPTAIN: Tony, if there's anything wrong, I'm here to listen.
TONY: I know. And that's what's irritating, you're too nice.
CAPTAIN: Too nice!?
TONY: Yes, You're my captain for gods sakes. You should be constantly on my case, like the captain on Starsky and Hutch. Once a week you should routinely haul my ass into your office, accuse me of being a maverick and complain to me that you're sick and tired of defending my screwball antics to the Well, as you may know, Tony. I don't report to a commissioner. I report to a committee, some of whom are appointed, some elected and the remainder co-opted on a bi-annual basis. A quorum
CAPTAIN: Well, as you may know, Tony. I don't report to a commissioner. I report to a committee, some of whom are appointed, some elected and the remainder co-opted on a bi-annual basis. A quorum
TONY: Police work should be all about running around, following up crazy hunches that turn out to be right, going out on a limb.
CAPTAIN: Well Tony, I've never seen it that way. For me police work is all about following procedure and remaining accountable to the general public.
TONY: ( exasperated ) Captain! When I joined the police force, I thought I was going to be Serpico and unfortunately I ended up being Toma. I would have settled for That's interesting Tony. I'm perturbed that you should be so disillusioned.
CAPTAIN: That's interesting Tony. I'm perturbed that you should be so disillusioned.
CHARLIE: Hey, Tony, I gotta talk to you.
CAPTAIN: Oh, hello, Charlie. Look, I'm in the way here. You guys probably have something you want to talk about, and Tony, if you've still got stuff you want to sort out, please, you know where the suggestion box is.
CHARLIE: Nice guy. Hey, what's up?
TONY: I'm having doubts about being a cop again. It's not like how it is on cop shows. All I do is fill out papers and reports.
CHARLIE: Let me get this straight, your Captain hasn't threatened to have you up on charges so fast you won't know what hit you?
TONY: No! He's never once said to me that he was going to "throw the book at me so hard it'll knock my ass from here till Tuesday." Anyways what's
CHARLIE: Have you heard of this case? Mrs. X? She murders her husbands on their honeymoons and then changes her identity and marries again.
TONY: I never heard of it. So what?
CHARLIE: Curious, that's all. I read about it, and. I think I'm dating Mrs. X.
TONY: ( after a pause ) Two words, Charlie. Get therapy. They have doctors that deal specifically with this illness.
CHARLIE: Everything's adding up, Tony. One of the victims was a martial arts expert. Last night at dinner, she put a martial arts move on my dad.
TONY: There about twenty thousand people in San Francisco who are martial arts experts. Should I arrest all of them too?
CHARLIE: If they also say Ralph in their sleep I think it'd be a good start. Ralph Elliot. A plumber from San Francisco. Missing since his You're just getting scared. Like the dream, you feel Harriet could be the one, so you start to suspect her of things, 'cause deep down you're scared that if she is the one, you'll marry, and marriage to you is death.
TONY: You're just getting scared. Like the dream, you feel Harriet could be the one, so you start to suspect her of things, 'cause deep down you're scared that if she is the one, you'll marry, and marriage to you is death.
CHARLIE: Hey, don't analyze my dreams, okay? They're my dreams. Analyze your own It's not a marrying thing, Tony. It's a murdering thing. Harriet lived in Atlantic City, right? Well so did this guy, right around the same time she left town.
TONY: ( reading article ) "Larry Leonard, a crooner who made a name for himself for being able to sing in six different languages the song "Only You". ( putting paper down ) Does she know the song "Only You?"
CHARLIE: I don't know. It hasn't come up yet.
TONY: Charlie, move past it. You're running your life by the National Enquirer.
CHARLIE: ( defensively ) What? It's the fifth highest circulating newspaper in the United ( taking paper back ) Mrs. X. Please. Look it up.
KATHY: There's no record of any deaths. All three of these guys were reported missing around the time of their honeymoon, but so were the wives. No pictures of any of the brides. For all we know they just picked up and moved away.
CHARLIE: And Ralph Elliot, too?
TONY: Charlie, you're talking about three guys over a seven year span. That's hardly news. No deaths. Elopement in this state, as of this day, is still not illegal.
CHARLIE: ( re: the article ) Yeah well murder is. And this article says that these men were murdered by the same woman.
KATHY: Mr. MacKenzie, we've found that, most National Enquirer articles are actually based on our own police reports. They take the facts and fabricate a story around them.
TONY: It's true, Charlie. You gotta realize that. I mean, personally, I would lie to you, but Kathy. has this crazy notion of always telling the You feel better now?
CHARLIE: It guess so. It's just. if I had a photo of Harriet, I could show it to the relatives or friends of Mrs. X's victims to identify her.
TONY: Charlie, listen to me! There is no Mrs. X! Drop it! Okay?
ROSE: ( thrilled ) You're back. But Harriet's not here Maybe I could wait.
CHARLIE: Maybe I could wait.
ROSE: Sure. That would be fine.
CHARLIE: Inside? I was hoping.
ROSE: ( letting him in ) I'm glad you asked. I didn't want to be so forward. I mean, if you're waiting inside, then you feel obligated to entertain me and keep up the conversation just to be polite, and really your head might be totally elsewhere and then there's the chance that you would really want to talk and it's me who'd be busy, but in an attempt not to be rude, I sit there and listen to some story that you don't really want to tell and I don't really have time to hear. You know?
CHARLIE: I couldn't agree with you more.
ROSE: I think about a lot of things.
CHARLIE: Look, if you have work to do, you go right ahead. I mean, to tell you the truth, I'd love to see your work.
ROSE: Okay! What would you like me to do?
CHARLIE: No, I don't want to see you work. I was talking about your work. Your photographs. That one that I saw was so, wonderful, and.
ROSE: Harriet's far more talented than I Well, I'm sure it's so subjective anyway and. Rose, show me your photos.
CHARLIE: Well, I'm sure it's so subjective anyway and. Rose, show me your photos.
CHARLIE: Hey, these are some interesting photos here. Very impressive. Nice shots of Sauselito and. some good bondage shots. A lot of people wouldn't think to mix the two subjects, but they're really a natural together. Hey, you wouldn't happen to have any pictures of Harriet by chance, would Well, I don't think she'd wanna do this sort of.
ROSE: ( re: her cards ) Well, I don't think she'd wanna do this sort of.
CHARLIE: No, no, not that. Just, in general some photos. Any little snapshot would do.
ROSE: I doubt I'd have any. Harriet hates being photographed. Rose did I see Charlie's car out in front?
ROSE: We're in here, Harriet.
HARRIET: ( walking in ) What are you guys doing?
CHARLIE: ( covering up ) Oh, nothing. Just looking through some of Rose's work.
ROSE: .Charlie wanted a photo of you.
CHARLIE: And that. That too.
HARRIET: Why of me, Charlie?
CHARLIE: Well, sentimental reasons. Something to remind me of you when we're not
HARRIET: There, can you remember that?
CHARLIE: Okay, it's just, I was gonna give one to my parents, too, and. Another time would be fine. It's hardly a matter of life and death.
NEWS ANCHORMAN: ( ON TV ) In the news tonight, regarding a Beverly Hills Jeweler, Morris Cohan, who died last week, police are now suspecting that Morris's partner, Lawrence Sachs, may have murdered him with an untraceable poison.

CHARLIE'S BATHROOM: Harriet comes into the bathroom and lays the empty glass down on the counter.
HARRIET: I'm gonna take a quick shower.
CHARLIE: Harriet, where did the shake go?
HARRIET: What do you care? I drank it. You could have at least tried it. You make me feel bad sometimes, Charlie. I don't know why.
HARRIET: Sorry. I'm a little sensitive. You didn't want to drink my milkshake. So what right?
NEWS ANCHORMAN: ( ON TV ) Regarding the murder between the two partners, we talked to Toxicologist Dr. Show on the issue.
NEWS ANCHORMAN: ( ON TV ) Doctor, is it possible that one could be poisoned with no trace at all?
DOCTOR SHOW: ( ON TV ) Certainly. There are plants that grow very commonly in our own backyard that could easily be fermented into poison. Take for instance the.
CHARLIE: ( getting nervous; blocking out TV ) Harriet, why don't we shut the light ( ON TV ) Really? And how easy it that to do?
NEWS ANCHORMAN: ( ON TV ) Really? And how easy it that to do?
DOCTOR: ( ON TV ) Scarily enough, quite simple. You merely take the.
CHARLIE: ( blocking out the TV again ) Maybe we should turn the light back on. Yeah that's better.
HARRIET: Charlie, what's the matter?
CHARLIE: Well, it's just. The TV. You can't even watch the news these days without getting I know, Charlie. And it's not just that. Look at the things people are doing. Partners killing each other. I mean, you hear a story like that, and. who can you really trust these What do you mean?

CHARLIE: What do you mean?
HARRIET: It's like, have you ever stood with someone at the edge of a cliff, or the edge of a subway platform, and you think, just for a split second, "What if I pushed him?"
CHARLIE: Well, I don't really take the subway ever, so.
HARRIET: I'm just making a point of how many times we trust people with our lives. I mean, look at us. If you didn't trust me, you would never be able to fall asleep.
CHARLIE: Why do you say that?
HARRIET: Look at you, you're sleeping. Look how vulnerable you are. I mean, I could do anything at that point.
CHARLIE: ( nervous ) What could you do?
HARRIET: ( sweet and innocent ) Anything. You're lying on your side, asleep, I could. stick a needle in your ear.
CHARLIE: ( grabbing his ear at the thought ) I'm just making a point of what a good relationship we have. Goodnight,
HARRIET: I'm just making a point of what a good relationship we have. Goodnight,

He had a small studio, and every year at Christmas he'd take a picture of me and Rose and put it in the window on a little card that said "Seasons Greetings." Awful pictures. It's like. I could see his pain in my face. Anyway, me and my sister worked with our "childhood issues" in different ways. She became a photographer and I became phobic about having my picture taken. It's quite a family.

CHARLIE: Yeah, it's a little Seals and Croft. I have a habit of sabotaging relationships, and there were a million times during me and you that I could have blown this, and I just thank God that I didn't.
CAPTAIN: O.K., Spiletti, I got word from upstairs that you been pokin' your nose into that Ralph Elliot case.

CHARLIE: The gas station guy? Why would the gas station guy chase us.
HARRIET: I don't know, Charlie. I guess for not paying.
CHARLIE: What do you mean not paying? You didn't pay him for the gas.
HARRIET: I forgot to pay. I didn't want to be away from you for any longer.
CHARLIE: So, you just left.
HARRIET: Yes. And you're an accomplice.
CHARLIE: I'm not sure I understand.
HARRIET: Look, Charlie, don't you get it? We're a team.
CHARLIE: ( going with it ) I can play that game. I'll get the next gas station. Like Bonnie & Clyde.

CHARLIE: What are you talking about? You're gonna be a great Mom. I know you It's not that, Charlie.
HARRIET: It's not that, Charlie.
CHARLIE: What then?
HARRIET: You're gonna laugh.
CHARLIE: Tell me. Of course I'm not gonna laugh. Kids is a big thing. It's hard. I'm sure I have the same fears.
HARRIET: If we have kids, Charlie, things happen. Kids are healthy and fine, and some aren't, and I don't know if I could live with myself if I gave birth to a child with webbed feet.
CHARLIE: Webbed feet?
HARRIET: You're laughing.
CHARLIE: No, I'm not laughing.
HARRIET: You think that's silly?

HARRIET: Don't go, Charlie.
TONY: ( flashing his badge ) Excuse me, Sir, I'm with the San Francisco Police Department. I'm on official business and I'm afraid I have to commandeer your vehicle.
MAN: ( unfazed ) What do you mean no?!
TONY: What do you mean no?!
MAN: I happen to know for a fact that you don't have the power to commandeer my vehicle.
TONY: This is true. Please can I commandeer your vehicle?
MAN: Well, where are you going?
TONY: To The Dry Creek Lodge.
MAN: I'll give you a lift.
TONY: Well, I don't want a lift, I really want to commandeer the vehicle. Please just let me commandeer the vehicle.
MAN: Why don't you just let me drive you there? Really, I don't mind, it's on my way.
TONY: You're not going to bend on the commandeering thing are you?
MAN: Well, if we get stopped will you at least let me say that I commandeered the vehicle, but I let you drive?
TONY: Well, if we get stopped will you at least let me say that I commandeered the vehicle, but I let you drive?
MAN: I'm uncomfortable with that.
TONY: All right.
MAN: All right.
HARRIET: I heard you on the phone before, Charlie. There's something I've got to tell you.
CHARLIE: ( frightened ) Harriet, I.
HARRIET: I've been married before.
CHARLIE: I already know.
HARRIET: About my husbands?
CHARLIE: Yes. And I was meaning to have a word with you. We could get an
HARRIET: ( screams )
CHARLIE: Aaaaah, Rose, I never thought I'd be so glad to see you.
CHARLIE: ( going to the phone ) Maybe the phones are working again by now.
CHARLIE: 'Dear, Harriet. I just can't handle the commitment. I'm leaving you.' Signed, 'Charlie.'
CHARLIE: What the hell is this? I didn't write
CHARLIE: What the fuck?!
ROSE: Charlie. Why did you marry Harriet? I warned you not to marry her, didn't I? I warned all of them. But none of them listened to me. They all went ahead and married her. She's the pretty one. Where's Harriet? What have you done with my sister, Harriet?
CHARLIE: Nothing, Rose.
ROSE: If you've done something to my sister, Harriet, I swear to God I'll kill
HARRIET: ( from the closet ) Where are you, Charlie? What's going
MAN: Could you stop doing that please?
CHARLIE: Call the police!
CHARLIE: Call the police!
ROSE: ( mostly to herself; slurring most words ) Charlie, did you like your note? I thought it was pretty accurate. I did all the husbands' notes. I can forge anyone's handwriting, I can write in anyone's style. See, I'm an artist. Harriet isn't an artist. Sure she could get a husband, but she could never have done this. And you know what I'm most proud of?
CHARLIE: What's that, Rose?
ROSE: Harriet never knew. She thought they all just left her. I protected her. She's my sister.
TONY: ( shouting ) ( from closet ) Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet. I'm in here.
HARRIET: ( from closet ) Tony, is that you? It's me, Harriet. I'm in here.
HARRIET: Tony, Rose is trying to kill Charlie. They're out on the ledge.
TONY: ( not believing ) Get on the floor and put your hands behind your back.
HARRIET: Sure, anything. You've got to save
HARRIET: Look! It's Charlie!
TONY: Nice try.
HARRIET: I swear to you. It was Charlie. Look! Now there's Rose!
TONY: No you don't.
HARRIET: I beg you. Look! It is Rose.
TONY: Oh no, not again. Aaaaah! Rose.
REVERSE ANGLE: Mr. Levenstein is in a Viking outfit. Mrs. Levenstein is in full Norse Regalia.
TONY: I hate to bother you on your honeymoon, Charlie, but.
CHARLIE: Thank God. I'm sorry I doubted you, but I thought you were the killer, but you were acting pretty strange?
HARRIET: I thought you were going to leave me, like the others. Thank God they were just murdered. I thought they were always leaving me.
CHARLIE: MARRIED MAN MOST MERRY AND IN CONCLUSION THIS POEM SUCKS.
MARRIED MAN: MOST MERRY AND IN CONCLUSION THIS POEM SUCKS.
