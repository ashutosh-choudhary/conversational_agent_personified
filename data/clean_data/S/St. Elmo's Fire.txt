BILLY: Sorry, babe. sorry.
WEHDY: We'll be right behind you! They all move toward Alec's car except Kirbo, who sud- denly notices'someone. He becomes mesmerized as he falls away from the group and starts back for the hospital.
KIRBO: Dale?. Dale Biberman? She hesitates, somewhat puzzled.
KIRBO: You don't remember me.
DALE: I do, but I'm trying.
KIRBO: Kirby Kreager. You were a senior when I started Georgetown.
DALE: Kirby. It's been four years. How are you?

KEVIN: It's still sticky.
WENDY: Oh, God. Wait 'til my father hears the car is totalled.
BILLY: I'm gonna get you a new car, Wendy. Everyone screams in disbelief as they go into St. Elmo's. Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin holds the door open, but no one thanks him.
KEVIN: You're welcome. You're welcome. A young, burned-out UNDERGRAD ( CLAYTON ) follows.
KEVIN: You're not welcome, Clayton. How's Baroque. Thank you very much. How's life after school?
CLAYTON: Baroque. Thank you very much. How's life after school?
KEVIN: Like getting slam-dunked against a brick wall, thank you very much.
CLAYTON: College is the last womb. Got a cigarette for a lowly undergrad?
KEVIN: If you tell me the meaning of life?
CLAYTON: Life? Life's like acne. It has to get worse before it gets better.
ALEC: Wally! You let undergrad punks at our tables???
WALLY: Relax, Alec. they've only been there ten minutes.
ALEC: Yeah, well, we've been here for four years. Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin and Billy ( still with sax around his neck ) take their usual chairs as Kirbo drops off a large pitcher of beer.
BILLY: Hey, I need a real drink. Kirbo is long gone. Kevin pours.
KEVIN: Waiters are like cops. Never around when you need one. Kevin and Alec begin bouncing quarters from the edge of a table into their beers obviously some ritual.
BILLY: Will somebody get me a screwdriver?
JULES: And a hammer.
ALEC: You know what it means to have a suspended license for drunk driving on your record?
BILLY: Yeah, Al. It means I won't ever be able to be a cop in D.C. Hey, Wend, you're not angry are you?
WENDY: No, I'm not angry.
KEVIN: Never trust a woman who says she isn't angry.
WENDY: You better call your wife, Billy. Billy reluctantly leaves as Jules laces into Kevin.
JULES: You're the one who's so angry these days. I thought writing for the Washington Post would make you happy.
KEVI N: Writing obituaries is not writing, Jules. All my characters die in the and. I'd like to write something about the meaning of life for a change.
LESLIE: You'll get your chance, Kevin. Alec suddenly spots TOMMY BANCROFT, an older version of Alec, across the room.
ALEC: Hey, Tommy.
JULES: The meaning of life, Kevin, is fun, good times and a little H-U-M-O-R. Don't you enjoy anything anymore? Like girls?
KEVI N: I enjoy being afraid of Russia. It's a harmless fear. Makes America feel better and Russia gets an inflated sense of national worth from our paranoia. Excuse me, I have to call in my latest epitaphs to the death squad. The presses are waiting. He gets up and leaves the table, passing Kirbo.
KIRBO: Did you see her at the hospital? Dale Biberman?
KEVIN: 9 BILLY ON PHONE 9 Well, honey, I kinda had a car accident. What? Stop shouting. I know I don't have any insurance. Aren't you even gonna ask if I'm Billy adjusts a framed photo on the wall of him, Alec, Jules, Wendy, Kevin, Leslie and Kirbo in their graduation caps and gowns.

BILLY: Here's Kevin, he wants to say He hands the phone to a more than reluctant Kevin and moves toward the YOUNG WOMAN at the bar.
BILLY: Hey, Wally. a double screwdriver. He joins the Young Woman who is eyeing his sax.
BILLY: So, you believe in premarital sax?
WEND Y: Will you both give Billy a break? He lost his job today.
LESLIE: The job Alec got for him?
JULES: You didn't give him any money, did A little.
WENDY: A little.
Â¢ JULES: I thought you were going to take definite steps to change everything in your life that is not working.
WENDY: That doesn't leave much left.
LESLIE: I better break this to Alec gently before he finds out the wrong way and destroys his political career by murdering Billy in front of fifty witnesses. She leaves as Jules looks to Wendy.
JULES: Wendy, this is all too destructive.
WENDY: Life in the-fat lane.
JULES: You're not fat.
WENDY: My thighs are fat. And no diet works. The only way to lose weight on your thighs is amputation.
JULES: You have to amputate Billy the Kid.
WENDY: I know, but I can't.
JULES: I don't get it.
WENDY: Me, either.
YOUNG WOMAN: So, what line of work are you in?
BILLY: Me? I'm a very important drinker! So how 'bout we cut outta here?
BILLY: That's okay, honey. This face seats five. Alec appears.
ALEC: Billy, may I see you, please. Billy follows as Leslie alerts Kevin and Kirbo.
BILLY: What's up, Al?
ALEC: May I see you over here, please. Billy joins him. Alec grabs him and shoves his head in the toilet.
ALEC: Why didn't you tell me you blew another job?
BILLY: For some insane reason I thought you'd take it badly. Kevin and Kirbo rush in.
KEVIN: Don't drown him, he's a father. Alec releases Billy who comes up with his hair wet and gives Alec a major shove.
ALEC: That's right, you are a father and when are you gonna grow up?
BILLY: Like this was real mature, Al? They all start to laugh. Alec softens.
ALEC: I just got pissed off 'cause I had to pull so many strings to get you that job.
Â¢ BILLY: Working for Senator Pomerantz was not for me. Billy looks at himself in the mirror.
ALEC: Sorry, Billy.
BILLY: That's all right. You couldn't help yourself. You're an asshole. Besides, the wet look is in. He shakes his head, showering them with toilet water.
KEVIN: Why do they put ice cubes in the It tastes better.
KIRBO: It tastes better.
LESLIE: If we could find the money it would be better to get the longer sofa. Alec enters in his underwear, brushing his teeth.
ALEC: Tommy Bancroft said I could start working on weekends for Hodges. No pay at first, but a way toward big dough. They wrap themselves around each other, kissing.
LESLIE: Isn't Hodges a Republican?
0 C: Â¢ 15 ALEC 15 ( KISSING HIM )
LESLIE: ( KISSING HIM )
ALEC: You want the longer sofa?
LESLIE: - I want you.
ALEC: I'm going to buy you a red nightgown with satin and lace.
LESLIE: And rubber and leather.
ALEC: Yeah, leather. He opens her shirt and smothers her with love.
LESLIE: Your breath is so sweet. Wait, let me get the babykiller. She starts for the bathroom.
ALEC: Come on. Let's just do it. We're getting married soon.
LESLIE: Not so soon.
ALEC: Let's take a chance. Russian And guess who has to carry the bullet around for nine months. There is a KNOCK at the front door.

E R: 15 LESLIE 15
ALEC: Who else could it be. Jules, of course, afraid to stay in her new apartment alone and she's spending the night again.
JULES: So this crummy welfare hospital called and remember I told you about my father's second wife. My The one who used to lock you in the closet all the time?
LESLIE: The one who used to lock you in the closet all the time?
JULES: She gambled away all the money she got out of my father, is on her I deathbed and she put me down as next of kin.
LESLIE: But what about your father?
JULES: Unreachable somewhere in South Africa with his new wife, who it turns out is only three years older than me. And if I don't reach him, guess who's going to end up paying for that old witch's funeral. Is there some insane irony to this or I'm sure your father will take care of everything.
LESLIE: I'm sure your father will take care of everything.
JULES: Sure, just like he takes care of everything else, including not showing up for my graduation. In the background, Alec has brought in their mattress and some sheets and a pillow.
JULES: Thanks, Alec. You're still my Indiana Jones. Always coming to my rescue.
ALEC: I just know better than to try and break the umbilical cord between two old roommates. Good night, Leslie kisses Jules and goes into the bedroom with Alec. Jules takes another belt of vodka.
KEVIN: TAKE IT. TAKE ANOTHER LITTLE PIECE OF MY HEART NOW, DARLIN'. Kirbo enters carrying his bike, and Kevin immediately hides the photographs in a straw basket and becomes his sophisticated self.
KEVIN: Quick, what's the meaning of life?
KIRBO: Dale Biberman. Kevin looks puzzled as Kirbo hangs up his bike.
KIRBO: The girl I fell in love with when we were freshmen. Remember, I met her at that big fountain on main campus? The one that says 'Knowledge, Art, Religion, Life'. she was sitting on the 'Life' side and she smiled at me.
KEVIN: You took her to one movie! That's not love, it's infatuation! Kirbo searches madly through records strewn on the floor.
KIRBO: . Getting married. becoming a Killing his roommate for removing Janis Joplin for the soundtrack from Manhattan???
KEVIN: Killing his roommate for removing Janis Joplin for the soundtrack from Manhattan???
KIRBO: And having the right girl smile at you. She has the whitest teeth I've ever seen. "RHAPSODY IN BLUE" fills the room. Kevin begins gathering up his endless pieces of paper, notes, etc.
KEVIN: If you think I'm going to live through another year of finding poorly written, unmailed love scratchings around this apartment.
KIRBO: I found her again. It's fate. It's true love. I have her hospital schedule!
KEVIN: Love is just an illusion created by lawyer-types like yourself to perpetuate another illusion called marriage to create the reality of divorce and the illusory need for divorce lawyers. Did you know there are more people in law school right now than there are lawyers on the planet?
KIRBO: You're just bitter, 'cause you haven't had sex for a long time.
KEVIN: No wonder. The sexual revolution? Who won?
KIRBO: It's the only illusion that counts.
KEVIN: Says who?
KIRBO: Anyone who's ever been in love.
KEVIN: Love stinks. He moves into the bedroom, closing the door on Kirbo.
JULES: You should have bought the red dress. Red drives men mad. As two college guys hit on Jules she flips her red cape.
JULES: I have a mad man in my life You have to put some kind of distance between you and Billy.
WENDY: I have a mad man in my life You have to put some kind of distance between you and Billy.
JULES: You have to put some kind of distance between you and Billy.
LESLIE: Jules is right. Kevin and Kirbo join them.
WEHDY: It's easy for both of you. Men are just a game for you Jules.
JULES: Trivial pursuit.
WEHDY: And of course you and Alec are.
LESLIE: Thanks for the pressure, guys.

WEND Y: How'd you do?
BILLY: I'm an official pollster, thanks to Alec. Everyone applauds.
ALEC: ( KISSING LESLIE )
BILLY: You're a god, Alec.
JULES: How 'bout bloody Marys on me at St. Elmo's? Everyone cheers except Alec.
ALEC: I gotta get back to work.
KIRBO: Since when do you work on Saturdays?
LESLIE: Since he started volunteer moonlighting for Senator Hodges.
KI RBO: What is the three-year president of Georgetown's Young Democrats doing working for a Republican?
ALEC: Moving up, Kirbo. As most of the others boo and hiss playfully, CAMERA FINDS Billy talking to Wendy. Reaching in his pocket, he gives her a toy car.
BILLY: I told you I'd get you a new car. I'm goin' ultimate on this gig, Wend. Gonna pay you back for everything. Let's celebrate tonight.
WENDY MI: What about Felicia and the baby?
BILLY: Hey, come on, it's Saturday night. Let's party out. Let's go ultimate. Could he mean sex? Love? What she's been waiting for?
WENDY: Okay. Why can't I say no to you?
JULES: What do you think?
KEVIN: Very subtle and very pink. Must have cost some subtle bucks.
JULES: Why do you think God invented credit for fabulous people like me? Fix us a drink. She disappears into the bedroom.
KIRBO: Why, Dale? How nice to see you Kirby, what brings you back here? Nothing serious, I hope.
DALE: Kirby, what brings you back here? Nothing serious, I hope.
KIRBO: Oh, no. just tying up some legal loose ends for my friends.
DALE: Excuse me. I'm late.
KI RBO: Ah, funny running into you again. I noticed there's going to be a Woody Allen festival and I thought maybe we.
DALE: I don't get to the movies much anymore. I've got to go. She is moving away.
DALE: Sure. That would be nice sometime. She is moving quicker.
Â¢ KIRRO: Wednesday? How about Wednesday? Dale is gone.
LESLIE: A whole community within itself. Right near Lockheed. Open some wine.
KEVIN: Looks like it could be put together with Leggo blocks. You design this?
.LESLIE: I did all the mechanicals for one of our senior architects and I think he's going to promote me to the design staff. Kevin is fighting with a ridiculous wine opener.
KEVIN: Maybe you could design a corkscrew that actually works. Everything in this apartment comes from Scandinavia. They don't even have wine in Naturally Leslie opens it in a flash.
KEVIN: Do you think my attachment to Alec is unnatural?
LESLIE: No, I think mine is. We've only just started to live together and he's already pushing for 'the Well, since you fell in love with a Democrat and now he's a Republican, I think all bets are

LESLIE: How do some women do this every night of their lives and not go They are insane. Wives, husbands, children, love, marriage, relationship. It's all insane.
KEVIN: They are insane. Wives, husbands, children, love, marriage, relationship. It's all insane.
LESLIE: That's what I'm afraid of. Did I tell you that my perfect sister and her perfect husband are getting a perfect divorce-?
KEVIN: I have the perfect cure. Stay away from love. He finds the butter and puts some on her hand.
LESLIE: You must have been in love, once. You like hot peppers?
KEVIN: Doesn't Alec hate them?
LESLIE: Insurrection. Now, come on, Kevin, you must have been in love with somebody, sometime.
KEVIN: Once, in junior high. I played guitar in a group and fellin love with our singer who did 'We've Only Just Begun' as sweet as Karen Carpenter. I got high on cheap champagne and pledged my love. Next day she ran off with the bass player named Rocky and I traded my guitar in for a battered Underwood On which you will type your way to being one of the most important writers in America.
LESLIE: On which you will type your way to being one of the most important writers in America.

KEVIN: I can't seem to organize any of my thoughts into anything of any Maybe you need to stop thinking so much and fall in love again.
LESLIE: Maybe you need to stop thinking so much and fall in love again.
KEVIN: Love stinks. The door opens and Alec arrives home.
ALEC: Hi, guys. He kisses Leslie.
KEVIN: Rough day with the right wing, Alec hands Leslie a red box. She opens it excitedly and finds a black lace nightgown. She screams as Alec heads for the kitchen.
ALEC: Try it on. Leslie makes naughty eyes at Kevin and disappears into the bedroom.
ALEC: Leslie has to marry me, soon.
KEVIN: Why, you pregnant? Kidding. What's your 'marriage' hurry?
ALEC: When you have a serious relationship, Kev, you'll find out the problem with living together: it's too easy.
KEVIN: Maybe for you and Leslie. You have the perfect relationship.
I ALEC: I mean, it's too easy to get out of. You either build to something bigger like marriage or one day you could make a mistake and the person you were living with is Alec takes a bite of dinner and cringes.
ALEC: I'm going to kill myself.
KEVIN: They're only peppers, Alec.
ALEC: I can't believe what I just did. I innocently go to buy the nightgown and this amazing blonde salesgirl starts coming on to me. we wind up doing it standing up in front of a three-way mirror in the dressing He lies down on the floor.
ALEC: If Leslie would just marry me, I know I wouldn't do stuff like that it would be a legal violation.
KEVIN: As opposed to tonight's standing violation. You think marriage is going to make you faithful?
ALEC: The idea of two people spending their lives together was invented by people who were lucky to make it to thirty without being eaten by dinosaurs. Marriage is obsolete.
KEVIN: The idea of two people spending their lives together was invented by people who were lucky to make it to thirty without being eaten by dinosaurs. Marriage is obsolete.
ALEC: Dinosaurs are obsolete. Marriage is still around. Leslie screams from the bedroom.
I S: This is obscene. I love it. Alec dashes into the bedroom. As he opens and then closes the door, Kevin sees a flash of Leslie looking absolutely ravishing in the nightgown. As they SCREAM and PLAY, Kevin, feeling very alone, stirs the burning 33 EXT. BAD NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT ( LATER ) 33 talking to passing car.
BLACK HOOKER: You want a date.? Hi. you want a date. Kevin passes quietly and she ignores him.
KEVIN: Why don't you ever ask me if I want a date?
BLACK HOOKER: 'Cause I thought you were gay.
KEVIN: Why would you think I'm gay?
BLACK HOOKER: 'Cause I never see you with a girl. And you always look real strange.
KEVIN: Well, just for your information. I happen to be in love with someone but they don't know it. I guess you wouldn't understand loving someone from afar. He takes a swig from a bottle in a paper bag.
BLACK HOOKER: Delaware's about as far as I've ever gone. Is this person a he or a she? She takes the bottle and takes a swig.
KEVIN: It's a secret. But I guess you wouldn't understand about that, Oh honey, lots of people come to me for love and it's a secret. He takes his bottle back and goes home.

WENDY: Ever feel like you're not accomplishing anything? Billy sits on her desk.
BILLY: I think I'm in touch with the feeling. Let's go get a drink.
WEND Y: Billy, why aren't you at work? Billy gives her a look she knows all too well.

KIRBO: So. how's your, uh. are you seeing anyone?
DALE: To tell you the truth, my work's so time-consuming, I don't get the chance to date, but when I do well, medicine's such an incestuous profession, the only people I seem to ever go out with are doctors. The Maitre D' returns with the telephone.
MAITRE D': Miss Biberman? Telephone.
DALE: r See, they just won't let me alone.
KIRBO: She is gone as the Maitre D' walks over to him with his pad and speaks with exquisite, controlled sarcasm.
MAITRE D': Have you had enough time to look at the menu?
KEVIN: You cannot go to med school just to impress this girl with whom you have a fleeting infatuation.
KIRBO: This is not just an infatuation and she's not just a girl she's the only evidence of God I can find on this planet with the exception of the mystical force which removes one of my socks from the dryer every time I do laundry. Laundry folded, they head out of the laundromat passing the drop-off "Fluff and Fold" facilities.

ALEC: And the other half don't.
LESLIE: My six-year-old niece asked me today why everyone's father doesn't live in a separate house like her father does. I don't want us to become another divorce statistic in Newsweek.
ALEC: Look at my parents. My father may not come home with a raging hard- on, anymore, but they're happy.
LESLIE: Your father sits around playing chess while your mother talks to him constantly. But he's not That's probably why they're happy. ( he grabs her ) Leslie, let's stop living together . get married and start really living together!

KEVIN: Does Alec know you're doing this?
KIRBO: I told him I had Kim's permission. Should I go for the formal'tux, or the velvet smoking jacket, I-do- this -all -the -time look?
KEVIN: You've left school, put yourself into debt, lied to Alec who got you this job in the first place and all for a woman who doesn't seem to be interested in you.
KIRBO: When she sees me in this setting and realizes my potential, which she has always secretly known about me, the veil will be stripped from her eyes and she will give herself to me tonight.

KEVIN: holds court for the undergrads.
KEVIN: The best advice I can give you undergrads is to fail. Failure is a virtue in today's society. Human error is a badge of honor. If you're the alcoholic child of a celebrity, you can blame them and earn a year on the best-seller list. If you're a celebrity, your mistake will earn you a People magazine cover. It's post- Watergate morality. Take responsibility for your mistakes and make a quick buck while you're at it.
ALEC: Then Sully snuck the pizza waitress into the showers. They start screaming with laughter.

KIRBO: Ah. by any chance did Dale Biberman get called in on emergency duty tonight?. Ho? He hangs up and tries her home number. It's busy.
Â¢: Ah. by any chance did Dale Biberman get called in on emergency duty tonight?. Ho? He hangs up and tries her home number. It's busy.
BILLY: So how you doin'? Still living at home?
WENDY: Yeah, how about you?
BILLY: Felicia hasn't kicked me out yet.
WENDY: You been playin' your sax?
BILLY: I hocked it to pay the phone bill. You forgiven me yet for bein' such a horse's ass?
WENDY: There's nothing to forgive. In fact, I should thank you. It helped me grow up a lot and see how stupid I was.
BILLY: How stupid you were to be caring about a loser like me. I agree with you wholeheartedly. They both pause for a beat.
WENDY: You have a lot of talent, Billy.
BILLY: So you still a virgin?
9 WENDY: That's none of your business. Wendy quickly goes back into the house. Billy spits at the moon.
KIRBO: Emergency break in!. Operator! . That's right. What do you mean she won't release the phone??? Did you tell her I'm giving a party for her???
ALEC: Quiet. Big Al has an announcement. Everyone more or less quiets down. Kevin TURNS DOWN the STEREO, but not without SCRATCHING the record.
ALEC: On June first. Leslie will do me the long-awaited honor of becoming my bride. You're all invited. Everyone rushes to Leslie, who is stunned.
LESLIE: Alec, you're drunk. Alec is already accepting congratulations, and passing out cigarettes like cigars, as Leslie grabs him.
LESLIE: Alec, may I speak to you please. She leads him toward the kitchen as he shouts back:
D: ST. ELMO'S FIRE - Rev. 10/1/84 75.
0 ALEC: Hey, Howie. how 'bout we make it a double wedding? They pass Kirbo who dashes out of the kitchen franti- cally. He finds Wendy.
KI RBO: Can I use your car?
WENDY: Wendy, please, this is the most important thing in my life.
KIRBO: Wendy, please, this is the most important thing in my life.
WENDY: It's brand new.
KIRBO: Trust me.
LESLIE: You just want a yearly Christmas card with the Newberrys in front of the fireplace..
ALEC: You're just afraid to commit.
LESLIE: You don't have to slow down your career to help raise them.
ALEC: Jesus Christ, will you just for once not make the reason you won't marry me your fucking career!
LESLIE: All right then, what will we do about your extra-curricular love What extra-curricular love life?
ALEC: What extra-curricular love life?
LESLIE: ALEC A
ALEC A: He dashes back into the
ALEC: What'd you tell her?. Little buddy. little traitor. Huh, what'd you tell her?
LESLIE: He told me nothing. It was just a hunch. until now. Alec filled with guilt and remorse becomes angrier. Alec realizes that everybody in the house is watching him. He must save face.
ALEC: Leslie, I want you out of the apartment tonight. Alec marches out the door. The place is a wreck.
BILLY: Hey. everything's cool. It's not a party 'til something gets broken.
KI RBO: You better get off the phone and open this door! Suddenly the window above him opens and Dale's roommate Judith appears angrily.
JUDITH: Are you the maniac trying to cut in on my line?
KIRBO: Where is Dale?
JUDITH: She went skiing.
KIRBO: What???. Where???
JUDITH: Why should I tell you?
KIRBO: Because I'm not responsible for what I'll do to you if you don't.
BLACK HOOKER: .You think you ain't gonna pay? You'll pay.
LESLIE: I haven't been here for a long It's still the same. Small and ugly. but then again it's small and ugly. Are you sure we shouldn't find you some nice lady-like hotel?
KEVIN: It's still the same. Small and ugly. but then again it's small and ugly. Are you sure we shouldn't find you some nice lady-like hotel?
LESLIE: No, I'll be fine here for tonight 0 as long as I'm not putting you or Kirbo to any trouble.
KEVIN: That's not how you're supposed to ask. You're supposed to be a young lady who is very impressed with. my mind. Having come from a deep Hungarian film and getting cozy over a brandy, she says. 'Is that. a coffin.?' And, then I say, 'Yes, it's my coffin' . 'Your coffin,' she would gasp, her interest in me growing by leaps and bounds. Then'I would sit back stroking her arm and say 'Yes, I figured we're going to spend a long time in the ground together so I've made friends with it. I've gotten drunk on it. rolled joints on it . Even made love on it many times!' It's a prop for affect.
LESLIE: Does it work?
KEVIN: How would I know?
LESLIE: Well you better not let Jules see it. She'll steal it for her stepmother. Are these relatives of yours?
E: distinguished family.
KEVIN: No, that's more effect. He opens a straw box, obviously filled with his most personal possessions and extricates a photograph of a very ordinary family.
KEVIN: You remember my family.
LESLIE: So I've wandered into a real woman trap here, haven't I?
KEVIN: Except you're the first woman I've ever been able to get up here. And I've blown all my props already. So how about some brandy? Kevin searches for clean glasses in the debris that passes for a kitchen, Leslie finds photos and political cartoons in his straw box. Eventually, she finds a photo of herself, and then another followed by dozens more. Kevin has an entire homage to her in his secret stash. He comes back with the brandy to find her looking at the photos.
LESLIE: Am I part of your props?
KEVIN: ( PAINFULLY; SWEETLY )
R: Alec was the first. There were other guys, in high school, boys but he was the first love of my life. I always wondered if Alec and I hadn't ended up in the same dorm well, I guess I would have just found someone else. And so would he.
LESLIE: Alec was the first. There were other guys, in high school, boys but he was the first love of my life. I always wondered if Alec and I hadn't ended up in the same dorm well, I guess I would have just found someone else. And so would he.
KEVIN: Alec had the luck of geography. Whatever we say about Alec we'll regret tomorrow.
LESLIE: What do you think about our relationship. as an outsider?
KEVIN: Oooo dangerous question.
LESLIE: And I think the reason I'm not interested in other women. is 'cause I.
KEVIN: And I think the reason I'm not interested in other women. is 'cause I.
LESLIE: ( tears of joy ) Kevin. All this time right in front of us. How could I have been so blind?
KEVIN: Leslie, we won't even remember this tomorrow.
LESLIE: It is tomorrow. There is a mad moment of hesitation and then Kevin and Leslie smash into each other's arms.
S: It is tomorrow. There is a mad moment of hesitation and then Kevin and Leslie smash into each other's arms.
KEVIN: I love you. I've always loved They kiss madly, passionately. They fall to the floor in a frenzy. Leslie pulls Kevin's hair.
KEVIN: Aaaaah. Ouch. ( as she stops ) No. I love it. I love it!!! Leslie grabs onto the large throw rug as they roll around the floor. Somehow as they roll and turn, the rug gets wrapped around them. Leslie tears at his shirt, as he yanks her sweater off. Kevin fights madly with the back of Leslie's bra. He is going berserk trying to find the No. it's in front. With a flick of her hand she undoes her bra and opens up the wonders of paradise to her old buddy. They kiss madly again as they roll in the rug.
LESLIE: No. it's in front. With a flick of her hand she undoes her bra and opens up the wonders of paradise to her old buddy. They kiss madly again as they roll in the rug.
JULES: Which one is yours? I always So do I. You wanna go someplace? He points to a house. Jules stops the Jeep.

JULES: We're going to my place. Good. She STARTS up the JEEP.
BILLY: Jules, you've really grown up into a fine-looking woman.
JULES: I don't feel very fine-looking.
BILLY: I've been meaning to ask you something all night. What do you have on under that skirt?
JULES: You should know.
Â¢ BILLY: Come on Gimme some of those beautiful lips. Jules needs some attention. The hot couple kiss. He immediately goes for the gold.
JULES: Billy. enough!
BILLY: Who says?
JULES: I say.
BILLY: Yeah, well, I bet you really won't have so much to say with me in your mouth. He kisses her wildly as she pushes him away aggressively.
JULES: I'm serious, Billy. No!!! He grabs the keys from the ignition as the CAR DIES.
JULES: Holding her off with one hand, he shoves the keys into his underwear and then sits back grinning.
BILLY: Come and get 'em.
JULES: You shit!!! She attacks him, biting his hands, his neck and his chest. Billy shrieks with laughter and pain.
BILLY: ( ECHO ) ( CONTINUED )

JULES: I really needed you tonight.
BILLY: Nell, just get back in the Jeep and assume the missionary You break my heart. You break everybody's heart. She drives off in the Jeep. Billy fumbles with his pants and then turns toward his house. Felicia, holding their baby, stands watching from the porch. Obviously having seen most of this, she silently goes back into the house,. locks the door and turns out the light. Alone, drunk and bewildered, Billy starts moving away from the house real- izing he has no place to go.

KIRBO: Shit. Goddammitt.
KIRBO: Heater. Where's the defroster??? He rams and jams every button and knob in sight as he weaves dangerously on the freeway. Eventually one of the levers comes off in his hand.
KIRBO: Dear Mr. Iacoccoa. I recently had the misfortune of using one of your, so-called, new luxury cars in an emergency situation. So much for American enterprise!
KI RBO: Is Dale Biberman in there?
KIRBO: Kirby Kreager! And who the hell are you? The door swings open and there stands GUY, a handsome thirty-year-old wrapped in a blanket. Dale comes from the bedroom, fastening a man's robe and staring at Kirbo in disbelief.
DALE: Kirby? What are you doing here? His entire world has collapsed. He can't swear, shout or cry he can only dash toward the car frantically. Falling in the snow once or twice, he eventually jumps into the car and tries to peel out, but it just spins in the snow. Meanwhile Guy has put on heavy boots and comes running out to the car where Kirbo stands on the gas to no avail.
DALE: Kirby, stop. Come inside. He ignores her maniacally as he keeps desperately trying to get out of there.
GUY: You've got no skid chains or snow tires. You've got no traction. Kirbo ignores them.
DALE: Kirby, please!
GUY: You-'re not gonna get out of here tonight. You better come back 1.28 CONTINUED: 128 I'll stay in the car.
KIRBO: I'll stay in the car.
GUY: ( yelling at Dale ) He wants to stay in the car.
DALE: He'll freeze!!! She begins pulling on her boots as Guy tries to reason with Kirby.
GUY: People have died out here.
KIRBO: Leave me alone. I'm not your Dale has joined them.
DALE: By driving up here, you've made us responsible for you. Now come inside.
DALE: Your clothes should be dry in a few hours.
KIRBO: He's a doctor, isn't he?
DALE: Here are some pajamas.
KIRBO: You expect me to wear his pajamas?
DALE: We'll talk in the morning. She joins Guy, in the bedroom and closes the door. Kirbo is left with the pajamas and his desperate anguish.
KEVIN: ALEC ( O.S. ) No, it's Alec. Kevin and Leslie look at each other frantically.
KEVIN: ( WHISPERING )
ALEC: I'm only gonna ask you this once. Did you tell Leslie about my screwing around?
KEVIN: 133 INT. LIVING ROOM 133 Alec has found a beer.
ALEC: I believe you. I want you to know that I believe you and, Kev, I'm sorry I hit you. Shit, how'd she find out? How long has she known? I've been thinking all night about school. How sex was always a barometer,'especially, at the fraternity. The more women you got, the more of a man you were. or thought you were. I thought I was.
KEVIN: Ah. I kind of have company.
ALEC: Oh Jesus. I'm sorry. I never thought. Who is it?
KEVIN: That fat chick from the party? You and the fat chick.
ALEC: That fat chick from the party? You and the fat chick.
KEVIN: Alec, I'll call you later. Alec capitulates and leaves the apartment. Kevin relaxes just as Alec pops back in.
ALEC: Just tell me if it's the fat The bedroom door opens and Leslie appears wrapped in a No. No. No. wait a minute. I don't believe it. This could not be real. There is no way this is happening.
ALEC: No. No. No. wait a minute. I don't believe it. This could not be real. There is no way this is happening.
LESLIE: It happened, Alec.
ALEC: Not Kevin. Little fuckin' Kevin. My little buddy. No way, Jose.
LESLIE: He didn't do it alone, Alec.
Â¢: takes a stand.
KEVIN: I know that if we fight, you're going to win. But I'm warning you, I will use every bone in my body, every lamp in this room to make sure I inflict as much damage as possible on you before you bring me down. Kevin prepares for the fight.
ALEC: You're both pathetic. I don't want to see either one of you again, ever. You understand me? You see me on the street, you see me at St. Elmo's, just pretend you don't know me. On his exit, Alec takes a lamp and throws it against a Woody Allen photograph on the wall. Kevin and Leslie look at each other, uncertain of what they have done.

WENDY: He took my new car.

DALE: I'm sorry. I had no idea it had gone this far.
KIRBO: I gave up school. and my job at St. Elmo's. and you never even knew about it. It's kind of funny, isn't it? Dale sits down next to him.
DALE: The reason I didn't know. is because all of this happened
R: between you and you. I could never participate because I never knew what was expected of me. Love isn't like this, Kirby. It's mutual and reciprocal. Guy yells to them from outside.
DALE: Drive carefully. Guy gets out of the car.
GUY: Wait a minute. I've got to get a picture of you old college 0 He goes into the cabin. Dale sees Kixbo's pain.
DALE: I don't really know you well. but you seem like a fine person .. and I want you to know that I'm flattered by all of this and deep down, I'm sure for a long time, I'll wonder if maybe this somehow isn't my loss. She kisses him gently on the cheek. He is about to sink into more pain when suddenly he grabs Dale and kisses her with all the passion he has for her. When he releases her she is dazed. Something has definitely happened.
GUY: They turn to face Guy and his Polaroid camera. After he takes their photo, he hands it to Kirbo who hands it to Dale'and quickly gets into the car.
GUY: Aren't you going to wait for it to develop? Kirbo drives off quickly.
REARVIEW MIRROR: Dale gets smaller and smaller.
MIRROR: She is smaller and smaller.

MR. BEAMISH: Good. so you like the car?
WENDY: It's a great car, Dad, but I can't keep it. I don't feel right about driving a car like that and working with people who can't afford to eat. She finds the keys and hands them to him.

WENDY: I'm giving Howie back, too.
MR. BEAMISH: Wendy, listen to me. You think I wanted to marry your mother? I was pressured into it. She was pressured into it.

WENDY: Sit down, Daddy. sit down. They sit down, both still very emotional. After a moment, Mr. Beamish takes a torn greeting card from his pocket. It has a very sexy woman on it.
MR. BEAMISH: See this. A feminist came into the Pennsylvania Avenue store this morning called me a 'sexist' and a 'pig' and tore the card up. I said 'Listen, we got naked men on cards, too, with their pee-pees hanging out. It's fair! We got men and we got women!'
WENDY: Daddy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said I hated you.
MR. BEAMISH: That's okay. I'm sorry about Howie. You don't have to marry anybody you don't want to marry and if you want to move out, well, move out. But listen. He starts to get up with her help.

LESLIE: I don't believe this is happening to us. Alec sits down angrily on the new sofa, clutching his Wasted love. I wish I could get it all back.
ALEC: Wasted love. I wish I could get it all back.
AFTERNOON: Dealing with her emotions, she drives Jules' Jeep through the Georgetown streets. The back of the Jeep is filled with her clothes, etc.

JULES: Don't you two ever use a bed? Leaving the door wide open, she races through the apart- ment. Kevin continues to madly attack Leslie when Ron, carrying packages, arrives at his door across the hall. He and Kevin exchange a look as-Ron goes inside.
LESLIE: Let me show Jules your piece.
LESLIE: Kevin has his first byline. Jules is so stoked she can't focus.
JULES: Wonderful. Brilliant. Ha ha. 'Tract Housing in Maryland'.

LESLIE: Jules' boss and lover. International banking seems to be getting sexier.
KEVIN: Speaking of which. As she closes the window, Kevin attacks her again.
LESLIE: Kevin, I've been thinking.
KEVIN: Me, too, and I don't like to count my cornish hens before they hatch, but I do think I'll be getting a raise. And I was thinking we could get a place together.

KEVIN: But not a big miracle like Alec.
LESLIE: Oh, Alec was the big miracle for a long time. But I think I'd like to try life without any miracles for a while. Kevin realizes how serious Leslie is.
KEVIN: Well, having your first byline, and losing the love of your life in the same night has a certain 'The Gods must be laughing at me' feeling.
LESLIE: I'm not the love of your life.
KEVIN: Who says?
LESLIE: I say.
KEVIN: But you're a girl, what do you Leslie embraces him with deep friendship.

GENTLEMAN: I am Forrester Davidson Jr. Leslie is shocked and even more confused.
LESLIE: Well, there must be some mistake. I've come to see Julianna van Patten and they told me she doesn't work here anymore.
ALEC: Did you forget one of your albums?
LESLIE: I'm sorry to bother you here. It's Jules. After she left for work this morning, the finance company came and took away all her furniture, her Jeep, everything they could get their hands on.

All this time, she's been pretending to go to work every day , and pretending to be still having this affair with her boss. And she's been doing a lot of coke .. Well, anyway, I confronted her at the apartment, and at first she denied everything, but then she went crazy and now she's locked herself in the apartment and she won't let me back in. I'm really worried about her. Alec hesitates angrily.
LESLIE: Alec, please. I need your help.
LATER: Alec knocks on the door with Leslie.
ALEC: Jules, open the door. Leslie puts her key in the door.
ALEC: Jules, remember my junior year when I went cold turkey on cigarettes? You sat up with me all night in the commons room feeding me emergency carrots.? No answer.
LESLIE: Jules, if you don't let us in, we're going to have to call the police. There is a beat and then Jules speaks from the depths of JULES ( O.S. ) I'll throw myself out the window before they get through the door.
LESLIE: Not my greatest ploy.
ALEC: Jules, remember the time I flunked art history and I was trying to drink myself to death. Kevin and Kirbo come dashing up the stairs breathlessly.

ALEC: You little shit!!! He grabs Kevin. Kevin tries to fight back, but Alec is so overpowering he pushes Kevin up to the railing of the fire escape, and then pushes him over. Kevin hangs upside down as Alec holds him by his legs. Dozens of scraps of paper fall from his pocket. Leaning out the apartment hallway window, Leslie sees Alec, no!!!
LESLIE: Alec, no!!!
RON: What's happening???
KEVIN: My notes!
ALEC: You won't need any more notes on the meaning of life.
KEVIN: ( upside-down,
STRAINING ): I'm kinda betting on you not doing it, Al. think of your political Leslie runs into the alley underneath them.
LESLIE: Alec, stop Iit! She frantically starts climbing the fire escape.
LESLIE: BACK TO ALEC AND KEVIN After all I've done for you.
ALEC: After all I've done for you.
KEVIN: I feel I've done a lot for you, too, Al. so pull me up and we'll call it even.
ALEC: What you did for me was take the woman I was going to marry. The woman he was going to marry arrives frantically onto their landing. She struggles with Alec.
LESLIE: Alec, stop it right now! Below them, Billy and Kirbo pull up in a Chevron tow truck. Billy, wearing Chevron coveralls, jumps out with an acetylene torch in hand, shouting.
BILLY: Looks pretty ultimate up there.
KEVIN: You think this is helping Jules? With Kevin's life still in his hands, he suddenly remembers Jules.
LESLIE: Are you all right? Kirbo tries to get the dolly up the fire escape with Hey! Help. Kevin goes down the fire escape to help him, leaving Alec and Leslie alone. Leslie kneels by the window with her hands on the iron bars and speaks to Jules.
KIRBO: Hey! Help. Kevin goes down the fire escape to help him, leaving Alec and Leslie alone. Leslie kneels by the window with her hands on the iron bars and speaks to Jules.
LESLIE: Oh, my God. Jules, please, it's so cold.
ALEC: Very noble how you ran up here to save your lover.
LESLIE: He's not my lover. Jules, listen.
ALEC: I have never lied to you once since the day I met you. you cocky shithead.
LESLIE: I have never lied to you once since the day I met you. you cocky shithead.
LESLIE: Hang on, Jules. We all love you. She has been holding onto the bars with her bare-hands, but the bitter cold makes her wince as she removes her hands. Alec is overwhelmed with feelings as he takes her hands and holds them to his mouth, breathing warm breath onto them. Much emotion passes between them.
LESLIE: Your breath, your breath is so Leslie, I'm sorry. I'm so profoundly sorry. Kirbo and Kevin arrive. Billy races down the alley.
KIRBO: Blowtorch, anyone?
ALEC: Give it to me.
KEVIN: Do not hand him a blowtorch! Kevin takes the torch and goes for the bars. SPARKS and fire fly. Suddenly there is a PHENOMENAL POUNDING from inside the apartment at Jules' front door. It stops everyone on the fire escape.
BILLY: ( FRIENDLY )
LESLIE: You want some coffee, Ron? Ron enters tentatively and joins them as JULES and BILLY start SHOUTING and LAUGHING LOUDER.
RON: You know, until today I thought gay people were nuts.
WIDER ANGLE: REVEALS it's Wendy's apartment. It is partially painted and a large ladder stands in the room. A small. wing chair has fabric swatches on it. Cartons, books, etc. Wendy sits on the floor watching Billy.
WEND Y: Then what happened?
BILLY: That was it. We came out of the bedroom and had coffee with You saved her life.
WEND Y: You saved her life.
BILLY: Let's not get dramatic.
WENDY: So, when did you get so sane?
BILLY: When I realized how insane I've been all this time tryin' to be like Alec and Leslie. and you and Kevin. I'm not part of this post-college Georgetown life; marriage and jobs. Felicia and Melody'll be better off without me.
WENDY: Did she get remarried already?
BILLY: Three or four weeks.
WENDY: I'll tell you what's great. Last night I woke up in the middle of the night and made myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. and you know it was my kitchen, and my refrigerator and My apartment . and it was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I've ever had in my life. They chuckle together and then they become more serious.
WENDY: So you're goin', huh.? She picks up his sax and blows a few comic notes.
BILLY: So, are you still a virgin?
WENDY: Why is my sexual status so important to you?
BILLY: Have I abused our relationship too much? Or could I be so bold. as to ask you for a going-away present.? Wendy is moved.
ALEC: Need someone to blow on your hands? She smiles, but shows him her gloves. As she searches for change in her pockets, Alec stops her and puts his own coins in the machine. He presses buttons as he Did you know that I.always wanted to make you coffee? I tried once when you were in the shower but it didn't turn out right, so I threw it out and cleaned everything up so you wouldn't know. I don't like doing things I'm not good at like making coffee and saying I'm sorry. He looks at her sincerely as he hands her the plastic cup from the machine.

ALEC: Leslie, I'm sorry. They exchange a tender glance, and then Leslie takes a sip from the steaming cup.
LESLIE: Alec, this is soup.

BILLY: I'll keep in touch.
WENDY: ( LAUGHING )
HIS FRIENDS: watch him pull away.
BUS: As it pulls backward, we can see Billy with his friend's reflections on the bus's windshield SUPERIMPOSED OVER his. The bus's headlights flare INTO the CAMERA. The images of all of them mix with the white, hot GLARE SUPERIMPOSED OVER this, for a brief second we see IMAGES of them all from past, from school, from St. Elmo's, ,etc. The SCREEN GOES totally WHITE with incandescent brilliance as we
