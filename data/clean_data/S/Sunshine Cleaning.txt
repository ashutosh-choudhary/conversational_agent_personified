OWNER: I've got the five stores here and then two in Rio Rancho.
JOE: That's fantastic. See, if we're talking that kind of volume I can absolutely massage the numbers a little. Seriously, you're not gonna be able to keep it on the shelf.
OWNER: Yeah, I'd need to look at some things before I can place an order.
OWNER: How about I give you a call if I decide to
JOE: I'll call you. Not a problem. No problem at all. Even better, I'll swing by. You're on my route. How `bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow.
OWNER: Yeah, tomorrow's not good.
JOE: Thursday then. That's better anyway. That'll give you a chance to take a look see on those other stores. We'll put everything on one order and get you a good price
JOE: My advice to you - weed out some of this weaker product to make more space for the corn. Like this.
JOE: Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright idea was it to stock that? I mean come on, what self respecting kid asks his mom for apricot fruit

CARL: Yep, a real pain in the ass.

ROSE: I am strong. I am powerful. I can do anything. I am a winner.
NORAH: The fact that we have sex, real coitus sex, means I'm under no obligation to blow you.
RANDY: I think you're scared of it.
NORAH: ( Holding in the smoke ) I'm not scared of it.
RANDY: Uncomfortable then. You just need to get better acquainted.
NORAH: ( yelling ) Dad, get the phone.

NORAH: He's slowly freezing to death and he knows lobsterman is out there. somewhere. coming for him. And he's totally screwed because his tongue is stuck to the mailbox.
OSCAR: Why did he lick the mailbox?

OSCAR: Why wasn't he in school?
NORAH: Are you gonna let me tell the
NORAH: An then, he hears a horrible sound. Snap, snap, drag. Snap, snap, drag. Lobsterman is coming.
OSCAR: Maybe he didn't go to school because he had the ACD.
OSCAR: Norah downs the last swig of beer and sets the bottle down next to another empty.
NORAH: He's trapped. If he doesn't rip the skin off his tongue and make a run for it lobsterman will tear him to pieces with his razor sharp claws.
ROSE: Still sore?
ROSE: I don't know why you did that.
MAC: You should hear the way he goes on about his lean body mass index bullshit. Drinking that antioxidant, protein powder, enzyme crap all the time.
ROSE: When was the last time you even played basketball?
MAC: He needed to be brought down a peg or two.

NORAH: I'm not taking money.
ROSE: It's just ten bucks, take it. Dad told me about you getting fired.
ROSE: What happened?
NORAH: What, were you stoned or something?
ROSE: What, were you stoned or something?

ROSE: ( swallow ) Rose Lorkowski. Nice to meet you.
CARL: I hear you're my new competition.
ROSE: We're hardly competition for you.

CARL: Just roll their eyes and call you a
ROSE: I am strong. I am powerful.
OSCAR: What's a bastard?
OSCAR: Jeremy said I was a bastard. What does that mean?
NORAH: It just means your mom wasn't married when she had you. It's no big deal. In a couple of years you're gonna find it's a free pass to cool. You'll probably start a band called Bastard Son.

OSCAR: We're gonna make the money grow because that's the smart way. It's capital and you don't spend that. You invest it. That way you can get the SP250 and have money left over.

NORAH: Ever been trestling?
LYNN: Are the bodies there?

NORAH: I have seen a dead body once My mom.
LYNN: My mom.
NORAH: My mom.
NORAH: She was in a movie of the week once, ya know.
LYNN: Your mom?

LYNN: Sounds great.
NORAH: It is. I'm telling you.
NORAH: I didn't mean to bum you out with the whole mom stuff. I just thought you would. I don't know, I guess I thought.
LYNN: ( CONTINUED )
NORAH: He's coming.
OSCAR: What was I before I was born? What happens when we die? Do animals go to the same place as we go after we die? Is heaven really crowded? When somebody gets an arm chopped off does it go to heaven? Is Jesus another name for you or are you two separate people? Were you born? Will you die? If you already live in heaven where do you go when you
NORAH: Rose, wait for me.
LYNN: Oh, shit.
LYNN: You idiot.
NORAH: Sneaky fucker.
LYNN: That was really stupid.
NORAH: I think I broke my hand.
LYNN: Lynn leans close with real concern.
NORAH: No. But it hurts like a mother.
ROSE: Brow furrowed, he walks past Rose without acknowledging her. He goes straight to his room and shuts the door.
LYNN: How's the hand?
NORAH: Lynn draws Norah's hand close to her lips. Smiles. Looks at Norah. Norah's a deer in headlights. Lynn kisses Norah's hand. Everything is still and tense.

LYNN: Norah stares at her recently kissed hand and nods. She looks up to Lynn. Lynn kisses Norah lightly on the lips. A tester kiss. Then again. Softly. Norah doesn't move, eyes locked on Lynn. All is good. Norah leans in and kisses Lynn's neck. Lynn's eyes are closed enjoying the moment. Lynn opens her eyes. The school photos of Lynn sit directly across from her on the shelf. Lynn stares at the pictures. Waves of recognition and confusion register in her eyes. Norah kisses Lynn's neck oblivious.
LYNN: Is that?
LYNN: Are those.
LYNN: How do you have my school pictures?
NORAH: I just. I found them. I was gonna tell you.
LYNN: Where would you find old pictures of me?

LYNN: My mom is dead.
NORAH: I wanted to tell you. that first day. That's why I
LYNN: You knew this whole time?
NORAH: I think. You know, I think there's a reason that I found them. The pictures. Because that lead me to you, right?
LYNN: You would understand?
NORAH: Wait. Please. Don't.I
LYNN: You're sick, you know that? There's something wrong with you.

OSCAR: Why do I
ROSE: ( too sternly ) Because I said so.
ROSE: Rose walks briskly through the house. Urgency mounts with each step.
ROSE: Dad! Daddy!
JOE: I'm busy here.
ROSE: Damn it dad, you scared me.
JOE: Those snotty restaurant fucks wouldn't buy my shrimp. Some bullshit about health codes or whatever. I don't believe that shit for a second.
ROSE: God, dad what were you
JOE: Don't. Don't start with me. Bastards completely shut me out. They got their own little cartel. Little restaurant mafia. I bet they screwed with my car too. I wouldn't put it past `em. Bunch of shady mother fuckers.
ROSE: I need you to watch Oscar.
JOE: I can't.
ROSE: What do you mean you can't?
JOE: I can't watch Oscar today Rose.
ROSE: I'm in a real bind here.
JOE: Yeah, well it's hard, isn't it? Raising a kid on your own. Try two.
WINSTON: You look nice.
ROSE: Winston finishes gluing the piece and looks up.
ROSE: I was wondering if Oscar could hang out here for a little while.
ROSE: I've got this baby shower to go to and Norah's working a job and my dad's incapacitated. Do you mind?
WINSTON: I guess not.
ROSE: You're a lifesaver.
WINSTON: You did your hair different.
ROSE: You like it?
ROSE: All right. Be good. I'll pick him up in a few hours when I'm done.
OSCAR: What's that?
WINSTON: This is a World War Two Mitchell Cannon Nose Bomber.
OSCAR: You make all these models?
WINSTON: Dab the end of that in the glue. Just a little bit.
OSCAR: What's that piece for?
WINSTON: It's a strut.
OSCAR: What's a strut?
WINSTON: Supports the wing.
OSCAR: Seems like it'd be hard to build models with just one hand.
WINSTON: It is.
MOUSEY: So Rose, what are you doing? Are you still cleaning houses?
PAULA: Rose has gone into real estate.
MOUSEY: Actually, I own my own business.
ROSE: Actually, I own my own business.
MOUSEY: A real estate business?
ROSE: No. It's a biohazard removal and crime scene clean up service. It's a growth niche industry right now ­ highly technical and competitive.
MOUSEY: What does that mean ­ biohazard removal whatever?
ROSE: A lot of times, when somebody dies, it can be kind of, you know, messy. So, we go in and clean up all that left over mess. Make sure that the area is clean and sanitary.
ROSE: People just don't understand the health and safety risks involved in disposing of biological material like blood and body fluids.
PAULA: Oh my God.
ROSE: Course, we have a whole arsenal of disinfectants and um. professional techniques. Like I said, it's a highly technical and professional operation with a whole complicated, you know. methodology behind it.
ROSE: Real growth industry.
MOUSEY: I can't imagine. You like doing it?
ROSE: Rose stops. She hadn't thought about whether she liked it.
ROSE: I do. We come into the lives of people who have just experienced something so sad and profound. They've lost somebody. The circumstances are different but that's the same.
ROSE: And we help them. In this one small way. we help.
MOUSEY: Sounds horrible to me.
PAULA: I believe I'd vomit.
NORAH: The incense falls from the dresser. Norah finally muscles the mattress through the doorway.
NORAH: Oh my God, you're the cutest thing ever. Did you get left behind?
NORAH: It's okay.
NORAH: No, no, no.
PEPPY: Okay, ladies. For our first game we've taken five different kinds of candy bars and melted them in these Oh I love this game.
MOUSEY: Oh I love this game.
PEPPY: You all can
ROSE: Rose forces a smile at Peppy who motions for someone to start distributing the diapers.
PEPPY: You can look, smell and taste. The first to identify all five correctly wins!
ROSE: ( over the phone ) Hello, you've reached Sunshine Cleaning. You're call is very important to us so.
NORAH: Norah snaps the phone shut and continues slapping back the 149 INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - AFTERNOON 149 Rose watches with a detached expression as Floral clad women stick their noses in the brown goo of the diapers.
FUCK!: Norah snaps the phone shut and continues slapping back the 149 INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - AFTERNOON 149 Rose watches with a detached expression as Floral clad women stick their noses in the brown goo of the diapers.
ROSE: You know what? I. uh.Actually, there's somewhere I need to be.
PAULA: Oh nooo! You can't leave now. We're just starting the games.
ROSE: Yeah. Well.
NORAH: It was an accident.
ROSE: Oh my God, what have you done?
NORAH: It was an accident.
ROSE: How does this happen? Huh? How do you burn down a house, Norah? Jesus fucking Christ!
NORAH: Jesus Rose, Calm down.
NORAH: Well, if you had been here to help me but no, you're off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who don't even matter. Prove to your old cheerleading squad that you're not this huge loser. If you had been here doing your job it wouldn't have happened. So don't try to put all this on me.
ROSE: This is on you. You did this. You set a fucking house on fire! You.
NORAH: Oh, go ahead and play the martyr. It's like your favorite thing.
ROSE: I can't believe I was so stupid to think that you could handle a little bit of responsibility.
NORAH: I am so sick of all your holier than thou bullshit. Why don't you take a look at you're own life, huh? You're a real inspiration.
ROSE: Well maybe if I didn't have to take care of everybody in this family.
NORAH: Fuck you. I'm done being your
ROSE: Oh that's great. Turn everything to shit and then walk away.
ROSE: She bangs on the glass doors.
WINSTON: Long baby shower.
ROSE: I'm sorry, I. everything's
WINSTON: Oscar's asleep in back.
ROSE: Norah's ruined everything. She burnt down a house. A client's
WINSTON: You know?
ROSE: You know?
WINSTON: Carl told me.
ROSE: How does he.?
ROSE: That's just great. We burnt down a client's house. How do you get around that?
WINSTON: Rose shrugs.
ROSE: I figured we'd wait and get the better rate once I got certified.
WINSTON: Didn't you go to that?
ROSE: There's not a lot I'm really good at, you know.
ROSE: Really. I'm good at getting guys to want me. Not date or marry me. But want me. I've always been good at
ROSE: And cheering. I was pretty good at that too.
WINSTON: Cheering is good.
ROSE: Yeah. Not as marketable as you'd
ROSE: You brush your teeth?
MAC: Hey beautiful.
MAC: I was starting to think you were on a date or something.
MAC: You okay?
ROSE: Long day.
MAC: Can I come in?
ROSE: It's not really a good time.
MAC: I got you something.
MAC: It's for your business cards. You put `em in there and, I don't know. impress people.
ROSE: It's beautiful.
MAC: You don't like it?
ROSE: No, I like it very much.
ROSE: It's just this thing we're doing.
MAC: Come on, let's not do that.
ROSE: I don't want this anymore.
MAC: So that's it?
MAC: That's it then.
NORAH: ( CONTINUED )
NORAH: I need to talk to Lynn.
LYNN: She can't donate. You can't donate.
LYNN: Forty-eight days. It's not been forty-eight days.
NORAH: Why are you acting like this? Why haven't you called me back.
LYNN: Listen, I just, don't think you're the kind of person I need to be hanging out with right now.
NORAH: What's that supposed to mean?
LYNN: Do I really need to spell it out?
NORAH: Lynn takes the packet. As she walks back to the reclining blood donors she tosses the photos in a trash can. A smiling Korean woman gives Norah a cup of juice and puts an `I gave blood today' sticker on her chest.
WINSTON: I'm sure I can turn this stuff around pretty quick.
ROSE: Thanks. For everything.
OSCAR: Are you coming to my party?
ROSE: We're going to Hinkle's Saturday for Oscar's birthday. It'd be great if you came.
WINSTON: Sounds like a blast.
JOE: That other pair we looked at, full of gadgets and gimmicks.
JOE: These here are the real deal. I want you to have them.
ROSE: Dad, you promised him those others. From the store. He's been talking about it for weeks.
JOE: No Rose, I want to him to have
WINSTON: Wow, is that an old Zeiss?
WINSTON: Porro prism?
JOE: Eight by thirty Jenoptems. No marks on the objectives. Perfect bloom.
WINSTON: You got yourself some classic binoculars there.
NORAH: Sorry I'm late.
NORAH: ( to Winston )
JOE: Where are you going?
NORAH: Winston cleans up pretty good.
NORAH: I read somewhere that beauty is really all about symmetry. Like having eyes the same size and all So, you know, when you factor that in he's like, hot.
NORAH: Listen, I know I fucked up, okay? Like really huge and I know that and I'm sorry, okay?
ROSE: God, that drives me crazy! That whole `Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just a big fuck up' routine. Like that's a legitimate excuse.
NORAH: I really am sorry. But it really isn't all my fault, Rose.
ROSE: I think there's something wrong with you. The way your brain works. I mean, what the hell? It's like you can't be trusted with anything. You just screw around all the time like it's all a big fucking game. It wasn't a game, Norah. We're not all just here for your amusement. You should have been paying attention. You should have been focused on the job.
NORAH: You finished?
ROSE: I know. I should have been there.
NORAH: What are you going to do now?
ROSE: I got some ideas. I was thinking maybe we could
NORAH: I've got my own ideas.
ROSE: So, you really think he's hot?
NORAH: Winston? No.
NORAH: You gonna open my present?
OSCAR: The guy said that if you're careful they'll last a whole month. And these aren't stupid kiddie unicorns and shit. They're all based on classic biker designs.
NORAH: The guy said that if you're careful they'll last a whole month. And these aren't stupid kiddie unicorns and shit. They're all based on classic biker designs.
OSCAR: What's that say?
ROSE: What's that say?
NORAH: Li'l bastard.
ROSE: Oscar slips his arm out of his sleeve and inside his shirt and stares at Winston admiringly. Rose whispers in Oscar's ear and he pulls his arm back into his sleeve.
NORAH: I'm thinking of taking a road trip.
JOE: Haven't worked it all out yet. I was thinking I could maybe take the
