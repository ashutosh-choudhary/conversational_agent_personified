GEORGE: After a while that hurts. doesn't Lester smiles. He appreciates this.
LESTER: It's good you want to do something, Thank you.
GEORGE: Thank you.
LESTER: But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
GEORGE: They're not?
LESTER: ( suddenly direct, almost enthusiastic ) No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
GEORGE: You're right.
LESTER: Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to.
SECRETARY: Mr. Karpf.
JACKIE: I'm sorry but I need an extra garage key.
LESTER: What for? What do you need the key Jackie continues to stare at George.
JACKIE: The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
LESTER: How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss this is Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.

GEORGE: Great. Who's been doing your hair?
JACKIE: I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite. nobody much.
LESTER: George is going to open a shop.
JACKIE: ( really interested ) No kidding? Your own shop?
LESTER: George, could you excuse us for a minute?
GEORGE: He leaves the office, shuts the door, leaving Jackie and Lester alone. Lester shuts the door.
LESTER: I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
JACKIE: I am?
LESTER: Who were you talking to?
JACKIE: Who do you think I was talking to?
LESTER: My secretary saw you with that boy.
JACKIE: Whatever his name is, that actor.
LESTER: Whatever his name is, that actor.
JACKIE: Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy. Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
LESTER: Then you were talking to him.
JACKIE: I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
LESTER: I'm not jealous of the dogs.
JACKIE: So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Of course not.
LESTER: Of course not.
JACKIE: That's not very logical, Lester.
SECRETARY: He thinks the room is soundproofed. Don't tell him it's not.
GEORGE: How come?
SECRETARY: He'll have that awful construction crew back again, and they can never do anything right.
LESTER: ( trying to think of why ) It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth.
JACKIE: Really? How about starting with By her tone, Jackie indicates she's been saying all of this for months. Lester repeating it like it's just occurred to him genuinely upsets her. She's near tears and she's not the kind of girl who cries easily. Lester's sensitive to it.
LESTER: Sweetheart, I know it's rough but at this point my business involves handling money for some very touchy people, politics and so on. Felicia's at a very difficult period in her life. any divorce and settlement and so forth, my finances would have to be looked Jackie knows what he's talking about.
JACKIE: ( quietly ) You and your touchy investors.
LESTER: ( finally ) Look. you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
JACKIE: You're lying about one thing, What's that?
LESTER: What's that?
JACKIE: You're still jealous.
LESTER: God, you're a doll.
LESTER: Angie, give Miss Shawn a garage key for the Bowmont House, would you?
ANGIE: Yes, Mr. Karpf.
LESTER: Well, let's go down together. C'mon, George, I'll walk you out.

WOMAN: So, little red riding hood says 'my what big teeth you have and the wolf says all the better to eat you with, my dear, and she says eat, eat, eat, doesn't anybody ever fuck any more?'

GEORGE: ( he takes it seriously ) Well I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
LESTER: Isn't that bad for it?
GEORGE: No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
LESTER: Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there layer so it kind of fluffs out
GEORGE: Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there layer so it kind of fluffs out

JACKIE: ( same tone as Sid's ) well, more than anything else ( indicating George ) I'd like to suck his cock.
LESTER: ( to East ) Senator, you should've seen those little kids! About forty of 'em, all blind. We put out these mattresses on the front lawn and they came running out of the house, tripping and falling all over the place, having a hell of a good time. I mean they were blind of course.

FELICIA: cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
LESTER: Can't we go into this later, Ladies and gentlemen, to Senator Joe East.
ROSALIND'S VOICE: Ladies and gentlemen, to Senator Joe East.
FELICIA: We cannot go into this later.
LESTER: That's okay too.
FELICIA: You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
EAST: this tells of the ancient grandmother who, upon seeing the garden gate of her childhood, stops a moment and says, hello garden gate, hello garden gate, garden gate, hello.
SENATOR: this tells of the ancient grandmother who, upon seeing the garden gate of her childhood, stops a moment and says, hello garden gate, hello garden gate, garden gate, hello.
LESTER: ( finally exasperated ) look, Felicia, this party involves more than you and me, you know. These people are concerned about more than each other, you is that right?
FELICIA: is that right?
LESTER: yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or THE SENATOR has begun his weird chant, beating out accompaniment on a cigar box and a pewter vase.
THE SENATOR: has begun his weird chant, beating out accompaniment on a cigar box and a pewter vase.
FELICIA: ( glancing up ) is that what this is all about?
LESTER: Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks
FELICIA: Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl or that she'll keep her hands off him.
LESTER: ( he turns like a shot ) What are you talking about?
FELICIA: ( she laughs ) think what you have time to think, Lester.
LESTER: What are you talking about, Suddenly there's a rumble in the room and East has stopped chanting. Several men have stepped to the center of the room. One of them in a slate suit raising both hands.
DET. YOUNGER: Excuse me, Senator. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have to evacuate this room as quietly and quickly as possible. There's nothing to worry about. We'd like you to exit through the door here on my left. down the steps into the street, please!
OUTSIDE: the emergency doesn't keep autograph hounds from inhibiting the exit as they try to hold up celebrities in the crowd that flows onto the street. Jill and Johnny Pope are caught up in the swirl of the crowd. Pope temporarily loses Jill. He looks around. Jill taps him on the shoulder.
JILL: here I am. Now what?
POPE: Well as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
JILL: Let's do that.
LESTER: have they located it?
GEORGE: What are you looking at?
JACKIE: The lawn it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
GEORGE: look, you don't have to entertain me.

JILL: Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?

LESTER: Call me Les.
POPE: Where to, Les?

LESTER: peers into the kitchen. It's filled mostly with unkempt beards. He decides against it, turns up a small staircase and continues up it until he finds himself in a den.
LESTER: ( whispering ) how's it going?
LESTER: ( squinting to see ) is that Illinois?
LESTER: ( dumbly ) ( pointing with his pipe stem to a girl by Lester's ear, also watching the set )
JILL: so when are you going to Egypt?
POPE: You mean when are you going to Jill laughs. She turns and shakes her finger at Pope.
JILL: Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
POPE: Two weeks from tomorrow.

JACKIE: What's wrong?
GEORGE: do you want ice?
JACKIE: George pops the tops of the cans, hands one to Jackie. Neither one of them drink. They're staring steadily at each other, their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis court lights which someone has turned on.
GEORGE: ( finally ) we're kidding ourselves.
JACKIE: ( staring right back ) we are?
GEORGE: last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
JACKIE: I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
GEORGE: I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
JACKIE: but what about her? I don't want to hurt Jill.
LESTER: walks back in the foyer, holding a drink, swaying. The strobe lights are going again in the living room.
POPE: What's wrong?
JILL: We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
POPE: he'll never know the difference.
JILL: still at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.

JILL'S VOICE: there you are. Les. Les Les Les, we're leaving.
LESTER: ( with genuine awe ) now that's what I call fucking.
LESTER: who has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of the image hits him. His face freezes. It is harsh and determined. He turns slowly away from the window and walks past Jill without looking at her.
JILL: She turns to the window and sees George and Jackie herself.
GEORGE: Honey? Where've you been? We've been looking everywhere for you.
JACKIE: ( softly ) Oh God.
GEORGE: Jill! Jill! Jill, goddammit!
JACKIE: well you better go after her.
