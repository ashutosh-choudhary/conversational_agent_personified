FULLER: .So, let's keep a steely eye out for this bastard. ( THEN ) Before we dismiss, this is your monthly reminder of why we're here.
STAINER: Kirk, bro. Tonight?
KIRK: I don't know, Stainer.
STAINER: Dude, you never come see us anymore. It's been like four months. Time to forget about Marnie and get back on the whores.
KIRK: It's not that. It's my Grandma. I'll probably be at the hospital for the next few nights.
STAINER: Oh, shit. I spaced that. How's she doing?
KIRK: She's hanging in there but it doesn't look good.
STAINER: Dude, I'm sorry. She's a great lady. That sucks.
KIRK: Hey there, Habib.
HABIB: ( perfect English with a Howdy Kirk. Lemme guess; I been flagged for a random search.
KIRK: Yeah, sorry. I'll get you out of here quick. You off to Boston again?
HABIB: No, sir. Pediatric convention in
KIRK: I'm sorry. It's just.
HABIB: Thanks Kirk. See you next time.
FULLER: You think that's funny!? You wanna sit in first class or you wanna sit on my gloved and jellied finger!?
WHITE AGENT: ( RUSHED ) Okay, how many bags are you checking? Any bags!?
YUPPIE MAN: Is this one too big to carry on?
WHITE AGENT: No. Carry it on. Good call.
YUPPIE WOMAN: Grant, you don't want to lug that thing all over the airport.
BLACK AGENT: ( RUSHED ) Did you pack your bags yourself?
ASIAN WOMAN: BLACK AGENT
BLACK AGENT: Has anyone unknown to you asked you to carry anything onto your flight?
ASIAN WOMAN: BLACK AGENT
BLACK AGENT: I think you mean NO.
WHITE AGENT: You can't do that!
BLACK AGENT: She doesn't know what the hell I'm talking about!
YUPPIE MAN: Where exactly is gate F5?
WHITE AGENT: Just past F4. Have a day now folks. Let's hustle it up.
ASIAN WOMAN: Sank you!
BLACK AGENT: No sweat. Keep it moving.
BOTH AGENTS: Reverse to show the woman they were competing for. She is a classy, sophisticated, blonde around thirty. Drop dead beautiful. She is startled by the sudden call from both men. She laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the black agent. He shoots a smug victory grin over to his co- worker, who is being an overtly sore loser.
MOLLY: Hi, I'm booked on flight 94 to Burbank. Molly McCall.
BLACK AGENT: ( trying way too hard ) California. Fantastic. So do you travel quite a bit?
WHITE AGENT: Hey Derek. You got the numbers on the ( making it up as he goes ) new, um, procedures for the, um, airport thing. regarding the, ah, planes? ( to Molly ) Whassup?
STAINER: Les Paul Classic re-issue?
ROCKER: ( SMUG ) No, it's a sixty-five. Mint.
STAINER: Fuck you. No way.
ROCKER: Dude, I'm late for my flight.
STAINER: Sorry, I have to search this case for, you know, explosives and such. This thing is sweet!
KIRK: Oh, hello again.
MOLLY: Oh, hello again.
KIRK: Second trip in two days?
MOLLY: Uggh. Yeah. It's just a short hop to L.A. but they've got me going back and forth three days in a row. This client is killing me.
KIRK: Well hang in there kiddo and I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
MOLLY: It's a date.
FULLER: Did'ja see that? Boy would I ever like to.you know.put my penis in her vagina. ( wink )
ROCKER: What the hell!?
STAINER: Dude, I am so sorry.
ROCKER: Sorry my ass! This thing is worth more than you make in a year, you clumsy motherfucker!
STAINER: Yeah, I bet it was but.
KIRK: Hey Mom. Hey Marnie.
MRS. KETTNER: Oh, hi Sweetie.
KIRK: Who's that guy Dad's with?
MARNIE: Kirk, you've been really great about your mom and I staying so close since we broke up but I know how much Grammy meant to you. Well, is it okay with you that I'm here?
KIRK: Sure. It's fine. ( it's not )
MARNIE: Okay, good. Then can I introduce you to my new boyfriend?
RON: Uh, oh - the ex. Awkward! ( Ron and Mr. Kettner laugh ) No! I'm just jack-assin' with you, pirate. Great to meet you. How you doing?
KIRK: I've been better.
RON: Right. Of course. I'm sorry about your grandmother. It's just so. Well, old people, you know, what are you gonna do?
KIRK: Yeah. Thanks.
ERIC: Little brother. Grammy wants to see you.
KIRK: Okay. Well, I better get in there.
ERIC: Listen, I'm pretty sure she wants to discuss the will. She won't tell us dick, so we're kind of hoping you can grease the wheels.
KIRK: Okay, but you know Grammy didn't have all that much. Once the hospital and. and the ah.
ERIC: Yeah, yeah, the cremation and what Well, it's not going to leave enough to get worked up over.
KIRK: Well, it's not going to leave enough to get worked up over.
DEBBIE: We've got a wedding to pay for, Kirk and.
ERIC: Debbie, let me handle this. We've got a wedding to pay for, numbnuts, and you know Mom and Dad are going to Branson next month. Now you always been Grammy's favorite so we're counting on you to get in there and sort out what's what.
GRAMMY: There you are Big Slick. Did you bring 'em?
KIRK: Grammy, you really shouldn't.
GRAMMY: Just hand 'em over. I'm on death's door and you know it.
KIRK: I love you Grammy.
GRAMMY: Don't start that shit now. You're looking at one lucky old broad who's done a lot - skydiving, rollerderby, colored fellas. I got no complaints. So when the check comes I don't want any blubbering or bullshit outta you. Just enjoy your life like I did mine and raise a glass to your old Grammy once in a while.
FULLER: Ma'am, could you please remove your jacket and shoes?
MOLLY: Oh, sure.
FULLER: Why don't we go ahead and strip off that belt too while we're at it.
KIRK: Why don't you just come on through, ma'am, and we'll see if anything sets off the machine.
RANDY: Kirk buddy! Phone call!
FULLER: You best hope the terrorists are taking personal calls on the job too, mister!
KIRK: This is Kirk Kettner.
MOLLY: Oh Geeze. Please tell me I didn't get you in trouble back there.
KIRK: No, no. It's not that. I ah.I lost somebody today.
MOLLY: Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I know. I lost my grandmother a few months ago and I.
KIRK: She used to be a blackjack dealer at the Horseshoe. When I was little, she taught me and my friends how to play poker. Turned us into a bunch of eight-year-old degenerate gamblers.
MOLLY: My Grammy Keenan was ninety four but independent right to the end. She was always trying to cook for everyone. You couldn't stop her.
KIRK: Oh, God, I know. Grammy used to change her own oil. Right up until a few months ago. She was. Do you change your own oil?
MOLLY: ( LAUGHS ) No. I wouldn't know where to begin.
KIRK: I know, me neither. She could barley walk and I'd come over and find her lying under her Cadillac all covered in grease.
GATE AGENT: .final boarding call for United flight 94 to Burbank.
MOLLY: Oh, geeze, that's me. I'm so sorry.
KIRK: No, no. Go catch your flight.
MOLLY: I'm Molly.
KIRK: Kirk Kettner.
BUSINESSMAN: Dead Grandma. ( a nod and a cheek click ) Nice one.
CREEPY BUSINESSMAN: How you doin'?
MOLLY: Oh, hi. Molly McCall?
KIRK: Oh, hi. Molly McCall?
MOLLY: Who's calling please?
KIRK: It's Kirk. From the coffee shop. You left your pictures with me. If you tell me which gate you're at, I can run them right down to you.
MOLLY: Oh, no. I'm already on the plane and we're pushing back right now.
KIRK: Okay, well I'll leave them at the lost and found and when you get.
MOLLY: Oh geeze, some of those are my only prints. It would be such a huge favor if you could hold on to them for me. I'm coming back next week.
KIRK: Oh, sure. But how will I.
FEMALE PASSENGER: She's talking on her phone.
MOLLY: I have your number in my phone. As soon as I get back I'll call you and arrange to pick them up, okay? Thank you so much, Kirk.
CREEPY BUSINESSMAN: You believe these pricks? So, what do you do?
STAINER: Thank you! We're going to take a little breakski but we'll be back in a few minutes to do Frontiers.
DEVON: Hey Kirk. How you been holdin' up?
KIRK: It's been a rough week but, you know, all of the services and family stuff keep you pretty busy. I really miss her, though.
JACK: She sounded like a hell of a lady.
KIRK: Hello?. Oh, Hi. I'm sorry I can barely hear you. I'm at a club and.. Club Vertigo? Oh, yeah - it's right down the street from there. Okay, sounds good.
JACK: What was that all about?
KIRK: Nothing, just a passenger. She accidentally left something with me. She's going to stop in and pick it up I guess.
DEVON: She's coming here? She a cute gal?
KIRK: Well alright dude! That's a leave- behind. She digs you!
STAINER: Well alright dude! That's a leave- behind. She digs you!
KIRK: No she doesn't. Trust me.
STAINER: She does a leave behind and then just happens to be in the neighborhood? She practically has her hands in your pants.
KIRK: No, seriously - it's nothing. She's way out of my league.
STAINER: Dude, you said Marnie was out of your league and let's face it, Marnie's kinda nasty.
MARNIE: I don't know who that is.
STAINER: Oh, you don't know Marnie Tomkins? She's just this girl. I thought you knew her. Anyway, she's pretty nasty looking. but you're looking good.
MARNIE: Kirk, I'm sorry about Grammy.
KIRK: Thanks. Thanks, I'll be alright.
MARNIE: Listen, are you going to Branson with your folks next month?
KIRK: No. It's not really my thing.
MARNIE: What's wrong with Branson? You too good for Branson now?
KIRK: No. Branson's.awesome.
MARNIE: Well, your mom invited Ron and I along. We'd love to go but not if it's going to be weird for you.
KIRK: No. You should go. I'm sure you'll have a great time. Totally.
MARNIE: Kirk, I'm sorry about what happened with us. You're going to make someone very happy someday, but you have to get over me first, okay? Is it a deal?
STAINER: She's going to Branson with your fucking parents? And bringing her new fucking boyfriend!?
KIRK: Yeah. He seems like a good guy, though. He's an entrepreneur.
JACK: Entrepreneur? Kirk, I know that guy. He owns a Pizza Hut.
KIRK: So? That's a business.
STAINER: It's not even a real Pizza Hut. It's one of those strip-mall take- out ones. They don't even have chicken wings. The guy's a fuckin' douche bag.
KIRK: He's got more going on than I do. That's all I'm saying.
STAINER: Dude, you can do a hell of a lot better than her.
DEVON: One door closes, another door opens.
STAINER: Fuck you Devon, that doesn't even make any sense. But take this broad that's coming here tonight - I got a feeling about her. You're gonna get on that.
JACK: Absolutely. Visualize it.
KIRK: I appreciate what you guys are trying to do but, I'm telling you, I have zero chance with this one and I'm completely okay with that.
DEVON: That's defeatist thinking.
KIRK: No it isn't. It's just like saying I'll never go to the moon and I'm okay with that too.
STAINER: You're saying you don't want to go to the moon? That's bullshit.
KIRK: No. I'm saying that I never will go to the moon but I'm not going to get down about it because, you know - I never expected to.
STAINER: You don't know. Technology and shit. You might go to the moon.
DEVON: Holy Frijole.
JACK: Oh shit. Yeah, you're right.
STAINER: Sorry, bro. You'll go to the moon before you'll hit that. No chance.
KIRK: I told you.
MOLLY: Hey! There you are!
KIRK: Here I am.
MOLLY: I'm sorry I'm so overdressed. I just came from a work thing. Are you doing okay with.everything?
KIRK: Oh, you know. Hey, these are my best friends - Jack, Devon and
MOLLY: Yeah, just a nickname. Doesn't really mean nothin'.
STAINER: Yeah, just a nickname. Doesn't really mean nothin'.
KIRK: Oh. Here's your pictures - all safe and sound.
MOLLY: Thank you so much for taking care of them for me! I need to get some copies made. If I lost these.uugh.
KIRK: No trouble at all.
MOLLY: Hey, have you eaten yet?
KIRK: I was going to go grab a bite. Let me buy you dinner to pay you back.
MOLLY: I was going to go grab a bite. Let me buy you dinner to pay you back.
KIRK: You don't have to pay me back.
MOLLY: I know. I want to. Come on! The place across the street has the best greasy burgers in town.
KIRK: A burger does sound good. ( then to the guys ) I'm going to just ah.
STAINER: Dude. It's cool that she's buying you dinner but do not get your hopes up about this one.
KIRK: Don't worry. Believe me, I know.
BIG GUY: Good advice there friend. Your boy ain't got a prayer with that chick.
STAINER: You talking shit about my buddy!? 'Cause I'm giving out free fuckin' ambulance rides!
WAITER: Start you off with something to drink ma'am?
MOLLY: I'll have a Bass.
WAITER: And for your. brother?
KIRK: What? Oh, I'm not her brother.
WAITER: Oh, I'm sorry. I just figured.
KIRK: You know what, a Bass sounds good. Make that two.
WAITER: Great. Sorry.
KIRK: So. You know what I do, what about you? Your card said event planner. How'd you get into that?
MOLLY: Well, it wasn't the original plan. I went to law school. Ended up at a big firm but I hated it. Then, they asked me to plan the Christmas party. It was a big hit and a few months later I was done with law.
KIRK: I know. Pernicious career move, Oh, I don't know what that word means. What was it?
MOLLY: I know. Pernicious career move, Oh, I don't know what that word means. What was it?
KIRK: Oh, I don't know what that word means. What was it?
MOLLY: I'm sorry. Like, destructive or.
KIRK: Oh, okay. No, I don't think that's so perni.gious?
MOLLY: Good - new word. No, not pernicious at all. Not if you enjoy the work.
KIRK: Good - new word. No, not pernicious at all. Not if you enjoy the work.
MOLLY: I really do. We do a lot of charity events and I get to work with some of the most amazing human beings on some really fun projects. Next month I'm doing a cancer benefit with Billy Joel.
KIRK: Wow. I love Billy Joel.
MOLLY: The only downside is I have to do a lot of public speaking and I've always struggled with stage fright.
KIRK: Oh man - That's my number one fear. I'm terrified of getting up in front of people. I'd rather get a Kentucky root canal.
MOLLY: Are you seriously hitting on me right in front of my boyfriend?
KIRK: Oh, yeah right! ( Catches Molly's unspoken instructions. ) But, yeah. I'm her boyfriend, I guess, so.
KIRK: Honest mistake.
MOLLY: Did you get a load of that hair- piece? What is it with men? I mean, look at you. You're bald and you're fine with it. A little dignity is all I'm saying. The toupees and plugs and the teen- dream sports cars. Oh geeze, I'm sorry. Do you drive a sports car?
KIRK: I drive a 94 Taurus. It's got AM/FM but I wouldn't call it a sports car per se.
MOLLY: Oh, my God! I love that book!
KIRK: So, a duck walks into a bar.
MOLLY: Well, I've got an early morning. I should go. Thanks for coming along. This was really fun. And thanks again for helping me out.
KIRK: No, thank you for dinner. I feel bad that you won't let me.
MOLLY: Oh, stop it. Listen, I handle some of the charity events for the Coyotes and I've got some tickets for the hockey game tomorrow night. You interested?
KIRK: ( NERVOUSLY ) Um, sure. Yeah, great. I mean, I'm free tomorrow night.
MOLLY: Perfect. I hate to see them go to waste. There's two so maybe bring
KIRK: Oh, right. Thanks! Thank you.
STAINER: Whatcha runnin' there a PX-235?
GUARD: I don't know sir.
STAINER: The two hundred series are dog shit. You couldn't find a bazooka with that thing. You should look into the new eight fifties.
GUARD: Can you keep it moving sir?
KIRK: Hey, it's Molly. She's here.
STAINER: ( PERPLEXED ) Hey guys! You made it! Hooray! Thanks for coming.
MOLLY: Hey guys! You made it! Hooray! Thanks for coming.
KIRK: Oh, yeah. Wouldn't miss it.
STAINER: Thanks for the sweet seats!
MOLLY: Guys, this is my best friend in the whole world, Patty. This is Kirk and, um, Stainer, right?
PATTY: Hey boys. Nice to meet you.
MOLLY: Patty's my assistant and my go-to gal. Whatever you need, she can make it happen on a moments notice.
PATTY: You need a cock-shaped cake with a cotton-candy bush delivered by four o'clock? I'm your connection.
MOLLY: Oh, and she likes to shock people so don't let her freak you out.
KIRK: How 'bout that. So, we're going to grab some beers. Can we bring you ladies anything? Beer? Nachos? Patty, cotton candy?
STAINER: That's it. She's setting you up with the fat chick.
KIRK: Ooohhh! Okay! Okay! That makes sense, right!? When Molly was here I was like, "what!?" But, okay! Well, Patty seems cool. She's funny.
STAINER: Well, yeah, she has to be.
KIRK: What does that mean?
STAINER: Nothing. The fat chick seems great. You never know, bro, that fat chick could wind up being the love of your life.
REESE: Hey Molly! Yer lookin' good, eh!
MOLLY: That was a bogus call, Bobby. Your skates barely left the ice.
REESE: I know. What's that aboot, eh?
KIRK: ( nervously to Reese ) Yeah, that ref is like a total blindo, man.
STAINER: Kirk, Molly's sister is blind.
PATTY: Kirk, Molly's sister is blind.
KIRK: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean.
MOLLY: ( not offended ) Oh, I know. It's fine.
ANNOUNCER: Forty Five seconds left on the Power Play and the Sharks are knocking at the door.
REESE: So, after the game, you wanna party?
MOLLY: You know my policy on players, Bobby. And you might have noticed we've already got dates.
REESE: Come on, Molly. Just give me a chance, eh. I'm a great guy - ask any of these assholes.
MOLLY: Reese, you'd better.
REESE: You can't seriously be blowing me off for these two hosers.
STAINER: Hey! Fuck you Reese! You suck this year anyway!
PATTY: You'd better check that tone, Reba! You do NOT want me comin' up there!
MOLLY: Patty! Stop it! I'll go see what I can do about Stainer.
KIRK: No, this is my fault, I'll take care of it.
MOLLY: No, it's okay. I know the head of security. I'll be right back.
KIRK: God, I'm really embarrassed.
PATTY: That's okay, if Reese did that to me I'd have gone over the glass too. But I would have landed a few before they got me. Reese has been all over Molly ever since she dumped her boyfriend. I tell you, that girl has nothing but trouble when it comes to men.
KIRK: What? How is that even possible? She's so.
PATTY: Tell me about it. I'm no lezbo but sometimes she makes me want to strap on - if know what I'm saying.
KIRK: Yeah. I think I do.
PATTY: It's a curse, looking like that. Who has the balls to hit on her? Just the most arrogant A-holes like Reese out there.
KIRK: Yeah, I suppose.
PATTY: Listen, Molly brought me along tonight because, you know, she thought I might be 'interested.'
KIRK: Oh. Oh yeah?
PATTY: But, just for honesty's sake, I'm not interested. No offense.
KIRK: No! Hey! None taken. I don't blame you. I know I'm no Brad Pitt. That's cool.
PATTY: What? You? No, I'm talking about your pal, Stainer. I know he's your friend but he seems like kind of a dumbshit. ( THEN ) Wait. Why would you think I was talking about you?
KIRK: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to assume Oh my God. You don't have a clue do you? Molly's really into you.
PATTY: Oh my God. You don't have a clue do you? Molly's really into you.
KIRK: Oh, yeah right!
PATTY: A knockout like Molly be interested in a spud like you?
KIRK: Well, yeah.
PATTY: Got me. Again, no offense. But listen, Kirk, your dream girl just showed up. Try not to blow it.
DEVON: Atta boy Jackers!
STAINER: It doesn't add up, Kirk. If Molly's so into you, why bring her friend and give you two tickets?
KIRK: She was hoping to set Patty up with Oh, great.
STAINER: Oh, great.
KIRK: It's okay, she wasn't interested.
STAINER: So you're saying the hottest babe in the world wants you and the fat chick isn't into me. Will you listen to yourself? Fuck you.
KIRK: I don't know, Stainer, somebody got thrown out of the game and I had to drive him home, remember?
DEVON: Pretty impressive catch, Kirky.
STAINER: There's no way. Don't get him all worked up. Her friend was fuckin' with him. Molly said herself that Patty loves to mess with people.
DEVON: Kirk, you deserve a gal like her. And Stainer, why don't you try to be a little more supportive.
STAINER: Why don't you try a little shut the fuck up, Devon. This week, we're not taking dating tips from the guy who met his wife in eighth grade.
JACK: Are we still bowling?
STAINER: All I'm saying is - she's just too hot. No judgement on Kirky, the guy's just outgunned here.
KIRK: I can't argue with him.
BOWLER: Yo, house ball! I was up first.
STAINER: Oh for fucks. What is it with you Just wait your turn.
BOWLER: Just wait your turn.
STAINER: All this noise and bullshit in this place and I'm such a distraction over here in your god damned peripheral vision!?
KIRK: Okay Stains, take it easy.
STAINER: Well!? Fuckin' roll then!
BOWLER: You're lucky motherfucker!
STAINER: Oh yeah!? Bring it, Brunswick!
DEVON: Stainer! Cool your jets, buster.
STAINER: Okay. Anyway. I love Kirky but let's face it, the guy's a three.
DEVON: Stainer, that's just dirty pool. He's at least a four.
STAINER: You're outta your fuckin' mind - four! You go ahead and pump rainbows up his ass. I'm just being honest.
KIRK: I can live with three.
STAINER: He's a nice guy and he's funny. Those are a half a point each.
DEVON: Kirk said she likes his Taurus.
STAINER: That's so fucked, I won't even dignify it with a response. So we're back to three. Meanwhile, this Molly is a hard ten.
DEVON: A hard ten?
STAINER: Generally, if a broad is that hot you can deduct a few points for dumb or shallow but she went to law school and her sister's blind. That's a hard ten, friends, and that is rare. A seven point disparity - that's a chasm. The most you can jump is two points. I can't even get a ten.
JACK: Oh, not even you, huh?
STAINER: I'm a five, okay?
JACK: Bullshit. Then what am I?
STAINER: You're a seven and a half.
JACK: Fine, you're a five then.
STAINER: Okay, so I get a two point bump for being in a band. That puts me at seven. On a good day, most I can bag is a niner.
KIRK: What about your shitty car?
STAINER: Artist exemption. I'm expected to have a shitty car.
JACK: Is there an artist exemption for being a jag-off?
STAINER: Fuckin' A there is.
KIRK: Stainer's right. Patty was probably just messing around. It's not a big deal. Let's just bowl.
DEVON: What about Rick Ocasek? Billy Joel, Donald Trump.
STAINER: Yeah, dumbass. Those are the wild- cards. Money and fame.
JACK: So, if he were a millionaire?
STAINER: A mil ain't what it once was, Jackie. Devon's practically a millionaire for Christ sake. A mil might get you an eight but to bring down a ten now days - two million
KIRK: ( into the phone ) Hey, Molly. Um, yeah, sure. No, that sounds good. Yeah, I know where that is. Um, okay, yeah. see you then.
KIRK: ( to himself ) It's okay. Get it together. Guys do this all the time. You can do this. You can make it happen.
WILLY: ( thick accent ) Kirk! You look like someone made a second number in your breakfast cereal. You are doing okay, yes?
KIRK: You know what Willy. I honestly don't know how I'm doing.
WILLY: He does not know!
KIRK: I should be doing awesome but I don't know. Know what I mean?
WILLY: How are you?
KIRK: How are you?
WILLY: Perfect! Willy is having another kick ass of a day.
KIRK: Who's that?
STAINER: Nobody. Just some chick I boned once when I was drunk. You look like shit, bro.
KIRK: Thanks. I had trouble sleeping last night. This Molly thing. I don't want to want this, you know? It just seems too good to be true. I just don't get it.
STAINER: I know what you mean. There has to be some explanation.
KIRK: I can't think of one. Not one that makes any sense.
STAINER: Well, let's spitball it a little. You've got dick for money so she's no gold digger. Oohh! Did you ever see Double Indemnity?
KIRK: Please don't say she wants me to kill someone.
STAINER: Okay, then. maybe she's on a scavenger hunt. You know, like find a wagon wheel, a wiffle ball bat and a fat, bald TSA agent - that kind of thing.
ERIC: It's about time, numbnuts.
KIRK: I came right from work.
MR. KETTNER: Okay Maury - we're all here.
MAURY: Oh! You bet! You betcha! Okay, hi there Kirk. Firstly, let me just say how awful sorry I am. Stella was one heck of a gal and a real dish. Anyhow, let me just.
GRAMMY: Testing. One, two, three, four. Oh, this God damned thing!
ERIC: So Kirk gets it all!? That is Eric, it can't be much.
KIRK: Eric, it can't be much.
ERIC: Maury digs into his desk and pulls out a mess of papers. He dons a pair of glasses that make his eyes look gigantic.
MAURY: Let's see here. Looks like she had herself six G's in savings.
ERIC: She left him eighty grand!?
MAURY: Most of Stella's retirement home expenses were covered by her reverse mortgage. But, figure in thirty thousand still due to Arborwood Village. She racked up forty-seven thousand in medical bills. And my fee, of course, which now stands at two thousand and change - which is real reasonable, folks.
ERIC: So Kirk owes money!? HA! Shit, man! That is God damn hilarious!
MOLLY: But, you can't legally be held responsible for her debt. What kind of hack is this attorney?
KIRK: It's okay. I had it in savings.
WAITER: ( French accent ) Madame. From ze gentleman in ze grey suit.
KIRK: Anyway. Grammy hated owing anyone money. I'm afraid she couldn't rest if she wasn't square with the house. It's the least I can do. She practically raised me.
MOLLY: You're a good man, Kirk.
WAITER: From ze gentleman in ze purple tie.
MOLLY: Listen, no more drinks. Please.
WAITER: Of course. No more drinks, madame.
MOLLY: I'm sorry. This happens sometimes.
KIRK: Yeah, I get that a lot too. I'm sure the next one will be for me.
MOLLY: Oh, my gosh! Talon! I didn't realize you were in town already.
TALON: I just flew in this morning.
MOLLY: Kirk, this is Talon. This is my good friend, Kirk.
TALON: Great to meet you, sir.
MOLLY: Wouldn't miss it.
TALON: That's fantastic. ( to Kirk ) Mol is always a big hit with the kids.
MOLLY: Please. You're the one the kids go crazy for.
KIRK: So you two work together?
MOLLY: Only once a year. Talon is our charity liaison at the air show.
TALON: And my ex-boyfriend.
MOLLY: And my ex-boyfriend.
KIRK: Oh, boy. I guess I better.
MAX: Excuse me. My name is Max Fleming. I'm a financial planner.
KIRK: Oh, Hi.
MAX: Please forgive me but I'm curious. Who manages your portfolio?
KIRK: My portfolio? I don't really.
MAX: It's okay if you'd rather not say. I admit that selling my services in a men's room is a tad aggressive but isn't that what a man of your means requires in his financial planner?
KIRK: My means.
MAX: Judging by the company you're keeping, I'd say that you're making a handsome living. I can help you do even better.
MAITRE D: Excusez-moi Monsieur. Might I have a word?
KIRK: Oh, sure. Is everything all right?
MAITRE D: My kids eat here. My mother's here right now you son of a bitch.
KIRK: Okay. Did I.
MAITRE D: Look, I can appreciate that this is not some common street-walker. You're obviously willing to pay for the best but we can't have this kind of thing at my place.
KIRK: What? I'm not paying anyone. We're just on a date.
MAITRE D: You are on a date with her? What am I an idiot? Now, I don't wish to embarrass you, sir, or make a scene. So, enjoy your dinner but, be warned, do not ever bring another professional into my place. ( louder and back into the French accent ) Tres bien Monsieur!
KIRK: Oh, no. Did I miss Talon?
MOLLY: He had to go but he asked me tell you how much he enjoyed meeting you.
KIRK: Yeah. Super. He, uh, seems like a great guy.
MOLLY: He is. He's wonderful. I know, I know - the blue eyes and the rock hard abs, right? But he's really so much more than that. A gallery in New York just opened an exhibit of his photography. He's a genius.
KIRK: ( to the waiter ) Can we get the check?
WAITER: Madame, your bill has been covered by ze woman in ze Raiders Jacket.
MOLLY: Oh my gosh! This is your apartment? I used to live in this neighborhood back in college.
KIRK: Yeah, I'm gonna move to a better place pretty soon.
MOLLY: We used to come to parties over here sometimes. Oooohh. Can I come up and see your place?
KIRK: It's not much, I know.
MOLLY: No, I like it!
KIRK: What? It's a good movie.
MOLLY: I love that movie.
KIRK: You like Cheap Trick?
MOLLY: Are you kidding? Heaven Tonight is the first album I ever owned! A hand-me-down from my big sister. She was the coolest person in the whole world.
KIRK: A little. My grandma taught me. It was kind of our thing. She was a great player. Ragtime, show tunes, that kind of thing. I'm really not very good.
MOLLY: Oh, I'll bet you're great. Play something for me.
KIRK: No, I can't really play in front of What, the stage fright thing? Come on it's just me. Please?
MOLLY: What, the stage fright thing? Come on it's just me. Please?
KIRK: No, I really can't. Trust me, you're not missing anything.
MOLLY: So you've never played in front of Nope. Almost did once. A talent show in high school. I just sat up there drenched in sweat. I really thought I could do it but then I made my big mistake.
KIRK: Nope. Almost did once. A talent show in high school. I just sat up there drenched in sweat. I really thought I could do it but then I made my big mistake.
MOLLY: Let me guess. You looked at the Yep. All these eyes on me. I'm shaking, my head is spinning, I'm trying to remember if I even play the piano. and then, I puked.
KIRK: Yep. All these eyes on me. I'm shaking, my head is spinning, I'm trying to remember if I even play the piano. and then, I puked.
MOLLY: Right there on the stage?
KIRK: INTO the piano actually.
MOLLY: Shut up! You're lying! Why would you do that?
KIRK: It was a reflex. I was trying not to barf on the floor. Turns out it's a lot easier to clean puke off a stage than out of a baby grand.
MOLLY: Yeah, that has to be a real bitch. Oh, I shouldn't be laughing. You poor thing.
KIRK: Sorry. I'm a little cotton-mouthed. I'm going to get a glass of water. How 'bout for you? Water? A nice glass of, you know.water?
MOLLY: Yeah. That sounds good.
KIRK: Um. You want anything to eat?
KIRK: Oh come on!
KIRK: No. I got it!
MOLLY: Listen Kirk, I want you to know that I would really like to, you know, to be with you tonight.
KIRK: Sure! Sure! Yeah! No problem! Great! That's.that's great! Ice!? You want some ice!?
MOLLY: I mean, don't get me wrong. I want to! Believe me - getting naked and crazy sounds fantastic right now.
MOLLY: Are you okay?
KIRK: Oh, dear God.
KIRK: Hey. I'm totally fine with that.
MOLLY: You're the best.
KIRK: Kirk opens the door for Molly.
KIRK: No thanks fellas.
KIRK: Sorry, Mrs. Neusbaum!
KIRK: Hello!? Hello!?
KIRK: Sorry, Mrs. Nuesbaum.
STAINER: Kirk, it's a simple rule of life. Look around. People are pretty evenly matched.
KIRK: Yeah, but Stainer, she was the one who asked me out. So, why.
STAINER: That first night, were you intimidated by her?
KIRK: No, I didn't think I had a chance.
STAINER: Exactly. So you were relaxed and funny. You were on.
KIRK: So I gotta get back to that.
STAINER: That's just it, Kirky. Now that she's opened the door, you can't get back to that.
KIRK: So I'll have to fake it?
STAINER: Forget it. You can't fake that far. A broad like her - she'll smell that horseshit a mile away.
STAINER: Can we get a couple of menus? ( then to Kirk ) You eating?
KIRK: Maybe just a salad.
STAINER: Dude, one salad ain't going make up for thirty years of chili dogs.
KIRK: I know. But I got dinner with my folks later.
STAINER: Fun. Be sure and stab your brother in the eye with a fork for me.
KIRK: Sorry, Eric's not coming tonight.
STAINER: Fuck you are! Put that thing away. You do not call her. Don't you get it? Talon is back in town.
KIRK: No, she broke up with him.
STAINER: So, you're telling me you were sitting there, a sweating, quivering stutter-bucket and when you came back from the can, Molly's hugging a guy who's so good looking you'd probably fuck him. What do you think she's doing this weekend?
KIRK: So what am I supposed to do?
STAINER: What can you do? She hasn't called - she's not going to.
KIRK: You're probably right.
STAINER: Just count yourself lucky. You got to kiss a goddess and you got out before she recalibrated your hardware. A chick like that can raise the bar too high and then once she dumps you, nobody else measures up.
KIRK: No, you're right. You know what - it's good. It's better. I'm actually relieved. You should have seen this Talon guy. Man! All I've been thinking about is having to be naked in front of her. I don't need that kind of pressure.
STAINER: Don't do it!
KIRK: Cut it out!
STAINER: Let it go!
KIRK: Hello!?. Oh, no problem! Yeah I was super busy yesterday anyway.
STAINER: Would you look at yourself?
KIRK: Well, I have dinner with my folks tonight. Oh, I wouldn't want to subject you to them. Okay. If you want to. I can pick you up.
STAINER: Well, I guess you just solved that. An hour with your family and she'll file for a restraining order.
KIRK: No. Eric's not going to be there. It's going to be good. You might be wrong about Molly. She might.
STAINER: ( to the boy ) Whoa! I don't think so Spanky! A little lower!
KIRK: You found it!
MOLLY: I had good directions!
KIRK: I'm sorry. My folks aren't back yet. We're locked out.
MOLLY: You don't have a key?
KIRK: No. My dad's kind of obsessed with home-security. Like someone's going to break in and steal his Reader's Digest collection.
MR. RILEY: Well, howdy Kirk!
KIRK: Hey, what do say you take the night off and I'll take Noodle around the block for you? ( to Molly ) Are you up for a walk?
MOLLY: That sounds great.
MR. RILEY: Geeze Kirk, that's mighty nice.
KIRK: ( baby talk ) Yes! Always happy to see you, pretty girl! Yes you are a pretty girl! Yes you are!
MR. RILEY: You're a good boy, Kirk.
KIRK: It's no trouble at all.
OLD WOMAN: Honey!? Are you back in business!?
KIRK: ( To Molly ) I had a little neighborhood dog- walking service when I was a kid . ( to the woman ) No problem, Mrs. D, we can take Norton along too!
MOLLY: What are you talking about? I want to meet your family.
KIRK: Hey dad.
MR. KETTNER: ( without looking up ) Hi sweetie!
ERIC: Close the door, fucknut.
KIRK: Hey Eric. I thought you were hanging drywall tonight.
ERIC: Nah. Fuckin' Leroy fired me again. Like that dick never came to work with a little buzz on.
KIRK: Okay, listen, I brought a date tonight. I really like her. Please don't embarrass me in front of her. I'll do anything you want.
ERIC: I promise I won't mention her
RON: I did like you said Mr. K.
KIRK: Oh, hey Ron. So Marnie's here?
ERIC: You want another one Dad?
MR. KETTNER: You read my mind.
MRS. KETTNER: You two take it easy now. We have guests. ( THEN ) Eric honey, I'm sure if you apologize to Leroy, he'll take you back.
ERIC: Nah, fuck him. Anyways, Leroy ain't payin' shit ever since he trucked in all those spics from Fresno.
KIRK: Geeze Eric!
RON: I got this, Kirk. Eric, before you go bad-mouthin' a whole group of people, you should know that my grandmother on my father's side is from Fresno.
ERIC: Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't know. ( THEN ) So, Molly. What do you do?
MOLLY: I'm an event planner.
ERIC: You see? That's using your head. That's a business to get into.
MOLLY: Well, thank you Eric.
ERIC: Book a band, blow up a few balloons and people pay out the ass for it.
KIRK: There's a little more to it than that, Eric. Molly handles some big events. She's even doing a benefit with Billy Joel next month.
MOLLY: ( PLAYFULLY ) Actually, Eric's right. Just a few
RON: You know, Molly, I'm a business owner myself. A little restaurant.
MARNIE: I wouldn't really call it a restaurant, Ron.
RON: We serve food that people eat. So - It's a Pizza Hut with no tables. It's a take out place.
MARNIE: It's a Pizza Hut with no tables. It's a take out place.
ERIC: So, Molly, me and Debbie here are getting hitched. What do you get for a wedding job?
MOLLY: Hmmm. Honestly, I don't really do a lot of weddings. I specialize more in fund-raisers, corporate events, that kind of thing.
ERIC: But you've done weddings.
MOLLY: I've done a few.
ERIC: So, what do you get for one?
KIRK: Dad, could you.
DEBBIE: Don't get your panties in a wad, Kirk. He's just making Geeze, there are so many factors that affect the cost of a wedding.
MOLLY: Geeze, there are so many factors that affect the cost of a wedding.
ERIC: We're looking at about two hundred people and we're gonna do this whole Nascar theme.
DEBBIE: I'm getting a kick-ass dress made out of actual checkered flags and Eric is going to be in an orange tux with a big Home Depot logo on the back and Tony Stewart's number 20 on the shoulders.
MOLLY: Oh, how fun!
ERIC: So what's the damage for supervising something like that?
KIRK: Eric, please.
ERIC: I'm just talkin' ballpark. I'm ain't gonna try and Jew her down.
MOLLY: Okay. Before expenses, my base fee for a non-charity event is fifteen thousand. So, I'd ballpark that somewhere around twenty-five grand.
ERIC: ( STUNNED ) Fuck a duck.
MRS. KETTNER: Come on, Ma - we're all thinking it.
ERIC: Come on, Ma - we're all thinking it.
MRS. KETTNER: Molly, I'm so sorry.
MOLLY: No, it's fine. The truth is, Kirk and I are just getting to know one another but so far, I think he's decent, he's funny and. You know, when we first met, Kirk asked me in all sincerity if I knew how to do an oil change.
ERIC: Funny? Kirk is funny? Tell us a joke there Sinbad.
MRS. KETTNER: ( to Kirk ) Well I hope you can hold onto this one pumpkin. ( to Molly ) When Marnie broke up with him he was devastated for months, the poor little guy.
ERIC: No shit, when you dump him, he's liable to kill himself.
KIRK: Are you heading home?
MARNIE: Got to get home and let Peanut out. ( she wipes some lint off of Kirk's shirt sleeve. ) Kirk, you look really good.
KIRK: Thanks. You do too.
MARNIE: Ron! Let's go!
RON: I'm coming! It was really fantastic to meet you Molly. If you ever need a pizza.
KIRK: Molly, you don't have to do that.
MOLLY: No, It's fine.
MRS. KETTNER: You let us have some girl time. Take these downstairs to your dad.
KIRK: So, what was the final score?
ERIC: You think you're hot shit now? Is that it?
KIRK: Look, Eric, you've had a lot to drink tonight and.
DEBBIE: Don't tell him what to do. ( to Eric ) You're doing fine, baby.
ERIC: You think you're better than me. Say it. Well take a look around, Big Slick. ( re: trophies ) Every one of these says Eric. First place! First Place! M.V.P.!
KIRK: ( STANDING ) Well, it's been fun.
MR. KETTNER: Now don't be that way, boy. All your big brother is trying to say is that we're worried about you.
ERIC: You show up here with that piece of ass!? Either you're fucking with us or she's fucking with you so which is it?
KIRK: Look, I know she's a little out of my league but.
ERIC: A little!? Are you shitting me? Alright, alright! I think we can all agree that Debbie here is one wicked hot box.
KIRK: She's um. very attractive.
ERIC: Yeah, and this Molly makes her look like a pig.
KIRK: Look, I don't know what's going on either but.
ERIC: I'm goin' upstairs and gettin' to the bottom of this.
KIRK: Eric! No!
ERIC: I think this gal is messing with my little brother and I'm not going to sit still for it.
KIRK: Eric! Okay! I know! I'm sure she's just slumming or something and it's all going to be over any minute but, Jesus Christ! She'll come to her senses without any help from you! She's up there with.
ERIC: Way to go numbnuts. You should have let me handle it.
KIRK: I know. I'm sorry, man.
STAINER: Well, I guess this is it. I'm surprised she even bothered.
KIRK: Oh. Yeah. Hi.
MARNIE: I'm sorry to bug you at work but this couldn't wait.
KIRK: Wow. I don't know, Marnie.
MARNIE: Why not? Please don't say it's because of this Molly person.
KIRK: No, I think I already screwed that up anyway.
MARNIE: Good. I was really worried about you with her. She seems like kind of a bitch.
KIRK: What? She is not.
MARNIE: Well, she acts like she's better than everyone with her hybrid car and her la-de-da charity work.
KIRK: She doesn't do that at all, Marnie. You're just putting that on her.
MARNIE: Okay, maybe so. See? This is what I mean. You never argued with me before. You're really growing.
KIRK: What about Ron?
MARNIE: If you want to get back together, of course, I'll break up with Ron.
KIRK: You mean you're still with him?
MARNIE: I'm not going to risk being all alone just because you don't know what's good for you. Come on, Kirk. Deep down, you know where you belong.
KIRK: You're right, I think I do. Say hi to Ron for me.
KIRK: This wasn't my idea. I ain't dropping twenty bucks to go in there. God-damned planes are in the sky. I can see 'em just fine from the parking lot for free.
STAINER: This wasn't my idea. I ain't dropping twenty bucks to go in there. God-damned planes are in the sky. I can see 'em just fine from the parking lot for free.
KIRK: She's working one of the kids' charities. I'm guessing they might be down by the rides.
STAINER: Whoa dude, check it out. The Blue
KIRK: I just wanted to apologize for last night. for my family.
MOLLY: I just wanted to apologize for last night. for my family.
KIRK: I just wanted to apologize for last night. for my family.
MOLLY: Your family I can deal with.
KIRK: And for me. For what I said.
MOLLY: Do you really think I'm that shallow? You think I need to slum?
KIRK: No. I don't know what to think. You just have to understand that this is a new area for me. Believe it or not, I don't have gobs of experience with beautiful women.
MOLLY: Is that all I am to you?
KIRK: No, but I don't have much experience with brilliant, successful, wonderful women either.
MOLLY: Kirk, this can't work if you put me up on some kind of pedestal.
KIRK: It's not that I. Okay, look. When I was a kid, we played a lot of baseball in my neighborhood. The worst part was picking teams because I was always picked last. Every time. Like they couldn't start a friggin' game without first establishing how much I sucked. So, now you come along and make me feel like the first pick. But. what if I can't hit?
MOLLY: You already got to first base. Just keep your eye on the ball.
KIRK: Sounds good.
TALON: It's Kirk right? ( firm handshake ) Excellent to see you again, sir.
KIRK: Oh, Talon. You're a Blue Angel?
TALON: Yes sir, a Naval Aviator.
KIRK: Perfect. Okay, I get it - Talon is what - your call-sign?
TALON: No, it's my name.
KIRK: Then what's your call-sign?
TALON: Oh, I'd rather not say. It's embarrassing. Just something the guys gave me.
KIRK: Yeah, I guess.
TALON: Well, I understand that fellas like yourself tend to have uniquely candid relationships with the women they befriend. Am I right?
KIRK: Fellas like myself?
TALON: Don't get me wrong. I have no problem with your lifestyle. What grown men do in the privacy of their homes is none of my concern.
KIRK: Talon, I'm not.
TALON: Hey, I'm in the Navy. I don't ask and I don't expect you to tell.
KIRK: No. She speaks very highly.
TALON: God as my witness, I WILL make it right. I WILL get her back. Can I count on you to put in the good word for me, Poncho?
KIRK: Um. Sure.
TALON: You're the man. Come here.
TALON: Talon finishes the long hug. He and the other Blue Angels walk off in formation. Stainer rejoins Kirk.
KIRK: That was Talon.
STAINER: Who? The Blue Angel guy? ( cracking up ) Duuuuude!
COP: Nice try pervert!
FADE MUSIC: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT Dressed up and wearing party hats, Kirk, Stainer, Devon, Jack and about thirty others stand in a small, classy restaurant.
STAINER: Seriously, what's with the banner? She's blind, right? Seems like they could have saved a few bucks
PATTY: Here they come! Everybody hide!
STAINER: Is that really necessary?
KIRK: Stainer! Just hide.
MOLLY: Katie, I'd like you to meet Kirk.
KATIE: It's so nice to meet you, I've heard great things.
KIRK: Oh, thank you. Molly raves about her big sister non-stop.
KATIE: May I?
BLIND TEEN: Mrs. McCall?
KATIE: Robert! Is Jerry with you?
JERRY: Yes, ma'am. Happy Birthday.
KATIE: It's so nice you came. ( to Molly ) These are two of my star pupils, Robert and Jerry. Boys, this is my sister, Molly.
JERRY: It's nice to meet you.
MOLLY: What's your wish, Katie?
KATIE: I wish Kirk would play the piano for me.
KIRK: Really. I can barely play.
KATIE: Come on, Kirk! For my birthday?
TALON: It's okay Kirk. You'll rock us next time right chief?
KIRK: Oh, hey Talon. Thanks.
TALON: I'm glad you're here. I feel terrible about our little misunderstanding. I don't know what had me thinking you were a gay fella. Molly tells me you two have been seeing each other.
MOLLY: Oh, it's a DVD.
KATIE: Who's this from?
STAINER: What? It's closed captioned.
KIRK: What did he do?
PATTY: Listen, Molly would kill me if she knew I was telling you this but I'm trying to do you a favor.
KIRK: Molly has this physical.um issue. You know, kind of like a birth Oh, my God.
PATTY: Molly has this physical.um issue. You know, kind of like a birth Oh, my God.
KIRK: Oh, my God.
PATTY: It's not a big deal but she's really self-conscious about it. Talon and some other guys she's dated have been weirded out and made her feel like a freak.
KIRK: What is it?
PATTY: It's better if she tells you but if you can't deal with it, just get lost now and don't put her through that heartbreak again.
KIRK: No, no. I wouldn't do that.
PATTY: Good. 'Cause if you do, it'll be your last conscious act. ( she stands ) Cake?
STAINER: ( playfully chipper ) My friends! Whassup Bitches!
KIRK: ( playfully chipper ) My friends! Whassup Bitches!
DEVON: What? What's going on?
KIRK: My troubles are over boys! It's all going to work out! Check it out - Molly has. Wait for it.
DEVON: Excuse me?
JACK: That's terrible.
KIRK: No. That's awesome! Don't you get Ahhhh No.
DEVON: Ahhhh No.
STAINER: Sure, I get it. She needs a good guy like Kirky 'cause the guys she dates can't handle it, right?
KIRK: It sent Talon packing.
DEVON: Well, what's wrong with her?
KIRK: I don't know yet. Patty just said she had a physical issue.
DEVON: Well that could be anything. Did she say it was a birth defect?
KIRK: She said it was, "something like a birth defect."
JACK: What if it's something really bad?
KIRK: I hope it is. I hope it's something that would make most guys run screaming. It won't matter to me. I love her.
JACK: That's cool that you love her but it's pretty fucked up to be rooting for a harsh deformity.
DEVON: Oh, wow. What if this is Patty's way of telling you that Molly is a man?
STAINER: Hey, if that chick has a dick, I'll suck it!
MOLLY: Kirk, I'm so sorry about the piano thing. It was stupid of me.
KIRK: No. I know what you were trying to do. It's okay. I wish I could have played for her but.
MOLLY: Well, anyway, thanks for all your help with Katie's party. I know it meant a lot to her.
KIRK: They start cleaning up as fast as they can. Kirk is beaming!
MOLLY: Kirk, before we do this, there's something I'm really insecure about and you're going to see it sooner or later so.
KIRK: Hey, take a look at me.
MOLLY: Don't rush me. Okay, look.
KIRK: That's it?
MOLLY: If you can't handle it.
KIRK: Jesus Christ! I can't! I thought you were going to show me some kind of hairy growth or a third nipple or something I could work with!
MOLLY: What the hell is wrong with you!?
KIRK: You know what's wrong with me!? I'll tell you! I'm fat! I'm bald! I'm ugly! I'm hairy! I'm uncoordinated! I'm uncreative! I'm not a college graduate! I've never been to Europe! I have a shitty job! I drive a shitty car! You want me to go on!? Because I can!
MOLLY: So, here I think that the perfect Molly McCall is finally going to show me a good reason why she's messing around with the likes of me! And this is all you got!? You can't wear friggin' flip-flops!?
KIRK: So, here I think that the perfect Molly McCall is finally going to show me a good reason why she's messing around with the likes of me! And this is all you got!? You can't wear friggin' flip-flops!?
MOLLY: Kirk, I've given you plenty of good Oh, yeah! I'm nice! I'm funny! I ask cute, stupid questions! Right! That doesn't get a three hooked up with a ten! Not in this world!
KIRK: Oh, yeah! I'm nice! I'm funny! I ask cute, stupid questions! Right! That doesn't get a three hooked up with a ten! Not in this world!
MOLLY: A three what? What are you talking about!?
KIRK: Look! What the hell is going on here!? What are you up to!?
MOLLY: What am I up to!? Good God!
KIRK: Please, tell me you're a terrorist! Tell me you're on a scavenger hunt! Just tell me something that makes sense because all you're doing is driving me nuts!
MOLLY: ( hurt and resigned ) The only thing I'm going to tell you is that I'd like you to leave.
KIRK: Fine! I'm going! Webbed feet!? Are you fucking kidding me!?
KIRK: Go on, Habib. You're good.
HABIB: Really!? Great!
FULLER: You think you're pretty smart don't you Kettner. Thin ice mister!
STAINER: Kirky! Hold up, man! What are you doing!? You can't let her screw up your life!
KIRK: Get away from me Stainer!
STAINER: Whoa! Don't take it out on me! We both knew this Molly thing wasn't going to work out! It ain't my You're right. It's not your fault. It's my fault for listening to all your. pernicious advice.
KIRK: You're right. It's not your fault. It's my fault for listening to all your. pernicious advice.
STAINER: What the fuck you talkin' about?
KIRK: All you did was fill my head with all this crap about threes and tens and how I'm not worthy.
STAINER: Are you worthy of a chick like Maybe! I don't know. But that's not the point! You're supposed to be my God damned best friend. You know what!?
KIRK: Maybe! I don't know. But that's not the point! You're supposed to be my God damned best friend. You know what!?
STAINER: That is total bullshit!
KIRK: Then why weren't you there for me? What if she actually liked me!? Maybe with a little help, I could have pulled it off!
WILLY: It is Kirk and his crazy friend Stinker and they are most upset!
STAINER: Kirk, she was going to hurt you.
KIRK: Look at me! I'm hurt now!
WILLY: He's hurting now!
STAINER: The longer this went on the worse it would have been. I guarantee it!
KIRK: You don't know what you're talking He does not know!
WILLY: He does not know!
STAINER: Yes, I do, Kirk! I know exactly what I'm talking about.
WILLY: Perhaps he does know after all!
STAINER: Remember last year when you hardly saw me for about two months? I met my own perfect ten. Tina Jordan. Smart, cool and hot like you wouldn't believe. Hotter than Molly even.
KIRK: Yeah right. So how come I never heard a word about her until now?
WILLY: Yes, how come no word of this Tina!?
STAINER: I didn't tell anyone. I didn't want to jinx it. She was perfect. I was spilling over with.with fucking happy! You know?
WILLY: Fucking happy!
STAINER: Two months into it, she dumps me. And I knew it was coming. A girl like that. Sooner or later she was bound to get a better offer. But it kicked my ass, man. I was depressed for months.
KIRK: That's what that was? You said you had that fatigue syndrome thing.
STAINER: I didn't want everyone knowing what a pussy I was. Dude, it was a hurt I can't even put into words.
WILLY: What a pussy.
STAINER: I couldn't watch you go through that 'cause I love you, man. You're the brother I never had.
KIRK: You have a brother, Stainer.
STAINER: Yeah, but he's a cheese-dick.
KIRK: INT. LAW OFFICE Maury sits at his desk.
MAURY: Kirk? Geeze, I'm glad I caught you. Listen son, I got something to tell you and don't get mad at me okay? 'Cause this thing ain't my fault. You might want to sit down for this.
STAINER: INT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - DAY Patty sits behind a reception desk in a small but stylish lobby. A sign above her desk reads, "McCall Events." Kirk walks in. Patty puts down her work and stares back at him.
KIRK: Is Molly in?
PATTY: You got some big red apples showing your face around here again.
KIRK: I know. I'm sorry. I just. Is she here?
PATTY: No. Get lost.
STAINER: Listen, bitch.
PATTY: Who's your Mommy!? Come on! Who's your Mommy!?
STAINER: You are!
PATTY: That's right! Patty is, isn't she!
KIRK: Patty! Cut it out! I just came to tell her that something happened! Something really major happened!
STAINER: What happened?
PATTY: You shut your hole! ( to Kirk ) What First off, I'm sorry. Okay?
KIRK: First off, I'm sorry. Okay?
PATTY: Every time you say you're sorry, dumbshit here gets his bell rung.
KIRK: Okay, okay! Sorry! I just.
STAINER: Dude! Stop apologizing!
KIRK: Look! I know I was acting like an idiot. She's just so. Well, I was really having a hard time with everyone thinking I was Molly's brother or her co-worker or her gay friend or whatever. I mean, nobody believed that we were together.
PATTY: It's too late for this shit, Kirk.
KIRK: But I've got it worked out now.
STAINER: Patty drops Stainer on the floor.
PATTY: I thought she was a blackjack It turns out she bought stock in Caesars Palace back in the sixties. Nobody knew she still had it. I don't think she even knew.
KIRK: It turns out she bought stock in Caesars Palace back in the sixties. Nobody knew she still had it. I don't think she even knew.
PATTY: Wow. So, what does this have to do with Molly?
KIRK: See? Now it makes sense - me with her. I'm a millionaire now.
PATTY: So, what, now you can afford her!?
STAINER: No! No! I get it! It's not a whore thing! Now it works out in his own mind. Right!? He can relax and stop acting like a freak because now he's bringing something to the table! Right, Kirky!?
KIRK: Right. Well, no. Now that you say it out loud. I don't know.
PATTY: You know what, Kirk - I told Molly you were different but you're just as shallow and full of shit as the rest of them, aren't you?
KIRK: Yeah, maybe I am.
STAINER: Kirky! How you been, brother!? What are you doing here?
KIRK: Me and Marnie and the family are going to Branson. You know.
STAINER: So you're "Branson Bound."
KIRK: ( EMBARRASSED ) These were Marnie's idea. To make it easy for us to stick together.
MARNIE: Come on, Kirk.
KIRK: I gotta go.
STAINER: Relax, your flight doesn't leave for another forty five minutes.
KIRK: ( to Marnie ) I'll meet you guys down at the gate, alright?
ERIC: Hey Stainer! Long time no see! Take care, bro!
STAINER: Why is he so nice all of a sudden?
KIRK: Probably because I'm getting three million dollars next week.
STAINER: Shit, that's right. ( THEN ) So you're back with Marnie then, huh?
KIRK: Yeah, I know, but it's for the best. I'm more secure with her. I'm actually happy to be done with all that Molly craziness.
RON: Hey Stainer. Hey Pirate, can you spot me a twenty. I want to get me one of them travel pillows.
STAINER: How come I'm not a pirate!? ( then to Kirk ) Dude, do not tell me that he's going with you guys.
KIRK: He already bought his ticket and my dad likes him. It's no big deal.
STAINER: Look at me Big Slick.
KIRK: Look at me.
STAINER: Look at me.

GATE AGENT: Are you folks in the A group?
MARNIE: What difference does that make!?
GATE AGENT: Well, because you seem like a little bit of a B. May I see your boarding pass?
MARNIE: Fine. We're not in the A group but we're still getting on next.
GATE AGENT: Oh, it looks like you're a raging C. So, you're gonna want to take a seat until your group is called.
TINA: I really liked you Elmer, but all that stuff about me being a ten and how lucky you were and always checking up to see if I was going to dump you.
STAINER: Well, you did dump me, so.
TINA: What could I do? You were all up in my business all the time. I couldn't breathe.
STAINER: It was my stupid job, wasn't it? You were embarrassed.
TINA: I work at Orange Julius, Elmer! If you would have just chilled out and been yourself.

STAINER: Kirky! In junior high I peed my pants in class and Eric started calling me Stainer, remember?
KIRK: Okay, yeah?
STAINER: Pretty soon everyone else started calling me Stainer because they knew it would make me cry. Then you told me to own that name, to call myself Stainer so nobody could hurt me with it anymore.
KIRK: What's your point?
STAINER: My point is. um. Oh, shit. I was just in the crapper and I had this thing all worked out. Damn it.
PILOT: Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to exit the aircraft immediately.
STAINER: I'm going to have to ask you to fuck off immediately before I feed you your own fuckin' teeth!
KIRK: Jesus Stains! You're going to get arrested! And I won't be here to bail you out this time.
STAINER: Ooohh! That was my point! You saved me! That time and a bunch of other times too.
KIRK: Stainer, I appreciate that you think you're helping me but I'm with Marnie now.
STAINER: Kirk, Marnie's a fuckin' bitch. ( to Marnie ) All due respect.
MARNIE: Hit him Kirk! Or else I will!
STAINER: Kirk! You said Marnie makes you feel secure but security is bullshit! Look at our jobs! It's all for show! For all we know, there's a bomb on this plane right now!
HABIB: Fuller grabs Stainer by the collar.
