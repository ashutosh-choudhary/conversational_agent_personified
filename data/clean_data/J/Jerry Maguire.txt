JERRY'S VOICE: What started out as one page became twenty-five. Suddenly I was my father's son. I was remembering the simple pleasures of this job, how I ended up here out of law school, the way a stadium sounds when one of my players performs well on the field. I was remembering even the words of the late Dicky Fox, the original sports agent, who The key to this job is personal
DICKY FOX: The key to this job is personal
JERRY'S VOICE: And suddenly it was all pretty clear. The answer was fewer clients. Caring for them, caring for ourselves, and the games too. Starting our lives, really.

JERRY'S VOICE: ( continuing ) I didn't care. I had lost the ability to bullshit. It was the me I'd always wanted to be.

WOMAN: And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships. I mean, I crave this guy. and yet. why. why did I have that affair this weekend? Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
JERRY: I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
WOMAN: It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it. you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?! Tell me about your fiancee.

JERRY: A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months. Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months. It's like ka- boom. The curse of 18 months.
WOMAN: That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
JERRY: Exactly. And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
WOMAN: To the pools?
JERRY: To the pools. Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this "Hurry up, klutz."
WOMAN: Oh no
JERRY: Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet. And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know. And I decide I'm not going to propose. The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't. And she knows I know. So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that. We fly to Honolulu in silence. We check into the Pro Bowl hotel
WOMAN: How sad
JERRY: But wait.
RAY: ( waking up ) Shhh. Mommy's eavesdropping.
DOROTHY: Shhh. Mommy's eavesdropping.
JERRY'S VOICE: Now little do I know that my assistant. has assumed that I've now proposed. So she has gotten the lounge band to actually play "Here Comes The Bride" when we walk back in.
JERRY: Which they do. And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew. So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies. We're getting married in Jerry. You two will be together
WOMAN: Jerry. You two will be together
RAY: What's wrong, mom?
DOROTHY: First class is what's wrong. It used to be a better meal. Now it's a better life.

DOROTHY: I loved your memo, by the way.
JERRY: Thanks. actually, it was just a "Mission Statement."
DOROTHY: I think in this age, optimism like that. it's a revolutionary act.
JERRY: ( eager for feedback ) You think so?
DOROTHY: Oh tsht. Yes.
JERRY: I appreciate that, because some of that stuff. you know, it was two in the morning and.
DOROTHY: the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm"
DOROTHY: ( continuing ) "and we should all force open the tightly-clenched fist of commerce, and give a little back for the greater good.". I mean, I was inspired, and I'm an accountant. Ray, don't spill my

Thanks, though. Bye.
JERRY: ( amused ) Dorothy. Ray. A pleasure.

AVERY: ( continuing ) Never BETTER!!
AVERY: ( continuing ) Open your eyes. ( he does ) If you ever want me to be with another woman for you, I would do it. I'm not interested in it. There was a time, yes, it felt normal for me, but it was a phase, a college thing, like torn Levi's or law school for you. people change, but if you ever feel like being adventurous in that way, I would do it for you. You want anything from the kitchen I'm going to get some fruit
JERRY: ( to the next room ) You know. I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
AVERY: Who told you?
JERRY: One of the accountants.
AVERY: Jerry. Your buddy Dooler worked his ass off to make you a tribute film. All those guys from the office are coming. Everybody loves you. Just calm down, relax, act surprised, and have an amazing time. And you'll never guess who narrates your bachelor movie.
MICHAEL JORDAN: I have often wondered where my career would have been had Jerry Maguire been my agent. The answer Yugoslavia.
DOOLER: You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this Oh come on
JERRY: Oh come on
DOOLER: This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
JERRY: ( eying crowd ) You're imagining it.

MARCEE: Now I don't know what you do for your five-percent, but this man, my husband has a whole plan, an image. we majored in marketing, Jerry, and when you put him in a Waterbed Warehouse commercial, excuse me, you are making him common. He is pure gold and you're giving him "Waterbed Warehouse" when he deserves the big four shoe, car, clothing- line, soft-drink. The four jewels of the celebrity endorsement
MARCEE: ( continuing ) You gonna get that
JERRY: Not a chance.
JERRY: ( continuing ) Marcee, things are changing around here. You and Rod will have my total personal attention.

SUGAR: You read that memo I snuck to you, the guy's tired of the job. Tired of making you money.
JERRY: And when I got you that big contract in Chicago, and the fan poll in the Sun-Times was 93% against you, who went and found you that sympathetic journalist who turned it all around, it was
SUGAR: He's costing you money, Debra. he's oldschool.
JERRY: SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be? You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone. You'd be my only client on that team.
SUGAR: I've got the clients. I've got the juice.

LIVING ROOM NIGHT A living room filled with ten earnest, talkative Divorced Women. This is their talk group. We meet JAN, 30, who speaks shyly, thoughtfully, covering her braces often as she speaks. She holds a too-full glass of red wine. ( Much of the talk in this Women's Group will be improved by our cast of actresses )
JAN: I love men. I respect men. But that doesn't change the fact that most of them belong in cages.
LAUREL: What about medical?
DOROTHY: Of course, medical!
LAUREL: ( unconvinced ) You are a single mother. You have given up the right to be frivolous.

AVERY: It is the victory call of the competitive girl, and she falls back into a chair, kicking her expensive shoes onto the bed. In the b.g. we see the hungry look of her male co-workers. Part of them lusts after her. The larger part knows she would demolish them, and pick her teeth with their bones.

CUSH: He still goes number one, but San Diego wants to trade up with New England they want him bad.
JERRY: He still goes number one, but San Diego wants to trade up with New England they want him bad.
MATT: What happened to Denver?
JERRY: Denver got very silent about a day ago. San Diego's got a fever for Cush. This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft. People get crazy. And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight. I don't know, Jerry.
MATT: I don't know, Jerry.

AVERY: So honesty is outlawed here, I can't be honest?

AVERY: What was our deal when we first got together? Brutal truth, I think you added the "brutal."
JERRY: I think you added the "brutal."
AVERY: Jerry, there is a "sensitivity" thing that some people have. I don't have it. I don't cry at movies. I don't gush over babies. I don't start celebrating Christmas five months early, and I don't tell a man who just screwed up both of our lives 'oh, poor baby.' That's me. For better or worse. But I do love
JERRY: She knows what's coming. She moves fast to avoid him.
AVERY: Don't say it. We're both ragged out right now.
JERRY: She exits back into the main ballroom. For a moment, she stops. They face off. This is it. They are quickly interrupted by overweight, talk-show voiced CURTIS WEINTRAUB,

JERRY: ( continuing ) See this jacket I'm wearing? You like it? I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
TIDWELL: Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
JERRY: The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic
TIDWELL: ( shaking head ) It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime.
JERRY: It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime.
TIDWELL: You are not allowed to act this Why not?

TIDWELL: Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops! My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years. What's my family gonna live on? What you get me. So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
JERRY: ( ruefully, to Another drink please.
