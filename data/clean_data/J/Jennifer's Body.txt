JENNIFER'S BODY: Written by Diablo Cody
RAYMUNDO: Rec time in five minutes, Needy.
NEEDY: Grassy-ass, Raymundo.
NEEDY: ( ALOUD ) I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.
NUTRITIONIST: Just one Toastem, huh?
NEEDY: ( QUIETLY ) I like Toastems.
NUTRITIONIST: That's good. But I'm not sure a Toastem can provide you with sufficient energy for your day. I'd recommend more complex
NEEDY: I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP!
FUCK UP!: The nutritionist is KNOCKED OFF HER FEET as if she's been kicked by a far mightier creature than Needy and collapses, clutching her bleeding nose. We see that the bone has SNAPPED. The patients shriek. Chaos. As Needy is restrained by staff members, she thrashes like a trapped fish. Needy snorts up a killer LOOGIE and hocks it at the prone nutritionist. The glob nails her in the eye.
NEEDY: This is where it all went down. "Devil's Kettle" sounds twisted, I know, but the place just is named after a dumb waterfall.
JENNIFER: Needy PLUNGES through the window, screaming and brandishing a HAMMER. She takes a SWING at Jennifer's head, but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL, specifically in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster. Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES Jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her.
NEEDY: You'll throw me a bone, huh? Huh? You killed Chip! You goddamned monster! You.ZOMBITCH!
JENNIFER: ( GAGGING ) Do you buy all your murder weapons at Home Depot? God, you're butch.
NEEDY: Know what this is for? Cutting
JENNIFER: ( CHOKING ) My tit!
MRS. CHECK: Jennifer! What is it, baby? Oh my God! Oh my God!
NEEDY: Is she dead, Mrs. Check? Did I get
ROMAN: Christ, Needy, what have you done?
NEEDY: Hi, Roman! How's the Force treating you? I like that jaunty cap. Blue like your balls.
ROMAN: How could you do this, Needy?
NEEDY: Everything's going to be okay now. I rule.
FEMALE COP: Shut your mouth back there!
NEEDY: Hey. Didn't you used to baby-sit me in like 1998? When my mom worked the overnight at Hormel?
FEMALE COP: You're one to talk about brutality, Ms. Lesnicki. You're looking at attempted murder.
NEEDY: Ugh, don't say attempted. That sounds so JV. Small time. Teeny- weeny, just like Officer Duda up there. And trust me I'd know.
FEMALE COP: She's delirious.
ROMAN: ( MUTTERING ) This is going to be a circus.
FEMALE COP: At least we've already got a Confessions are for pussies. You've got a declaration, Grace.
NEEDY: Confessions are for pussies. You've got a declaration, Grace.
ROMAN: God, I love this song.
FEMALE COP: I know. And they've done so much for this town.
ROMAN: They're way more than a band, really. They're heroes.
FEMALE COP: Wait, this is my favorite part.
CHASTITY: You're totally lesbigay.
NEEDY: What? She's my best friend.
CHASTITY: You stare at her like you want to dry hump her.
NEEDY: ( INTERRUPTING ) Are you jealous?
CHASTITY: Of what? That rich bitch?
NEEDY: She's not rich.
JENNIFER: Hey, Monistat.
NEEDY: What's up, Vagisil?
JENNIFER: You and me are going out tonight.
NEEDY: Tonight? Why?
JENNIFER: Soft Shoulder are playing at the And it's all-ages, for once, which means I won't have to play Hello Titty with the door guy.
NEEDY: What's Soft Shoulder?
JENNIFER: They're this indie band from the city. I saw their MySpace and the singer is extra salty. And there will be lots of other salty morsels there for you. Come on Needy, it's the weekend!
NEEDY: It's Thursday.
JENNIFER: Thursday counts as the weekend in college. And we're going to be in college twenty-three months from now. University of Northern Minnesota Duluth- woo!
NEEDY: I have to study.
JENNIFER: ( SHOUTING ) Boo! Cross out Needy!
NEEDY: Fine. What time is the show?
JENNIFER: I'll pick you up at 8:30. My mom has a date with that guy who owns the ham store.
NEEDY: He seems nice.
JENNIFER: ( SMIRKING ) Yeah, Mom says he's got a huge. heart. So huge he gave her a recurring bladder infection. Wear something cool, okay?
NEEDY: INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE - 8:45 A.M. Needy is standing in a small, dingy bathroom, trying on different configurations of clothing.
CHIP: Those jeans are hella low. I can almost see your front butt.
NEEDY: Chip, it's a rock show. This is my rock look.
CHIP: I can see, like, your womb.
NEEDY: Jennifer needs me. She really wants to go see this band. It's extremely important to her.
CHIP: I've never even heard of Soft Shoulder. Which one is Jennifer The lead singer, of course. Girls like her don't go out with Thanks a lot!
NEEDY: The lead singer, of course. Girls like her don't go out with Thanks a lot!
CHIP: Thanks a lot!
NEEDY: No offense. I mean, she'd probably make an exception for a drummer who was also the lead singer.
CHIP: Like Phil Collins.
NEEDY: Who's Phil Collins?
CHIP: Forget it. He's seminal, but Anyway, this singer guy is like 22, so he could get locked up in the state pen if he actually dated her. But Jennifer says he's extra salty, so.
NEEDY: Anyway, this singer guy is like 22, so he could get locked up in the state pen if he actually dated her. But Jennifer says he's extra salty, so.
CHIP: Salty. You guys ever going to stop using that secret language?
NEEDY: "Salty" means beautiful.
CHIP: Then you must be soy sauce, babe.
NEEDY: Jennifer's here.
CHIP: How do you know?
JENNIFER: ( O.S. ) Needy, quit tampooning yourself and get down here!
CHIP: That's fucking weird.
NEEDY: ( straightening her
CLOTHES ): I'd better hurry.
CHIP: You always do what Jennifer tells you to do.
NEEDY: She's my best friend, Chip. Remember? This necklace is no
JENNIFER: ( GLOATING ) Guess who's got the whip `til 11:30? A 2003 Chrysler Sebring and it's all mine.
NEEDY: ( CONTINUED )
JENNIFER: You're lucky you get to ride with me to the club in style!
CHIP: I think you forgot, like, two I think she remembered two
NEEDY: I think she remembered two
JENNIFER: It smells like Thai food in here.
NEEDY: You're gross!
JENNIFER: Okay, let's go to the club. The Carousel is not a club.
CHIP: The Carousel is not a club.
JENNIFER: Eat my ass, Chip. You're just jello `cause you're not invited.
CHIP: I'm not jello! That place is gross. Everyone there has a You're totally jello! You're lime green jello and you can't even admit it.
JENNIFER: You're totally jello! You're lime green jello and you can't even admit it.
CHIP: ( calling after them ) Stop kidnapping my girlfriend!
JENNIFER: God, I can't wait until I'm old enough to get wasted. Have you ever had peach schnapps?
NEEDY: I don't think so.
JENNIFER: Peach schnapps are excellent. They even taste good when they come out of your nose mid-puke.
CRAIG: Hi Jennifer. You look nice.
JENNIFER: ( without enthusiasm ) What up, Craig.
NEEDY: Hey, it's Ahmet from India. The foreign exchange guy. He's all by I can't believe we traded a cute hockey player for that.
JENNIFER: I can't believe we traded a cute hockey player for that.
NEEDY: He seems okay. He's got that cool elephant statue in his locker.
JENNIFER: Do you think he's circumcised? I always wanted to try sea cucumber.
NEEDY: ROMAN DUDA saunters up to Jennifer, swigging a bottle of beer. He snatches the pack of cigarettes away from her.
ROMAN: You're smoking dicks now, Jen?
JENNIFER: What? I like the Wides.
ROMAN: I just bet you do. I should arrest you for possession under the legal Arrest me, pfft! You're not even out of the academy yet, Roman!
JENNIFER: Arrest me, pfft! You're not even out of the academy yet, Roman!
ROMAN: Two more months and I'm on the force for real. Then I'll be able to cuff you whenever the hell I
JENNIFER: How will I wait that long?
ROMAN: Not here, babe. I gotta keep my nose clean.
NEEDY: ( POINTING ) Look, there's the band!
JENNIFER: You can tell they're from the Yeah, `cause they look like a bunch of faygos.
ROMAN: Yeah, `cause they look like a bunch of faygos.
JENNIFER: You would think that. You're such a small-time Gomer. I wish we had more guys like that in Devil's Kettle. All stylish and shit.
NEEDY: They look so so cool.
JENNIFER: Hey, I think they need two groupies. Come on! It'll be like Almost Famous! I'll be Penny Lane and you can be the other girl.
NEEDY: Don't be J.V., Needy. They're just boys. Morsels. We have all the power, don't you know that?
JENNIFER: Don't be J.V., Needy. They're just boys. Morsels. We have all the power, don't you know that?
NIKOLAI: I'm Nikolai Wolf, and this is my
JENNIFER: ( AWKWARD ) Yeah! Soft Shoulder, right? I've heard you guys are super, super good at playing your instruments.
NIKOLAI: I hope we can live up to such.high praise.
NEEDY: Hey, if you don't mind me asking, why did you want to play all the way out here in Devil's Kettle? You live in the city, right?
NIKOLAI: Yeah. But I think it's so important to connect with our fans in rural areas. Plus, the audiences in small towns really appreciate us.
JENNIFER: Can I show you my appreciation right now?
NIKOLAI: ( GRIMACING )
DIRK: ( gesturing to Needy ) Who, Training Bra Jones?
NIKOLAI: No, the hot one. The one who just walked away. She's it, man. She's exactly what we're looking for.
DIRK: You're sure she's.
NIKOLAI: She's a kid. We're in God's country, man. Everyone out here's a fundie bible-banger. Of course she's a virgin.
DIRK: Fine. Okay. You know, I know I'm not "just the bassist." I'm a person who happens to play the bass guitar. And I would like some What? Are you scared of rock stars Those guys are rank, Jen. Just forget about it.
JENNIFER: What? Are you scared of rock stars Those guys are rank, Jen. Just forget about it.
NEEDY: Those guys are rank, Jen. Just forget about it.
JENNIFER: I think the singer wants me.
NEEDY: Only because he thinks you're a virgin. I heard them talking.
JENNIFER: Yeah, right! I'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to Roman. By the way, that hurts. I couldn't even go to flags the next day. I had to stay home and sit on a bag of frozen peas.
NEEDY: Oh my God.
JENNIFER: Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, I can do innocent. I'll be Little Miss Fucking Sunshine.
NEEDY: He's way too old for you.
JENNIFER: Don't cock-block me, Needy.
NIKOLAI: Good evening, Devil's Lake.
NEEDY: ( to Jennifer ) I know where to go!
JENNIFER: ( DAZED ) It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on fire. Oh God, I'm burning!
NEEDY: You're okay, I promise. You got burned worse when you wore that tin-foil bikini to the beach. Everything's fine. Are you girls all right?
NIKOLAI: Are you girls all right?
NEEDY: We're great. Maybe you should try to find your band?
NIKOLAI: Those guys? They were the first ones out the door. Ran for the van like a bunch of Marys. Frankly, I'm ashamed of them.
JENNIFER: She slumps against Nikolai's chest.
NIKOLAI: You're in shock. Here, drink this. You'll feel better.
NEEDY: Aren't you a little freaked out about this? What about all your stuff? It's probably melting, and when you get to the next stop you'll have to do like, a crappy acoustic set! Nobody likes that.
NIKOLAI: We'll be able to afford new gear soon enough. I have a feeling we're gonna blow up.
JENNIFER: ( SLURRING ) I want to see your van. C'mon Needy, let's go to the van.
NEEDY: Why? Why should we? We have the Malibu. Let's just get out of here. We can go to El Ojo and get Northwoods Nachos with extra Badger Sauce! Please? I'm Needy, stop it. Just stop it!
JENNIFER: Needy, stop it. Just stop it!
CROSS CUT: PHONE CALL:
CHIP: ( SLEEPILY ) Hey, Niedermeyer.
NEEDY: Thank God you're there. I hoped you were sleeping with your phone.
CHIP: What's wrong?
NEEDY: Jennifer's gone. She ran off with that rock band. And the Carousel burned down.
CHIP: Like, burned down? To the ground? Is everyone okay?
NEEDY: No. I think they're mostly dead.
CHIP: Shit. You're okay, right?
NEEDY: We went out the bathroom window. Everyone else was trying to use the door. It was like a stampede. The people who fainted got run over and you could hear their bones breaking.
CHIP: This is real, right? This isn't just, like, some crazy dream like last time?
NEEDY: No! Anyway, it took me like an hour to walk home. But Jennifer's still with those creeps! They had one of those white molester vans with no windows. The back was all blacked out.
CHIP: Who cares about Jennifer and those douchebags with douchebag haircuts? People just burned to death. In our town!
NEEDY: ( FRANTIC ) Oh cheese and fries! Someone's here. I'm alone, Chip. I'm freaked Where's your mom?
CHIP: Where's your mom?
NEEDY: Swing shift. Listen, I'll call you in a minute. Stay awake.
CHIP: ( SLEEPILY ) Holla back.
NEEDY: Um, Jennifer?
JENNIFER: ( WHISPERING ) Are you scared?
NEEDY: ( screaming after her )
GOSSIPING GIRL: ( WHISPERING ) I heard Needy and Jennifer were there and they had to fight their way out with a machete.
OTHER GIRL: Look, she's not even moving.
GOSSIPING GIRL: It's called Post Traumatic Stress
JENNIFER: Happy Friday!, D-bag!
NEEDY: You you're all right!
JENNIFER: Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
NEEDY: Last night. At my house. You were hurt. You had two black eyes and blood everywhere and.
JENNIFER: Needy, you're delusional. I got a little banged up when you made me go out that window, but I'm fine.
NEEDY: ( DUMBFOUNDED ) We had to go out that window. The bar was like, engulfed in flames!
JENNIFER: You do have a tendency to overreact. Remember at Girl Scout camp when you thought there was an earthquake and it was really just two guys with a ghetto blaster?
NEEDY: A lot of people died, Jennifer. They burned to death, or they choked, or they just got trampled. More than half of the people there didn't make it out. It's like, all over the news. National news. Kids are dead. Parents are dead.
JENNIFER: Anyone we know?
NEEDY: We know everyone!
JENNIFER: Sucks to be them, I guess.
NEEDY: I don't get it. What's wrong with
JENNIFER: What's wrong with you? I mean, besides the obvious surface flaws.
NEEDY: ( to herself ) There's no way I dreamed it. No
NEEDY: Work, you.twat! Swiff, darn it! Swiff! Swiff!
JENNIFER: Don't talk to yourself. It's one of your more freakish Needy behaviors and it makes us both look like total gaylords.
MR. WROBLEWSKI: I'm sure those of you who made it here today have all heard the news. It's a dark day for Devil's Kettle, a day we can never, ever
JENNIFER: No way! Parrish ate shit?
MR. WROBLEWSKI: This tragedy is obviously beyond anything we can measure. More than ever, we need to band together and draw strength from each other.
JENNIFER: ( DRY ) Oh look, they're united in grief. That'll last.
CHIP: No band practice today.
NEEDY: No anything today.
CHIP: It's surreal, right? I mean, when just one guy dies in Devil's Kettle, it's like time stops. And now so many people are dead, nobody knows when it's okay to start again.
NEEDY: I feel guilty just breathing.
CHIP: Chip, I need to tell you something kind of weird. It's about You know last night when we were talking and someone came to my door? That was Jennifer. But she didn't talk. She just stood there, smiling at me, but a bad kind of smile. She looked like she'd been beat up or shot or something. She was all bloody.

CHIP: Yuck. Like those porcupine meatballs my mom makes with the rice sticking out?
NEEDY: Yeah, like almost that bad!
CHIP: It was probably because she inhaled a whole bunch of smoke.
NEEDY: No. It was something evil.
CHIP: You might want to talk to the school shrink, Needy. I'm not saying that to be a dillhole. I'm actually kinda concerned.
NEEDY: Chip, I'm a National Merit Scholar. I don't tell whoppers and I'm not crazy.
CHIP: I didn't say you were crazy. It's just that everyone's a little messed up about this. It's okay to Yeah, you know. Fucked up.
NEEDY: Yeah, you know. Fucked up.
CHIP: Yeah, you know. Fucked up.
COLIN: Hi Needy.
NEEDY: Oh. Hi, Colin.
COLIN: ( DRAMATIC ) I heard you were there last night. In the fiery trenches.
NEEDY: Well, I'm glad you made it out.
COLIN: Well, I'm glad you made it out.
NEEDY: Colin walks away. Chip looks jealous.
CHIP: How are you friends with Colin Gray? I thought Colin Gray only talked to the Dead Girls. I just am. We have Composition together. He's a really good writer. You know he's so dark and emotional and all.
NEEDY: I just am. We have Composition together. He's a really good writer. You know he's so dark and emotional and all.
CHIP: Oh. I can relate. I'm also like that, even if I'm not all obvious about it like a poseur.
NEEDY: Walk me home?
CHIP: You know it.
JENNIFER: ( ALARMED ) Oh. Hey, Jennifer.
JONAS: ( ALARMED ) Oh. Hey, Jennifer.
JENNIFER: I'm crazy-sorry about your profound loss. You are crying about Craig, right?
JONAS: He was my best friend.
JENNIFER: I know. I was close to him too. You know, I was there last night in that horrible place. I saw Craig a few minutes before the fire broke out.
JONAS: You you did?
JENNIFER: Yeah. I was probably the last person to talk to him. Like, ever. Wow. What did he say?
JONAS: Wow. What did he say?
JENNIFER: Well, we got to talking about you, actually. And do you know what he said? He said you were like a brother to him. Not a bro. An actual brother.
JONAS: ( choking up ) I just can't believe he's gone.
JENNIFER: I know, I know.
JONAS: Forget it. It's too intense.
JENNIFER: Forget it. It's too intense.
JONAS: What? Please, Jen, you've gotta tell me!
JENNIFER: Well, he said he always thought you and me would make a totally bangin' couple. Isn't that so He said bangin'?
JONAS: He said bangin'?
JENNIFER: ( WHISPERING ) Feel my heart, Jonas. I think it's ( choking up ) Mine too.
JONAS: ( choking up ) Mine too.
JENNIFER: Come with me. Just for a while. We'll help each other get through this nightmare. It's what Craig would have wanted.
CHIP: The whole night must be a total blur, right?
NEEDY: That's the thing, it's not a blur at all! I remember everything, in like ultra-high-def detail. The band, the fire, everything. Especially what happened after.
CHIP: "After" is the part I don't really get, to be honest.
NEEDY: Please, I need someone to believe me. Jennifer was she was destroyed. She was dying in my hallway, Chip. I saw. I used my CPR training to check her pulse. And I felt her dying, on the inside, I mean. I've known her so long that it's like sometimes I can feel what she feels. We're like E.T. and Elliot Ness.
CHIP: I believe you.
NEEDY: Thanks, Chipper.
JONAS: You feel so warm. Why are you so
JENNIFER: ( firmly covering his
MOUTH ): She pulls off Jonas' shirt and digs her nails into his arms, kissing him with renewed ferocity.
JONAS: ( MUFFLED ) Jennifer! Jen.
JENNIFER: He gestures to the ANIMALS, who are watching, still as statues. A few crows alight on a nearby tree.
JONAS: He gestures to the ANIMALS, who are watching, still as statues. A few crows alight on a nearby tree.
JENNIFER: Mm-hmm. They're waiting.
JONAS: Uh, okay.
JENNIFER: Do you miss Craig?
JONAS: ( STARTLED ) Of course.
JENNIFER: Don't worry. You're going to see your buddy again.
JONAS: You mean like in heaven someday?
JENNIFER: She smiles and shakes her head. Jonas jerks back, creeped out. He tries to pull away from Jennifer, but she's too strong. She PINS him to the tree. We see her jaw begin to UNHINGE, like some horrible snake. Her eyes cloud over with blood.
MR. WROBLEWSKI: ( to himself ) God, they're feeling so much pain.
NEEDY: Fried bologna is the bomb! You want some, Greedo?
RADIO DJ: That was Soft Shoulder, the local band who became the unlikely heroes of the tragedy in Devil's Kettle last night. Eyewitnesses say the boys helped numerous people escape the inferno, risking their own lives in the process. That's rock n' roll with a conscience, ladies and gentlemen. Had a lot of requests for that
MR. WROBLEWSKI: Virgin Mother!
NEEDY: Needy's mom, ANTONIA "TONI" LESNICKI, has quietly entered the kitchen in her pajamas. She's pale and sweaty, as if she's been spooked.
TONI: You said it.
NEEDY: Oh, hi, Mom. I didn't know you were awake.
TONI: I just had one of my night It's four o' clock, so technically you had a day terror.
NEEDY: It's four o' clock, so technically you had a day terror.
TONI: Right, right. I'm all mixed up since I started working swing What did you dream about?
NEEDY: What did you dream about?
TONI: I dreamed some bad people were trying to nail me to a tree with hammers and big stakes and shit. Just like Jesus.
NEEDY: ( SMILING ) Yes you are.
TONI: It's like, don't y'all touch my daughter. I'll piss on you like You know, I can take care of myself, Mom.
NEEDY: You know, I can take care of myself, Mom.
TONI: That's what you think. One of these days you're gonna be crying out for me and I might not be Hey Mom? Did you get a chance to catch the news after you clocked out this morning?
NEEDY: Hey Mom? Did you get a chance to catch the news after you clocked out this morning?
TONI: No. I just did my scratch tickets, snorted a few Lunesta and went straight to bed. Is something going on?
NEEDY: Nothing. Forget it.
TONI: Don't nothing happen in Devil's
NEEDY: Yes ma'am.
OFFICER WARZAK: We will get the man that did this to your son. You hear me? We'll get that sick M.F.
JONAS'S DAD: I'll get him myself! I will! You hear me, you bastard? I'll cut off your nutsack and nail it to my door! Like one of those lion doorknockers rich folks got! That'll be your balls!
NEEDY: Needy speaking.
CROSS CUT: PHONE CALL:
JENNIFER: I feel sooo scrumptious!
NEEDY: Good for you.
JENNIFER: You know, like when you kiss a hot guy for the first time and your whole body feels like it's on It's that good.
NEEDY: It's that good.
JENNIFER: It's that good.
NEEDY: Lucky you. See, I'm still kind of depressed about, you know, the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of town?
JENNIFER: Move-on dot org, Needy! It's over. Life's too short to mope over some white-trash pig roast.
NEEDY: That's really nice.
JENNIFER: I tell it like it is. Besides, you should be happy for me. I'm having the best day since, like Jesus invented the calendar.
NEEDY: Jesus didn't invent the calendar.
JENNIFER: So blow it off.
NEEDY: It'll just be a second.
JENNIFER: Pooh. I'm crossing you out. I need to see you right now.
CHIP: I need to see you right now.
NEEDY: I can barely hear you.
CHIP: Camille is playing piano. Knock it off, Camille!
CAMILLE: You knock it off!
CHIP: Can you meet me at McCullum in You knock it off, Chip! You're penis cheese!
CAMILLE: You knock it off, Chip! You're penis cheese!
NEEDY: Back on JENNIFER: Jennifer is impatiently dragging a razor down her arm. Blood drips onto the rug. She smiles, in awe of herself.
JENNIFER: What could possibly be more important than me and my godlike I have to meet Chip at McCullum Chip is looking cute to me lately. So tell me, is he packing some serious pubic inches? What's the story down there?
NEEDY: I have to meet Chip at McCullum Chip is looking cute to me lately. So tell me, is he packing some serious pubic inches? What's the story down there?
JENNIFER: Chip is looking cute to me lately. So tell me, is he packing some serious pubic inches? What's the story down there?
NEEDY: ( QUICKLY ) I gotta go.
NEEDY: Why are the cops at your house?
CHIP: They're not. They're at Jonas Kozelle's house. He got murdered.
NEEDY: What?! Like, he was shot by No, Needy! Do you see anyone rollin' on dubs around here?
CHIP: ( EXASPERATED ) No, Needy! Do you see anyone rollin' on dubs around here?
NEEDY: Some animals must've got to him.
CHIP: Human teethmarks.
NEEDY: Who would do that?
CHIP: I don't know. It just happened after school. No one's supposed to know yet, but my dad went over there and talked to the cops. Jonas's mom is catatonic. She's just staring out the front window like a zombie mannequin robot This can't be a coincidence.
NEEDY: This can't be a coincidence.
CHIP: What do you mean, Needy?
NEEDY: A fiery death trap last night, and now a cannibal eats our starting tight-end? Come on!
CHIP: Don't get spooky on me, babe.
NEEDY: Seriously Chip. Most small towns only have something gruesome happen like, once every decade maybe. Devil's Kettle gets two nightmares in 24 hours? It's freaktarded. It's not right.
CHIP: What, do you think it's, like I don't know. I'm extremely intelligent but I obviously don't know everything.
NEEDY: I don't know. I'm extremely intelligent but I obviously don't know everything.
CHIP: Well, the bad luck's gotta be over now, right? It can't get any worse, right? Obviously it can't. It can't. I mean, you agree, right? There won't be another You're shaking.
NEEDY: You're shaking.
CHIP: I'm cold. It's very cold out here.
NEEDY: Want my sweater?
CHIP: It's pink.
NEEDY: Pink is cool. Rap guys wear pink.
"WHY?": The headline of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reads: "'BUTCHERED': Devil's Kettle youth brutally murdered in wake of devastating fire."
MOURNERS: ( SINGING ) Through the trees, I will find
MR. WROBLEWSKI: Before the period ends, I have an As you know, this is the one month anniversary of the Carousel fire and also the murder of Jonas
JENNIFER: We see Jennifer. She looks haggard, thin, and cranky.
NEEDY: ( WHISPERING ) Are you okay?
JENNIFER: No. I feel like boo-boo. My skin is breaking out. My hair is dull and lifeless. God, it's like I'm one of the normal girls!
NEEDY: Are you PMS-ing or something?
JENNIFER: PMS isn't real, Needy. It was invented by the boy-run media to make us seem crazy.
NEEDY: Mr. Wroblewski clears his throat, annoyed by their A ripple of excitement in the room. A girl seated in the front row is wearing a Soft Shoulder T-SHIRT.
MR. WROBLEWSKI: .As I was saying, Needy and Jennifer, I finally have some good news to share with all of you. The members of the rock group Soft Shoulder have decided to extend a helping hand to our community.
NEEDY: What about the other 97%?
MR. WROBLEWSKI: Excuse me?
NEEDY: The other 97%. I mean, that's just crass. Right?
CHASTITY: Soft Shoulder are American heroes.
NEEDY: No, they're not. I was there, Chastity. They didn't actually help anyone escape the fire. I don't even know how that rumor got Rumor?! RUMOR? It's true! It's on their Wikipedia page!
CHASTITY: Rumor?! RUMOR? It's true! It's on their Wikipedia page!
NEEDY: Oh, that's crap.

CHASTITY: ( growling, almost
POSSESSED ): You take that back, Needy Lesnicki! We need them now more then ever!
MR. WROBLEWSKI: That's enough.
NEEDY: I'm already sick of that song.
JENNIFER: Yeah. It's poorly produced. Could the bass be any lower in the mix?
NEEDY: No offense, but you look kind of drained. Is everything all right?
JENNIFER: I'm fine. It's just, like, wearing off or something.
NEEDY: What's wearing off?
JENNIFER: No, dick ridge! Just forget I said
COLIN: ( to Needy ) ( to Jennifer, more
NERVOUSLY ): Hi, Jennifer.
JENNIFER: Oh, hey Colin. Listen, can I copy your bio lab again? I never got around to dissecting that kitten Sure. Actually, I sort of wanted to ask you something.
COLIN: Sure. Actually, I sort of wanted to ask you something.
JENNIFER: Oh. You want to know if I'll go out with you.
COLIN: No! Well yeah.
JENNIFER: Just go ahead with the pitch.
COLIN: Well, we've been having a lot of fun in class, you and I, and I just thought maybe we could go to a movie or something. There's a midnight showing of Rocky Horror at the Bijou next weekend.
JENNIFER: I don't like boxing movies.
COLIN: It's not.fuck it. Never mind.
JENNIFER: Colin turns around.
COLIN: Oh. Great! Okay.
JENNIFER: I'll text you my address.
NEEDY: That was random.
JENNIFER: I'm used to guys asking me out.
NEEDY: Colin's a really nice guy.
JENNIFER: He's into maggot-rock. He wears nail polish.
CHIP: ( FLIRTATIOUS ) Hi Chip.
JENNIFER: ( FLIRTATIOUS ) Hi Chip.
CHIP: ( to Needy ) Talking to your good pal Colin Gray again?
NEEDY: No. He was just asking Jennifer out on a date.
CHIP: Can I come over tonight?
NEEDY: Sure. I'd like that.
CHIP: I went to Super Target and bought more condoms.
NEEDY: Not that that has anything to do with my coming over.
CHIP: Not that that has anything to do with my coming over.
NEEDY: I didn't assume that.
CHIP: Well, I'll see you tonight.
CHIP: For ambiance. It's Jammin' My mom has Holiday Scents too, if you're interested.
NEEDY: My mom has Holiday Scents too, if you're interested.
CHIP: My mom has Holiday Scents too, if you're interested.
NEEDY: No, this is nice.
COLIN: He stumbles over a stray 2 x 4. There are piles of sawdust and building materials everywhere the house is definitely still under construction. Colin looks A MOUSE skitters over his sneakers.
NEEDY: ( READING ) "Sensual Swirl?"
CHIP: It's supposed to make it feel good for the girl.
NEEDY: Oh. Cool.
JENNIFER: You made it.
COLIN: What's going on? This isn't really your house, is it?
JENNIFER: No baby. This is our house, just for you and me. We can play Mommy and Daddy.
COLIN: Do you even know my last name?
JENNIFER: Silly. I've been sending you signals all year. Couldn't you tell? You give me such a wettie.
NEEDY: Oh. It's got little bumps on it. I can hardly wait.
COLIN: Jennifer looks over her shoulder and giggles.
JENNIFER: You scared? I thought boys like you were into vermin.
COLIN: ( FAINTLY ) No way.
JENNIFER: Oh, don't you dare pass out! I need you to be conscious.
COLIN: I gotta go.
JENNIFER: I need you frightened.
NEEDY: ( SOFTLY )
CHIP: What? Am I hurting you?
CHIP: Is it something I did?
NEEDY: ( GAGGING ) It's her.
CHIP: Do you need more foreplay?
CHIP: ( CONTINUED )
NEEDY: I have to go. I'm sorry. I just. feel like something.something You feel What does that even mean? I'm worried about you.
CHIP: You feel What does that even mean? I'm worried about you.
NEEDY: I'm so sorry, Chip. I'm so sorry. Everything is just wrong.
NEEDY: Fudge! Fudge! Maple fudge!
RADIO DJ: That was, of course, Soft Shoulder. They're going to be playing a benefit concert in Devil's Kettle next month. Talk about giving back to the community! Generous guys, I tell
NEEDY: Mommy! Mommy? Please be home!
LITTLE JENNIFER: I'll be Perfect Prom Barbie and you be her.
LITTLE NEEDY: Why do I have to be Ugly Ashley?
LITTLE JENNIFER: You can be Ugly Ashley or Ken.
LITTLE NEEDY: What's wrong, Jennifer?
LITTLE JENNIFER: ( trying to swear like Damn! Ass!
OWWWWWW!: ( trying to swear like Damn! Ass!
LITTLE NEEDY: Better. We should get a Band-Aid We're sisters now, you know.
LITTLE JENNIFER: We're sisters now, you know.
NEEDY: I never tell on you.
JENNIFER'S VOICE: What's up, Monistat?
JENNIFER: God, enough screaming already. You're such a cliche.
NEEDY: Get out!
JENNIFER: But we always share your bed when we have slumber parties.
NEEDY: What the fuck is happening?
JENNIFER: Whoa. I have never heard you drop the F-bomb before. What's buggin'?
NEEDY: I saw you! I saw you! The Buh-buh-buh. Slow down, tardy slip. You sound like a sped.
JENNIFER: ( MIMICKING ) Buh-buh-buh. Slow down, tardy slip. You sound like a sped.
NEEDY: I'm calling the police.
JENNIFER: Go ahead, narc me out. I've got the cops in my back pocket. I'm fucking a cadet, remember?
NEEDY: What do you want?
JENNIFER: I want to explain some things to you. You've already seen too much and besides best friends don't keep secrets. Right?
NEEDY: Yeah, it rings a bell.
JENNIFER: Well, I got pretty messed up. I almost died. You know those guys in Soft Shoulder? Totally evil. They're basically agents of Satan with awesome haircuts. I figured that out as soon as I got into their molester van.
JENNIFER: Guys? Where are we going?
NIKOLAI: Shut your mouth, object.
DIRK: ( NERVOUSLY )
JENNIFER: Are you guys rapists?!
NIKOLAI: You wish.
MICK: ( to band members ) Hey guys? Do we even know if she's a virgin?
JENNIFER: Yes.yes! Of course I'm a virgin! I've never done sex ever. I don't even know how. So maybe you should find some other girl who does. Know how.
NIKOLAI: Told you, Dirk. You owe me a beer.
DIRK: ( PREOCCUPIED ) Sure, man.
NEEDY: What did they do to you?
JENNIFER: Just let me finish. So they drove all the way out to the falls. I tried to figure out an escape, but it was so dark out there.
NIKOLAI: We got a waxing moon. Perfection.
MICK: You're the man, Wolf.
DIRK: I don't know if we should go through with this.
NIKOLAI: ( ANGRILY ) Do you want to be rich and famous like the guy from Maroon 5? Or do you want to be a huge suicidal ( SADLY ) Maroon 5.
DIRK: ( SADLY ) Maroon 5.
NIKOLAI: Then grow a pair and fetch me the ritual! God.
MICK: That's it?
NIKOLAI: What? I found it on Google.
JENNIFER: ( WHISPERING ) My name is Jennifer.
NIKOLAI: That's fascinating.
JENNIFER: Please let me go. I'll do anything. Anything you want.
NIKOLAI: I only hump nines and tens. You're a seven at best, even with the chicken cutlets.
JENNIFER: ( DESPERATE ) Maybe you could just hire a publicist. Make some T-shirts or something. Hey, I could be on your street team!
NIKOLAI: Sorry, darling.
JENNIFER: ( LOUDLY ) Start chanting, boys.
NIKOLAI: ( LOUDLY ) Start chanting, boys.
DIRK: Dude, that is a hot murder weapon!
NIKOLAI: It's a bowie knife.
DIRK: Bowie. Nice.
NIKOLAI: "There's a starman waiting in the "He'd really like to meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds."
BAND: "He'd really like to meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds."
JENNIFER: Being tortured would make most girls black out or something. But I'm so hard core, I was with them the whole time. I could feel them gutting me Under my ribs, up into my belly, then right through my They.killed you.
NEEDY: They.killed you.
JENNIFER: I'm here, aren't I?
NEEDY: ( SOTTO ) Maybe it did.
JENNIFER: Whatever. Anyway, I don't really remember what happened after that. I just woke up a few hours later and found my way back, somehow.
NEEDY: I remember.
JENNIFER: I couldn't bring myself to hurt you. I mean, I'm a really good friend. But I felt so hungry. I had to do something.
JENNIFER: Ahmet. You made it out.
JENNIFER: Ever since then, I just somehow knew what I needed to do to be strong. And when I'm fulllike I am right nowI'm like, immortal! I can do stuff like this. No biggie. Watch.
NEEDY: What do you mean, "when you're You know. Full. Like full of tasty
JENNIFER: You know. Full. Like full of tasty
NEEDY: What about my mom's Kia? Why did you attack me out there? Why were you covered in blood? You didn't even look human.
JENNIFER: You should talk to someone about these disturbing thoughts you're having. We're all concerned. Especially Chip. I think he's having second thoughts about you.
NEEDY: ( FORCEFUL ) My, aren't we a C-U-Next-Tuesday?
JENNIFER: My, aren't we a C-U-Next-Tuesday?
NEEDY: GET OUT! Come on. Let me stay the night. We can play "boyfriend/girlfriend" like we used to.
GET OUT!: Come on. Let me stay the night. We can play "boyfriend/girlfriend" like we used to.
JENNIFER: Come on. Let me stay the night. We can play "boyfriend/girlfriend" like we used to.
NEEDY: What are you doing?
JENNIFER: You said to leave. So I'm outtie-
PRIEST: We gather here today to celebrate the life of Colin Gray, who was plucked from the prime of.
MR. GRAY: These are Colin's friends.
GOTH BOY: Colin! Take me with you! I belong down there! In the DAAAARKNESS!
GOTH GIRL: No, Kevin. Those are just his fleshly remains. He's among the dark angels of the realm now. Fly, Colin. Fly into the firmament.
GOTH BOY: Is it cool if we camp here for a few days? We want to commune with his corpse. He was our spooky Children, this is a private service for family only.
PRIEST: Children, this is a private service for family only.
GOTH GIRL: ( to Colin's mother ) Oh, right. I need to ask you something, Mrs. Gray. It's really important for me to have closure.
PRIEST: Young lady, have some respect for this family.
MRS. GRAY: ( waving him off ) No. It's fine.
GOTH GIRL: Is it true that Colin had a date with Jennifer Check the night he was killed?
MR. GRAY: Did he.?
GOTH GIRL: Have a date with Jennifer Check.
GOTH BOY: Um, Chloe? Maybe you should be mad at the person who murdered Colin. All Jennifer Check did was invite him over to watch Aquamarine.
GOTH GIRL: That's WORSE!
GOTH BOY: Colin wouldn't have liked this.
MRS. GRAY: ( losing it ) Oh, you think so, Powder? Yeah, you're right! I'm pretty sure my son wouldn't have liked being eaten by a fucking CANNIBAL and buried before his eighteenth birthday! Wow, you must have known him so well!
MR. GRAY: The goth boy looks terrified. But Mrs. Gray's not done ranting yet.
MRS. GRAY: By the time they found Colin in that godforsaken house, he looked like lasagna with teeth. I'd know I had to identify the remains. My boy's not in the realm of the undead. He's not flying around in the firmament with magical wings of flame. He's in an overpriced rosewood box that's headed six feet downtown.
CHIP: Hey. Did you buy Turnabout tickets yet? I don't get paid until next I gotta show you something.
NEEDY: I gotta show you something.
CHIP: What is it?
NEEDY: Not here. Behind the school.
CHIP: What is it?
NEEDY: ( WEARILY ) Is this about Jennifer?
CHIP: ( WEARILY ) Is this about Jennifer?
NEEDY: Yes, but I promise you this is the last thing I need to show y
CHIP: ( INTERRUPTING ) Needy, I care about you. A lot. As a person, not just a girl I made love to for four minutes the other night. And I'm scared of what's happening to you. You're acting really fucked up.
NEEDY: Please just let me show you.
NEEDY: Look at this.
CHIP: ( CONFUSED ) Demonic transference. It's something that happens when you try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan without using an actual virgin!
NEEDY: Demonic transference. It's something that happens when you try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan without using an actual virgin!
CHIP: She's eating boys! They make her strong. Really strong. And when she's hungry, she gets weak and cranky and her hair is all full of split ends. And look at this.
NEEDY: She's eating boys! They make her strong. Really strong. And when she's hungry, she gets weak and cranky and her hair is all full of split ends. And look at this.
CHIP: Youyou really think Jennifer killed Jonas and Colin?
NEEDY: And possibly Ahmet from India.
CHIP: Really? You think she ate those No. No! Of course not!
NEEDY: No. No! Of course not!
CHIP: Is that what you think?
NEEDY: No.Listen, I'll make an appointment with Mr. Feely. I'm real sorry about this sudden onset of teenage paranoia.
CHIP: It's all right, Needy.
NEEDY: This has been a crummy school year, Chip.
CHIP: No shit.
NEEDY: Listen, I'm done with all that devil stuff. Do you know what you're wearing to Turnabout?
CHIP: I was thinking a suit with black shoes and a boutonniere, right
CHIP: What color dress are you gonna wear? I need to order your wrist I don't know yet.
NEEDY: I don't know yet.
CHIP: How about magenta? You're definitely a winter. My mom says winters should wear regal jewel tones like magenta. Or possibly Oh yeah, your mom's an Avon lady.
NEEDY: Oh yeah, your mom's an Avon lady.
CHIP: Well, they call them "sales reps" Right. Well, I'll try to find something magenta.
NEEDY: Right. Well, I'll try to find something magenta.
CHIP: That'll look dope.
EVENING: A group of student council kids are putting the finishing touches on the dance decorations. The theme is "Through the Trees" and there are papier mache trees everywhere.
TONI: You look beautiful.
NEEDY: I look pork stupid.
TONI: No, you've got that tiny waist, like a fashion model. I always thought you looked like Cindy
NEEDY: Who's Cindy Crawford?
TONI: One of the great beauties of our time. She's even got a mole like you, except hers is on her face.
NEEDY: Ow! You're too close to my neck.
TONI: Well, if Chip gives you a hickey, you can just tell everyone I burned you.
NEEDY: Gross, Mom. Chip isn't that Now that's a word you don't hear every day. Hold still.
TONI: Now that's a word you don't hear every day. Hold still.
NEEDY: What are you doing to my hair?
TONI: Hooker helmet.
NEEDY: ( GROANING ) Aw, jeez Mom!
TONI: If you can't have big what-nots, you might as well have big hair!
CHIP: I'm in underpants, Mom!
CHIP'S MOM: I need to give you something.
CHIP: Hang on.
CHIP'S MOM: I've been thinking about it for a while, and I think you need to be carrying this. There's obviously a sicko out there who likes boys. Boys your age. And I don't want you going out there unarmed.
CHIP: I can take care of myself. I've been using the Bowflex.
CHIP'S MOM: Did you hear what Colin Gray looked like when they found him?
CHIP: Lasagna with teeth?
CHIP'S MOM: You heard. So unless you want to wind up looking like another exotic Eye-talian dish, take Mommy's rape spray.
CHIP: Meeting her at the dance. I'm gonna walk. It's so warm outside. It's like 40.
CHIP'S MOM: I want pictures with your sister before you go.
CHIP: Yes, ma'am.
CHIP'S MOM: One more. Back to back. Big smiles. Camille, we don't touch ourselves down there. That's our lady garden.
GOTH GIRL: ( popping balloon ) This is my heart.
GOTH GIRL: I hate your guts, Madison.
MR. WROBLEWSKI: Can I have everyone's attention Welcome to the Turnabout Dance. I hope you've all had an opportunity to consume the Pecan Sandies and Cran-Grape that were so generously donated by the Parents Club.
JENNIFER: CHIP makes an incoherent noise and jumps as Jennifer appears, improbably, right in front of him. She's wearing a gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect.
CHIP!: CHIP makes an incoherent noise and jumps as Jennifer appears, improbably, right in front of him. She's wearing a gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect.
CHIP: You weren't calling my name.
JENNIFER: Yes, I was.
CHIP: I couldn't hear it.
JENNIFER: I think you were maybe spacing out. You were like this: Derrrrr.
CHIP: I was?
JENNIFER: Yes, exactly like that. Listen, I need to talk to you about you-know- who. Our little Needy.
CHIP: I know.
JENNIFER: Are you worried? `Cause I'm super- stressed about her. God knows how I even sleep at night.
CHIP: She hasn't been the same for I think I know what's wrong with her. In fact, I know I know what's wrong with her.
JENNIFER: I think I know what's wrong with her. In fact, I know I know what's wrong with her.
CHIP: Then tell me.
JENNIFER: I feel bad telling you this.
CHIP: Say it!
JENNIFER: Needy and Colin were intimate. By that I mean he was poking her donut on a semi-regular basis.
CHIP: Needy's not like that.
JENNIFER: That's what she wants you to believe. But trust me, her and Colin were doing stuff you haven't even heard of. Total varsity But you were with Colin the night he was killed.
CHIP: But you were with Colin the night he was killed.
JENNIFER: Well, apparently he had a thing for me no surprise there. And I figured Needy was busy jumping your jock that night, so I agreed to a little pity date. Colin brought me to that empty house so we could have some privacy. But he wanted to go too far, so I left after a few minutes. Next thing I knew, they'd found.
CHIP: ( to himself ) Never mind.
JENNIFER: Never mind.
CHIP: Never mind.
JENNIFER: I'm sorry you had to hear this from me. I'm just so worried about Needy. She's losing her shit. Colin was her everything.
CHIP: I just can't believe this.
JENNIFER: Well, you've been talking to her more than I have. How bad is it?
CHIP: It's bad, man. It's bad.
JENNIFER: I can only imagine the paranoid theories she's come up with.
CHIP: Oh, you have no idea.
JENNIFER: I just can't believe she would do this to you. I care so much about you, Chip.
MR. WROBLEWSKI: Boys and girls, please welcome.Soft Shoulder!
NIKOLAI: Good evening, babies. Are you ready for some bad vibrations?
NEEDY: ( CONTINUED )
JENNIFER: Needy didn't deserve a boy like
JENNIFER: Ooh, you're so salty!
CHIP: Yeah, you too.
JENNIFER: Say it like you mean it.
CHIP: You're so salty. I need water. It burns. The salty burns my mouth.
JENNIFER: Say I'm better than Needy.
CHIP: What? Why?
JENNIFER: We really shouldn't be doing this.
CHIP: ( QUICKLY ) You're better than Needy.
JENNIFER: She resumes kissing him enthusiastically.
CHIP: This feels weird. Can we go somewhere else?
JENNIFER: I have just the place.
CHIP: Murphy Pool? I don't think we can go in there. I knew some skater guys who went in there. They got in big trouble and now they have to pick up garbage for 100 hours.
JENNIFER: You're in big trouble anyway. Come
NEEDY: ( STRAINED ) Well, hi there Camille! Is Chipper
CHIP'S MOM: Needy? Is something wrong?
NEEDY: Where's Chip?
CHIP'S MOM: ( CONFUSED ) He left for the dance at least twenty minutes ago. He certainly should have been there by now.
NEEDY: He walked? Mrs. Dove, you mean to only tell me that in these dangerous, godless times you let your only son walk alone at night?
CHIP'S MOM: Well, it's only five blocks. My God, your hair is.
NEEDY: Which way did he go?
CHIP'S MOM: He usually cuts across the park.
CHIP: Aren't you cold?
JENNIFER: Never, Trevor. I'm hot like magma.
CHIP: What are you doing?
JENNIFER: Ha ha.
CHIP: Ha ha.
JENNIFER: Come on in, Chip. Show me your breast stroke.
CHIP: The water looks disgusting.
JENNIFER: It's not so bad.
CHIP: Are you kidding? It's totally bubonic in there. I think I see a dead possum with a Doritos bag in its pouch. And that looks like a used syringe over there.
JENNIFER: I'm sorry. I was just trying to make you laugh. I think now, more than ever, we need laughter. We've both lost a close friend.
CHIP: I know.
JENNIFER: I feel so empty.
CHIP: Me too.
JENNIFER: Please come here and kiss me again. Make all this madness go
NEEDY: ( YELLING )
CHIP: ( MOUTHING ) Holy crap!
NEEDY: Holy crap!
JENNIFER: Fuck this J.V. shit!
CHIP: ( CROAKING ) She can fly?
NEEDY: She's just hovering, CHIP. It's not that impressive.
JENNIFER: God, do you have to undermine everything I do? You're such a
NEEDY: You're a jerk.
JENNIFER: Nice insult, Lizzie McGuire. Got any more harsh digs?
NEEDY: You know what? You were never a good friend. Ever. Even when we were little. You used to steal my toys and pour lemonade on my bed and make me be Ugly Ashley when we played Barbies!
JENNIFER: And now I'm eating your boyfriend! See? At least I'm consistent.
NEEDY: Why do you need him? Huh?
JENNIFER: I am not insecure. God, what a joke! How could I be insecure? I was the Snowflake Queen!
NEEDY: Yeah, two years ago. When you were socially relevant.
JENNIFER: I AM STILL SOCIALLY RELEVANT! You were skinny then, too!
NEEDY: You were skinny then, too!
JENNIFER: I'm gonna eat your soul and shit it out, Lesnicki.
NEEDY: ( TREMBLING ) I thought you only murdered boys.
JENNIFER: I go both ways.
NEEDY: ( SURPRISED ) We hurt you.
JENNIFER: Got a tampon?
NEEDY: Where are you going?
JENNIFER: Fuck this noise. I'm out. You losers are more trouble then you're worth.
NEEDY: ( EMOTIONAL ) Why give up now? He's almost dead! Get your bulimic ass back here and kill us both!
JENNIFER: Nah. I mean, you say I've been a bad friend all these years. I might as well throw you a bone.
NEEDY: Oh, Chip!
CHIP: Needy. You saved me.
NEEDY: I'm gonna call for help.
CHIP: Oh no, I'm out of minutes!
NEEDY: I think 911 is always a free call.
CHIP: Oh yeah. You're right.
NEEDY: It's not working. It's full of
CHIP: ( FAINTLY ) Hey, I'm going somewhere.
NEEDY: No! You're not going anywhere!
CHIP: I'm toast, Needy. I'm definitely gonna die. I think I already died before you were here, but I woke up when I heard your voice.
NEEDY: I love you.
CHIP: Yeah me too. And you look hot in that dress.
NEEDY: You're clearly delirious.
CHIP: No. When you're dying, you can see everything a lot clearer. You can see what's true and what's not. The things that are true have this glowing halo of light around them, like a picture of the Baby Jesus, or Barbara Walters when they use the special lens. And I know for sure that you're totally hot.
NEEDY: I'm never leaving.
CHIP: But I have to go.
NEEDY: Chip's eyes close. His face relaxes. He's gone. Needy wails at the top of her lungs. She rests her head against his mutilated chest, oblivious to the blood and INT. DEVIL'S KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT The dance is in full swing and students are slow-dancing. Girls rest their heads against boys' chests, only under far less macabre circumstances than Needy and CHIP's deathbed tableau. Soft Shoulder are still playing onstage, their guitars chiming melodically.
DIRK: This sucks old-man balls.
NIKOLAI: Shut up. It's good PR.
GIRL: What are you looking at, Clumpy?
NEEDY: ( QUIETLY ) Just watching your old man try to suck the ugly off your face.
GUY: What did you say?
NEEDY: Did you know the original Goths were a Germanic tribe that settled in Rome? They didn't wear black. They wore regular linen tunics. I don't know why nobody else knows
NIKOLAI: ( to Dirk ) We gotta get out of here.
DIRK: I think this girl's flipping out.
NIKOLAI: I think this girl's flipping out.
DIRK: What could she do to us?
NIKOLAI: Look at her.
NEEDY: ( into the mic ) You didn't play your hit yet.
NEEDY: Trouble was, some of us would never wake up.
NEEDY: She left an insanely hot corpse.
NEEDY: ( SINGING ) "Through the trees, I will find you. Heal the ruins left inside
VIGIL ATTENDEES: ( SINGING ) ".And the stars will remind you, we'll meet again."
NEEDY: ( SINGING ) ".We'll meet again."
OLD MAN: Where you looking to go, young East, toward Madison.
NEEDY: East, toward Madison.
OLD MAN: East, huh? Guess I'm headed that way. But I'm gonna need you to pay me in ass, gas or grass. Got that? No free rides in this wagon.
NEEDY: I don't have any money or drugs, so you'll have to settle for ass.
OLD MAN: Fair enough. Hop in my chariot.
NEEDY: I'm following this rock band.
OLD MAN: Huh. Must be a hell of a group.
NEEDY: Tonight's gonna be their last
RADIO DJ: What a song. Thought we'd play that one in honor of Soft Shoulder. They're playing in Madison tonight. Should be a night to remember.
