FIRST DRAFT: BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT It is late night, and deserted. Engine noise approaches; headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing. It is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano whooshes by with We hold as another car approaches. This one is a conservative sedan, whose occupant does not sing.
REVERSE: The car enters and roars away. After a beat of quiet, the conservative sedan enters and recedes.
BEACH: We are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel. The singing, squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a The young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a half-empty bottle of champagne. The man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag.

MARYLIN: .I thought he'd outgrown trains.

MARYLIN: So I see.

MARYLIN: Hard to believe that's the best he could do.
GUS: Probably you're the best he could Oh. Thank you.
MARYLIN: Oh. Thank you.
GUS: You're takin' it pretty well. I seen 'em weep like they'd hired me to prove their husbands weren't fooling around. And I seen 'em celebrate. Like I just handed 'em a winning lottery ticket.
MARYLIN: I'm just enjoying the movie.
TRACKING SHOT: All from the perspective of a moving automobile. The moving shots show mansions, palm trees, boutiques; we pass joggers, strolling businessmen holding cellular phones to their ears, male models working as waiters at sidewalk cafes, young women on roller blades who turn, smile, and wave at the camera. It is la dolce vita Los Angeles style.
THE DRIVER: A handsome, fortyish man in a town car talks into cellular phone. This is MILES MASSEY.
MILES: hello Marjory, any messages? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Have Wrigley look up Oliphant v. Oliphant for its relevance to the Chapman filing. She took the kids where? Tahoe? Which side of Tahoe. Great. If the cruise goes all the way around the lake, she left the state and she's in breach. She can't leave the state. Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to attach everything. Primary residence, autos, stocks. Sure. Put him through. Hello Ross. What? She's sleeping with the nanny? Well, you're separated. She can sleep with is this the one you slept with? Oh. A guy? Interesting career choice. Hmmm? Yes. I know you want her dead. Everyone in your tax bracket wants their ex wives dead.
REX: Honey! .Honey?!
MARYLIN: Rex. Get away from the door.
REX: Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
MARYLIN: We are. And it's winding down.
REX: But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have everything we have is tied up in my business. The business is my entire Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
MARYLIN: Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
REX: Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
MARYLIN: Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
REX: From inside the house we hear the menacing sound of LARGE
LETTERING: On an interior wall; it says MASSEY, MEYERSON, SLOAN &
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Massey will be right with you.
MILES: The problem is that everyone is willing to compromise. That's the problem with the institution of marriage it's based on compromise. Even through its dissolution. One attorney will try to score some points, the opposition will try to impeach. The process will find an equilibrium point determined by the skill of the opposing lawyers, and then each party will walk away with their portion of the "goodies." Some say, "Life is compromise." But at Massey Myerson we believe life is struggle and the ultimate destruction of your opponent.
RECEPTIONIST: Your eleven o'clock is here.
MILES: Ladies and Gentlemen we will continue this at the Associates Meeting next Friday. In the meantime, I want you to consider this. Ivan the Terrible, Henry the VIII, Attila the Hun what did they have in
ASSOCIATE: Middle names?
MILES: Mr. Rexroth.
REX: Rex, please.
MILES: Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room for the duration of the campaign.
REX: Thank you.
MILES: Now Rex.
MILES: Tell me your troubles.
REX: Jeez. Where do I start?
REX: .Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
MILES: That's her job. You have to respect When I first met Marylin Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each But then. But then. Time marches on. Ardor cools.
REX: When I first met Marylin Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each But then. But then. Time marches on. Ardor cools.
MILES: But then. But then. Time marches on. Ardor cools.
REX: But then. But then. Time marches on. Ardor cools.
MILES: Time marches on. Ardor cools.
REX: No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy but there's a lot of it out there.
MILES: You know what I mean when I say "it."
REX: You know what I mean when I say "it."
MILES: Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
REX: Seems like there's more of it than ever before
MILES: Well, with the expanding global population Let me ask you this your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
REX: I don't know. I can assume.
MILES: Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
REX: I'm not sure.
MILES: And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
REX: Mmm. And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking is there a
MILES: Mmm. And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking is there a
MILES: The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
REX: That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
MILES: I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined I'll lose millions.
REX: I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined I'll lose millions.
MILES: So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
REX: Well is that possible?
SARAH: You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
MARYLIN: I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
SARAH: Neither did I until my lawyer found it quite a paper trail he had it in the dog's name.
RAMONA: ( To Marylin ) So who'd you hire?
MARYLIN: Ruth Rabino.
SARAH: She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a She did a Harriman.
MARYLIN: She did a Harriman.
SARAH: In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
MARYLIN: In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
RAMONA: I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
SARAH: Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
RAMONA: Three is not Farrow.
SARAH: Who's Rex's guy?
MARYLIN: Miles Massey.
SARAH: Of Massey Myerson?
MARYLIN: Do you know him?
SARAH: By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
RAMONA: George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
SARAH: Muriel Rumsey.
MARYLIN: Who's she?
SARAH: Now? She's a night manager at You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin solidify your position.
RAMONA: You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin solidify your position.
MARYLIN: You like kids.
RAMONA: You like kids.
MARYLIN: I can't have a baby with a man I don't love. And I can't submit a child to divorce.
SARAH: It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
RAMONA: Maybe next time.
MARYLIN: We do have a man for you.
SARAH: We do have a man for you.
RAMONA: Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
SARAH: She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his And only two are hers.
RAMONA: And only two are hers.
MARYLIN: Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
SARAH: I wish I had your discipline.
A COURTROOM: We are close on the person on the witness stand, a woman in her 60's.
LAWYER: Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married
WITNESS: Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
LAWYER: Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
WITNESS: I was a hostess. For Trans-World What is your husband's profession?
LAWYER: What is your husband's profession?
WITNESS: He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
JUMP BACK: At the counsel's table in the foreground Miles chats, voice lowered with WRIGLEY, a boyish, bespectacled junior associate. Beyond them we see the woman on the witness stand continuing her testimony.
WRIGLEY: Wait. He wants to give her.?
MILES: And she has.?
WRIGLEY: And she has.?
MILES: What the fuck.?
WRIGLEY: What the fuck.?
MILES: Sometimes I have serious doubts about I am very sorry.
WRIGLEY: Sometimes I have serious doubts about I am very sorry.
MILES: Sometimes I have serious doubts about I am very sorry.
WRIGLEY: I am very sorry.
MILES: Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
WRIGLEY: No. You're not.
MILES: I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
WOMAN: No, he had the videos.
MILES: Anyway, I need a challenge. This
MILES: is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
WOMAN: He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
JUDGE: Mr. Massey! I ask again, if you have any questions for the complainant.
MILES: I'm sorry, your honor, I was just conferring with my associate.
MILES: Now then, Mrs. Guttman. Do you know a gentleman named Morris Rudnick?
MRS. GUTTMAN: Well, yes, Morris is my accountant.
MILES: ( sadly )
MILES: We would like to offer these photographs into evidence.
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Massey will see you now.
CONFERENCE ROOM: In the middle of the Massy Meyerson conference table is a large fruit and pastry plate. The door swings open. Miles rises.
MILES: They shake hands.
MILES: Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
MARYLIN: And you must be Mr. Massey.
MARYLIN: ( Sadly ) Hello, Rex.
REX: Are you alright? You lost weight.
MARYLIN: Are you alright? You lost weight.
REX: My whole metabolism is off.
MILES: So, Ruth. How's Sam?
RUTH: Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
MILES: A yert. Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
REX: What's a yert?
RUTH: ( Dryly ) I ran into your mother at the radiologist last week.
MILES: Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
RUTH: Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
MILES: How nice.
MARYLIN: Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
REX: They drift for a moment.
RUTH: So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
MILES: At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
RUTH: My client has ruled that out.
MILES: My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
RUTH: That's delusional.
MILES: My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
RUTH: My client feels sufficiently My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
MILES: My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
RUTH: Ha Ha.
MILES: ( conceding the point ) Heh heh.
REX: What's so goddamn funny?
MILES: Please let me handle this.
MILES: So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
RUTH: My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
MILES: Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
RUTH: Oh brother. Here we go.
MILES: Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
RUTH: Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
MARYLIN: Do you need a Tagamet?
REX: You have some?
MARYLIN: These are yours.
MILES: Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
MARYLIN: Have you been taking your digestive Sometimes I forget.
REX: ( Contrite ) Sometimes I forget.
MARYLIN: ( To the attorneys ) I'm sorry. Where were we?
RUTH: We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
MILES: Are you familiar with Kirshner?
RUTH: Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
REX: What's Kirshner?
MILES: Please let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner what's your bottom line?
RUTH: The primary residence and FORTY percent of the remaining assets. You're becoming tedious Miles.
REX: Aren't we going in the wrong Shhh. Please. Let me do my job. Buy a clue, Ruthie. Have you forgotten about Kirshner?
MILES: Shhh. Please. Let me do my job. Buy a clue, Ruthie. Have you forgotten about Kirshner?
RUTH: See you at the preliminary.
MILES: Fine. We'll eat all the pastry.
MILES: I think that went as well as could be expected.
REX: She always looked out for me.
MILES: And she had private investigators assisting her.
REX: ( Sentimental ) She brought my digestive enzymes.
MILES: In anticipation of making you sick.
REX: Maybe I should reconsider my.
MILES: A superficial display of marital solicitude, and you lose your resolve? Rex. I underestimated you. But I'm your attorney, and if you choose to reward her for that mediocre charade of spousal concern.
REX: You're right. Screw her.
APPLAUSE: We pull back and see that we are in a Self Defense Class. Two instructors, two "muggers" and ten women students all wearing T-shirts with the words IMPACT-Personal Safety. Marylin and Sarah sit against the wall.
MARYLIN: I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't Well what does he want?
SARAH: Well what does he want?
MARYLIN: I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
SARAH: He has a reputation for being tough. Lilly's up.
MARYLIN: ( Grinning ) Lilly's up.
SARAH: Oh, God!
MARYLIN: ( Whispers ) Every week
SARAH: I'm dying. Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
MARYLIN: Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
SARAH: So where are you now?
MARYLIN: Well, if he continues to maintain this position we're in court.
SARAH: Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
MARYLIN: Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
INSTRUCTOR: Marylin? Ready.
MARYLIN: Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure.
SARAH: That's completely odd.
MARYLIN: ( To Sarah ) I know. That's why I accepted. Find out what's up with this clown.
INSTRUCTOR: That was excellent, Marylin. But you forgot to yell "no."
MARYLIN: ( Calmly, to the Mugger )
MILES: Mrs. Rexroth. Thank you for coming.
MARYLIN: I have to admit. I was curious. And Something to start? Some wine,
MAITRE D': Something to start? Some wine,
MILES: ( She smiles ) Bordeaux? Hmmm. Chateau Margaux '57.
MARYLIN: I assume this is on Rex?
MILES: Isn't everything?
MILES: Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
MARYLIN: "Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
MILES: She laughs.
MILES: Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
MARYLIN: Did you see the tape?
MILES: Not yet.
MARYLIN: See the tape. Then we can discuss my
MARYLIN: Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
MILES: What does your lawyer think?
MARYLIN: Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
MILES: But you don't agree?
MARYLIN: How do you know?
MILES: Why would you be here?
MARYLIN: I told you. I was hungry.
MILES: I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same? I assume you're a carnivore.
MARYLIN: I know you do.
MARYLIN: Risotto with white truffles, please.
MILES: "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
MARYLIN: You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
MILES: Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
MARYLIN: Have you ever been married, Miles?
MILES: You don't believe in it.
MARYLIN: You don't believe in it.
MILES: As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
MARYLIN: You just haven't met the right person.
MILES: No. I haven't. Have you?
MARYLIN: All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
MILES: He wants a reconciliation.
MARYLIN: See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
MILES: What is it you're after, Miles?
MARYLIN: What is it you're after, Miles?
MILES: Oh, I'm a lot like you just looking for an ass to mount.
MARYLIN: Well, don't look at mine!
COURT ROOM: A large black woman in judicial robes and raiment enters from behind the Solomonic Platform.
CLERK: The Honorable Marva Munson presiding. All rise.
REX: Have you sat before her before?
WRIGLEY: the judge sits. We argue. We argue before her. She sits before us.
REX: Okay. Has she sat before you before?
WRIGLEY: You can't sit before her. That's the rule! She sits before we argue!
MILES: Shut! Up!
LATER: We are on a close lateral track of the jurors faces as they sit, with earphones on, in the darkened courtroom, illuminated by a flickering TV monitor. Leaking tinnily through the headsets we hear a very faint:
VOICE: I'm gonna nail your ass.
LATER: Marylin Rexroth now struggles to maintain her composure on the witness stand. She is modestly dressed and her attitude is one of shocked, wounded innocence.
MARYLIN: I was devastated. Of course.
RUTH: Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
JUDGE: Mr. Massey, any questions?
MILES: He paces, hands clasped behind his back, affecting to be lost in thought. Marylin watches him. Finally Miles, still pacing, declaims:
MILES: "Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no
MILES: Do you know those lines, Mrs. Rexroth?
RUTH: Objection, your honor!
JUDGE: Uh. poetry recitation.
RUTH: Uh. poetry recitation.
MILES: Let me rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, how high is that wall around your heart?
RUTH: Your honor, this is harassment! Arid frankly it's still a little.
RUTH: .arty farty!
MILES: Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
MARYLIN: Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
MILES: And you've always loved him?
MARYLIN: "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
MILES: And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
MARYLIN: Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
MARYLIN: Rex was is a very appealing man. I am sorry I couldn't. I tried my best.
MILES: That'll be all Mrs. Rexroth. Please forgive me for causing you additional Thank you, Your Honor. No further
JUDGE: Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
RUTH: We rest, Your Honor.
JUDGE: Mr. Massey?
MILES: Yes, Your honor. I call Patricia Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg.
BAILIFF: Patricia Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg.
RUTH: Who's that?
MARYLIN: An attractive woman in her mid fifties advances to be sworn. She was a beauty, but her glory days are past and she's not taking it well. She looks tense and slightly hypo-manic. She speaks in a breathy, giggly voice, and smiles frequently for no apparent reason.
BAILIFF: Mrs. Isenberg.
PATRICIA: Mrs. Banderas, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?
BAILIFF: Mrs. Banderas, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?
PATRICIA: Yes, Mr. Bailiff. I do.
MILES: Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
PATRICIA: We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
RUTH: ( To Marylin ) Is this a lover?
MARYLIN: And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know you are her.?
MILES: And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know you are her.?
PATRICIA: Marylin sighs.
RUTH: Marylin sighs.
MILES: Her Mother?
PATRICIA: Hi, Sweetie.
MILES: Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
MARYLIN: ( Mumbles ) He'll regret this.
MILES: Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
PATRICIA: No. I haven't. But I've been out of Hello, Rex. Hello there.
MILES: You were never invited to meet your No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well. no.
PATRICIA: No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well. no.
RUTH: Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
JUDGE: Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
MILES: Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
PATRICIA: Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so. Let me tell you something about Patty.
PATRICIA: Let me tell you something about Patty.
MILES: Who's "Patty."
PATRICIA: Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
MILES: I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
PATRICIA: When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say like nurse ballerina anchorwoman? She always said "When I grow up, I want to be
MILES: Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
PATRICIA: Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy." And I guess her dream is coming true. I'm happy for you Patty
MARYLIN: It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine Why do you think she did it?
RAMONA: Why do you think she did it?
MARYLIN: ( Shrugs ) Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
RAMONA: Maybe they put a horse head in her That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
SARAH: That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
MARYLIN: They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
RAMONA: That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
SARAH: Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
MARYLIN: Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
SARAH: So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
MARYLIN: Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
RAMONA: I begged you to have a baby!
MARYLIN: In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
SARAH: You're not.
MARYLIN: No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
MILES: She got absolutely nothing. Zero. So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
KENNETH: So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
MILES: Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
KENNETH: Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
MILES: I don't need it.
KENNETH: You want Botox?
MILES: What the hell is Botox?
KENNETH: It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them.
MILES: Why in God's name would I want.?
KENNETH: No frown lines. New watch?
MILES: It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
KENNETH: Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
MILES: It was a gift from a client.
KENNETH: Set one side for Bel Air.
MILES: Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
KENNETH: We did not.
MILES: You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
KENNETH: I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
MILES: Denial is not a river in Egypt.
KENNETH: You're in check.
MILES: I should be in therapy.
MILES: Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you beat you
BONNIE: ( Reacts ) Well, I wouldn't say
MILES: Your husband, who has beaten you Please was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance friend of long standing
BONNIE: Please was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance friend of long standing
MILES: Please was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance friend of long standing
BONNIE: They hate each other
MILES: So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own. As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
MILES: Am I going to far here?

VOICE: I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
MILES: Marylin Rexroth? When does she
VOICE: She's here now.
MILES: Marylin! How nice.
MILES: Marylin! How lovely, uh
MILES: Marylin! What a pleasure
DOORWAY: On Miles as he opens the door, suavely smiling.
MILES: Marylin, what a pleas who the fuck are you?
MARYLIN: Miles, how nice of you to see us may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
DOYLE: I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
MILES: Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
DOYLE: ( To Marylin ) After you, Doll.
MILES: And how is Mrs. Reiser?
DOYLE: Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but hey all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
MILES: So she's uh, flourishing?
DOYLE: She makes felt wallets. Got one right
DOYLE: Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
MARYLIN: Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
MILES: Muh Well, uh Huh?
DOYLE: Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for what you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
MARYLIN: ( Thinks ) Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what twelve?
DOYLE: ( To Miles ) Here. Got pictures.
MILES: I. uh guess congratulations are in Well Marylin and Rex broke up Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to.
DOYLE: Well Marylin and Rex broke up Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to.
MARYLIN: Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to.
DOYLE: .and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it
MARYLIN: we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
MILES: I had no idea until after, but
DOYLE: I had no idea until after, but
DOYLE: Baby. You are so HOT!
MARYLIN: ( Coy )
MILES: What a touching story.
DOYLE: You know, Miles, after my wife wife's mastectomy things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, I like my women with two boobs.
MARYLIN: Howard and I are here, Miles, because I have learned through bitter experience that when it comes to matrimonial law, you are the very
MARYLIN: As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in You did good, Massey!
DOYLE: You did good, Massey!
MARYLIN: Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
DOYLE: And there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
MARYLIN: They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
DOYLE: She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
MILES: Oh, for the love of.
MARYLIN: That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
MILES: That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
DOYLE: Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
MILES: I just want to make sure that you
MILES: understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier Well at the moment, that'd be me.
DOYLE: Well at the moment, that'd be me.
MILES: And without it, that party is exposed a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
DOYLE: A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
MILES: ( slightly sickened ) and we are sure.
MILES: we are both sure that's what we Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey this is one bad bad little We'd better go before we get thrown
MARYLIN: Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey this is one bad bad little We'd better go before we get thrown
DOYLE: Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey this is one bad bad little We'd better go before we get thrown
MARYLIN: ( laughing ) We'd better go before we get thrown
ELEVATOR BANK: Marylin and Howard wait for an elevator as Miles trots out to catch them.
MILES: Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
DOYLE: What part?
MILES: I'd just like to have a word with Why not? I'm going to have her for a
DOYLE: Why not? I'm going to have her for a
MILES: What are you doing?
MARYLIN: Getting married.
MILES: To him? He's a sick freak.
MARYLIN: He's passionate.
MILES: Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
MARYLIN: All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
MILES: Marylin! Listen to me.
MARYLIN: No. You listen to me. You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
MILES: But why him?
MARYLIN: We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
MILES: The Massey pre-nup has never been pene successfully challenged.
MARYLIN: So I hear. Is that all?
MILES: No, that's not all.
MILES: You fascinate me.
MILES: Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
KENNETH: Got any symptoms?
MILES: Yes. The inability to experience Oh. That. Don't waste time with your queen.
KENNETH: Oh. That. Don't waste time with your queen.
MILES: The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
KENNETH: The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
MILES: She can't really love that idiot, can she?
KENNETH: Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
MILES: Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
KENNETH: Doyle Oil? A Massey Pre-nup? She loves him.
MILES: He's the wrong man.
KENNETH: Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
BOLENSKY: Parsley sage, rosemary and thyme Remember me to one who lives there.
BOLENSKY: she once was a true love of mine.
MILES: What the hell is wrong with you?
WRIGLEY: I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I it gets me every time. It's so optimistic.
MILES: Is she going through with it?
WRIGLEY: If she's not going through with it, she's cutting it awful close.
RABBI BOLENSKY: Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme. Ingredients. Spices. Spicy ingredients for the banquet we call life. Marriage is like a Great Feast. Courtship is the Appetizer.

RABBI BOLENKSY: Do you Chaim David Doyle, take Marylin to be the Barbara to your Wolfgang though the lean years as well as those that are heavily marbled?
DOYLE: I do.
RABBI BOLENSKY: And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take Chaim to be the roux in your bechamel? The stock in your sauce?
MARYLIN: I do.
MILES: Heads turn. Miles bites a knuckle. Birds twitter.
RABBI BOLENSKY: Then, by the power vested in me by the state of California, and as the maitre'd in the Prix Fixe Four Star Restaurant of Life, I now pronounce you man and wife.
WRIGLEY: What do you think?
MILES: What are they?
WRIGLEY: Berry spoons.
MILES: Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever
WRIGLEY: Miles why so angry?
MILES: Why couldn't we be the club sandwich?
DOYLE: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: I have something to say to my bride.
DOYLE: Darling, like the rabbi said. life is a banquet, A Grand Bouffe, and Marylin, darling. I just want you to know that I am IN the kitchen and I CAN STAND THE HEAT!
DOYLE: And I'm going to start this marriage by EATING MY WORDS. Because the hot hors d'oerve of this love story is Pre-nup Primavera! Carmine! Bring on the Pesto!
DOYLE: Carmine! Bring on the Pesto!
DOYLE: This is for you, darling.
DOYLE: this is for you, Darling.
MILES: Next to him Wrigley is puzzled.
WRIGLEY: Why is he doing that?
MILES: Brilliant. It's brilliant. He's eating the pre-nup.
DOYLE: This is for you, Darling!
WRIGLEY: That's the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my LIFE!
DOYLE: THIS IS FOR YOU, DARLING!
LATER: Marylin stands at the punch bowl accepting congratulations. Miles approaches and draws her aside.
MILES: I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard is a beautiful person.
MARYLIN: Howard is a beautiful person.
MILES: Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
MARYLIN: Miles. Miles. Miles.
MILES: I am thrilled for you, but tell me this. How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
MARYLIN: It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Well, when this goes south promise you'll have dinner with me?
MILES: Well, when this goes south promise you'll have dinner with me?
MARYLIN: ( She holds a plate of food for him ) Have you tried the duck?
MILES: I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
MARYLIN: It has bones. Be sure to swallow Although knowing you as I do there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total
MILES: Although knowing you as I do there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total

MILES: More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
MARYLIN: Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
MILES: No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you
MARYLIN: ( Reproachfully ) You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You ( With difficulty ) sound like my mother.
WAITER: Should we order?
MARYLIN: Yes, I well, I'm not really.
MILES: Not hungry, huh? Neither am I.
DOYLE MANSION: Miles pulls up to the huge house.

MARYLIN: You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive
MILES: And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
MARYLIN: And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
MILES: She never particularly cared for me.
MARYLIN: She didn't love you?
MILES: No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't. I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup
MARYLIN: She held that against you?
MILES: Apparently she was very disappointed.
MARYLIN: Boy. Boy, oh boy.
MARYLIN: And here I thought my mother was.
MILES: Your mother was.
MARYLIN: Oh right. You met Patricia.
MARYLIN: We're damaged goods.
MILES: No, we're not!
MARYLIN: We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe.
MILES: That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and. I like us.

MILES: No. That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
MARYLIN: Did you just propose to me?
MILES: Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.

MILES OFFICE: He has managed to fill his credenza with pictures of married life. Due to its brevity these pictures are uneventful, the Massey's wear the same outfit in most of them. Miles works. He is interrupted by the voice of his SECRETARY.
SECRETARY: I have Mrs. Massey on line one for
MILES: He laughs and laughs. We hear Marylin's laughter coming through the receiver. Miles exits a flower store with a bouquet of tulips. Marylin at the doorway, greets Miles as he arrives home. As Miles changes into his casual after work outfit, ( khakis? ) Marylin sits at the edge of the bed. He's telling her about his day, and she is rapt with attention. The Massey's have a candlelit dinner of fish and pasta. The tulips are in the middle of the table. Miles and Marylin snuggle on a couch and watch Seinfeld. Miles in bed on the new Frette Linen. A few too many pillows, but he's making it work. Marylin enters the bedroom in a nightshirt that is the perfect combination of innocence and nastiness. He puts down his book as she gets into bed with They gaze at one another the picture of contentment and impending lust.

Ironic isn't it that I have been frightened of this emotion which is, in a sense, the seed of my livelihood. But today, I am here to tell you: Love should cause us no fear. Love should cause us no shame. Love. is good. Let me ask you a question. When our clients come to us confused, angry, hurting because their flame of love is fluttering and threatens to die should we seek to extinguish that flame, so that we can sift through the smoldering wreckage for our paltry reward? Or should we seek to fan this precious flame this most precious flame back to loving, roaring life?
WRIGLEY: Should we counsel fear or trust? Should we seek to destroy or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism or with The decision of course, is each of ours. For my part, I have made the leap of love, and there is no going

MILES: No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
MARYLIN: Honey, I could sit.
MILES: In fact, this is not a married house it's a bachelor pad.
MARYLIN: Hardly. You have six bedrooms
MILES: I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms a billiard room, a card room, a gym Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
MILES: Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
MARYLIN: Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie
MILES: ( Beat ) Are those foods?
MARYLIN: Fabric and fringe.
MILES: Exactly. And then maybe not right away There's a room right off the bedroom It would be perfect for a nursery. It's a walk in humidor right now but if I took out the refrigeration I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house.

TV SCREEN: COURT TV REPORTER We are back at the Trial of New Jersey v. Medrano. Mr. Medrano is accused of killing his wife, Alicia in 1992. He claims it was suicide. Let's return to the courtroom. See the action in the courtroom The Prosecutor shows the jury an extremely large handgun.
PROSECUTOR: How far would this gun have to be in order to inflict a wound without leaving powder burns on the scalp.
EXPERT WITNESS: Approximately three feet.
PROSECUTOR: And how could Mrs. Medrano shoot herself in the back of the head from a distance of three feet?
KENNETH: Really long arms?
MILES: They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
KENNETH: It's your move, Miles.
MILES: ( Sadly ) I already made my move, Kenneth.
SARAH: Vishu! Knock it off. That hurts.
VISHNU: Breathe through it.
VISHNU: That's good, Marylin.
MARYLIN: I don't even know where he is. He looked so devastated. If I could just talk to him for a few minutes.
SFX DOORBELL: Was that the bell?
MARYLIN: Was that the bell?
RAMONA: It sounded like a bell.
MARYLIN: I'll be right back.
MARYLIN: Yes? Can I help you?
POLICE OFFICER: Marylin Hamilton Rexroth Doyle Massey?
MARYLIN: POLICE OFFICER
POLICE OFFICER: We have a warrant for your arrest.
MARYLIN: INT. POLICE STATION - MONTAGE - DAY Marylin is photographed front and profile. She is finger printed; she is searched and relieved of her jewelry; and finally, she is throw into a holding tank with several other women trapped. She clings despondently to the bars.
POLICE OFFICER: You can go now, Mrs. Massey. Someone made bail.
MARYLIN: Forgery and Fraud?
RUTH: You used his credit card.
MARYLIN: He told me to he said he wanted me to
RUTH: Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
MARYLIN: Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
RUTH: Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter? I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
MARYLIN: He never even asked. He just assumed
RUTH: He was right, wasn't he?
MARYLIN: So. Now what?
RUTH: Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
MILES: Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
MARYLIN: May I come in?
MILES: I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal I'd just like to pick up a few of my I don't believe you have "things."
MARYLIN: I'd just like to pick up a few of my I don't believe you have "things."
MILES: I don't believe you have "things."
MARYLIN: On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is
MARYLIN: What do you want?
MILES: What do you want?
MARYLIN: I want to nail you ass.
MILES: Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
MARYLIN: I'm reporting you to the IRS.
MILES: The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
MILES: I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
MARYLIN: I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about
MARYLIN: ( Chomping on the Cigar ) Got a light?
MILES: What kind of "stuff?"
MARYLIN: Arty Farty stuff. Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
MILES: Those are gifts.
MARYLIN: Salary. Unreported income. By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
MILES: You can't prove anything.
MARYLIN: I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH. What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
MILES: You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague. I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.

MILES: I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a. matter of some delicacy.

KENNETH: I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
MILES: Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
KENNETH: Miles voice is still flat, expressionless:
MILES: Everything goes to Marylin.
MILES: She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
KENNETH: So, that's good, right?
MINUTES LATER: Miles paces with the telephone. He punches numbers with the thumb of the hand holding the phone; his other hand holds a coffee cup from which he takes trembling slurps.
VOICE: This is Joe. Wuddya need?

MARYLIN: I fell in love Miles.
MILES: So did I. Now pack up a few basics You do? You do love me?
MARYLIN: You do? You do love me?
MASSEY MANSION: Marylin hangs up the phone. She walks slowly around the room, pausing at the mantelpiece to pick up a framed picture of Miles, which she contemplatively regards. We pan with her continued walk to bring Joe into frame. He stands with his back pressed to the wall. She's started for a moment, but quickly recoups:
MARYLIN: Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
JOE: Mr. Dumbarton.
MARYLIN: Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
JOE: She cocks an eye at him.
JOE: That's his lawyer.
MARYLIN: Who's the pigeon?
JOE: Who's the pigeon?
MILES: ( Whispers )
DINING ROOM: Miles tiptoes through, looking warily about. He backs through the swinging doors connecting to the kitchen. Finds himself face to face with Joe.
MILES: Joe! Thank God you're in time. You're not in time. I'm in time. Thank God I'm in time.
MILES: It's a no go! Get it? No one any the wiser. Okay!

MILES: Nonono. Marylin I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
MARYLIN: That's true.
JOE: Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
MARYLIN: Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
MILES: It was fifty for you.
JOE: ( To Miles ) That's cause you're a lawyer. I gave her the lawyer discount. ( Looks at Marylin ) But I shouldn't of. Cause you're a whore.

WRIGLEY: Miles and Marylin are looking at each other. Quietly:
MILES: Hello Marylin.
MARYLIN: Hello Miles.
MILES: Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
MARYLIN: It's not something I wanted either.
MILES: But then I guess something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
MARYLIN: Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill.
RUTH: Now you both wait a minute. Nobody hired anyone to kill anyone.
WRIGLEY: Hear, hear.
WRIGLEY: Apparently, from what I can gather, a burglar broke into your house became despondent over his lifestyle and shot himself.
MILES: Where does that leave us?

RUTH: We think it's more than generous.
WRIGLEY: My client is prepared to consider a
