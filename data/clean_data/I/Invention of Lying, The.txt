JENNIFER: Hi. You're early. I was just That makes me think of your vagina. I'm Mark, how are you?
MARK: That makes me think of your vagina. I'm Mark, how are you?
JENNIFER: A little frustrated at the moment. Also equally depressed and pessimistic about our date tonight. I'm Jennifer.
MARK: I hope this date ends in sex.
JENNIFER: Not me. I don't find you attractive. Come on in.
ROLL CREDITS: Jennifer's apartment is new-adult, as if she just found out she was an adult yet hasn't had the time or the money to complete the transition.
JENNIFER: I need to finish getting ready. While doing that I might realize I'm still horny and try to finish masturbating without you hearing.
MARK: ( shouting to her ) I feel awkward and I regret being ( shouting back ) Yeah, I'm disappointed you're early and not really looking forward to tonight in general, but the thought of being alone the rest of my life scares both my mother and I
MARK: ( shouting to her ) I have an erection now because I assume you began masturbating once we stopped talking.
MARK: ( shouting to her ) I'm embarrassed because I think the restaurant I've made reservations at might not be expensive enough or hip enough to impress you, but it was the best I could do because I don't make very much money. You see, I'm forty years old and have no real financial assets to speak of, I've never owned a home, and never had a significant relationship. My boss even told me today that I'm most likely going to get fired tomorrow and.
JENNIFER: I just masturbated.
MARK: That makes me very horny.
JENNIFER: Shall we go?
MARK: Mark stands up. Jennifer picks up her purse and opens the
JENNIFER: After you.
END CREDITS: INT. MARK'S VOLVO - NIGHT Mark and Jennifer drive in silence for a beat.
JENNIFER: I'm only doing this as a favor for my cousin Greg. He keeps begging me to go out on a date with you. He says you're funny.
MARK: Greg's a good friend.
JENNIFER: Where are we eating tonight?
MARK: A cute little place called La Bonisera in West Hollywood.
JENNIFER: You obviously don't have very much money but that's not necessarily a deal breaker.
MARK: I have very little money.
JENNIFER: I also don't really care about a guy who knows all the latest, hippest restaurants.
MARK: I don't know any of them.
JENNIFER: In fact, there are very few things in life that I care about all that much. The only things I have to offer myself or anyone else are my good looks and my affected sense of quirkiness which artistically inclined men interpret as In fact, I think my best trait is the fact that I've made very few mistakes: socially, academically, financially or romantically. I take very few risks and therefore lead a relatively happy and light-hearted existence. Mostly though, I'm a kind, sweet person with the potential of genuinely becoming a vital and interesting human being the day I take the energy I expend on hyper self-reflexivity and apply it to actual action in the reality of my life.
MARK: I found that boring and started thinking about this place's fish
JENNIFER: The valet parking guy hands Mark a ticket.
JENNIFER: This isn't as nice as I remember What are we going to talk about?
MARK: What are we going to talk about?
HOSTESS: ( to Jennifer ) I'm threatened by you.
MARK: Two, please.
HOSTESS: Of course, come with me.
WAITER: I'm very embarrassed that I work here. Hi.
MARK: ( to Jennifer ) And you're pretty and that only makes me feel worse. Can I get you two started on some drinks?
JENNIFER: ( to Jennifer ) And you're pretty and that only makes me feel worse. Can I get you two started on some drinks?
WAITER: ( to Jennifer ) And you're pretty and that only makes me feel worse. Can I get you two started on some drinks?
MARK: I'll have a Budweiser.
JENNIFER: I'll start with your Mango Margarita and probably have three more drinks by the end of the She's out of your league.
WAITER: ( to Mark ) She's out of your league.
MARK: The waiter leaves. Jennifer and Mark peruse their menus. A woman screams out from a table on the other side of the room:
WOMAN: ( SCREAMING ) All of a sudden I got EXTREMELY
MARK: I'm going to ask you some questions about your life because that's what you do, but I'll only really listen to about half of what you're
MARK: How do you spend your days?
JENNIFER: I get up at eight in the morning because the noise from my alarm clock interrupts my sleep, so I lean over and.
MARK: That's a little more specific than I expected.
JENNIFER: Well what did you want to know?
MARK: Do you have a job?
JENNIFER: What job do you have?
MARK: What job do you have?
JENNIFER: I have a job at an office.
MARK: What do you do?
JENNIFER: Just typing and filing and stuff.
MARK: Do you enjoy it?
JENNIFER: No. But I enjoy the end result of the job which is money. And the hours are pretty good for the amount of money I make, which I spend on things I like, such as clothes, hiking, drinking even though I know it's bad for me.
MARK: Sure. Tell me more. I'm trying to get a little insight into you.
JENNIFER: Well you already know a lot about me. You know I'm good looking because. well. here I am. You know I'm successful because you've seen my apartment and the clothes I'm wearing. And you know I'm happy because I'm smiling.
MARK: Are you always happy?
JENNIFER: Usually. Some days I stay in bed eating and crying.
MARK: The waiter returns with their drinks.
WAITER: ( hands beer to Mark ) Here you go. ( hands drink to Jennifer ) I had a sip of this.
JENNIFER: Do you guys know what you want or do you need a moment?
WAITER: Do you guys know what you want or do you need a moment?
MARK: I'm ready.
JENNIFER: I'll have a caesar salad with chicken because I think I'm fat but I also think I deserve something that tastes good.
MARK: I'll have the fish taco's because I had them once here and it's all I Excellent, I'll get those both started for you.
WAITER: Excellent, I'll get those both started for you.
JENNIFER: Sorry, one second.
JENNIFER: It's my mother, this won't take long. Probably checking in on our
JENNIFER: Sorry about that.
MARK: Don't think twice. How is your mom?
JENNIFER: She's all right.
MARK: TIME CUT: LATER THAT NIGHT Both of their plates are now empty. Three empty Margarita glasses sit in front of Jennifer.
WAITER: ( to Jennifer ) If I give you my number will you call me?
JENNIFER: EXT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT Mark walks Jennifer to the front door of her apartment
MARK: Thanks for going on this date with me. You're way, way out of my league and I know you were just doing it as a favor to Greg, and that most likely I'll never hear from you again.
JENNIFER: I actually had a better time than I thought I'd have, but I won't know for sure how I feel about you until I'm less drunk.
MARK: Give me a call if you still like me once you're sober.
JENNIFER: I might.
MARK: Thanks for kissing me on the cheek, I know you didn't have to do that
MARK: ( shouting after her ) . you're very pretty. Thank you!
JIM: Hi, I'm Jim and I'm the spokesperson for the Coca-Cola company. I'm here today to ask you to continue buying coke. I'm sure it's a drink you've been drinking for years, and if you still enjoy it, I'd like to remind you to buy it again sometime soon. It's basically just brown sugar water, we haven't changed the ingredients much lately, so there's nothing new about it I can say. We changed the can around a little bit. See, the colors here are a little different, and we even put a polar bear on it for the kids. Also, coke is very high in sugar, can lead to obesity in children and adults who don't sustain a healthy diet, and has a Ph acidity level high enough to dissolve teeth and bones over extended periods of time. Coke also works great at removing corrosion from car batteries and loosening rusted bolts. So that's it, it's coke. Everyone knows it. It's very famous. I'm Jim, I work for coke, and I'm asking you to not stop buying coke. That's all. Thanks.
FRANK: Hi Mark. How's it going?
MARK: Not so good. Last night I went on a date with a girl I've had a crush on for years who will most likely never call me again and I'm pretty sure I'm going to get fired today. I spent the whole night throwing up pain killers because I'm too afraid to take enough to kill myself.
FRANK: I spent the whole night throwing up pain killers because I'm too afraid to take enough to kill myself.
MARK: See you tomorrow.
FRANK: INT. MARK'S CAR MORNING As Mark drives to work we take in a bit of his world.
BUSINESS MAN: I'm not talking to anyone on my cell phone. I only want people to assume I'm very busy.
GIRLFRIEND: I woke up this morning and realized that, not only do I not love you, but that the thought of touching you sickens me.
BOYFRIEND: The more you hate me the more I fall in love with you.
HONKING MAN: Move it, fatty!
SCREAMING MAN: This isn't natural! None of this is natural! We're all animals! This doesn't feel right! Why am I wearing clothes? How can you people live like this? Where did all this concrete come from?!
TOUR GUIDE: All of Lecture Films' productions are written, filmed and edited right here on this very lot. In fact, this building is where Lecture Films' talented writers scour through the world's past events, searching for the most entertaining, dramatic and even hilarious moments of world history, which are then turned into scripts, handed over to our world-famous Readers, and filmed for your viewing pleasure.
TOUR GUIDE: If you'll just follow me over to this monitor you'll get a sneak peak at Lecture Film's upcoming summer's blockbuster: "Napoleon 1812 to 1813."
NARRATOR: Coming this summer from Lecture Films Motion Picture Studios. Written by Oscar winning screenwriter Rob Marlowe.
NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE: ( READING ) And so Napoleon invaded Russia with a brute force of nearly seven hundred thousand men behind him armed with muskets and supported by canon brigades.
NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE: ( READING ) Through the devastating snow they marched, crippled by disease and hunger, Napoleon's men marched on.
TOURIST #1: I love these films. Saves me reading the book.
NARRATOR: Napoleon 1812 to 1813. Coming this summer from Lecture Films.
TOUR GUIDE: Look everyone, there goes Mark Bellison, one of Lecture Films very own screenwriters!
TOUR GUIDE: He's one of our least successful writers here at Lecture Films.
TOUR GUIDE: Now let's head to editing bay where we can watch..
MARK: Hi Shelley. I'm still attracted to you today.
SHELLEY: Hi Mark. Everyday I realize more and more how over-qualified I am for this position and how incompetent you are at yours.
MARK: Any messages?
SHELLEY: Anthony's coming by within the hour to see if he can work up the courage to fire you. If he can't, he said he'll definitely do it Nobody else called? No calls to do with actual work?
MARK: Nobody else called? No calls to do with actual work?
SHELLEY: Well, I told everybody you were getting fired this week and not to expect their calls returned, so no one left any messages.
MARK: Next time I'd rather you took down the messages just in case I don't get fired.
SHELLEY: You're almost definitely getting Well, it hasn't happened yet.
MARK: Well, it hasn't happened yet.
SHELLEY: Okay, but everybody knows you are.
MARK: Okay, I'll be in my office.
SHELLEY: Okay, I'll be searching for new jobs on Craigslist.
ANTHONY: Wow, you look really depressed today. That's going to make this so much harder.
MARK: Anthony, don't fire me.
ANTHONY: Mark, the 1300's are boring. Nothing interesting happened in that century. Nobody cares about the post-Roman, pre-enlightenment era. The last few scripts you turned in were depressing.
MARK: They were about the black plague! It's the 1300's Anthony, what else am I going to write about!
ANTHONY: It's not totally your fault, Mark. You got stuck with a bad century.
MARK: No! I can make it work!
ANTHONY: Give it up Mark, it's not like something new is going to have happened in the 1300's. At Lecture Films we're no longer interested in searching through the less well- known historical periods for great events, we just want to take the big name Reader's of the day and have them read the historical events that people know and love: the holocaust, D-day, the birth of electricity. These are the stories people want to see, because they know them. They find comfort in
ANTHONY: Do you think I could come back and do this tomorrow? I just got very nervous about firing you. I don't do well with confrontation.
MARK: Is there anyway you could do it now? I'd rather not put it off.
ANTHONY: ( MEEKLY ) You're fired?
MARK: Anthony slinks out of the room. Mark looks down at his computer to see he has an email in his inbox.
JENNIFER": Mark sits back in his chair and sighs deeply.
MARK: She's a really good writer, too.
SHELLEY: I loathed almost every minute I worked for you.
MARK: I often fantasized about you naked.
SHELLEY: What are you going to do now?
MARK: I have no idea. But I have very little hope for the future.
SHELLEY: I don't have much hope for you either, but I wish you good luck.
MARK: Bye, Shelley.
SHELLEY: Bye, Mark.
ROB: So they fucking fired you, huh dipshit? I always knew the Black Plague would never work as a movie. Guess the 1300's were as much of a loser as you are.
MARK: Please don't make me feel worse. Or actually whatever, go ahead, I don't think I could possibly feel I fucking always hated you. You're a shitty writer assigned to a shitty century and you're a little man bitch. But I was always threatened by you because I knew there was something different about you that I didn't understand and I fucking hate things I don't understand. But you will always be a loser and I will always be more successful than you in nearly every way. That's just the way it is. And Shelley calls you an ass fag behind your back.
ROB: I fucking always hated you. You're a shitty writer assigned to a shitty century and you're a little man bitch. But I was always threatened by you because I knew there was something different about you that I didn't understand and I fucking hate things I don't understand. But you will always be a loser and I will always be more successful than you in nearly every way. That's just the way it is. And Shelley calls you an ass fag behind your back.
MARK: Well, now I feel worse.
RECEPTIONIST: Are you looking to abandon an elderly person?
MARK: I already have. Martha Bellison. I'm her grandson.
RECEPTIONIST: Ooh, it's good you're here. She's not doing well. You should say your final goodbyes today.
MARK: You say that every time I'm here.
RECEPTIONIST: She's at the top of our death pool.
MARK: Oh Grandma, that is so depressing. Come on, at least stare at the ceiling or something.
MARTHA: The television is broken.
MARK: The television isn't broken. You probably sat on the remote and changed it to channel two again.
MARK: See, you had it on the wrong channel. It needs to be on channel three in order for the satellite to I don't understand anything you just said and that makes me scared and angry.
MARTHA: I don't understand anything you just said and that makes me scared and angry.
MARK: I can't understand what it feels like to be you so it just irritates me and makes me think you're stupid. But I also love you and wish things were better for you.
MARTHA: I do too.
MARK: Grandma, I lost my job today. I'm forty years old. I'm completely alone and I've got absolutely no prospects for anything.
MARTHA: I'm sorry, Mark. Things aren't any better for me here. I can't afford most of my medication, I'm very alone and I forget more and more every day.
MARK: I'm just so tired of life. Why does life have to be so. what's the word? Don't you sometimes wish you could change things? Don't you sometimes wish you weren't such a I don't think I'm a loser.
MARTHA: I don't think I'm a loser.
MARK: Of course you're a loser, grandma. Our family is made up of losers. We're all poor, we're all average looking, we're all only moderately intelligent, we're all lonely and Well, we're poor because we weren't born with money and it's very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another. We're only moderately intelligent because there's been a lot of inbreeding in our lineage. And we're only lonely and unloved right now. Remember, I've had two husbands I loved very much in my lifetime.
MARTHA: Well, we're poor because we weren't born with money and it's very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another. We're only moderately intelligent because there's been a lot of inbreeding in our lineage. And we're only lonely and unloved right now. Remember, I've had two husbands I loved very much in my lifetime.
MARK: Yeah, but I'm not talking about the past, Grandma. I'm talking about right now. And right now we're both losers, Grandma. We're both shitty, shitty losers. Don't you know that?
MARTHA: I suppose we are. But things could be worse. We could be homeless.
MARK: I'd rather be dead than be homeless. That's why I need to get out there and find a job. If I have to be homeless, I'm going to kill Well that's sad. I love you, Mark. Good luck finding a job!
MARTHA: Well that's sad. I love you, Mark. Good luck finding a job!
MARK: I love you too, Grandma.
MARK: I'll start looking for a job Lately I don't like Indian people.
GREG: Lately I don't like Indian people.
MARK: Hey, thanks for setting me up with your cousin by the way.
GREG: Third cousin. She's hot right?
MARK: Way out of your league. Dunno why you bothered.
GREG: Way out of your league. Dunno why you bothered.
MARK: It felt nice to go out with someone that pretty. Like for just one moment I experienced what it would be like to be the type of person someone like that would date. It felt good. Doesn't matter anyway. I will always be just who I am right now: average looking, of average intelligence with an average personality. Just a completely generic human being.
GREG: Your life is still better than By a good margin.
MARK: By a good margin.
GREG: Lately I've been crying in my sleep and waking up in a pool of urine.
MARK: I really wish I had a better friend than you.
GREG: So, what are you going to do now?
MARK: I don't know. Guess I'll start looking for another crappy job.
GREG: Doubt you'll find one. Not much need for an out-of-work writer specializing in the Black Plague.
MARK: I'm going to go now. You're seriously depressing me. I really wish I was cool enough to have a better friend than you.
GREG: I'm the best you're gonna get, man. Call me later.
MARK: Mark gets up and drunkenly stumbles out of the bar.
MARK: ( QUICKLY ) No, it's Mark. I'm sorry.
MARK: Shut the fuck up, I don't even have a job!
LANDLORD: I'm here for the rent.
MARK: I was going to come talk to you about that. I got fired yesterday.
LANDLORD: I know. That's why I'm here for the Well, I haven't got it.
MARK: Well, I haven't got it.
LANDLORD: How much do you have?
MARK: I think I've got about three hundred dollars in my bank account.
LANDLORD: The rent is eight hundred dollars.
MARK: I know. I haven't got it.
LANDLORD: Then you're evicted. I'll help you with your things.
LANDLORD: Help me with the couch. It looks
LANDLORD: You have one day to get your things out of this hallway.
MARK: How am I supposed to do that?
LANDLORD: You've got three hundred dollars. Rent a truck.
MARK: Oh, fuck me.
BANK TELLER: How can I help you today?
MARK: I'd like to make a withdrawal.
BANK TELLER: Okay, sir. I'm confident I can help you with that.
MARK: I've just been evicted from my apartment so I need to withdraw what I have left in my account so I can move my things out. I guess I need to close out my account to do I think I'm about to be homeless.
BANK TELLER: Unfortunately sir the system is down right now so I'm not going to be able to perform an account closure until the system is back up. But I can assist you in a withdrawal. How much would you like to withdraw?
MARK: Well, I'd like to withdraw eight hundred dollars.
BANK TELLER: How much are you going to withdraw today, sir?

BANK TELLER: ( awkwardly fast ) Eight hundred dollars.
MARK: ( awkwardly fast ) Eight hundred dollars.
BANK TELLER: Pardon me?
MARK: ( more confident ) I have eight hundred dollars in my bank account.
BANK TELLER: Wait a second here. The system just came back up. System seems to be back up, guys. Just one second while I access your account. You said you're withdrawing eight hundred, correct?
MARK: The bank teller types on her keyboard.
BANK TELLER: Well, look at this. It says here you've only got three hundred dollars in your account. But you said you wanted to withdraw eight
BANK TELLER: I apologize for this sir, but it seems our system has made a mistake. Hold on one second while I go and get your eight hundred dollars. Did you want that in large or small bills?
MARK: Large bills.
BANK TELLER: ( to co-worker ) Guys the computers seem to be a bit buggy. Will someone call James to come in and look into it, please?
BANK TELLER: There you are. Eight hundred dollars. Anything else I can do for you today?
BANK TELLER: Sometimes our computers can get a bit buggy, especially when the system goes down. Sorry for any It's no problem.
MARK: It's no problem.
LANDLORD: What are you doing here?
MARK: Paying my rent.
LANDLORD: Where did you get this money?
MARK: It was amazing. I went in to the bank and the system was down and I was going to take out three hundred dollars but she asked me how much I'd like to take out and.
MARK: I found it. Lying on the street.
LANDLORD: Okay. Lucky.
MARK: Give me my key back.

MARK: How much does it cost to bribe you?
COP: At least five grand.

GREG: Stupid stomach flu.
MARK: Vegas, baby. Vegas.
GREG: What are we doing here? We don't have any money to throw away.
MARK: Sure we do.
GREG: What is that, a few hundred bucks? That's not going to last us very Sure it will.
MARK: Sure it will.
MARK: Chips please.
CHIP WOMAN: There's a very good chance you'll lose all this money here tonight.
MARK: I know.
CHIP WOMAN: And even if you do happen to win, there's an even better chance that in the long run we'll win it back.
MARK: I know.
CHIP WOMAN: Some of the games are fixed. Like all the ones that use computers.
MARK: I know.
COCKTAIL WAITRESS: If I could be a stripper I would, but I'm not attractive enough. Drinks, guys?
GREG: No. I have a stomach flu.
MARK: We'll both have beers and we'll take them at that roulette table over there.
GREG: Oh come on, roulette is the stupidest game of them all. It's pure chance, no skill whatsoever.
MARK: It's okay. I'm feeling lucky.
GREG: You've never had a lucky day in your life.
MARK: Just watch.
ROULETTE DEALER: Get your bets in, get your bets in. The house always wins in the long run. Because of the zero's on the board every bet is slightly favored towards the house.
ROULETTE DEALER: Twenty-seven red. No one wins.
MARK: I'm on twenty-seven red.
ROULETTE DEALER: We have a winner. Congratulations, You did it. You just, like, quadrupled your money. You lucky son of a bitch.
GREG: You did it. You just, like, quadrupled your money. You lucky son of a bitch.
MARK: That's nothing. Watch this.
ROULETTE DEALER: Get your bets in, get your bets in. The house always wins in the long run. Fork over your money right here folks. I say this so often I want to kill myself.
ROULETTE DEALER: Nine black. No winners.
MARK: I'm on nine black. These are all
ROULETTE DEALER: Nine black wins. Big winner. Congratulations, sir.
GREG: Do it again.
MARK: I don't think I should. Lets go play slots.
MOMENTS LATER: Mark is talking to a Pit Man right in front of a slot
MARK: Hi, I just won a major jackpot on this slot machine but no money came I'm sorry about that, sir. Let me get that fixed for you. And can I say congratulations, sir.
PIT MAN: I'm sorry about that, sir. Let me get that fixed for you. And can I say congratulations, sir.
MARK: Thank you.
MOMENTS LATER: Mark and Greg, each carrying four giant buckets overflowing with chips, waddle through the casino.
GREG: This is the most amazing night of my life.
GREG: It amazes me the winning streak you're on. You must be the luckiest man in the world.
MARK: Well, sort of.
GREG: It was like we couldn't lose.
MARK: We couldn't lose.
GREG: Do you have a system?
MARK: I've got a system.
GREG: Well, with your system in just a few weeks I figure we could be the richest people in the world.
MARK: And then what?
GREG: Well, here's what I'm thinking. We take all the money in the world. and put it on black.
MARK: Why put it on black? Why stop there? Put it on a number and get thirty five times back.
GREG: That's exactly what we'll do.
MARK: Hold on, I think I found a flaw in your plan. How can they pay us if we have all the money in the world?
GREG: Well, they'd just have to.
MARK: Well, they can't because we've got it all.
GREG: Well, they'd better find it. They can't let us bet if they're not going to pay us back. They'll have to just give us the casino.
MARK: We already own the casino. We've got all the money in the world. We'll be betting against ourselves.
GREG: Then we'll go to another casino.
MARK: We own that one too. We won that.
GREG: So we own all the casino's?
MARK: And if we win we can't pay us back because we already have all the
GREG: And if we win we can't pay us back because we already have all the
MARK: Greg thinks this over for a long beat.
GREG: Only one thing we can do then.
MARK: I'm listening.
GREG: Take ourselves into the back room and break our own fingers.
MARK: INT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - MORNING Mark, exhausted from his long night, waits for the elevator to arrive. The elevator doors open and Frank, the depressive neighbor, steps out.
MARK: Hey there, Frank.
FRANK: Mark. How's it going?
MARK: Pretty good, thanks.
FRANK: Yeah. You?
MARK: Yeah. You?
FRANK: Awful. I was doing some internet research last night about suffocation suicide. I'm probably going to give that a try tonight.
MARK: ( PAUSE ) All right. Bye, Frank.
FRANK: Mark gets in the elevator, Frank walks away. A short beat. Mark exits the elevator and yells after Frank.
MARK: Frank, halfway out the building, turns around.
FRANK: Don't do it.
MARK: Don't do it.
FRANK: Why not? I'm miserable. And no one will care.
MARK: I'll care.
FRANK: You're a loser, though.
MARK: Don't do it, Frank. Things are going to be all right.
FRANK: They are?
MARK: Yes. You're going to meet someone soon. You won't be so lonely. Things are going to turn around at your job.
FRANK: My job's actually fine.
MARK: Well, things are going to get better. Better than they are.
FRANK: What about the depression?
MARK: It will go away very soon. You're going to be happy soon, Frank. You just need to wait for it. Listen to me: you don't need to kill
FRANK: Frank laughs.
MARK: Frank laughs.
FRANK: Wow. Man, and that suffocation thing really seemed like a good It wasn't.
MARK: It wasn't.
FRANK: Okay. Well, my night's open now. You want to hang out later?
MARK: I don't know. Not really.
MARK: Sure. Of course. Let's hang out.
FRANK: I'll see you after work.
MARK: Mark gets back in the elevator to the sound of Frank laughing to himself as he exits the building. We hold on Mark for a moment as he smiles and nods his head.
MONTAGE: Mark doing various good deeds throughout the day. V.O plays Marks walks up to the homeless man with the "I don't understand why I'm homeless and you are all not" sign. He says something to the homeless man, who quickly drops his sign and follows Mark.
MARK: Whoever is reading this, go ahead and try it. Tell someone your eyes are a different color then they are. I think you'll be amazed at the results. It's so simple and yet. so powerful. this thing I've invented.
END MONTAGE: INT. MARK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Mark lies in bed watching TV. He picks up the phone and
MARK: Jennifer. It's Mark.
JENNIFER: Are you gonna hang up on me again?
MARK: No. Maybe. Who knows. I'm calling because I want to ask you out on another date.
JENNIFER: Why would you do that?
MARK: I discovered something yesterday. I found out I can pretty much have my life anyway I want it from now on.
JENNIFER: Congratulations. I gotta go.
MARK: Wait, and I know you said you didn't want to date me ever again, but I'm different now. Things have changed. I think I'm in your league You're better looking?
JENNIFER: You're better looking?
MARK: No. I'm not better looking. I'm just more. powerful. I think you have to see it for yourself.
JENNIFER: Have you been to the gym?
MARK: No, I haven't been to the gym. It's just. it's amazing. Things are different for me now. You have to see this. I think you'll hardly recognize me.
JENNIFER: Did you buy better clothes?
MARK: No, look can we just meet up?
MARK: Jennifer, If there was even a glimmer of something about me that you liked, please say yes. You even admitted that we got along well. Just give me one more chance. Just one little teensy, tiny date.
JENNIFER: Okay, fine.
MARK: Fantastic. Tomorrow night. I'll pick you up at eight.
JENNIFER: Most likely it'll be our last date though, so just know that.
MARK: ( SARCASTIC ) That's very sweet.
JENNIFER: No it wasn't. Did you not hear what I said?
MARK: Yeah, no I was being. .there's no word for it. See you tomorrow night.
JENNIFER: Mark hangs up happily.
ANGELO BADSMITH: Hello, I'm Angelo Badmsith. Come watch me read about the exciting events that took place during the Industrial Revolution.
MARK: Rob Marlowe, your streak of success has finally come to an end.
ROB: Come to beg for your old job back? Hey everybody, here's the loser who thought the Black Plague would make for an interesting film. Good luck, douche bag. Freaking loser.
ANTHONY: That was the head of the studio.
MARK: I'm not mad at all.
ANTHONY: Oh good, because I feel really bad about it. I mean, I would be horrible at your job too. I would be horrible at any job in this I love sports.
ANTHONY: Why are you here?
MARK: When you fired me, I was very I knew it.
ANTHONY: I knew it.
MARK: And so I left this building and I just started walking. And I walked all the way out of town. And then I walked into the desert and I fell asleep under a tree.
ANTHONY: I don't do well with other people's life changing events.
MARK: And when I woke up I found this strange old chest sticking out of the ground. So I started digging. And I unearthed a very old and ancient box. Probably, oh. about. seven hundred years old. And inside the box. . was this.
ANTHONY: What is it?
MARK: It's a never-before-heard historical event from the past.
ANTHONY: When does it take place?
MARK: The 1300's.
ANTHONY: I told you we're not interested in Black Plague movies here, Mark.
MARK: This one isn't about the black plague. Well it isn't just about the black plague. Let me read you some of this.
MARK: Anthony, get excited about this. This is a brand new event from history that no one has ever heard before. It's a great human Yeah, but is there a movie there?
ANTHONY: Yeah, but is there a movie there?
MARK: The greatest movie Lecture Films has ever made.
ANTHONY: Start reading.
MARK: ( READING ) On the very first day of the fourteenth century, a momentous occasion occurred. It began as a day much like any other. The sun rose, the people awoke, workers began to work, babies began to cry. But all of that was interrupted when a giant flying space ship crashed down from the skies and landed in the heart of Babylon.
ANTHONY: Mark smiles. Anthony picks up his phone and presses
ANTHONY: Please, Mark. Continue.
MARK: ( READING ) As the smoke cleared, the door to the spaceship opened and inside, were hundreds of beautiful, half naked alien women.
MARK: ( READING ) And then the ninja army unleashed a giant fireball that brought the robot dinosaur to its knees, saving Mars, Earth and the Nude Amazonian Alien Women all in one sweeping motion. The earth was saved. Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to marry by alien king Xardon. It was to be the First Human-Nude Amazonian Alien Woman wedding, and no expenses would be spared. All of Babylon and Mars were invited to join in the celebrations.
MARK: ( READING ) The wedding was held on a brisk summers day on Mars, with all of the survivors of the Great Ninja War and the Black Plague present. They feasted and danced and laughed and it was a joyous occasion.
ANTHONY: Mark, tell us what it's called.
MARK: ( to Rob ) The Black Plague.
JENNIFER: Congratulations on selling your script today.
MARK: Thanks. Thank you for having dinner with me.
JENNIFER: Everyone needs to eat.
WAITER: I'm an extremely important waiter.
MARK: I don't want to know what it is, I just want to order the most expensive thing on the menu.
JENNIFER: I'll have the duck. And I think you look like a little rat faced man.
WAITER: Okay, I'll have those right up for
JENNIFER: Things seem to be turning around for you.
MARK: Today is the best day of my life. Hands down. Easy. Best day.
JENNIFER: It's not every day you unearth a monumental historical event and sell it for a ton of money.
MARK: That wasn't the best part. It was great, but it wasn't the peak of my I've had a crush on you ever since I saw a picture of you on Greg's refrigerator two years ago.
JENNIFER: The best part of my day today is right now, sitting at this table here with you.
MARK: The best part of my day today is right now, sitting at this table here with you.
JENNIFER: You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life, and you're special. and it makes me happy to be around you.
MARK: You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life, and you're special. and it makes me happy to be around you.
JENNIFER: Thank you.
JENNIFER: Tell me something about your family. I really don't know much about you.
MARK: Ah, my family. We're what you'd probably call "not lucky". My whole family is kind of marked by tragedy, bad luck and general. shittiness. It goes back a long ways and could probably drive someone to suicide just hearing about it, so I'll keep it simple. My mom died when I was six. Cancer.
JENNIFER: And my dad got real depressed and lost his job. Out of work and with a kid to raise he had no choice but to turn to a life of crime.
MARK: And my dad got real depressed and lost his job. Out of work and with a kid to raise he had no choice but to turn to a life of crime.
JENNIFER: What kind of crime?
MARK: He was a robber. Houses mostly.
MARK: He was a very unlucky man. He spent his last days behind bars. I never really knew him. But I guess I've also had a little luck in my life. I did have a wonderful grandmother who raised Oh, that's sweet.
JENNIFER: Oh, that's sweet.
MARK: Yeah, she's great.
JENNIFER: Where is she?
MARK: Old person's home obviously. Who wants to live with that? Gross.
JENNIFER: I know, right?
MARK: But I'm going to get her out of there tomorrow.
JENNIFER: That's nice.
WAITER: I don't know what's wrong with the chef today, but these just look
MARK: They look fine to me.
WAITER: Well, you're stupid.
MARK: Right. I was thinking that since I'm going to be rich and successful now that I might be in your league.
JENNIFER: What would be the point?
MARK: Well, I don't know, maybe we might enjoy it. Maybe we'd be good together and could have a happy life, raise a family together.
JENNIFER: Well, I do like you. And I enjoy your company.
MARK: Good. Fantastic.
JENNIFER: Unfortunately, none of that changes the fact that you'd still be contributing half of the genetic code to our children.
MARK: Mark takes a bite of his food. Jennifer smiles and does the same, oblivious to Mark's pain.
WHAT?: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY Mark bursts into the hospital room to find his grandmother, MARTHA looking tired and scared, hooked up to dozens of machines, the heart monitor beeping ominously.
MARK: Grandma, they just called me. What's going on? Are you okay?
MARTHA: I don't know, I fell on my way back to my room.
MARK: What do the doctors say?
MARTHA: They say I'll probably die tonight.
MARK: There's a knock on the door. The doctor enters.
DOCTOR: Oh, hello. I was just coming in to check on her, you must be Martha Bellison's grandson.
MARK: What are you talking about she's going to die?
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. It just doesn't look good. She's suffered a major heart attack and her heart is very weak, her pulse not very strong, her blood pressure is dropping rapidly and most likely she'll have a fatal heart attack during the night.
MARK: The doctor checks Martha's chart.
DOCTOR: Yup, still going to die.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, guys. I wish I felt something for you two, but I really don't. I do this exact thing about thirty times a night and it's really hardened me to human suffering. On a side note, it's fajita night at the cafeteria downstairs. You might think about grabbing a bite to eat there after your grandma dies.
MARTHA: I'm so scared, Mark. I don't want to die. You know, people don't talk about it much, but death is a horrible thing. One minute you're alive, there's a whole world around you, humming and jumping, people coming in and out, doors opening and closing, love and anger and the whole mess of it all, and then like that, it's all gone.
MARK: Mark immediately slams on the big red "call nurse" button, holding his grandmother down as she lurches in pain.
NURSE #1: She's seizing.
MARTHA: I'm scared.
MARK: Listen closely to me, Grandma. I have a surprise for you.
MARK: You're wrong about what happens when you die. It's not an eternity of nothingness.
MARK: When you die you're going to go to your favorite place in the whole world. And you're going to be with all of the people you've ever loved and who have ever loved you. And you're going to be young again, and you'll be able to run through the fields and dance and jump, and there will be no sadness, no pain, just love and laughing and happiness. There will be ponies made of gold, and everyone will live in giant mansions, and everything will smell like cookies. And it will last for an eternity, Grandma. An eternity.
NURSE #1: Go on.
DOCTOR: What else happens?
MARK: Do your jobs!
MARK: You're going to be happy forever, grandma. I promise you. Say hello to my mom for me. Tell her I love
NURSE #2: ( TEARFULLY ) I'm going to see my mother again when I die.
DOCTOR: Tell us more, please.
MARK: Damn it.
JENNIFER: I'm so sorry, Mark.
MARK: I think I just did something bad.
JENNIFER: Do you want to come inside?
JENNIFER: They share a moment.
MARK: They share a moment.
NURSE #1: There he is!
PERSON #1: Is there only one place you go when you die?
PERSON #2: Will everyone who has ever died be What's this place called?
PERSON #3: What's this place called?
PERSON #4: Will I get to have sex with people
NURSE #1: You owe us an explanation. If you know something this important, you better tell us all.
MARK: Who are you people?
NURSE #1: The words you spoke last night, to your grandmother, spread like wildfire. Please, tell us more. Explain what you said.
MARK: Fine, fine, just give me a minute.
MARK: Remember last night when I said I think I did something bad? Well now I know I did something bad.
JENNIFER: They're saying that you know something different about what happens after you die.
MARK: Hold on.
MARK: Mark, what do you know? What did you tell your grandmother last night? What's going on?
JENNIFER: Mark, what do you know? What did you tell your grandmother last night? What's going on?
MARK: I can't explain it all right now. Why don't you come over?
JENNIFER: EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON Jennifer pushes through the throng of people, which is now even larger than before. As she reaches the door Mark opens it for her and slides her through.
MARK: Come up quick, they look like they could get out of hand any second.
JENNIFER: Just tell me what you told your I don't think I should. Who knows what could happen next? I'm just going to keep my mouth shut from now on.
MARK: I don't think I should. Who knows what could happen next? I'm just going to keep my mouth shut from now on.
JENNIFER: What you said obviously affected a lot of people. I don't think you have the choice to keep it in now.
MARK: Sure I do. I could just walk out that door and get on a plane and go to Namibia. No one knows me in Just tell me what you said. Please, My grandmother was dying, and she was terrified, shaking all over. She didn't want to just become nothingness. So I told her that when she died there wouldn't be nothingness. That she would be with all of the people she loved who had died and that she would live an eternity of joy and happiness.
JENNIFER: Just tell me what you said. Please, My grandmother was dying, and she was terrified, shaking all over. She didn't want to just become nothingness. So I told her that when she died there wouldn't be nothingness. That she would be with all of the people she loved who had died and that she would live an eternity of joy and happiness.

That she would be with all of the people she loved who had died and that she would live an eternity of joy and happiness.
JENNIFER: ( barely able to speak ) How do you know these things?
JENNIFER: You have to tell them everything you know. This is too big. You have no choice.
MARK: But you don't understand. The words I said. they weren't. it's not How did your grandmother feel when you told her these things?
JENNIFER: How did your grandmother feel when you told her these things?
MARK: Happy. At peace.
JENNIFER: And how did that make you feel?
MARK: ( sweeping her hand over Think how good it will feel to do the same for all of these people.
JENNIFER: ( sweeping her hand over Think how good it will feel to do the same for all of these people.
MARK: Okay. But I need a few hours to get my thoughts together.
JENNIFER: I'll go tell them.
MARK: Wait! Are you sure this is right?
JENNIFER: Of course it is. You know something that's going to change mankind forever. It's the most important thing the world has ever heard.
GREG: I brought pizza. How come you never told me we all get mansions?
MARK: I didn't.
GREG: Inventing the bicycle is one thing, but this.
JENNIFER: Shut up. Let him work.
MARK: I'm done.
JENNIFER: Are you ready?
MARK: I guess.
MARK: I feel like I should be reading these off of something other than just notebook paper. I wish they were like, written on large tablets or even just nicer paper or
MARK: Feels better.
JENNIFER: Just tell them what you know
GREG: Good luck out there, man.
YOUNG MAN: I heard that he said we all get mansions, and that there's even Ponies. Mansions. Ice Cream. These are the things we can all expect when we die. What else can we expect? We won't know until Mark Bellison steps out of that.
NEWSCASTER: ( to cameraman ) Ponies. Mansions. Ice Cream. These are the things we can all expect when we die. What else can we expect? We won't know until Mark Bellison steps out of that.
YOUNG MAN: ( SHOUTING ) THERE HE IS!
MARK: A man runs up and hands Mark a microphone.
MARK: Oh, thanks.

WOMAN #2: What about if you forget to feed your dog?
MARK: That also is fine. Unless the dog dies. Then it's bad.
MAN #1: If you do just one bad thing do you go to the bad place?

CRYING MAN: ( SHAMEFUL ) I've done many of those bad things. Is there anything I can do to not go to the bad place? Help me, I'm so scared.

MAN #6: That guy's a fucking coward! Hiding up there and doing bad shit to us! Why doesn't he do it to our faces?
WOMAN #6: We need to stop that motherfucker before he kills us all!
