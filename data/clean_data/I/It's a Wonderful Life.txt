NIGHT SEQUENCE: Series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town of Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State. The streets are deserted, and snow is falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over the above scenes we hear voices praying:
GOWER'S VOICE: I owe everything to George Bailey. Help him, dear Father.
MARTINI'S VOICE: Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend Mr. Bailey.
BERT'S VOICE: He never thinks about himself, God; that's why he's in trouble.
ERNIE'S VOICE: George is a good guy. Give him a break, God.
MARY'S VOICE: I love him, dear Lord. Watch over him tonight.
JANIE'S VOICE: Please, God. Something's the matter with Daddy.
ZUZU'S VOICE: Please bring Daddy back.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: Hello, Joseph, trouble?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: Yes, but he's got the faith of a child  simple. Joseph, send for
CLARENCE'S VOICE: You sent for me, sir?
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Splendid! Is he sick?
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Sir. If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: What's that book you've got there?
CLARENCE'S VOICE: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Poor George. Sit down.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Sit down? What are.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Well, naturally. Of course.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Well, keep your eyes open. See the
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Where? I don't see a thing.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Why, yes. This is amazing.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Oh, wonderful!
BOY: ( as he slides ) Hey, who's that?
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Hey, who's that?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: That's your problem, George Bailey.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: A boy?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
CLOSE SHOT: George Bailey at bottom of slide.
GEORGE: ( through megaphone ) And here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother, Harry Bailey.
HARRY: I'm not scared.
BOYS: ( ad lib ) Come on, Harry! Attaboy, Harry!
MEDIUM SHOT: Harry makes his slide very fast. He passes the marks made by the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears into the water.
GEORGE: I'm coming, Harry.
MEDIUM SHOT: George jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to pull him out he yells:
GEORGE: Make a chain, gang! A chain!
WIDER ANGLE: The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain. When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they pull them both to safety.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: George saved his brother's life that day. But he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear. Cost him his hearing in that ear. It was weeks before he could return to his after- school job at old man Gower's
DISSOLVE: EXT. MAIN STREET  BEDFORD FALLS  SPRING AFTERNOON MEDIUM SHOT Five or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm, whistling. Their attention is drawn to an elaborate horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the MEDIUM PAN SHOT The carriage driving by. We catch a glimpse of an elderly man riding in it.

GEORGE: So long!
BOYS: ( ad lib ) Got to work, slave. Hee-haw. Hee-
MEDIUM SHOT: George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter on the counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish:
GEORGE: Wish I had a million dollars.
GEORGE: Hot dog!
WIDER ANGLE: George crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch, a small girl, is seated, watching him. George goes on to get his apron from behind the fountain.
GEORGE: ( calling toward back room ) It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.
CLOSE SHOT: Mr. Gower, the druggist, peering from a window in back room. We see him take a drink from a bottle.
GOWER: You're late.
MEDIUM SHOT: George behind soda fountain. He is putting on his apron.
GEORGE: Yes, sir.
WIDER ANGLE: Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools at the fountain. She is the same height as Mary and the same age, but she is infinitely older in her approach to people.
VIOLET: ( with warm friendliness ) Hello, George. ( then, flatly, as she sees Mary ) 'Lo, Mary.
MARY: ( primly ) Hello, Violet. Two cents worth of shoelaces?
GEORGE: Two cents worth of shoelaces?
VIOLET: She was here first.
MARY: I'm still thinking.
GEORGE: ( to Violet ) Please, Georgie.
VIOLET: Please, Georgie.
VIOLET: ( to Mary ) I like him.
MARY: You like every boy.
VIOLET: ( happily ) What's wrong with that?
GEORGE: Here you are.
VIOLET: ( the vamp ) Help me down?
GEORGE: ( disgusted ) Help you down!
GEORGE: Made up your mind yet?
MARY: I'll take chocolate.
GEORGE: With coconuts?
MARY: I don't like coconuts.
GEORGE: You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here  from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral
MARY: A new magazine! I never saw it before.
GEORGE: Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic
CLOSE SHOT: Mary, whispering.
MARY: Is this the ear you can't hear on? George Bailey, I'll love you till the day I die.
GEORGE: I'm going out exploring some day, you watch. And I'm going to have a couple of harems, and maybe three or four wives. Wait and see.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain. Gower comes to the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven, chewing an old unlit cigar. His manner is gruff and mean. It is evident he has been drinking.
GOWER: George! George!
GEORGE: Yes, sir.
GOWER: You're not paid to be a canary.
GEORGE: No, sir.
CLOSE SHOT: Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box.
GEORGE: Mr. Gower, do you want something. Anything I can do back here?
GOWER: Anything I can do back here?
GEORGE: Anything I can do back here?
GOWER: George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite drunk. Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the CLOSE SHOT Capsules spilling on floor at their feet.
CLOSE SHOT: Capsules spilling on floor at their feet.
GEORGE: I'll get them, sir.
GOWER: Take these capsules over to Mrs. Blaine's. She's waiting for them.
GEORGE: Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
GOWER: Gower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar. George turns to him, the box in his hand.
GEORGE: Is it a charge, sir?
GOWER: Yes  charge.
GEORGE: Mr. Gower, I think.
GOWER: Aw, get going!
GEORGE: Yes, sir.
MEDIUM SHOT: George comes out into main room. As he puts on his cap he sees a Sweet Caporals ad which says:
INSERT: "ASK DAD HE KNOWS"  SWEET CAPORAL BACK TO SHOT With an inspiration, George dashes out the door and down the street. Mary follows him with her eyes.
MEDIUM SHOT: George runs down the street until he comes opposite a two- story building with a sign on it reading: "Bailey Building and Loan Association." He stops. Potter's carriage is waiting at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the stairs.
FULL SHOT: The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. There is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. Before a door marked: "PETER BAILEY, PRIVATE", George's Uncle Billy stands, obviously trying to hear what is going on inside. He is a very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves. With him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk. The office vibrates with an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office.
CLOSE SHOT: Uncle Billy listening at the door. As George is about to enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.
UNCLE BILLY: Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
GEORGE: Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
UNCLE BILLY: Some other time, George.
GEORGE: It's important.
UNCLE BILLY: There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
COUSIN TILLY: Uncle Billy. telephone.
UNCLE BILLY: Who is it?
COUSIN TILLY: Bank examiner.
INSERT: CLOSEUP  UNCLE BILLY'S LEFT HAND There are pieces of string tied around two of the fingers, obviously to remind him of things he has to do.
UNCLE BILLY: Bank examiner! I should have called him yesterday. Switch it inside.
MEDIUM SHOT: George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing swirls on a pad. He looks tired and worried. He is a gentle man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other people's rights. Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. The following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument had been in process for some time.
BAILEY: I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
POTTER: Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
BAILEY: All I'm asking is thirty days more.
GEORGE: ( interrupting ) Just a minute, son. ( to Potter ) Just thirty short days. I'll dig up that five thousand somehow.
BAILEY: Just a minute, son. Just thirty short days. I'll dig up that five thousand somehow.
POTTER: ( to his goon ) Shove me up.
GEORGE: Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
POTTER: Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
BAILEY: Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
POTTER: Then foreclose!
BAILEY: I can't do that. These families have They're not my children.
GEORGE: They're not my children.
POTTER: They're not my children.
BAILEY: But they're somebody's children.
POTTER: Are you running a business or a charity ward?
BAILEY: Well, all right.
POTTER: ( interrupting ) Not with my money!
BAILEY: Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hardskulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
POTTER: So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for
GEORGE: He's not a failure! You can't say that about my father!
BAILEY: George, George.
GEORGE: You're not! You're the biggest man in town!
BAILEY: Run along.
GEORGE: Bigger'n him!
GEORGE: Bigger'n everybody.
POTTER: Gives you an idea of the Baileys.
CLOSE SHOT: George and his father at the door.
GEORGE: Don't let him say that about you, All right, son, thanks. I'll talk to you tonight.
BAILEY: All right, son, thanks. I'll talk to you tonight.
CLOSE SHOT: Gower talking on the telephone. George stands in the doorway.
GOWER: ( drunkenly ) Why, that medicine should have been there an hour ago. It'll be over in five minutes, Mrs. Blaine.
GOWER: Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules? Did you hear what I said?
GEORGE: ( shaking him ) Did you hear what I said?
GOWER: ( shaking him ) Did you hear what I said?
GEORGE: ( frightened ) Yes, sir, I.
GOWER: What kind of tricks are you playing, anyway? Why didn't you deliver them right away? Don't you know that boy's very sick?
GEORGE: ( in tears ) You're hurting my sore ear.
CLOSE SHOT: Mary is still seated at the soda fountain. Each time she hears George being slapped, she winces.
GOWER: You lazy loafer!
GEORGE: ( sobbing ) Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing. You put something wrong in those capsules. I know you're unhappy. You got that telegram, and you're upset. You put something bad in those capsules. It wasn't your fault, Mr. Just look and see what you did. Look at the bottle you took the powder from. It's poison! I tell you, it's poison! I know you feel bad. and.
GEORGE: Just look and see what you did. Look at the bottle you took the powder from. It's poison! I tell you, it's poison! I know you feel bad. and.
GEORGE: Don't hurt my sore ear again.
GOWER: No. No. No.
GEORGE: Don't hurt my ear again!
GOWER: ( sobbing ) Oh, George, George.
GEORGE: Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I Oh, George.
GOWER: Oh, George.
MEDIUM SHOT: It is late afternoon. A young man is looking over an assortment of luggage. Across the counter stands Joe Hepner, the proprietor of the store  he is showing a suitcase.
JOE: An overnight bag  genuine English cowhide, combination lock, fitted up with brushes, combs.
CUSTOMER: AS CAMERA MOVES UP CLOSER to him, he turns and we get our first glimpse of George as a young man. CAMERA HAS MOVED UP to a CLOSEUP by now.
GEORGE: Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Now, look, Joe. Now, look, I. I want a big What did you stop it for?

CLARENCE'S VOICE: Who is it?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: George Bailey.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: That's the kid.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Not a soul.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Well, wait and see.
GEORGE: Big - see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand. a great big I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second- hand job, would you?
JOE: I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second- hand job, would you?
GEORGE: Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
JOE: No charge.
GEORGE: That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
JOE: ( indicating name on suitcase ) That's right.
GEORGE: ( as he sees his name ) What's my name doing on it?
JOE: A little present from old man Gower. Came down and picked it out himself.
GEORGE: ( admiring the bag ) He did? Whatta you know about that  my old boss.
JOE: What boat you sailing on?
GEORGE: I'm working across on a cattle boat.
JOE: A cattle boat?
GEORGE: ( as he exits ) Okay, I like cows.
MEDIUM SHOT: The place is practically the same except that it is now full of school kids having sodas, etc. A juke box and many little tables have been added. It has become the hangout of the local small fry. There are now three kids jerking sodas. Gower is a different man now  sober, shaven and good-humored. He is behind the counter when George comes in. Gower's face lights up when he sees George.
GEORGE: Mr. Gower. Mr. Gower. thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
GOWER: Aw, forget it.
GEORGE: Oh, it's wonderful.
GOWER: Hope you enjoy it.
GEORGE: Oh. Oh. Wish I had a million

VIOLET: Oh, this old thing? Why, I only wear it when I don't care how I look.
MEDIUM SHOT: On Violet's back as she goes. As she crosses the street, an elderly man turns to look at her and is almost hit by a car that pulls up with screeching brakes.
ERNIE: How would you like.
GEORGE: ( as he enters cab ) Want to come along, Bert? We'll show you the town!
ERNIE: Want to come along, Bert? We'll show you the town!
BERT: No, thanks. Think I'll go home and see what the wife's doing.
ERNIE: Family man.
MEDIUM SHOT: Pop Bailey is seated at the dinner table. Mrs. Bailey and Annie, the cook, look up toward the vibrating ceiling. There are SOUNDS of terrific banging and scuffling upstairs. Annie pounds on the ceiling with a broom.
MOTHER: ( calling out ) George! Harry! You're shaking the house down! Stop it!
POP: Oh, let 'em alone. I wish I was up there with them.
MOTHER: Harry'll tear his dinner suit. George!

HARRY: I've eaten.
MOTHER: Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.

GEORGE: We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
POP: He's pretty young for that job.
GEORGE: Well, no younger than I was.
POP: Maybe you were born older, George.

POP: Still after that first million before you're thirty.
GEORGE: No, I'll settle for half that in
POP: Of course, it's just a hope, but you wouldn't consider coming back to the Building and Loan, would you?
GEORGE: Well, I. Annie, why don't you draw up a chair? Then you'd be more comfortable and you could hear everything that's going on.
ANNIE: I would if I thought I'd hear anything worth listening to.
GEORGE: You would, huh?
POP: I know it's soon to talk about it.
GEORGE: Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
GEORGE: Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that remark, but this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe. I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important.
POP: ( quietly ) You know, George, I feel that in a small way we are doing something important. Satisfying a fundamental urge. It's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace, and we're helping him get those things in our shabby little ( unhappily ) I know, Dad. I wish I felt.

GEORGE: You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
POP: This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
GEORGE: Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.

GEORGE: Hot dog! Just like an organ.
MARY: CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they proceed down the street.
GEORGE: And I told Harry I thought I'd be bored to death. You should have seen the commotion in that locker room. I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here. Here, let me hold that old wet dress of yours.

MARY: ( impatiently ) I'd like to have my robe.
GEORGE: Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.
MARY: Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
GEORGE: Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
MARY: ( getting mad ) George Bailey! Give me my robe!
GEORGE: I've heard about things like this, but I've never.
MARY: ( interrupting ) Shame on you. I'm going to tell your mother on you.
GEORGE: Oh, my mother's way up the corner I'll call the police.
MARY: ( desperate ) I'll call the police.
GEORGE: They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
MARY: I'm going to scream!

UNCLE BILLY: George! George! Come on home, quick! Your father's had a stroke! Mary. Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to Come on, George, let's hurry.

HARRY: Come on, George, let's hurry.
GEORGE: Did you get a doctor?
UNCLE BILLY: Yes, Campbell's there now.
FADE OUT: FADE IN: EXT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN SIGN OVER ENTRANCE INT. BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN OFFICE  DAY CLOSE SHOT  DIRECTORS MEETING There are about twelve directors seated around a long table. They are the substantial citizens of Bedford Falls: Dr. Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate salesman, etc. Prominently seated among them is Henry F. Potter, his goon beside his wheelchair. Uncle Billy and George are seated among the directors. The Chairman of the Board is Dr. Campbell. They have folders and papers before them, on which they have been reporting. Before each of the directors there are individual reports for them to study.
DR. CAMPBELL: I think that's all we'll need you for, George. I know you're anxious to make a train.
GEORGE: ( rising ) I have a taxi waiting downstairs.
DR. CAMPBELL: I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
GEORGE: DR. CAMPBELL
DR. CAMPBELL: Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
POTTER: Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my real purpose.
MAN: Wait just a minute now.
POTTER: Wait for what? I claim this institution is not necessary to this town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver.
UNCLE BILLY: ( angrily ) George, you hear what that buzzard.
LAWYER: Mr. Chairman, it's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to discuss chloroforming the Building and Loan.
MAN: Peter Bailey died three months ago. I second Mr. Potter's motion.
DR. CAMPBELL: Very well. In that case I'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw.
DR. CAMPBELL: But before you go, I'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey.
GEORGE: Thank you very much.
DR. CAMPBELL: It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
POTTER: I'll go further than that. I'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.
UNCLE BILLY: ( trying to control himself ) Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably drove him to his grave.
POTTER: Peter Bailey was not a business man. That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul. He was a man of high ideals, so-called, but ideals without common sense can ruin this town. Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop. You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi. You know. I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars. Why?
GEORGE: Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for his character.
POTTER: ( sarcastically ) A friend of yours?
GEORGE: Yes, sir.
POTTER: You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say.
GEORGE: Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was. Why, in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why. Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You. you said. What'd you say just a minute ago?. They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken- down that they. Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about. they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
POTTER: I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
GEORGE: I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know. Well, I've said too much. I. You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
POTTER: Sentimental hogwash! I want my
UNCLE BILLY: Boy, oh, boy, that was telling him, George, old boy. You shut his big You should have heard him.
COUSIN EUSTACE: What happened? We heard a lot of Well, we're being voted out of business after twenty-five years. Easy come, easy go.
UNCLE BILLY: Well, we're being voted out of business after twenty-five years. Easy come, easy go.
COUSIN TILLY: ( reading a newspaper ) Here it is, "Help Wanted  Female."
ERNIE: You still want me to hang around, Yeah, I'll be right down.
GEORGE: ( looking at his watch ) Yeah, I'll be right down.
UNCLE BILLY: Hey, you'll miss your train. You're a week late for school already. Go I wonder what's going on in there?
GEORGE: ( indicating Board room ) I wonder what's going on in there?
UNCLE BILLY: Oh, never mind. Don't worry about that. They're putting us out of business. So what? I can get another job. I'm only fifty-five.
COUSIN TILLY: UNCLE BILLY
UNCLE BILLY: Go on  go on. Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now you don't want to miss college too, do you?
DR. CAMPBELL: George! George! They voted Potter down! They want to keep it going!
UNCLE BILLY: DR. CAMPBELL
DR. CAMPBELL: But they've got one condition  only one condition.
GEORGE: What's that?
DR. CAMPBELL: That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
GEORGE: Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy.
DR. CAMPBELL: You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you Dr. Campbell, now let's get this thing straight. I'm leaving. I'm leaving right now. I'm going to school. This is my last chance. Uncle Billy here, he's your man.
GEORGE: ( emphatically ) Dr. Campbell, now let's get this thing straight. I'm leaving. I'm leaving right now. I'm going to school. This is my last chance. Uncle Billy here, he's your man.
DR. CAMPBELL: But, George, they'll vote with Potter

SAM'S VOICE: Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
GEORGE: Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
SAM'S VOICE: Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
GEORGE: Oh, I don't know. why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.

Oh, Mary. Mary.
MARY: ( nervously ) I'm here.
SAM'S VOICE: Would you tell that guy I'm giving him the chance of a lifetime, you hear? The chance of a lifetime.
MARY: ( whispering ) He says it's the chance of a lifetime.
GEORGE: ( fiercely ) Now you listen to me! I don't want any plastics! I don't want any ground floors, and I don't want to get married  ever  to anyone! You understand that? I want to do what I want to do. And you're. and

LONG SHOT: Scurrying people under umbrellas, swarming around the bank doors. Panic is in the air. Attendants are trying to close down. Several people come running past the cab.
ERNIE: Don't look now, but there's something funny going on over there at the bank, George, I've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks of a run.

MEDIUM SHOT: Potter seated behind his desk, his goon alongside him. Standing in front of the desk is a distinguished-looking man, obviously the president of the bank. He is mopping his brow with his handkerchief.
POTTER: George, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors. Is that true? Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that. George, are you all right? Do you need any police?
GEORGE: ( on phone ) Police? What for?
POTTER: Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know. George, I'm going all out to help in this crisis. I've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs. They'll close up for a week, and then reopen.
GEORGE: ( to Uncle Billy ) He just took over the bank.
POTTER: I may lose a fortune, but I'm willing to guarantee your people too. Just tell them to bring their shares over here and I will pay them fifty cents on the dollar.
GEORGE: ( furiously ) Aw, you never miss a trick, do you, Potter? Well, you're going to miss this one.
POTTER: If you close your doors before six P.M. you will never reopen. George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
UNCLE BILLY: George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
GEORGE: ( looks at string on Uncle Billy's finger ) .you can take this one off now.
GEORGE: Now, just remember that this thing isn't as black as it appears.
GEORGE: I have some news for you, folks. I've just talked to old man Potter, and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank. The bank's going to reopen next week.
ED: But, George, I got my money here.
CHARLIE: Did he guarantee this place?
GEORGE: Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him. We don't need Potter over here.
CHARLIE: I'll take mine now.
GEORGE: No, but you. you. you're thinking of this place all wrong. As if I had the money back in a safe. The money's not here. Your money's in Joe's .right next to yours. And in the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Macklin's house, and a hundred others. Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're going to pay it back to you as best they can. Now what are you going to do? Foreclose on them?
TOM: I got two hundred and forty-two dollars in here, and two hundred and forty-two dollars isn't going to break anybody.
GEORGE: ( handing him a slip ) Okay, Tom. All right. Here you are. You sign this. You'll get your money in sixty days.
TOM: Sixty days?
GEORGE: Well, now that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares.
RANDALL: Tom. Tom, did you get your money?
TOM: Well, I did. Old man Potter'll pay fifty cents on the dollar for every share you got.
RANDALL: Well, I did. Old man Potter'll pay fifty cents on the dollar for every share you got.
CROWD: ( ad lib ) Fifty cents on the dollar!
RANDALL: Yes, cash!
TOM: ( to George ) Well, what do you say?
GEORGE: Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement. Now give us sixty days on this.
TOM: ( turning to Randall ) Okay, Randall.
MRS. THOMPSON: Are you going to go to Potter's?
TOM: Better to get half than nothing.
GEORGE: Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait. now listen. now listen to me. I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets hold of this Building and Loan there'll never be another decent house built in this town. He's already got charge of the bank. He's got the bus line. He's got the department stores. And now he's after us. Why? Well, it's very simple. Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why. And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides.
GEORGE: Joe, you lived in one of his houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack? Here, Ed. You know, you remember last year when things weren't going so well, and you couldn't make your payments. You didn't lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would have let you keep it? Can't you understand what's happening here? Don't you see what's happening? Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying! And why? Because we're panicky and he's not. That's why. He's picking up some bargains. Now, we can get through this thing all right. We've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other.
MRS. THOMPSON: But my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and I need money.
WOMAN: How am I going to live until the bank opens?
MAN: I got doctor bills to pay.
MAN: I need cash.
MAN: Can't feed my kids on faith.
MARY: How much do you need?
GEORGE: Hey! I got two thousand dollars! Here's two thousand dollars. This'll tide us over until the bank reopen. All right, Tom, how much do you need?
TOM: ( doggedly ) Two hundred and forty-two dollars!
GEORGE: ( pleading ) Aw, Tom, just enough to tide you over till the bank reopens.
TOM: I'll take two hundred and forty-two
GEORGE: There you are.
TOM: That'll close my account.
GEORGE: Your account's still here. That's a
GEORGE: Okay. All right, Ed?
ED: I got three hundred dollars here,
GEORGE: Aw, now, Ed. what'll it take till the bank reopens? What do you need?
ED: Well, I suppose twenty dollars.
GEORGE: Twenty dollars. Now you're talking. Fine. Thanks, Ed. All right, now, Mrs. Thompson. How much do you want?
MRS. THOMPSON: But it's your own money, George.
GEORGE: Never mind about that. How much do you want?
MRS. THOMPSON: I can get along with twenty, all Twenty dollars.
GEORGE: ( counting it out ) Twenty dollars.
MRS. THOMPSON: And I'll sign a paper.
GEORGE: You don't have to sign anything. I know you'll pay it back when you can. That's okay. All right, Mrs. Davis.
MRS. DAVIS: Could I have seventeen-fifty?

UNCLE BILLY: Those Rockefellers!
GEORGE: Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
UNCLE BILLY: We'll save them for seed. A toast! They raise their glasses.
GEORGE: A toast! A toast to Papa Dollar and to Mama Dollar, and if you want the old Building and Loan to stay in business, you better have a family real quick.

FADE OUT: FADE IN: EXT. SLUM STREET BEDFORD FALLS  DAY  TWO YEARS LATER MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT In front of one of the miserable shacks that line the street are two vehicles. One of them is George Bailey's rickety car, and the other is an even more rickety truck piled high with household goods. The Martini family is moving. The family consists of Martini, his wife and four kid of various ages, from two to ten. George and Mary are helping the Martinis move. About a dozen neighbors crowd around. Martini and George, assisted by three of the Martini children, are carrying out the last of the furniture. As they emerge from the house, one of the neighbors, Schultz, calls out:
SCHULTZ: Martini, you rented a new house?
MARTINI: ( to George ) You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
GEORGE: What's that?
MARTINI: I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.

GEORGE: All in.
CLOSE SHOT: Sign hanging from a tree "Welcome to Bailey Park." CAMERA PANS TO follow George's car and the old truck laden with furniture as they pass  we hear Martini's voice singing "O Sole Mio." Bailey Park is a district of new small houses, not all alike, but each individual. New lawns here and there, and young trees. It has the promise when built up of being a pleasant little middle class section.
GEORGE: Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home. The Martinis cross themselves.
CLOSE SHOT: Sam Wainwright is standing in front of his big black town car. Sam is the epitome of successful, up-and-coming businessman. His wife, in the car, is a very attractive, sophisticated-looking lady, dripping with furs and jewels. Sam is watching George across the street.

CLOSE SHOT: Potter seated in his wheelchair at his desk, with his goon beside him. His rent collector, Reineman, is talking, pointing to maps spread out on the desk.
REINEMAN: Look, Mr. Potter, it's no skin off my nose. I'm just your little rent collector. But you can't laugh off this Bailey Park any more. Look at Congressman Blatz is here to see Oh, tell the congressman to wait. Go on.
SECRETARY'S VOICE: Congressman Blatz is here to see Oh, tell the congressman to wait. Go on.
POTTER: ( to dictaphone ) Oh, tell the congressman to wait. ( to Reineman ) Go on.
REINEMAN: Fifteen years ago, a half-dozen houses stuck here and there. There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies. Used to hunt rabbits there myself. Look at it today. Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw. Ninety per cent owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you. Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr. Employer, is becoming just that. And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath Oh, they are, are they? Even though they know the Baileys haven't made a dime out of it.
POTTER: Oh, they are, are they? Even though they know the Baileys haven't made a dime out of it.
REINEMAN: You know very well why. The Baileys were all chumps. Every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build. If I were you, Mr. Potter.
POTTER: ( interrupting ) Well, you are not me.
REINEMAN: ( as he leaves ) As I say, it's no skin off my nose. But one of these days this bright young man is going to be asking George Bailey for a job.
POTTER: The Bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough.
SECRETARY'S VOICE: Yes, sir?
POTTER: Come in here.

GEORGE: Why don't you have your friends join Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh?
JANE: Why don't you have your friends join Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh?
SAM: Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh?
GEORGE: Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
SAM: Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
GEORGE: Oh, now, don't rub it in.
SAM: I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
JANE: Awfully glad to have met you, Mary.
MARY: Nice meeting you.

CLOSE SHOT: Potter is lighting a big cigar which he has just given George. The goon is beside Potter's chair, as usual.
GEORGE: Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. You like it? I'll send you a box.
POTTER: You like it? I'll send you a box.
GEORGE: ( nervously ) Well, I. I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about?
POTTER: ( laughs ) George, now that's just what I like so much about you. ( pleasantly and smoothly ) George, I'm an old man, and most people hate me. But I don't like them either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan. You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it. or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing. Take during the depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our heads. You saved the Building and Loan, and I saved all the rest.
GEORGE: Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
POTTER: The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty- seven, twenty-eight. married, making, say. forty a week.
GEORGE: ( indignantly ) Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. He's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man  who hates his job  who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born. A young man. the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped. Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters. Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate?
POTTER: Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp.

GEORGE: ( mystified ) Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?
POTTER: My point? My point is, I want to hire you.
GEORGE: ( dumbfounded ) Hire me?
POTTER: I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties. George, I'll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a
GEORGE: ( flabbergasted ) Twenty thou. twenty thousand dollars a year?
POTTER: You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
GEORGE: Would I? You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
POTTER: Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
GEORGE: Well, what about the Building and Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
POTTER: Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
GEORGE: Well, Mr. Potter, I. I. I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I. I just. I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty- four hours to think it over?
POTTER: Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
GEORGE: I'd like to do that.
POTTER: In the meantime, I'll draw up the All right, sir.
GEORGE: All right, sir.
POTTER: ( offers hand ) Okay, George?
GEORGE: ( taking his hand ) Okay, Mr. Potter.
GEORGE: ( vehemently ) No. no. no. no, now wait a minute, here! I don't have to talk to anybody! I know right now, and the answer is no! NO! Doggone it! ( getting madder all the time ) You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter! In the. in the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider. You.
GEORGE: .And that goes for you too!
GEORGE: And it goes for you too!
POTTER'S VOICE: You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town. Buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a year. Maybe to Europe once in a while.
GEORGE'S VOICE: I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that.

I'm going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm going to build a bridge a mile long.
GEORGE'S VOICE: What is it you want, Mary? You want the moon? If you do, just say the word; I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you.
MARY: ( singing ) Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight.
GEORGE: Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
MARY: Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
GEORGE: Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
MARY: To keep from being an old maid.
GEORGE: You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
MARY: I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you. .Your what?
GEORGE: You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you. .Your what?

MARY: Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
GEORGE: Is she running a temperature? What is it?
MARY: Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
GEORGE: Gosh, it's this old house. I don't know why we don't all have pneumonia. This drafty old barn! Might as well be living in a refrigerator. Why did we have to live here in the first place and stay around this measly, crummy old town?
MARY: ( worried ) George, what's wrong?
GEORGE: Wrong? Everything's wrong! You call this a happy family? Why did we have to have all these kids?

She is holding her prize flower. George tiptoes in. Then, as he sees she's awake, he comes over, sitting on the edge of her bed.

GEORGE: ( on phone ) Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch? This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father. Say, what kind of a teacher are you anyway? What do you mean sending her home like that, halfnaked? Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you?
MARY: ( shocked )
GEORGE: Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for  to have teachers like you? Silly, stupid, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on? You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe they don't have any decent clothes.
GEORGE: Aw, that stupid.

GEORGE: Tommy, stop that! Stop it!
GEORGE: ( savagely ) Janie, haven't you learned that silly tune yet? You've played it over and over again. Now stop it! Stop it!
CLOSE SHOT: The room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only SOUND being George's labored breathing. George goes over to a corner of the room where his workshop is set up  a drawing table, several models of modern buildings, bridges, etc. Savagely he kicks over the models, picks up some books and hurls them into the corner. Mary and the children watch, horrified. George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he were some unknown wild animal. The three children are crying.
GEORGE: ( gasping for breath ) I'm sorry, Mary, Janie. I'm sorry. I didn't mean. you go on and practice. Pete, I owe you an apology, too. I'm sorry. What do you want to know?

MEDIUM CLOSEUP: Potter is seated at his desk, his goon beside him. He is signing some papers. George is seated in a chair before the desk, without a hat or coat, covered lightly with snow.
GEORGE: I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter. I need help. Through some sort of an accident my company's short in their accounts. The bank examiner's up there today. I've got to raise eight thousand dollars immediately.
POTTER: ( casually ) Oh, so that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about?
GEORGE: ( incredulous ) The reporters?
POTTER: Yes. They called me up from your Building and Loan. Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too. He's looking for you.
GEORGE: ( desperate ) Please help me, Mr. Potter. Help me, won't you please? Can't you see what it means to my family? I'll pay you any sort of a bonus on the loan. any interest. If you still want the Building and Loan, why I.
POTTER: ( interrupting ) George, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?

POTTER: What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
GEORGE: ( incredulous ) Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?

GEORGE: I can't get hold of him. He's in Well, what about all your other They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
POTTER: Well, what about all your other They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?

GEORGE: ( pulls out policy ) I have some life insurance, a fifteen thousand dollar policy.
POTTER: Yes. how much is your equity in Five hundred dollars.
GEORGE: Five hundred dollars.
POTTER: ( sarcastically ) Look at you. You used to be so cocky! You were going to go out and conquer the world! You once called me a warped, frustrated old man. What are you but a warped, frustrated young man? A miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help. No securities  no stocks  no bonds  nothing but a miserable little five hundred dollar equity in a life insurance policy. You're worth more dead than alive. Why don't you go to the riff-raff you love so much and ask them to let you have eight thousand dollar? You know why? Because they'd run you out of town on a rail. But I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you, George. Since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder of the Building and Loan, I'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest. Misappropriation of funds  manipulation  malfeasance.
POTTER: All right, George, go ahead. You can't hide in a little town like Bill? This is Potter.
POTTER: ( on phone ) Bill? This is Potter.
CLOSE SHOT: The place is an Italian restaurant with bar. The bottles sparkle. There are Christmas greens and holly decorating the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. The booths and the checkered-cloth-covered tables are full. There is an air of festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a public drinking place. George is seated at the bar  he has had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to.
MARTINI'S VOICE: ( greeting new customers ) Merry Christmas. Glad you came.
MAN'S VOICE: How about some of that good spaghetti?
MARTINI'S VOICE: We got everything.
GEORGE: God. God. Dear Father in Heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way. I'm at the end of my rope. Show me the way, God.

MARTINI: ( worried ) Why you drink so much, my friend? Please go home, Mr. Bailey. This is Christmas Eve.
MAN: Bailey? Which Bailey?
NICK: This is Mr. George Bailey.
MAN: ( to George ) And the next time you talk to my wife like that you'll get worse. She cried for an hour. It isn't enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write, and you have to bawl her out.

GEORGE: I'm all right.
MARTINI: Please don't go away  please!
MEDIUM SHOT: George's car comes along the empty street, through the falling snow, suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house.

CLOSE SHOT: George has stopped by the railing at the center of the bridge. The snow is now falling hard.
VOICE: ( from river ) Help! Help!
CLOSER ANGLE: George comes up, sees the man flailing about in the water, and CAMERA PANS WITH him as he swims toward the man.
MAN: Help! Help! Help!
CLOSE SHOT: The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, comes running out on the bridge with a flashlight, which he shines on the two figures struggling in the water below.
CLOSE SHOT: The man in the water is Clarence, the angel whose voice we have heard speaking from Heaven. George reaches him, grabs hold of him, and starts swimming for shore.
CLARENCE: I didn't have time to get some stylish underwear. My wife gave me this on my last birthday. I passed away in
CLARENCE: Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too. You should read the new book Mark Twain's writing now.
TOLLKEEPER: How'd you happen to fall in?
CLARENCE: I didn't fall in. I jumped in to save George.
GEORGE: You what? To save me?
CLARENCE: Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
GEORGE: Go through with what?
CLARENCE: George and the tollkeeper react to this.
TOLLKEEPER: It's against the law to commit suicide around here.
CLARENCE: Yeah, it's against the law where I come from, too.
TOLLKEEPER: Where do you come from? I had to act quickly; that's why I jumped in. I knew if I were drowning you'd try to save me. And you see, you did, and that's how I saved you.
CLARENCE: ( to George ) I had to act quickly; that's why I jumped in. I knew if I were drowning you'd try to save me. And you see, you did, and that's how I saved you.
GEORGE: ( offhand ) Very funny.
CLARENCE: Your lip's bleeding, George.
GEORGE: Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.
CLARENCE: ( comes around to George ) Oh, no  no  no. I'm the answer to your prayer. That's why I was sent down here.
GEORGE: ( casually interested ) How do you know my name?
CLARENCE: Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
GEORGE: What are you, a mind reader or Oh, no.
CLARENCE: Oh, no.
GEORGE: Well, who are you, then?
CLARENCE: Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
GEORGE: Odbody. A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
CLARENCE: Angel, Second Class. Cheerio, my good man.
CLARENCE: ( to tollkeeper ) Cheerio, my good man.
GEORGE: Oh, brother. I wonder what Martini put in those drinks?
GEORGE: Hey, what's with you? What did you say just a minute ago? Why'd you want to save me?
CLARENCE: That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
GEORGE: I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
CLARENCE: Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand Yeah. just things like that. Now how'd you know that?
GEORGE: ( bewildered ) Yeah. just things like that. Now how'd you know that?
CLARENCE: I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
GEORGE: Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
CLARENCE: I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
GEORGE: I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
CLARENCE: Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
GEORGE: ( humoring him ) Sure, sure. How?
CLARENCE: By letting me help you.
GEORGE: Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
CLARENCE: Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, Oh, tut, tut, tut.
GEORGE: Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, Oh, tut, tut, tut.
CLARENCE: Oh, tut, tut, tut.
GEORGE: I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
CLARENCE: Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you.
GEORGE: ( interrupts ) Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off. My wife, and my kids and my friends. ( annoyed with Clarence ) Look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you?
CLARENCE: No, you don't understand. I've got my job.
GEORGE: ( savagely ) Aw, shut up, will you.
CLARENCE: ( to himself ) Hmmm, this isn't going to be so easy. ( to George ) So you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, ( dejectedly ) Oh, I don't know. I guess you're right. I suppose it would have been better if I'd never been born at What'd you say?
GEORGE: ( dejectedly ) Oh, I don't know. I guess you're right. I suppose it would have been better if I'd never been born at What'd you say?
CLARENCE: What'd you say?
GEORGE: I said I wish I'd never been born.
CLARENCE: Oh, you mustn't say things like that. .wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea. What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right. You've got your wish. You've never been born.
CLARENCE: ( looking upward ) You don't have to make all that fuss about it.
GEORGE: What did you say?
CLARENCE: You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the
CLARENCE: No worries  no obligations  no eight thousand dollars to get  no Potter looking for you with the
GEORGE: Say something else in that ear.
CLARENCE: ( bending down ) Sure. You can hear out of it.
GEORGE: Well, that's the doggonedest thing. I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
CLARENCE: Your lip's stopped bleeding, too,
GEORGE: What do you know about that. What's George looks around, as though to get his bearings.
GEORGE: It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here? Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry.
CLARENCE: Our clothes are dry.
GEORGE: What do you know about that? Stove's hotter than I thought. Now, come on, get your clothes on, and we'll stroll up to my car and get.
GEORGE: Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.
CLARENCE: I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
GEORGE: You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
MEDIUM SHOT: This is the same empty street where George's car swerved into the tree near the sidewalk. George and Clarence come into shot and up to the spot where George had left his car smashed against the tree. George looks around, but his car is nowhere to be seen, and the tree is undamaged.
CLARENCE: What's the matter?
GEORGE: ( puzzled ) Well, this is where I left my car and it isn't here.
CLARENCE: You have no car.
GEORGE: Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
OWNER: ( politely ) Good evening.
GEORGE: Oh, say. Hey. where's my car?
OWNER: I beg your pardon?
GEORGE: My car, my car. I'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree.
OWNER: What tree?
GEORGE: What do you mean, what tree? This tree. Here, I ran into it. Cut a big gash in the side of it here.
OWNER: You must mean two other trees. You had me worried. One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.
GEORGE: ( blankly ) Pottersville? Why, you mean Bedford I mean Pottersville. ( sharply ) Don't you think I know where I live? What's the matter with you? Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is. ( to Clarence ) .or you are!
OWNER: I mean Pottersville. Don't you think I know where I live? What's the matter with you? Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is. .or you are!
GEORGE: Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is. .or you are!
CLARENCE: It isn't me!
GEORGE: Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel. Clarence! Clarence!
CLARENCE: ( as they go ) Clarence! Clarence!
GEORGE: Clarence! Clarence!
CLOSE SHOT: It is Martini's place, but almost unrecognizable. The cheerful Italian feeling is gone. It is now more of a hard-drinking joint, a honky-tonk. Same bar, tables have no covers. People are lower down and tougher. Nick the bartender is behind the bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice the difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming. They go up to the bar.
GEORGE: ( as they come in ) That's all right. Go on in. Martini's a good friend of mine.
GEORGE: There's a place to sit down. Sit Nick is wiping off the bar as they sit down.
MEDIUM CLOSEUP: Nick is wiping off the bar as they sit down.
GEORGE: Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?
NICK: You want a martini?
GEORGE: No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is Look, I'm the boss. You want a drink or don't you?
NICK: ( impatient ) Look, I'm the boss. You want a drink or don't you?
GEORGE: Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
NICK: ( to Clarence ) What's yours?
CLARENCE: I was just thinking. It's been so long since I.
NICK: ( impatient ) Look, mister, I'm standing here waiting for you to make up your mind.
CLARENCE: ( appreciatively ) That's a good man. I was just thinking of a flaming rum punch. No, it's not cold enough for that. Not nearly cold enough. Wait a minute. wait a minute. I got it. Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves. Off with you, me lad, and be lively!
NICK: Hey, look mister, we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast. And we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere. Is that clear? Or do I have to slip you my left for a
CLARENCE: ( to George ) What's he talking about?
GEORGE: ( soothingly ) Nick  Nick, just give him the same as mine. He's okay.
NICK: Nick turns away to get the drinks.
GEORGE: What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
CLARENCE: You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
CLARENCE: You don't huh? Well, you got any
GEORGE: You don't huh? Well, you got any
CLARENCE: No wonder you jumped in the river.
GEORGE: No wonder you jumped in the river.
CLARENCE: I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
GEORGE: Oh, that's right.
CLARENCE: Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
GEORGE: Made what?
CLARENCE: Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his
GEORGE: Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around Why? Don't they believe in angels?
CLARENCE: Why? Don't they believe in angels?
GEORGE: ( looking at Nick ) A. Yeah, but. you know.
CLARENCE: Then why should they be surprised when they see one?
GEORGE: ( to Nick ) He never grew up. He's. ( to Clarence ) How old are you, anyway, Clarence?
CLARENCE: Two hundred and ninety-three. .next May.
NICK: That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
GEORGE: Look, Nick. What's wrong?
NICK: ( angrily ) And that's another thing. Where do you come off calling me Nick?
GEORGE: Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox. Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come
NICK: What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox. Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come
CLOSE SHOT: A small wreck of a man, with weak, watery eyes. Obviously a broken-down panhandler, his hat in his hand.
NICK: ( to Gower ) Didn't I tell you never to come panhandling around here?
CLOSE SHOT: George, horrified, leaps up and goes over to Gower.
GEORGE: Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
GOWER: No. No.
NICK: ( to his bouncers ) Throw him out. Throw him out.
GEORGE: ( bewildered ) Hey, what is. Hey, Nick, Nick. Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?
NICK: You know, that's another reason for me not to like you. That rumhead spent twenty years in jail for poisoning a kid. If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself. Would you show these gentlemen to the door.
BOUNCER: Sure. This way, gentlemen.
CLOSE SHOT: George and Clarence come flying through the door and land in the snow.
CLOSE SHOT: Nick at the cash register, busily ringing the bell.
NICK: Hey! Get me! I'm giving out wings!
CLOSE SHOT: George and Clarence lying in the snow. George has a strange, puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they landed, looking at each other.
CLARENCE: You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the.
GEORGE: What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly.
GEORGE: ( exasperated ) What the. hey, what's going on around here? Why, this ought to be Martini's place. Look, who are you?
GEORGE: Look, who are you?
CLARENCE: ( patiently ) I told you, George. I'm your guardian
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What. are you a No, of course not.
CLARENCE: No, of course not.
GEORGE: Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
CLARENCE: Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
GEORGE: Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
CLARENCE: You're nobody. You have no identity.
GEORGE: What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
CLARENCE: There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance George looks in his watch pocket.
CLARENCE: They're not there, either.
GEORGE: Zuzu's petals.
CLARENCE: Zuzu's petals.
CLARENCE: You've been given a great gift, George. A chance to see what the world would be like without you.
GEORGE: ( shaking his head ) Now wait a minute, here. Wait a minute here. As, this is some sort of a funny dream I'm having here. So long, mister, I'm going home.
CLARENCE: Home? What home?
GEORGE: ( furious ) Now shut up! Cut it out! You're. you're. you're crazy! That's what I think. you're screwy, and you're driving me crazy, too! I'm seeing things. I'm going home and see my wife and family. Do you understand that? And I'm going home alone!
CLARENCE: How'm I doing, Joseph. Thanks. No, I didn't have a drink!
CLOSE SHOT: George stops before what used to be the offices of the Building and Loan. There is a garish electric sign over the entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs." A crowd of people are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops:
GEORGE: Hey. hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
COP: The Building and what?
GEORGE: The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
COP: They went out of business years ago.
MEDIUM CLOSEUP: George sees the struggling figure of Violet Bick, arrayed as a tart, being dragged into the patrol wagon.
GEORGE: Hey, Violet! Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
COP: I know. I know.
GEORGE: I know that girl!
GEORGE: Hey, Ernie  Ernie!
CLOSE SHOT: Ernie stops the cab, and George enters it.
GEORGE: Ernie, take me home. I'm off my nut!
ERNIE: ( a much harder Ernie ) Where do you live?
GEORGE: Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
ERNIE: Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore?.
GEORGE: Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
ERNIE: All right. He pulls down the flag on the meter and starts the cab.
GEORGE: Look here, Ernie, straighten me out here. I've got some bad liquor or something. Listen to me now. Now, you are Ernie Bishop, and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid? That's right, isn't it?
ERNIE: ( suspiciously ) You seen my wife?
GEORGE: ( exasperated ) Seen your wife? I've been to your house a hundred times.
ERNIE: Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid. And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
GEORGE: Okay. Just step on it. Just get me
ERNIE: Is this the place?
GEORGE: Of course it's the place.
ERNIE: Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
MEDIUM SHOT: George is stopped momentarily by the appearance of the house. Windows are broken, the porch sags, one section of the roof has fallen, doors and shutters hang askew on their hinges. Like a doomed man, George approaches the house.
BERT: What's up, Ernie?
ERNIE: I don't know, but we better keep an eye on this guy. He's bats.
CLOSE SHOT: The interior of the house is lit up here and there, ghostlike, by Ernie's spotlight. No furniture, cobwebs, wallpaper hanging and swinging  stairs are broken and collapsed. In a voice that sounds like a cry for help, George yells out:
GEORGE: Mary! Mary! Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu! Where are you?
CLARENCE: They're not here, George. You have no children.
GEORGE: ( ignoring him ) Where are you? ( then, to Clarence ) What have you done with them?
CLOSE SHOT: Bert is standing in the entrance, with his gun in his hand. Ernie is a few feet behind him, ready to run.
BERT: All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
GEORGE: Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
BERT: Stand back.
GEORGE: Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
ERNIE: ( warningly ) Watch him, Bert.
BERT: Come on, come on.
GEORGE: ( bewildered ) Bert  Ernie! What's the matter with you two guys? You were here on my wedding night. You, both of you, stood out here on the porch and sung to us, don't you remember?
ERNIE: ( nervously ) Think I'd better be going.
BERT: Look, now why don't you be a good kid and we'll take you in to a doctor. Everything's going to be all right.
GEORGE: Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen! It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
BERT: I hate to do this, fella.
CLARENCE: Run. George! Run, George! Help! Joseph, help!
CLARENCE: Help! Joseph, help!
BERT: Oh, shut up!
CLARENCE: Help, oh Joseph, help! Joseph!
BERT: Where'd he go? Where'd he go? I had him right here.
ERNIE: ( stammering ) I need a drink.
BERT: Well, which way'd they go? Help me find 'em.
MEDIUM SHOT: George runs up the path to the front door of the house and raps on the door. He rings the bell and taps on the glass, when his attention is caught by a sign on the wall reading: "Ma Bailey's Boarding House."
MA BAILEY: MA BAILEY
GEORGE: MA BAILEY
MA BAILEY: Mother? What do you want?
GEORGE: Mother, this is George. I thought sure you'd remember me.
MA BAILEY: ( coldly ) George who? If you're looking for a room there's no vacancy.
GEORGE: Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
MA BAILEY: Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
GEORGE: ( desperate ) Well, I know everybody you know. Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.
MA BAILEY: ( suspiciously ) You know him?
GEORGE: Well, sure I do.
MA BAILEY: When'd you see him last?
GEORGE: Today, over at the house.
MA BAILEY: That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
CLARENCE: Strange, isn't it? Each man's life touches so many other lives, and when he isn't around he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?
GEORGE: ( quietly, trying to use logic ) I've heard of things like this. You've got me in some kind of a spell, or something. Well, I'm going to get out of it. I'll get out of it. I know how, too. I. the last man I talked to before all this stuff started happening to me was Martini.
CLARENCE: You know where he lives?
GEORGE: Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
MEDIUM SHOT: George and Clarence approach the tree from which the "Bailey Park" sign once hung. Now it is just outside a cemetery, with graves where the houses used to be.
CLARENCE: Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
GEORGE: Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
CLARENCE: ( as they go ) You weren't here to build them.
CLARENCE: Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine.
GEORGE: That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to war! He got the Congressional Medal of Honor! He saved the lives of every man on that transport.
CLARENCE: ( sadly ) Every man on that transport died. Harry wasn't there to save them because you weren't there to save Harry. You see, George, you really had a wonderful life. Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?
GEORGE: Yes, George?
CLARENCE: Yes, George?
GEORGE: Where's Mary?
CLARENCE: Oh, well, I can't.
GEORGE: I don't know how you know these things, but tell me  where is she?
CLARENCE: If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
GEORGE: If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
CLARENCE: I'm not supposed to tell.
GEORGE: ( becoming violent ) Please, Clarence, tell me where she You're not going to like it, George.
CLARENCE: You're not going to like it, George.
GEORGE: ( shouting ) Where is she?
CLARENCE: She's an old maid. She never married.
GEORGE: ( choking him ) Where's Mary? Where is she?
CLARENCE: Where is she?
GEORGE: Where is she?
CLARENCE: ( in self-defense ) She's just about to close up the
CLARENCE: ( to himself ) There must be some easier way for me to get my wings.
CLOSE SHOT: Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it. We see George watching her from the sidewalk. Mary is very different  no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love of life. Glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close to body. She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self- satisfied and efficient.
CLOSEUP: George, as he watches her.
CLOSE SHOT: George and Mary, on the sidewalk.
GEORGE: She looks up, surprised, but, not recognizing him, continues Mary starts to run away from him, and he follows, desperately.
GEORGE: Mary starts to run away from him, and he follows, desperately.
GEORGE: Mary! Mary!
GEORGE: Mary, it's George! Don't you know me? What's happened to us?
MARY: ( struggling ) I don't know you! Let me go!
GEORGE: Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me. Please, Mary, help me. Where's our kids? I need you, Mary! Help me,
CLOSE SHOT: Small tables, booths, perhaps a counter. It is crowded. Many of the people are the same who were present during the run on the Building and Loan. Mary comes running in, screaming. The place goes into an uproar. George comes in, practically insane. Some of the men grab and hold on to him.
GEORGE: ( shouting ) ( to men holding him ) Let me go! Mary, don't run away!
MAN: Somebody call the police!
ANOTHER MAN: Hit him with a bottle!
ANOTHER MAN: He needs a strait jacket!
MARY: ( from back of room ) That man  stop him!
GEORGE: ( recognizing some of them ) Tom! Ed! Charlie! That's my wife!
GEORGE: Oh, no you don't!
MAN: Oh, no you don't!
GEORGE: ( screaming )
GEORGE: Clarence! Clarence! Where are you?
CLOSE SHOT: Just as George breaks through the door, Bert arrives in his police car. He gets out and heads for the door, to run into George as he comes out.
BERT: Oh, it's you!
BERT: ( to crowd ) Stand back!
MEDIUM SHOT: The same part of the bridge where George was standing before Clarence jumped in. The wind is blowing as it has all through this sequence. George comes running into shot. He is frantically looking for Clarence.
GEORGE: Clarence! Clarence! Help me, Clarence. Get me back. Get me back. I don't care what happens to me. Only get me back to my wife and kids. Help me, Clarence, please! Please! I want to live again!
CLOSEUP: George leaning on the bridge railing, praying.
GEORGE: I want to live again. I want to live again. Please, God, let me live again.
BERT: Hey, George! George! You all right?
BERT: Hey, what's the matter?
GEORGE: ( warningly ) Now get out of here, Bert, or I'll hit you again! Get out!
BERT: What the Sam Hill you yelling for, Don't. George?
GEORGE: Don't. George?
GEORGE: Bert, do you know me?
BERT: Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe. Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
GEORGE: What did.
GEORGE: ( joyously ) My mouth's bleeding, Bert! My mouth's ( feeling in watch pocket ) Zuzu's petals! Zuzu's. they're. they're here, Bert! What do you know about that? Merry Christmas!
LONG SHOT: George runs away from camera yelling
GEORGE: Mary! Mary!
CLOSE SHOT: George's wrecked car is smashed against the tree. He comes running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell, pats the car, and dashes on.
CLOSE SHOT: George sees that the "POTTERSVILLE" sign is now replaced by the original "YOU ARE NOW IN BEDFORD FALLS" sign.
GEORGE: Hello, Bedford Falls! Merry Christmas!
GEORGE: Merry Christmas!
PEOPLE: ( ad lib ) Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, movie house!
GEORGE: Merry Christmas, movie house!
GEORGE: Merry Christmas, emporium!
GEORGE: Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan!
CLOSE SHOT: George notices a light in Potter's office window, and races across the street.
CLOSE SHOT: Potter is seated working at his desk, his goon by his side. George pounds on the window.
GEORGE: ( from outside ) Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!
POTTER: Happy New Year to you  in jail! Go on home  they're waiting for you!
CLOSE SHOT: Carter, the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and photographer, and a sheriff, are waiting in the hall for George. George comes dashing in the front door.
GEORGE: ( excitedly ) ( sees the men ) Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
CARTER: ( surprised ) Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit!
GEORGE: I know. Eight thousand dollars.
SHERIFF: ( reaching into pocket ) George, I've got a little paper here.
GEORGE: ( happily ) I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest. Isn't it wonderful? Merry Christmas!
GEORGE: Reporters? Where's Mary?
GEORGE: Oh, look at this wonderful old drafty house! Mary! Mary!
GEORGE: Have you seen my wife?
CHILDREN'S VOICES: Merry Christmas, Daddy! Merry Christmas, Daddy!
MEDIUM SHOT: The three children are at the top of the stairs. They are in their pajamas.
GEORGE: George starts to run up the stairs, and the old familiar knob on the banister comes off in his hand. He kisses it lovingly and puts it back, then continues up the stairs.
GEORGE: Pete  kids  Janie  Tommy. I could eat you up!
CLOSE SHOT: George and the kids. He is hugging them.
GEORGE: Where's your mother?
JANIE: She went looking for you with Uncle Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
ZUZU: Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
GEORGE: Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
ZUZU: And not a smitch of temperature.
JANIE: And not a smitch of temperature.
GEORGE: ( laughing ) Not a smitch of temp.
CLOSE SHOT: As Mary comes through the door, breathless and excited. The four men are watching with open mouths.
GEORGE'S VOICE: ( to the men ) ( sees George ) George! Darling!
MARY: ( to the men ) ( sees George ) George! Darling!
CLOSE SHOT: Mary races up the stairs, where George meets her in a fierce
GEORGE: Mary! Mary!
MARY: George, darling! Where have you been?
MARY: Oh, George, George, George.
GEORGE: Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're Oh, George, George!
MARY: Oh, George, George!
GEORGE: You have no idea what's happened to You have no idea what happened. Well, come on, George, come on downstairs quick. They're on their All right.
MARY: You have no idea what happened. Well, come on, George, come on downstairs quick. They're on their All right.
MARY: Well, come on, George, come on downstairs quick. They're on their All right.
GEORGE: All right.
