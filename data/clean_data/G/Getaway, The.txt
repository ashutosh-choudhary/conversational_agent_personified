PASSENGER COP: ( CONTINUED )
DOC: CAROL STANDS ON THE ACCELERATOR. THE MERCURY GOES screaming forward, as Doc shoots out the back window. Then, as the terrified cops duck to the side, he shoots out their front windshield. The Mercury bounces up across the sidewalk as the empty plates and glasses topple off the serving tray and roll across the concrete. The car slams back down through a vacant space on the opposite side, and moves around in a semicircle across the asphalt, heading for the highway exit. DOC SMASHES OUT THE REAR WINDOW with the butt of his shotgun. THE BLACK AND WHITE NOW IN REVERSE, ZOOMING BACK, trying to get between the Mercury and the highway.
