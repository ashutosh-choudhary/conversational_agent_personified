SHOOTING DRAFT: FADE IN: NEON SIGN - THE PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT The N and the E are not working. So it reads the PR IC motel. ROOMS TO RENT BY DAY, WEEK, MONTH. KITCHENETTES. The Prince Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are parked outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains closed, but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We PUSH in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the parking lot. Then the curtain closes.
DIVINCI: Says here they got slips in Honolulu. 325 a month. Utilities included. That's not bad.
DIVINCI: But I gotta get at least a forty footer. It'll handle rough water better and I'll need the room if I'm gonna live on it. I don't know how you do it.
RODRIGUEZ: I don't know how you do it.
DIVINCI: How you can think about Hawaii now?
RODRIGUEZ: How you can think about Hawaii now?
DIVINCI: My heart's in Hawaii.
RODRIGUEZ: You never been there. How can your heart be there.
DIVINCI: You're tellin' me there's no place you'd rather be other than here?
RODRIGUEZ: No, I'm saying I just don't know how you can think about Hawaii right If I was in Hawaii right now, I wouldn't be thinking about here. See the difference?
DIVINCI: If I was in Hawaii right now, I wouldn't be thinking about here. See the difference?
RODRIGUEZ: Look, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here. But I don't want to be here, I want to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii, therefore I think about it so as to not get depressed about being here.
DIVINCI: Look, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here. But I don't want to be here, I want to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii, therefore I think about it so as to not get depressed about being here.
RODRIGUEZ: But I'm here, I know I'm here, I don't like being here, but I can't be anyplace else because I look around and I see all this shit. How do you get around that?! That's what I'm
DIVINCI: Divinci nods. Rodriguez looks at his watch.
RODRIGUEZ: Divinci nods. Rodriguez looks at his watch.
RODRIGUEZ: It's time. No more Hawaii, okay? Focus on this.
DIVINCI: ( smiles )
RODRIGUEZ: ( to himself ) Aloha my ass.
CYNTHIA: Left at the corner.
DIVINCI: Hope you don't mind me checkin' you for weapons.
HUDD: Hell yes I mind.
HUDD: I just don't want no man handlin'
DIVINCI: Okay. Check him.
HUDD: Lotta good hidin' places on this body. Check good.
HUDD: Careful. It's loaded.
CYNTHIA: He's got nothin'.
HUDD: Not bad, not bad. Any more where this came from?
DIVINCI: Then maybe we talk again.
HUDD: Then maybe we talk again.
DIVINCI: Hudd stands, unzips his pants. Reaches in to grab his cock, but instead, pulls out a stack of MONEY. Inch thick.
HUDD: Told you there was a lotta good hidin' places on this body.
HUDD: Bet you gotta lotta nice hidin' places, too.
THE CADILLAC: swerves into a parked car. The OTHER CAR a BUICK REGAL screeches to a stop next to it. ONE MAN gets out. Moving quickly to the Cadillac. It's dark, difficult to see. He carries a SMITH AND WESSON .44. Opens the door. He's wearing
RODRIGUEZ: Come on! Hurry up!
THE BUICK: tears off down the dark street.
CYNTHIA: Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street before you get run over. Joe, wake
CYNTHIA: You're in the street, Joe. Get outa the street.
CYNTHIA: Other way, Joe.
CYNTHIA: Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better off right there. I don't think you'd even feel it.
CYNTHIA: Who is it?
DIVINCI: Got your money.
CYNTHIA: Put it on the table.
DIVINCI: I'm not.
CYNTHIA: I'm not.
DIVINCI: I'm not.
CYNTHIA: Take a sleeping pill. There's some in my purse.
DIVINCI: You want your money?
CYNTHIA: I already worked for that.
DIVINCI: This is a bonus.
CYNTHIA: For who?
DIVINCI: This ain't my fault. This is a failure of our educational system. If you hadn't fallen through the cracks and dropped outa school, you wouldn't be here now.
CYNTHIA: So what's your excuse?
DIVINCI: I'm in love.
VIC: Keepin' some late hours.
RODRIGUEZ: What the hell you doin'? What're my neighbors gonna think?
VIC: I apologize. I understand your concerns. But you must understand that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one's debts. I am forced to employ the likes of Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might add, contributes significantly to my overhead. I am the real loser here. And I am concerned about your sincerity in repaying the twenty- seven thousand, nine hundred forty- two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due. What can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?
RODRIGUEZ: I can make your life fuckin' miserable that's what I can do.
VIC: Look at me. Do I have a wife and three kids? Do I have a good job at IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and no. I loan money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you who can't control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then I am forced to stay up all night trying to convince them that I have needs, too. The point of which is, I already have a fuckin' miserable life. So don't threaten me you lousy bag of cat shit.
VIC: All I'm askin' is that you be responsible. Is that unreasonable?
RODRIGUEZ: Four thousand is all I got.
VIC: I am proportionally reassured. You purchased yourself an extension.
RODRIGUEZ: Cutless Supreme, what kind of fuckin' idiot name is that?
CUTLESS SUPREME: It was the car my daddy stole to take my momma to the hospital, but the cops stopped him and shot him dead in an alley before he could explain. I was born in the back seat.
PATROLMAN MAHONEY: Another day, another body. Where you wanna start?
FIRST MAN: A hit?
PATROLMAN MAHONEY: Looks like. Could be gang related.
PATROLMAN MAHONEY: Happened sometime last night, early morning, two, three o'clock. African- American male, looks like in his thirties. But even that's a guess. Half his head is on the upholstery.
RODRIGUEZ: Any witnesses?
PATROLMAN MAHONEY: Oh, sure, hundreds.
DIVINCI: Fuckin' Animals.
FIRST DETECTIVE: .three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.
DESK OFFICER: Three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.
DIVINCI: One less drug store on the street.
DESK OFFICER: And the world is a safer place.
RODRIGUEZ: ( into phone ) a green car. you know what make. Maybe a Ford, uh-huh. You didn't see the license, did you?
RODRIGUEZ: ( into phone ) Yeah, no, I understand, it was dark.
DIVINCI: Wanna go for a ride?
RODRIGUEZ: ( into phone ) You think you could describe the ( covers phone; to Divinci ) You bought it?
DIVINCI: As of last night, I've got the down. Just picture me under swayin' palms with a Mai Tai.
RODRIGUEZ: ( into phone ) ( covers phone ) You're gonna buy it, no shit. When?
DIVINCI: Just a phone call away.
RODRIGUEZ: That's really great, man.
RODRIGUEZ: ( back to phone ) Uh-huh, okay. how tall was he?
CAPT. HENDERSON: You got primary on the drug related this morning on 27th.
DIVINCI: I'm workin' it up now.
CAPT. HENDERSON: Who's your second? In my office. Both of you.
DIVINCI: CAPT. HENDERSON
CAPT. HENDERSON: Captain Henderson doesn't wait for a response. He heads for the office an inner office of glass and wood. Divinci looks at Rodriguez, who is suddenly a little nervous. We can HEAR the PERSON OVER THE PHONE that he's talking to, but he's no longer interested and hangs up on them.
RODRIGUEZ: What the hell
CAPT. HENDERSON: Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez, this is Richard Simms. He's with the D.E.A. He wants to ask you some questions about your case.
DIVINCI: What's the occasion?
SIMMS: You get an i.d. on the victim?
RODRIGUEZ: We're waitin' for prints.
DIVINCI: Car was registered to
SIMMS: Anchor Imports. 81 El Dorado. If you got all this, what d'you want from us?
DIVINCI: If you got all this, what d'you want from us?
SIMMS: .The man in the car is Lionel Hudd.
RODRIGUEZ: ( a little incensed ) How d'you know that? ( to Henderson ) What's goin' on here?
SIMMS: Hudd was DEA, undercover.
DIVINCI: We'll do everything we can to help.
RODRIGUEZ: SHIT, FUCK, SHIT, JESUS CHRIST! Calm down!
DIVINCI: Calm down!
RODRIGUEZ: WE'RE DEAD, WE'RE FUCKING DEAD! SHUT UP! FUCK, FUCK, FUCK! STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW, STOP IT! GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT OF CONTROL!
DIVINCI: SHUT UP! FUCK, FUCK, FUCK! STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW, STOP IT! GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT OF CONTROL!
SHUT UP!: FUCK, FUCK, FUCK! STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW, STOP IT! GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT OF CONTROL!
RODRIGUEZ: FUCK, FUCK, FUCK! STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW, STOP IT! GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT OF CONTROL!
DIVINCI: STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW, STOP IT! GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT OF CONTROL!
STOP IT!: GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT OF CONTROL!
RODRIGUEZ: GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT OF CONTROL!
OF CONTROL!: Rodriguez tries to push Divinci away, but Divinci holds on. They struggle
RODRIGUEZ: LET GO OF ME! Shut up and listen to me!
DIVINCI: Shut up and listen to me!
DIVINCI: They could be watchin' us right now you asshole. So fuckin' shape up! You got it?! I want you to nod!
DIVINCI: Get the fuck up!
DIVINCI: Get in the car!
DIVINCI: There's no fuckin' reason to panic.
RODRIGUEZ: No fuckin' reason to panic? Did you say no fuckin' reason to panic!
DIVINCI: Stop being an idiot! We're the cops on the case. It's our case. We are going to find the fuckin' killers.
RODRIGUEZ: WE'RE THE FUCKIN' KILLERS! Since when does that matter?!
DIVINCI: Since when does that matter?!
DIVINCI: All they want is someone to go down for the crime, right? Do we care who goes down for the crime? Fuck no. As long as someone goes down for the crime. It's a slot that's gotta be
RODRIGUEZ: We killed a cop, doesn't that bother Of course it bothers me. What d'you want me to do, turn myself in? Well I'm not. That's the risk we take everyday, somebody might pop us, especially undercover like that. So he got popped. It happens.
DIVINCI: Of course it bothers me. What d'you want me to do, turn myself in? Well I'm not. That's the risk we take everyday, somebody might pop us, especially undercover like that. So he got popped. It happens.
RODRIGUEZ: Not by other cops!
DIVINCI: I patted him down! He wasn't wearin' a wire, he had no badge, no gun, how was I supposed to know?!
DIVINCI: Look, I feel just as bad as you do, but we gotta start thinkin' about us here. The important thing is we don't lose control of the case. We can never lose control of the case. Whatever evidence there is goes through us. We lay down the trail. Make it nice and logical. We're the teachers and two and two can add up to five if it's our classroom.
RODRIGUEZ: What're you talkin' about, are you sayin' we stick somebody with this?
DIVINCI: Evidence points wherever we want it to point. Shit, we can provide so much evidence, even the asshole we pick will think he fuckin' killed You got some asshole in mind?
RODRIGUEZ: You got some asshole in mind?
DIVINCI: Just don't worry. We'll find a killer. There's lots of 'em out there.
JAMES: What the hell'd I do now?
JAMES: Ain't my gun.
DIVINCI: Never is, is it.
JAMES: That ain't my fuckin' gun.
DIVINCI: Got your fuckin' prints on it.
RODRIGUEZ: Where were you Friday night?
JAMES: Friday night. last Friday night?
RODRIGUEZ: Where were you?
JAMES: Whatever you think I did went down last Friday night?
DIVINCI: Better have a good alibi, James, or it's good ali bye-bye.
JAMES: I was in jail you assholes. Check it All night. What a couple a dickheads!
MOVE IT!: CUT BACK TO: THE .44 - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY SLIDING across the table back to Rodriguez and Divinci. Cortez sits across from them. Wearing white t-shirt, baggy pants. Tattoos on his arms.
CORTEZ: Ain't my gun.
RODRIGUEZ: ( smiles ) Got your prints on it.
CORTEZ: ( stands; angry ) You fuck, I ain't never seen that gun before!
RODRIGUEZ: Where were you last Friday night?
CORTEZ: Fuck you. I wanna talk to a lawyer!
RODRIGUEZ: Lawyer's not gonna help you, Cortez. All the evidence we got points right to you.
CORTEZ: Did you say last Friday night?
CORTEZ: Intensive Care, you pindejo fuckin' gutter shits. And Thursday night, and Saturday, too. I just fucking got out this morning.
DAVE: Alright, alright, alright. shit. I ain't gonna fight you.
DAVE: Ain't my gun.
RODRIGUEZ: That's what they all say.
DAVE: Wish it was. No better gun than Smitty and Wes .44 mag with serial numbers filed off. Got any bullets?
DAVE: Who did I kill?
DIVINCI: Where were you last Friday night?
DAVE: You mean, what's my alibi right?
DAVE: I was breakin' and entering. Jewelry store on seventh and Front, about nine o'clock. Not even close to your jurisdiction. I got the rocks to prove it.
DAVE: Sorry I can't help ya. But one to five is better than ten to life.
DIVINCI: Montrose LaJolla.
RODRIGUEZ: We pulled him in last year for knifing that dealer on 32nd.
DIVINCI: Yeah. Almost killed him, remember? He'd be good.
DETECTIVE ): Anybody seen Montrose LaJolla?
ANOTHER DETECTIVE: He's dead. His life partner killed him in a Domestic D about a month
RODRIGUEZ: Divinci looks at him. Rodriguez is angry, tense. Divinci gives him a look telling him this is not the time and place for a discussion on this topic.
DIVINCI: Take it easy.
RODRIGUEZ: This isn't gonna work!
DIVINCI: Nobody said it was gonna be easy. But let's not advertise our despair.
DIVINCI: ( into phone )
DIVINCI: This is our case! Not the goddamn It's been three days.
CAPT. HENDERSON: It's been three days.
DIVINCI: We're not fuckin' magicians! What the hell is three days?! This is a goddamn murder case! It takes a little bit of goddamn time!
CAPT. HENDERSON: When a Federal Undercover Officer goes down, it's never a fuckin' murder case! I don't like the DEA on my ass any better than you like 'em on yours. But this is personal for them and they want answers. Forget your other cases and get something, anything that I can give to them. The last thing I want is the goddamn F.B.I. on my back, too.
DIVINCI: We've got a couple leads. We need a little more time.
CAPT. HENDERSON: I can't hold 'em off much longer.
RODRIGUEZ: This is no fuckin' way to run an Let me tell you both something, if you don't solve this quick, they're gonna start askin' why? And they'll be lookin' to blame somebody in this department. So my advise to you is, get something fuckin' fast or turn over what you've got and get outa the way.
CAPT. HENDERSON: Let me tell you both something, if you don't solve this quick, they're gonna start askin' why? And they'll be lookin' to blame somebody in this department. So my advise to you is, get something fuckin' fast or turn over what you've got and get outa the way.
DIVINCI: How much time we got?
CAPT. HENDERSON: A couple days. The funeral's this What funeral?
RODRIGUEZ: What funeral?
CAPT. HENDERSON: For Agent Hudd. Simms wants you there.
DIVINCI: What for? We didn't know him.
CAPT. HENDERSON: How the hell do I know?! It's DEA, it's their thing. You're the cops on the case, I suppose they want you to know what a great guy Hudd was so you'll work all that harder to find his killer. Just go. It'll reassure 'em how much you care and keep 'em off my ass.
REVEREND: and it is too easy to say that he was a good man in his job because he gave more than most. And it's too easy to say that he was a good man in his community because he gave more than others. And it's too easy to say he was a good man at home with his family because he was always there when they needed him. Special Agent Lionel Hudd was not just a good man, he was an extraordinary man. And his death shall not be in
DIVINCI: Don't Humpty Dumpty on me.
RODRIGUEZ: What's that mean?
DIVINCI: Your cracks are startin' to show.
RODRIGUEZ: ( covering )
DIVINCI: Get your balance. Here comes the
SIMMS: Glad you came. Anything break?
DIVINCI: Nothin' to brag about. But we've got a couple new leads we're followin'.
SIMMS: .Look, normally we'd be all over this, but your Captain seems to think you can do the job. It's your territory. I guess you know it better than anybody. And that can be worth a lot. But you understand. we won't wait forever.
DIVINCI: Just outa curiosity. What happened to his backup? You guys use backup on undercover don't you?
SIMMS: It was a new lead. Hudd was afraid backup would blow his cover. He was supposed to check in ten minutes after the deal went down. He never checked in.
RODRIGUEZ: We want this one as bad as you do. A cop's a cop. We're in this together,
SIMMS: That's why I asked you to come here. Just so you knew that.
DIVINCI: He didn't have backup. You believe that?! Jesus what a dick.
RODRIGUEZ: I don't think we should criticize that particular decision of his.
DIVINCI: I don't care what the reasons are, you don't play Lone Fuckin' Ranger on a drug buy. You're just askin' for it. That's all I'm sayin'.
RODRIGUEZ: I don't trust those bastards. They're not waitin' for us. That's bullshit. They're runnin' their own investigation. I know it!
DIVINCI: Let 'em. The gun, the coke came from evidence. The car came from impound. So what's to find?
RODRIGUEZ: That's what I'm afraid of. There's nothing for them to find. We were too good.
DIVINCI: So what're you worried about?
RODRIGUEZ: Nobody is that fuckin' good.
DIVINCI: Except us.
CYNTHIA: I think this is breaking and entering, isn't it?
DIVINCI: I work homicide, I don't deal with that shit.
CYNTHIA: ( puts on robe ) Learn anything you didn't already have on file?
DIVINCI: Yeah. You surprise me sometimes. Here I think you're just a hard case and I discover you've got a heart of You're an organ donor. That's really nice. The only problem is, they'll never use your best parts.
CYNTHIA: I'll make sure you get them.
DIVINCI: Hey, don't get me wrong. I was just surprised that we had something in common. Besides what we have in Do everybody a favor, if you're gonna donate your heart, make sure it goes to science. Most people want one that beats.
CYNTHIA: Do everybody a favor, if you're gonna donate your heart, make sure it goes to science. Most people want one that beats.
DIVINCI: Cynthia. pretty name. What do the first three letters spell?
CYNTHIA: Don't get so clever. It's out of
CYNTHIA: What's so interesting up there?
DIVINCI: Then why's it got all your attention?
CYNTHIA: Then why's it got all your attention?
DIVINCI: I'm thinkin', that's all.
CYNTHIA: About us?
DIVINCI: Divinci looks at Cynthia.
CYNTHIA: Divinci looks at Cynthia.
DIVINCI: What if I was thinkin' about us?
CYNTHIA: Don't waste your time.
DIVINCI: What if I was?
CYNTHIA: Where's it gonna get us?
DIVINCI: Maybe I got plans.
CYNTHIA: I don't wanna hear 'em. Plans just make you think somethin's gonna get better. I'm fine now. I don't need to get screwed up waitin' for something good to happen.
DIVINCI: I just want you to know, love is important to me.
CYNTHIA: Me, too.
DIVINCI: But more important is loyalty. Nothing is more important than that. Not love, not anything. Because loyalty is about respect. You can talk about love all you want, but without respect it's empty. I mean the first thing that goes in a marriage is respect. And once it's gone, forget the love. So I am telling you, I am loyal to you. Like I'm loyal to my partner. We are closer than blood. And I trust him with my life.
CYNTHIA: Why're you telling me this?
DIVINCI: When you asked if I was thinkin' about us and I said I wasn't, I just want you to know that I do.
CYNTHIA: Just don't ask me to marry you.
DIVINCI: ( smiles ) Why aren't more women like you?
DIVINCI: ( lowers gun ) You fuckin' idiot.
DIVINCI: What've we got here?
DIVINCI: Where were you last Friday night?
DIVINCI'S VOICE: What's your name?
DIVINCI: Your name, what's your name?
WILLIAM: Where'd you get the gun, Joe?
DIVINCI: Where'd you get the gun, Joe?
DIVINCI: It was in your pocket, Joe, your coat pocket. You must keep it for protection, right?
WILLIAM: I don't know.
DIVINCI: Sure you do, Joe. Everybody needs protection. Especially a guy like you lives on the street, right?
DIVINCI: Put it back in your pocket, Joe. You don't have to worry about me, I'm not gonna hurt you.
DIVINCI: Wake up, Joe! I want you to look at something. Out the window, Joe. Look out the window.
DIVINCI: This is where it happened, Joe. I want you to remember it. This is where you killed him
DIVINCI: You remember it now? How you shot him through the head? You remember I. don't.
WILLIAM: I. don't.
DIVINCI: ( lets go of Joe ) You will.
THE CAR: tears off down the street.
RODRIGUEZ: Who the hell is this?
DIVINCI: Is that any way to answer the phone?
RODRIGUEZ: Divinci, shit! It's quarter to six.
DIVINCI: I know what time it is, I'm not the one in bed. I need the photos of the I got a suspect. But he can't remember all the details. He needs a little help. And I thought, since you're my partner, you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin'
RODRIGUEZ: I got a suspect. But he can't remember all the details. He needs a little help. And I thought, since you're my partner, you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin'
DIVINCI: I got a suspect. But he can't remember all the details. He needs a little help. And I thought, since you're my partner, you might jump at the opportunity to lend me a fuckin'
RODRIGUEZ: He doesn't remember last Friday?
DIVINCI: He doesn't remember a lotta Fridays. Bring the shots and pick up a fifth of Vodka. Make it two.
DIVINCI: Time to get up, Joe.
DIVINCI: I want you to look at something.
DIVINCI: There's the guy and the street and the car. You remember how you shot
DIVINCI: You don't remember? That's not what you told me last night.
DIVINCI: If you remember you can have a drink.
DIVINCI: But you gotta remember how you saw him driving toward you and you were in the street and you were afraid he was going to hit you so you had to shoot to protect yourself. You remember now don't you?
DIVINCI: And where's your gun, Joe, where do you keep your gun?
RODRIGUEZ: Why'd you kill him?
WILLIAM: I. don't know.
RODRIGUEZ: It was your gun.
WILLIAM: .I don't have a gun.
DIVINCI: Yes you do. In your pocket.
WILLIAM: .I'm tired.
DIVINCI: I know, Joe, it's tough to remember things you don't wanna remember. What about your last name, Joe. You got a last name?
RODRIGUEZ: Come on, Joe, everybody's got a last I don't remember.
WILLIAM: I don't remember.
RODRIGUEZ: Don't fuck with us, Joe. We're trying to help you. What's your last goddamn
WILLIAM: I don't know. Come on, we're all tired here, Joe. Just give us your last name.
DIVINCI: ( to Joe; friendly ) Come on, we're all tired here, Joe. Just give us your last name.
WILLIAM: I don't remember.
DIVINCI: .Okay, fine, what's in a name? But you remember the gun, right, in your
DIVINCI: And you remember that you told me you thought he was going to hit you, right? That's why you shot.
WILLIAM: Divinci looks at Rodriguez. Rodriguez nods.
DIVINCI: How'd it happen, Joe, tell me how it You saw him driving toward you
WILLIAM: I saw him driving toward me
A .44: is pulled from a jacket pocket, lifted toward the APPROACHING CAR. The gun is in the hands of Joe. He is scared. The HEADLIGHTS COMING RIGHT AT HIM. He aims and FIRES the gun.
RODRIGUEZ: Then what did you do?
DIVINCI: You ran.
JOE'S VOICE: I didn't mean to.
WILLIAM: He was going to hit me. I was scared. he was going to hit me.
DIVINCI: That's why you shot him.
WILLIAM: That's why I.
JOE'S VOICE: .shot him.
DIVINCI: Helluva nice shot, Joe.
CYNTHIA: It's the middle of the day. Just talk.
DIVINCI: Just talk.
CYNTHIA: Since when?
DIVINCI: I need you to do something.
CYNTHIA: Good, I need the money.
DIVINCI: This isn't a deal. Where you goin'?
CYNTHIA: I got perishables, okay?
DIVINCI: The guy we did the last deal with is
CYNTHIA: Somebody popped him that night, probably when he tried to unload the stuff. I don't know.
DIVINCI: Somebody popped him that night, probably when he tried to unload the stuff. I don't know.
CYNTHIA: Jesus, does anybody
DIVINCI: Don't worry, there's no connection. We got the guy who did it.
CYNTHIA: You scared the hell outa me.
DIVINCI: We just need you to do one thing.
CYNTHIA: CUT TO:
DIVINCI: He'll be third from the left. Don't fuck up. Third from the left.
CYNTHIA: What'm I supposed to say?
DIVINCI: Just look at 'em and then look at the man the third from the left and say, It's him.
RODRIGUEZ: And I'll say, Are you sure?
DIVINCI: And you say, Absolutely. No question.
CYNTHIA: This is all I need to do right?
DIVINCI: We have a signed confession. You i.d. him, he's goin' straight into the can.
CYNTHIA: Okay, okay. But this is it. I'm not doin' anything more than this.
DIVINCI: Hey, it's a done deal.
A VOICE: Stop and face front.
THE VOICE: Lift your heads, look straight.
DIVINCI: Take your time. Try and remember his
CYNTHIA: I know him.
DIVINCI: If you can identify the man
CYNTHIA: ( whisper ) I know him.
DIVINCI: Just tell us which one.
CYNTHIA: No. I fucking know him.
RODRIGUEZ: What's the problem?
DIVINCI: There's no problem! Do you see him up there?!
CYNTHIA: ( aside ) You don't understand.
THE VOICE: No talking.
DIVINCI: Pick the asshole out!
CYNTHIA: Third man from the left.
JOE: squints against the harsh light, trying to see into the room, as if he recognized the voice.
DAY: Rodriguez, Divinci and Cynthia move briskly down the hall. None happy about what just happened. The conversation is
DIVINCI: You mind telling me what that was all about?!
CYNTHIA: I know him. He hangs around my building. He lives in the alley or
DIVINCI: You don't think people that hang around your neighborhood can kill somebody. Well let me tell you something. You don't live in a great fuckin' neighborhood.
DIVINCI: Just sign the goddamn paper.
CYNTHIA: What paper?
RODRIGUEZ: You picked a man out of a lineup, you have to sign that you did that so they don't think we made it up.
CYNTHIA: Now why the hell would they think something like that?
DIVINCI: Sign it.
CYNTHIA: You said all I had to do was pick him out.
DIVINCI: This is part of it. Just sign it and you're done.
CYNTHIA: How come you're so sure it was him?
RODRIGUEZ: Jesus Christ!
DIVINCI: He confessed.
CYNTHIA: We got it in writing.
RODRIGUEZ: We got it in writing.
CYNTHIA: He didn't do it.
DIVINCI: How the hell d'you know that? Were you with him at the time?! You have a good goddamn alibi for him?!
RODRIGUEZ: Maybe she was blowing him!
CYNTHIA: Better him than you.
DIVINCI: Take it easy.
RODRIGUEZ: Fine, I got nothin' at stake here.
DIVINCI: This is what they call an open and shut case. He did the kill and he's going down. Don't make the mistake of thinking you know the right thing to do.
SIMMS: Simms looks across at Rodriguez and Divinci. Capt. Henderson and TWO OTHER DEA AGENTS ( HOOPER and SARKASIAN ) are also present. The DEA are in suits and ties.
RODRIGUEZ: He wouldn't give us his last name.
SIMMS: He signed a confession but he wouldn't give you his last name?
DIVINCI: He said he couldn't remember it. He's a head case.
AGENT HOOPER: You run prints?
RODRIGUEZ: No priors.
AGENT SARKASIAN: Ballistics match?
RODRIGUEZ: We're waiting. But a forty-four was used in commission. He had a forty- four on him.
AGENT HOOPER: It went down pretty quick.
DIVINCI: It's our street.
CAPT. HENDERSON: I think they did a helluva job.
SIMMS: Everyone turns to Simms. He's angry. Rodriguez is uneasy.
SIMMS: Some goddamn piece a shit blows him away for NOTHING!
SIMMS: I'm sorry. Hudd was too good for this to happen. I just didn't think he'd go down this way.
SIMMS: Good work. Thanks.
CAPT. HENDERSON: Do me a favor. Make sure this one sticks. I don't want the D.E.Assholes back in here.
GLASS: SHATTERS in SLOW MOTION.
JOE: covers his face with his hands to protect himself from the glass. But there is no glass. Joe is sweating, detoxing. Wild eyed. He looks through his fingers, but there is no street, no dead man. Just the BARS of his CELL.
GUARD: Word is he killed a DEA undercover. Word is he shot him in the face. Word is he signed a confession.
ELLIOT: Word is everyone's entitled to a defense. no matter how guilty they
ELLIOT: Oh shit.
DOCTOR: He's detoxing. I gave him something to help him through it.
ELLIOT: Can I talk to him?
ELLIOT: Joe, can you hear me?
ELLIOT: I'm Elliot Goff. I'm your attorney. Do you understand what I'm saying?
HELEN: when the defendant, Clyde Dunner, entered the house of George and Carol Beaman on Friday night, a .44 caliber pistol in his hand. He entered the house with one thing in mind. To kill George and Carol, the people he blamed for the break up of his marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.
HELEN: George and Carol were watching a movie when he entered the living room and opened fire. George was killed instantly, hit in the face. Carol died later of three bullet wounds to her chest.
HELEN: Then the defendant, in his effort to cover up the crime, doused them with lighter fluid and set the house on fire. Carol was still alive.
HELEN: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury we will prove to you, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the defendant, Clyde David Dunner, is guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree.
JUDGE WEINBERG: The defense may now proceed.
RICHARD STEIN: Jesus Christ!
YOUNG MAN: I don't know where?
RICHARD STEIN: Are you sure?
YOUNG MAN: They looked all over
HELEN: What's wrong?
RICHARD STEIN: They can't find the murder weapon.
HELEN: What're you talking about?
RICHARD STEIN: Dunner's .44. They can't find the goddamn gun!
YOUNG MAN: They lost it or something. Misplaced it, I don't know. They can't find it
HELEN: ( no whisper this time )
HELEN: I don't have a goddamn case without the goddamn gun. His fingerprints, the ballistics, everything! I have to have the fucking gun or he's gonna walk. That murdering piece of filth will go free without the .44. How could they lose it?!
RODRIGUEZ: The Dunner gun, you used the fucking Dunner gun?!
DIVINCI: This is not my fuck up! Our shooting was supposed to be gang-related and unsolved! Only because we tagged a goddamn undercover cop do we need the fucking .44 for evidence! Otherwise, we never woulda needed it. So don't point your finger at Alright, alright. But how are we supposed to explain how the same gun was used in two murder cases by two different killers when it was supposed to be in police custody?!
RODRIGUEZ: Alright, alright. But how are we supposed to explain how the same gun was used in two murder cases by two different killers when it was supposed to be in police custody?!
DIVINCI: We don't explain it. It's not our fault they lost the evidence. Ballistics are already complete in Dunner's case. All we need is another
DIVINCI: The .44.
RODRIGUEZ: THE GUN SELLER
ELLIOT: Joe, I'm Elliot, we met the other. well, you weren't in very good shape. You look much better.
ELLIOT: Have a chair. We need to talk.
WILLIAM: About what I did.
ELLIOT: Joe crosses to the table and takes a chair opposite Elliot.
ELLIOT: Joe, before we get into what happened that night, I'd like to check a couple of things first. Joe is your first name, I assume
WILLIAM: Okay? Not the answer Elliot was looking for.
ELLIOT: What about Doe? Is that what you told the officers your last name I don't think so.
WILLIAM: I don't think so.
ELLIOT: What did you tell them your last name was?
WILLIAM: I don't remember.
ELLIOT: Well, is Doe your last name?
WILLIAM: I'm not sure.
ELLIOT: Do you know what your last name is?
WILLIAM: I don't remember.
ELLIOT: Joe, I'm your attorney, I'm here to help you. It doesn't matter if you give the court your last name or not, they will still put you on trial. Do you understand?
WILLIAM: So there's no reason to try and hide your identity. What is your last name?
ELLIOT: So there's no reason to try and hide your identity. What is your last name?
WILLIAM: I would tell you if I could remember.
ELLIOT: Joe Smith, Joe Jones, Joe DiMaggio.
WILLIAM: .I don't think so.
ELLIOT: Okay. Look, we'll move on. You understand the charges against you. They're serious. And if you are found guilty, you could go to prison for a very long time.
WILLIAM: Maybe I should.
ELLIOT: Go to prison. I killed him. I didn't mean to. But he was going to hit me.
WILLIAM: Go to prison. I killed him. I didn't mean to. But he was going to hit me.
ELLIOT: Yes, I know, I read your confession. Joe, if you really felt your life was in danger, we might be able to use self-defense as our argument. But before we get into that. Do you have any family, Joe? Any friends?
WILLIAM: I don't think so.
ELLIOT: Joe. do you know what a psychiatrist Have you ever seen a psychiatrist?
WILLIAM: Have you ever seen a psychiatrist?
ELLIOT: Have you ever seen a psychiatrist?
WILLIAM: .I'm not sure.
ELLIOT: Joe, you don't remember much about .but you remember the night you shot the man in the car.
WILLIAM: .but you remember the night you shot the man in the car.
ELLIOT: .but you remember the night you shot the man in the car.
WILLIAM: .because. I can. I'm sorry, I'm not much help.
ELLIOT: .because. I can. I'm sorry, I'm not much help.
WILLIAM: .because. I can. I'm sorry, I'm not much help.
HELEN: and when you approached the suspect in his apartment, did you identify yourself as a police officer?
DIVINCI: Did the suspect respond?
HELEN: Did the suspect respond?
DIVINCI: Yes, he did?
HELEN: In what way?
DIVINCI: He started shooting through the door.
HELEN: The Defendant fired six times, until his gun was empty. We would like to show you the weapon he used.
HELEN: And we would like to enter it into court records. It was the same Smith and Wesson revolver he used to viciously murder George and Carol
CLYDE: glances at "his" .44 as it passes into the BAILIFF'S HANDS. It's a .44 all right.
HELEN: The prosecution would like to call Mr. Steven J. Allen to the stand.
BAILIFF: Steven J. Allen.
HELEN: Mr. Allen, would tell the court what you do.
CLYDE: That ain't my gun.
JUDGE WEINBERG: I must remind the defendant that he is not to speak out when
CLYDE: That ain't my gun!
CLYDE: THAT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN!
CLYDE: YOU'RE TRYIN' TO FUCKIN' FRAME ME! IT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN!
CLYDE: IT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN!
RODRIGUEZ: We gotta put the right gun back.
DIVINCI: We can't put the right gun back! Without that gun, they won't convict Without that gun they won't convict I'm not worried about Clyde, I'm worried about us!
RODRIGUEZ: Without that gun they won't convict I'm not worried about Clyde, I'm worried about us!
DIVINCI: I'm not worried about Clyde, I'm worried about us!
RODRIGUEZ: Look, Joe's never goin' to trial, right. He signed a goddamn confession! Like you said, this one is open and shut. Clyde's the one we gotta worry about. We can't let him go back on the street! He's a fuckin' psychopath. He'll kill somebody again.
DIVINCI: Shit. How the hell did that piece of puke know it wasn't his fuckin' gun?! I don't think he knows his own fuckin' mother, but he knows his fuckin' I don't think that's important right
RODRIGUEZ: I don't think that's important right
DESK OFFICER: Sorry, Divinci, can't do it.
DIVINCI: What d'you mean you can't do it? I gotta check something.
DESK OFFICER: You gotta get written permission from the Chief.
RODRIGUEZ: Since when?!
DESK OFFICER: Since an hour ago when he came down here and chewed me a new asshole bigger than a three car garage.
DIVINCI: What's the problem?
DESK OFFICER: Something about missing evidence or who the hell knows. I just wanna transfer the hell outa here.
DIVINCI: What the hell're we supposed to do?!
DESK OFFICER: Ask the chief. Policy ain't my
ELLIOT: We would like to plead not guilty to the charge of murder at this time for reason of Insanity.
WILLIAM: But I did it.
ELLIOT: Yes, Joe. Let me handle this.
WILLIAM: But I signed the confession.
ELLIOT: Yes, Joe. Don't worry about it. I'm the attorney.
HELEN: Your honor, can we have a moment?
HELEN: Your honor, my colleague's client admits to the killing. I don't see any reason to go through a trial when it's obvious he would like to plead guilty.
ELLIOT: I don't agree.
HELEN: If he wants to plead guilty, you have to let him plead guilty.
ELLIOT: Not if he's not of sound mind.
HELEN: Come on, Elliot!
ELLIOT: I think he's crazy. I know you think he's just putting it on, that's D.A. standard procedure, but I don't think he is. So, your honor, I'm standing by the not guilty because I believe he's incapable of making that Have you had a psychiatrist look at Yes, your honor. I think you'll see that my diagnosis is not without warrant. I'll review the findings and make my decision tomorrow.
ELLIOT: Yes, your honor. I think you'll see that my diagnosis is not without warrant. I'll review the findings and make my decision tomorrow.
ELLIOT: Thank you, your honor. Besides, I hear there's a good chance of beating the charges for lack of
DIVINCI: Nobody can connect us to the evidence thing. we're clean there.
DIVINCI: The most important one is this DEA mess anyway. Once that's finished, we're completely in the clear.
RODRIGUEZ: You know we can't do it anymore.
DIVINCI: .yeah, I guess.
RODRIGUEZ: No, we're through. That's it.
DIVINCI: Good while it lasted though. A hundred grand apiece. Not bad for a few nights
RODRIGUEZ: I just wanna get through this.
DIVINCI: We're gonna get through it. No evidence problems on this one.
RODRIGUEZ: I hope not. I don't know, Frank, lately I been thinkin'. maybe what we did wasn't such a good idea.
DIVINCI: Hey, we took out a few scumbags, that's it. Nobody's ever gonna miss those shitheels. They were all pieces of garbage. Not one of 'em had a sheet less than a mile long. Drugs, extortion, assault. They were all fuckin' guilty as hell and still on the street, you know that.
RODRIGUEZ: Except the cop.
DIVINCI: Yeah, except the cop. That's part of the job. Could just as easily have happened to you or me.
RODRIGUEZ: But we're cops, you know? We fucked We fucked up once. Once outa ten. That's not bad. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, what can I say. I'm not goin' down for it.
DIVINCI: We fucked up once. Once outa ten. That's not bad. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time, what can I say. I'm not goin' down for it.
RODRIGUEZ: I know.
DIVINCI: Look, if we got paid a decent salary we wouldn't be tempted by this, right? And what happens when we retire? You think our pension's gonna take care of us? Shit no. We are on our own. I mean all I want in life is a goddamn fishing boat, a beach, a couple drinks and some Hawaiian fuckin' music. That ain't much for twenty years putting murdering assholes behind bars. I mean, the dealers, the pimps, the killers, they got no rules. We got all the fuckin' rules. It ain't fair. That's all I'm sayin', it ain't fair. For awhile, we made it fair.
DIVINCI: Quit thinkin' you're a bad guy. You're not a fuckin' bad guy. You made one mistake. Let it go.
RODRIGUEZ: Do you think we're corrupt?
DIVINCI: Hey, I never took a fuckin' bribe in my life.
RODRIGUEZ: Me either.
DIVINCI: Nobody ever bought me.
RODRIGUEZ: I know.
DIVINCI: No fuckin' way. Even the thought makes me sick. And what we did has nothing to do with being corrupt. It's two completely different things. Don't get 'em confused.
RODRIGUEZ: I guess you're right.
DIVINCI: I'm telling you. It's nothin' to do with corrupt.
RODRIGUEZ: I'm worried, that's all.
DIVINCI: Hey, you gotta worry a little. It's natural. Just don't lose your sense of humor.
RODRIGUEZ: My sense of humor, right.
DIVINCI: The problem with people is, nobody gives a shit about makin' the world a better place. You and me, I don't care what anybody says, we made the world a better place. No matter what happens. There are ten less drug dealin' assholes on the street today because of us. They're not plea bargainin' their way back onto the street, they're not clogging up the courts, and they're not costing the tax payers a fuckin' penny because they're not in prison. They were garbage. And there's nothin' wrong with takin' out the garbage.
RODRIGUEZ: So, you think you'll get back with Shit. Nothin' I ever do is good enough, you know?
DIVINCI: Shit. Nothin' I ever do is good enough, you know?
RODRIGUEZ: Never is, never was, never will be.
DIVINCI: Guess I gotta make the effort. It's gonna cost me if I don't.
RODRIGUEZ: Tell me about it. You know how much I got left.
DIVINCI: You're gonna think I'm an idiot, but. I like Cynthia. There's no bullshit with her. I just fuckin' like her.
RODRIGUEZ: I think you just like fuckin' her.
DIVINCI: Yeah, that, too.
CYNTHIA: What the hell, Joe, at least you won't get run over.
JUDGE WEINBERG: The defendant will stand and face the jury.
JUDGE: What is your verdict?
JURY FOREMAN: We find the defendant, Clyde David Dunner, not guilty.
CLYDE: Fuckin' A!
DIVINCI: when was the last time you saw him? Uh-huh And you haven't seen him since then?
RODRIGUEZ: We gotta talk.
DIVINCI: ( into phone ) Just a second. ( covers phone ) Calm down. I heard. Clyde walked.
RODRIGUEZ: ( leans in close ) They're takin' Joe to trial.
RODRIGUEZ: They found him mentally unable to plead so his attorney pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.
DIVINCI: You gotta be kiddin' me.
RODRIGUEZ: Yeah, that's me, I love to make people laugh. You hear the one about the two cops who popped the undercover
DEA?: CUT TO:
CYNTHIA: Who the hell're you and what the fuck are you doing in here?!
ASIAN MAN: You're Cynthia Webb.

CYNTHIA: Yeah, yeah, nice try, get out.
ASIAN MAN: I liked your show very much.
CYNTHIA: What the hell's this?!
CYNTHIA: A subpoena?! For what?! I didn't do Oh shit. oh shit. He served me! He fuckin' served me!
CYNTHIA: ( staring at paper ) Oh shit. oh shit. He served me! He fuckin' served me!
MAN'S VOICE: ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE
DIVINCI: ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE
SERGEANT GARDNER: Sorry to call so late, but I got a hysterical woman here says she needs to talk to you about a murder.
SERGEANT GARDNER: I told her I couldn't call you at home, but she said that it was very important. A matter of, you know, life and death.
DIVINCI: What's her name?
SERGEANT GARDNER: Divinci perks up at the name. And now we SEE Cynthia in the POLICE STATION trying not to look as freaked out as she feels. But she's not holding together well.
DIVINCI: Tell her to wait, I'll be right down.
WOMAN: What the hell're you doing?
DIVINCI: I gotta go down to the station.
WOMAN: Now? What time is it?
DIVINCI: Go back to sleep.
WOMAN: Frank, this is no way to repair our marriage, you know?
DIVINCI: Cynthia sees him and is immediately on her feet, moving to
CYNTHIA: Frank, I can't do this. He came to the club. You gotta
DIVINCI: Not here!
CYNTHIA: I thought you said all I had to do was pick him out?! That's what you said, that's all I had to do. I did what you said. But that was supposed to be all.
DIVINCI: SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!: He opens the driver's door, pushes her in. Gets in behind INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT Cynthia is a bundle of nerves. Divinci slams the door. Cynthia is startled by the suddenness of his anger.
DIVINCI: What're you talkin' about?
CYNTHIA: They want me in court.
CYNTHIA: You promised me I wasn't gonna have to do anything! What the hell is goin' on?!
CYNTHIA: I can't do this, Frank. I can't go into court. I'm gettin' outa here!
DIVINCI: You are not getting outa here!
CYNTHIA: Well I can't go to court! THAT'S NOT
DIVINCI: WELL THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN! NOW JUST FUCKIN' CALM DOWN FOR A SECOND AND LET ME THINK!
CYNTHIA: Fine. Think away. Look, you're a witness, that's all. You got nothin' to worry about. You saw something happen
DIVINCI: Look, you're a witness, that's all. You got nothin' to worry about. You saw something happen
CYNTHIA: What?! What did I see?!
DIVINCI: I will tell you everything you gotta know. You understand? Everything. You will know exactly what to say.
ELLIOT: Hi, Joe. You're looking much better.
WILLIAM: I guess jail's been good for me.
ELLIOT: Trial date's been set for Thursday.
WILLIAM: I've been thinking about what I did. and I don't think it's right that I try getting off.
ELLIOT: Excuse me?
WILLIAM: I want to plead guilty. I killed a man and I should be punished.
ELLIOT: .I'm a little surprised.
WILLIAM: Nobody ever wants to be punished for what they've done. It's just a new concept. But I still think our defense is reasonable. I don't believe, under the condition you were in, that you were responsible for your actions.
ELLIOT: Nobody ever wants to be punished for what they've done. It's just a new concept. But I still think our defense is reasonable. I don't believe, under the condition you were in, that you were responsible for your actions.
WILLIAM: But why was I carrying a gun? I had no right to carry a gun.
ELLIOT: If you hadn't been carrying the gun, you might be dead.
WILLIAM: And he might be alive.
ELLIOT: I understand. Can I think about No. I've made up my mind.
WILLIAM: No. I've made up my mind.
RODRIGUEZ: What if she takes off?
DIVINCI: Then we got no goddamn witness puts him at the scene.
RODRIGUEZ: And what happens if she testifies and nobody fuckin' believes her?
DIVINCI: Perjury, maybe. But that's a fifty fifty. They might believe her.
RODRIGUEZ: Shit, Frank, she's a goddamn stripper for Chrissake, who's gonna believe her. I don't believe her when she's telling the truth!
DIVINCI: Ahh, we got two bodies out here and three more in the house.
OFFICER: Ahh, we got two bodies out here and three more in the house.
DIVINCI: I was just wondering if you were gonna be the primary on this one, that's all.
OFFICER: I was just wondering if you were gonna be the primary on this one, that's all.
DIVINCI: Yeah, yeah, we're comin'. Just give us some room.
RODRIGUEZ: She could blow the whole thing. She could tie us in and that would be it. We'd be fuckin' fried.
DIVINCI: If it looks like she's gonna crumble we'll take steps.
RODRIGUEZ: What steps?
DIVINCI: One more chalk outline more or less in this city who's gonna know?
RODRIGUEZ: Oh shit, Frank.
DIVINCI: Hey, hey, you think I like this?!
RODRIGUEZ: We just can't go around killin' Just a second. Look around. Whatta we got here? Two stiffs on the street, shot to shit, three more inside. That's five chalk lines in one night in one deal in one neighborhood in one city. Let me fill you in on some statistics, we're not killin' Look, this is strictly last resort. Okay? But let's not kid ourselves. If push comes to shove, somebody has to go down. If you got another candidate, I'm willin' to listen.

WILLIAM: Is there something you want me to
WILLIAM: Oh my God.
DIVINCI: He moves into the bedroom. Sees clothes strewn around and a half empty closet.
DIVINCI: He heads back into the living room. Pulls open the door and almost runs into Richard Stein who was just about to knock.
DIVINCI: ( startled )
RICHARD STEIN: Divinci is caught off guard.
RICHARD STEIN: Richard Stein, D.A.'s office.
DIVINCI: Oh, yeah, sorry. I didn't expect what're you doing here?

DIVINCI: What d'you mean?
RICHARD STEIN: Well, I just mean, if she's not here. you were. Oh, yeah, the legal thing. Well, she's a witness in a murder case. And when they don't answer a knock and the door's open, it's my experience, you know. I like to make sure there's no dead bodies layin' Don't tell on me.

DIVINCI: Yeah. If she shows up, let me know. I'd like to talk to her, too.
RICHARD STEIN: Of course.
DIVINCI: See you in court.
RICHARD STEIN: Divinci heads down the walkway. Richard Stein watches him for a moment, then looks at the closed door, then at his INT. ELLIOT'S OFFICE - DAY Elliot's office is a cramped space in the PUBLIC DEFENDERS FLOOR of the CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING. A buzz of activity outside. The staff is overworked, underpaid and underappreciated. Elliot is reviewing legal documents. Knock on the door.
ELLIOT: The door opens and Arthur Baylor enters.
ARTHUR: Elliot Goff?
ELLIOT: Arthur Baylor?
ARTHUR: Elliot is stunned and flattered. He stands quickly.
ELLIOT: Arthur Baylor, oh my God. I ahh, would you ahh. are you here to see
ARTHUR: Arthur shuts the door.
ARTHUR: Joe stares at Arthur as if fighting a lost memory, then
WILLIAM: CUT TO:
HELEN: What are you telling me?!
HELEN: She missed the appointment? She forget you were coming? What?!
RICHARD STEIN: If you want my best guess, I'd say she split.
HELEN: She split, our witness split. Can't we keep our evidence and witnesses from disappearing around here? I mean what do I have to do, lock them in the trunk of my car? What the fuck is going on?! I want that bitch back here and on the stand or in
RICHARD STEIN: I'll get her.
MANNY: yeah, uh-huh. Why you think he'd go there?
DIVINCI: We need to talk.
MANNY: ( covers phone ) Just a second.
DIVINCI: Not just a second, now!

MANNY: Where've I seen her before?
DIVINCI: She dances.
MANNY: Yeah, right, okay. So what'd she take off for?
DIVINCI: I said
MANNY: I know what you fuckin' said, but you want me to find her I gotta know why the fuck she took off! So I know where not to look! Okay?!
DIVINCI: .she's supposed to testify. She got scared, thinks somebody might kill her, so she's hidin'. That's why I want you to find her.

RICHARD STEIN: What's he doing here?
HELEN: What the hell?
BAILIFF: Hear ye, hear ye. All rise, face our flag and recognize the principles for which it stands. The Criminal Court, Department G is now in session. The Honorable Harold W. Pine
BAILIFF: Please be seated and come to order.
BAILIFF: The People versus Joe Doe in case number 95-24705.
ARTHUR: Yes, your honor. I have joined the defense in the representation of Mr. William Dane McCall, otherwise known to this court as Joe Doe.
ARTHUR: I have represented the McCall family for several years before William McCall's disappearance seven years ago. It was assumed that he had died, but since he has reappeared under these tragic circumstances, I would ask this court for a continuance to allow the defense to prepare adequately in light of his real identity now being known.
ARTHUR: One week should be sufficient.
HELEN: I don't. believe so, your honor.
NEWSCASTER: when it was discovered that the man who has confessed to killing an undercover DEA agent, was actually himself thought dead for seven years. The man who signed the confession as Joe Doe is actually William Dane McCall, brother of Nathan McCall. Both are sons of the founder of McCall International, a corporation involved in telecommunications, computer design and development and other related industries. The net worth of both men is estimated at over a billion
RODRIGUEZ: but William McCall shunned the business world and turned his life to medicine, receiving his medical degree from Harvard in 1969. Once again he turned his back on the established norm and spent several years in Africa performing organ transplants for the poor.
RODRIGUEZ: Jesus Christ, this is who you picked? A goddamn surgeon who performs organ transplants on poor Africans?!
DIVINCI: He was living in the fuckin' street! How the hell was I supposed to know he was a goddamn doctor?!
RODRIGUEZ: He's not a goddamn doctor! You picked a fuckin' Saint to pin a fuckin' murder on!
RODRIGUEZ: When we pick 'em, we really fuckin' pick 'em. We shoulda just picked up the fuckin' Pope.
DIVINCI: ( reading ) he disappeared seven years ago on September 19 two weeks after the tragic death of his wife and two young children in a multiple vehicle accident. At the time it was assumed that he had returned to Africa, but that was never confirmed. What William McCall has been doing for seven years is now the mystery that the court will try to help unravel.
DIVINCI: Alright, alright, let's think here. What's the worse case scenario?
RODRIGUEZ: Are you asking me if I can think of something worse than what we've done that we can still do, or something worse that might happen to us if this all blows up and we are convicted and sent to jail and die in the electric chair and go to hell?
DIVINCI: Work with me here.
RODRIGUEZ: I'm sorry. I'm a little on edge. Would you repeat the question?
DIVINCI: Even if the doc walks, there's no evidence ties us to it. There's only one person who can connect us to Okay, fine, I don't wanna argue about it anymore. Let's just fuckin' kill
RODRIGUEZ: Okay, fine, I don't wanna argue about it anymore. Let's just fuckin' kill
DIVINCI'S VOICE: We need to talk.
MANNY: Are you fuckin' with me?
DIVINCI: No, I'm not fuckin' with you. Are you fuckin' with me?!
MANNY: You don't know?
DIVINCI: Know what?
MANNY: Well this is a good one. You're a cop and you don't know.
DIVINCI: Stop it.
MANNY: Cops got her. Ain't that a gas. Cops got her, you're a cop, and you gotta find out from me. It's a crazy world we live in, don't you think?
DIVINCI: Cops?! What fuckin' cops?!
MANNY: I don't know what fuckin' cops. All I know is, my people got to her sister's place and she was already gone. Her sister said some cops took her. I thought it was you!
SECRETARY: What an asshole.
MANNY: You're a good judge of character.
DIVINCI: look, she's our witness, if she's in custody, somebody better tell me!
DIVINCI: Nothin'. Nobody knows nothin'. The D.A. thinks she's gone. D.E.A. doesn't know shit.
RODRIGUEZ: Nothin'. Nobody knows nothin'. The D.A. thinks she's gone. D.E.A. doesn't know shit.
DIVINCI: If she was bein' held by police, we'd know.
RODRIGUEZ: Unless she said somethin'.
DIVINCI: If she said something we wouldn't be sittin' here. I think it's that lyin' piece of Don't ever lie to me again.
DIVINCI: Don't ever lie to me again.
DUNCAN: First trial, huh.
WILLIAM: I got one piece of advise. When you break for lunch, don't get the
DUNCAN: I got one piece of advise. When you break for lunch, don't get the
GUARD: Time to go.
BAILIFF'S VOICE: The Criminal Court, Department G is now in session. The Honorable Harold W. Pine presiding. Please be seated and come to order.
BAILIFF'S VOICE: The People versus William McCall in case number 95-24705.
HELEN: when he pulled this gun and fired at the driver of the car. Killing him instantly. Let the record show that this is the weapon used in the crime, a Smith and Wesson forty-four caliber handgun.
RICHARD STEIN: All these goddamn guns are startin' to look the same to me.
HELEN: And when you arrested the defendant, did he deny that he had killed Agent Can you describe the defendant's condition at the time of his arrest.
DIVINCI: Can you describe the defendant's condition at the time of his arrest.
HELEN: Can you describe the defendant's condition at the time of his arrest.
DIVINCI: He was drunk. We could smell the booze on him. But we drew blood. He didn't object.
HELEN: We have the blood test report that that he had four times the legal limit to drive. The people would like to enter this into evidence.
ELLIOT: and you arrested the defendant four days after the killing. What lead you to suspect Mr. McCall?
RODRIGUEZ: You ask questions. Work the neighborhood. Find out who was on the street that night.
ELLIOT: Yes, but specifically Mr. McCall? He had no previous criminal record.
RODRIGUEZ: We found someone who'd seen him in the area. So we picked him up for questioning. We didn't expect it to be him. But if someone saw him in the area that night we would want to talk to him. If he wasn't the killer, he might've seen the killer. Just routine really.
ELLIOT: Where did you find the defendant?
RODRIGUEZ: On the street. Corner of Third and What was he doing?
ELLIOT: What was he doing?
RODRIGUEZ: He was passed out.
ELLIOT: But you knew it was the man you were looking for.
RODRIGUEZ: Based on what?
ELLIOT: Based on what?
RODRIGUEZ: His description.
ELLIOT: Who provided you with the description?
RODRIGUEZ: ( hesitates a beat ) Cynthia something, I think.
ELLIOT: I believe her name is Cynthia Webb. According to the statement filed the night she picked him out of the line- up. The name familiar?
RODRIGUEZ: Yes. that's her.
ELLIOT: Where did you find Ms Webb?
RODRIGUEZ: On the street. Same area.
ELLIOT: And she agreed to pick the defendant out of a line up.
RODRIGUEZ: Where you aware that Ms Webb disappeared after she was served with a subpoena?
ELLIOT: Where you aware that Ms Webb disappeared after she was served with a subpoena?
RODRIGUEZ: Yes, my partner and I tried to contact her about the case and were Thank you, Detective, that's all the questions I have.
ELLIOT: Thank you, Detective, that's all the questions I have.
DIVINCI: To justice in all its forms.
RODRIGUEZ: We're not home free yet.
DIVINCI: Without Ms Webb, there's no place they can go. We still got the confession, the gun, the ballistics. And I don't give a shit about all this African doctor crap. the man is a drunk and he's been a drunk for seven goddamn years. So lets have a drink for drunks.
DIVINCI: That's the thing about life. You control it or it controls you. Most people don't understand that. They try'n blame their fuck-ups on something or somebody else. But it's not like that. I don't wanna hear why your life's a mess. It's a mess cause you're a mess. That simple. They're waitin' to live happily ever after. But after what? After all the shit happens? Well, I got a clue for everybody, the shit never stops happening. So you deal with it or you get buried in it. I'm not talkin' about you, you know what I'm sayin' Life don't work in mysterious ways. There ain't no mystery to it. You just work it. And you don't take it too serious. You can't take it too serious otherwise you get fragile. And you can't be fragile and have any fuckin' fun.
RODRIGUEZ: Life don't work in mysterious ways. There ain't no mystery to it. You just work it. And you don't take it too serious. You can't take it too serious otherwise you get fragile. And you can't be fragile and have any fuckin' fun.
DIVINCI: Life don't work in mysterious ways. There ain't no mystery to it. You just work it. And you don't take it too serious. You can't take it too serious otherwise you get fragile. And you can't be fragile and have any fuckin' fun.
RODRIGUEZ: You think I'm fragile?
DIVINCI: That's the first sign of trouble, when you start askin' other people.
RODRIGUEZ: .I just wish I knew where the hell she was.
RICHARD STEIN: ( referring to papers ) so I think we'll have to rely on the confession for his description of what happened. He'll never take the stand, even if
RICHARD STEIN: ( into phone ) D.A.'s office. What?. When?. Where will
RICHARD STEIN: They found Cynthia Webb.
HELEN: RICHARD STEIN
RICHARD STEIN: I don't know.
HELEN: RICHARD STEIN
RICHARD STEIN: I don't know.
HELEN: Well who the hell was that?
RICHARD STEIN: I don't know. They hung up.
HELEN: What the fuck is going on?!
HELEN: Your honor, the people call Ms. Cynthia Webb to the stand.
VARIOUS REACTIONS: Rodriguez and Divinci are stunned. Cynthia? Elliot is completely surprised. Cynthia? Arthur is never shaken by The courtroom doors open and Cynthia is lead down the aisle by a SHERIFF'S DEPUTY. She moves to the chair. But it's Joe's turn to double take. He remembers her. My God, he knows her. It's Cynthia the girl from the apartment building. He never saw who pointed him out, but he never expected it to be her.
BAILIFF: Raise your right hand. You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God.
BAILIFF: You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God.

CYNTHIA: No further questions.
HELEN: No further questions.
ARTHUR: Miss Webb. is it Miss?
CYNTHIA: Miss Webb, had you ever seen the defendant before that night, the night you described to us?
ARTHUR: Miss Webb, had you ever seen the defendant before that night, the night you described to us?
CYNTHIA: Do you know what perjury is?
ARTHUR: Do you know what perjury is?
CYNTHIA: When you lie.
ARTHUR: When you lie under oath in a court of law. Do you know what the penalty for that is?
CYNTHIA: You go to jail.
ARTHUR: Yes. Cynthia, have you ever seen the defendant before that night?
HELEN: Objection. The witness has already answered that question.
ARTHUR: I just want to give the witness the opportunity to remember if she could have seen Mr. McCall anyplace else before the night in question.
CYNTHIA: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
ARTHUR: What did you buy the night you went into the mini-mart?
CYNTHIA: What did I buy?
ARTHUR: You remembered seeing Mr. McCall that night and hearing the gunshot and a car crash. I just wondered if you remembered what you bought in the mini-mart.
CYNTHIA: .shampoo I think.
ARTHUR: That's all?
CYNTHIA: Where do you live?
ARTHUR: Where do you live?
CYNTHIA: 4356 17th Street. Number 37.
ARTHUR: Is that close to where this mini- mart is?
CYNTHIA: Close? Sort of.
ARTHUR: How far would you say?
CYNTHIA: I don't really know.
ARTHUR: Within walking distance?
CYNTHIA: No. I don't think so.
ARTHUR: Did you walk there that night or I ahh. drove.
CYNTHIA: I ahh. drove.
ARTHUR: You drove. But when you left the mini-mart you stated that you walked down the street.
CYNTHIA: How far?
ARTHUR: How far?
CYNTHIA: .to the corner.
HELEN: Objection. Your honor, I don't see a point to this line of questioning.
ARTHUR: Yes, your honor. Since this is the only witness, I'm trying to establish what the scene was like that night.
ARTHUR: ( to Cynthia ) And how far away from the corner was the Mini-mart? For example was it in the middle of the block, close to the corner, where?
CYNTHIA: In the middle I think.
ARTHUR: So you walked all the way to the corner. I assume then you were walking back to your car, yes?
CYNTHIA: Was there a reason you parked so far Um. there were lots of cars parked on the street.
ARTHUR: Was there a reason you parked so far Um. there were lots of cars parked on the street.
CYNTHIA: ( getting nervous ) Um. there were lots of cars parked on the street.
ARTHUR: Was there anyone else on the street besides you?
CYNTHIA: Lots of cars, but no people. Any I don't remember.
ARTHUR: Lots of cars, but no people. Any I don't remember.
CYNTHIA: I don't remember.
ARTHUR: So you were the only person to see Joe on the street that night?
CYNTHIA: I didn't see anybody else.
ARTHUR: So you heard a gunshot, a car crash and a man running with a gun in his What did you do then? Did you call the police, 911?
CYNTHIA: What did you do then? Did you call the police, 911?
ARTHUR: What did you do then? Did you call the police, 911?
CYNTHIA: I went home.
ARTHUR: You went home. Straight home?
CYNTHIA: And you're sure it was Joe you saw that night?
ARTHUR: And you're sure it was Joe you saw that night?
CYNTHIA: When you went home.
ARTHUR: When you went home.
CYNTHIA: Arthur pauses.
ARTHUR: When you went home you saw Joe?
CYNTHIA: Objection. Defense is trying to confuse the witness.
HELEN: Objection. Defense is trying to confuse the witness.
ARTHUR: I'm not trying to confuse the witness, it's the witness that's trying to confuse the court. I have witnesses who will refute her testimony. Witnesses who were on that corner the night of the shooting, who never saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the gunshot, who never saw Joe run past. Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment building that night because he lived in the alley next to it. Isn't that right, Ms Webb?
HELEN: Everyone's attention is on Cynthia.
ARTHUR: When I referred to him as Joe, you knew who I was talking about, didn't you. This case is the People versus Mr. William McCall. Not Joe. Joe has never been mentioned in this trial. How did you know who I was talking about, Ms. Webb?
ARTHUR: Ms. Webb, how did you know that Joe was the defendant?
CYNTHIA: He lived in the alley next to my apartment building.
HELEN: ( to herself ) Oh shit.
ARTHUR: Why did you lie to this court?
CYNTHIA: I don't know.
ARTHUR: Are you afraid of somebody?
CYNTHIA: I don't know.
ARTHUR: Are you protecting somebody?
CYNTHIA: I don't know.
CYNTHIA: having her mug shots taken. Holding a number. On the FLASH
RODRIGUEZ: She didn't talk.
DIVINCI: Don't hold your breath.
RODRIGUEZ: You think she'll talk.
DIVINCI: I know she'll talk.
RODRIGUEZ: We'll make it look gang related.
DIVINCI: Problem is we're gonna need another The problem?! Have you forgotten? She's in fucking jail. That's the goddamn problem.
RODRIGUEZ: The problem?! Have you forgotten? She's in fucking jail. That's the goddamn problem.
DIVINCI: Since when is being in jail a guaranty of a long life? You just get a fuckin'
MANNY: Oh shit. I didn't do anything!
DIVINCI: Everything's fine, Manny. I just came to apologize. We need some privacy.
DIVINCI: Just one more favor. I want you to bail somebody out of jail.
MANNY: You're kiddin'.
DIVINCI: Bail's twenty-five thousand.
DIVINCI: I want her out tonight. And don't tell her who. It's a surprise.
MANNY: And how'm I payin' for this? They don't take American Express.
DIVINCI: I know you know how to exchange that. It's worth a lot more than twenty- five grand. You can keep the change. I want her back in two hours. Or I'll nail you for possession.
MANNY: How'd you get to be such a prick?
DIVINCI: Divinci exits.
MANNY: What a piece of shit.
DUNCAN: You don't have to say nothin', but. you really a doctor?
WILLIAM: .I was. a surgeon.
DUNCAN: No shit, no shit, really. A surgeon. I know I'm nobody to judge, but you musta been a smart guy. What the hell's a smart guy like you doin' in
WILLIAM: .I had an affair with another woman. a nurse at the hospital I worked at. It was nothing. I can't even remember much about her. Except my wife found out. We had a fight. She left the house, took the kids. She was hysterical. I should've done something. gone after them, I don't know. they were killed in a car accident about a mile from the house. I've never told anybody that. about why she left.
DUNCAN: Hey, doc, you can trust me. It won't go no farther.
DIVINCI: You get the gun?
RODRIGUEZ: I got it.
DIVINCI: Everything okay?
RODRIGUEZ: Are you kidding? We're going to kill a goddamn witness who's in fucking jail because we killed an undercover DEA agent. I'm sorry, but this kinda shit troubles me a little.
DIVINCI: Take off the dress and get back in the game. We gotta do what we gotta Yeah. I know. Let's just get it over
RODRIGUEZ: Yeah. I know. Let's just get it over
CYNTHIA: I don't understand. Why can't you tell me who put up the bond?
MANNY: Look, a guy comes in, says bail her out, gives me the money, I do it. That's how I make my living, I bail fuckin' people outa jail. You wait with me.
CYNTHIA: Was it a cop?
MANNY: Yeah, right. Cops bail people outa jail all the time. Doesn't there seem to be a dichotomy there for I don't like this.
CYNTHIA: I don't like this.
MANNY: You wanna stay in jail, that's up to you. Or you come with me.
CYNTHIA: What'd he look like?
MANNY: You're a stripper right? Lotta guys fall in love with your type. But they don't know how to get close, know what I mean? Somebody wants you to owe them something. Take it or leave it.
RODRIGUEZ: This is the last time, Frank. The last time we kill somebody.
DIVINCI: Yeah, it's the last time.
RODRIGUEZ: This'll be eleven, Frank. Eleven is I get the picture.
DIVINCI: I get the picture.
RODRIGUEZ: It was all okay until you shot Hudd.
DIVINCI: What's goin' on here? You mad at me or something?
RODRIGUEZ: It wasn't my idea to start killing people, Frank. That's all I'm sayin'. We're in this goddamn mess because you started killing people.
DIVINCI: Drug dealers don't qualify as people. Never did, never will. So what the hell's wrong with you tonight? You suddenly worried about where all the money went?
RODRIGUEZ: I'm just sick of it, that's all.
RODRIGUEZ: What're you doin'?
DIVINCI: I need some fresh air.
RODRIGUEZ: Talk to me, okay? Just fuckin' talk to me.
DIVINCI: Talk to me, okay? Just fuckin' talk to me.
RODRIGUEZ: I don't know. I owe some money. I don't know how I'm gonna pay it.
DIVINCI: You gambling again?
RODRIGUEZ: Yeah, yeah. I just couldn't. Frank. let's forget about this. Let's just get the fuck outa here. We got enough money, let's go. We'll get outa the country or something.
RODRIGUEZ: What the hell're you doin'?!
DIVINCI: Take off your shirt.
RODRIGUEZ: What're you talkin' about?
DIVINCI: Just take off your shirt. If there's nothin' to worry about, then I'll apologize. But I'm not gonna argue. Take off your fuckin' shirt now.
RODRIGUEZ: What is this, you piece of shit?! You don't trust me?! Is that it?!

DIVINCI: I'll just feel a whole lot better when she's dead. Then we're off the
RODRIGUEZ: Divinci starts to shift gears, but suddenly throws his elbow into Rodriguez' face. And Divinci is all over him like a tornado. Slamming a fist into his face repeatedly. He grabs his shirt and rips it open REVEALING the TAPE RECORDER strapped to his body, recording their every word.
DIVINCI: YOU FUCKIN' RAT!
RODRIGUEZ: Yeah. yeah. I am, I'm a fuckin' rat. I traded you, Frank, I fuckin' traded you. Simms knows everything. Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I

VIC: Oh shit. You shot him, you fuckin' shot him! Divinci musta figured it. I didn't think he'd kill his own partner He's an animal.
AGENT SARKASIAN: Divinci musta figured it. I didn't think he'd kill his own partner He's an animal.
SIMMS: He's an animal.
AGENT HOOPER: Recorders busted up. But we might be able to salvage some of the tape.
SIMMS: I want him. You understand me, I don't care what it takes. I want that sonuvabitch!
MANNY: Shit! Who the fuck're you?!
AGENT SARKASIAN: Ms. Webb. We'd like you to come with
CYNTHIA: This was the big secret? Shit. You're an asshole.
SIMMS: Who set it up?
CYNTHIA: I don't know.
AGENT HOOPER: It was Divinci wasn't it?
CYNTHIA: I don't know.
SIMMS: Which one pulled the trigger? Divinci or Rodriguez?
CYNTHIA: I don't know.
SIMMS: Detective Rodriguez is dead. He was shot in the head last night.
SIMMS: Rodriguez was wearing a recorder. Divinci found it. You can do addition, can't you.
CYNTHIA: You're full of shit.
AGENT SARKASIAN: Just tell us what you know.

ARTHUR: I think you know my client is innocent. That's all I care about, my client. But I understand why you're scared. You're already facing perjury charges. My guess is, your involvement is deeper than that. But I don't really care, I'm not after you. I get nothing if you go to jail. But I think if I help you, I can help my William Joe didn't do it, did
CYNTHIA: William Joe didn't do it, did
ARTHUR: William Joe didn't do it, did
ARTHUR: Why don't you sit down.
SIMMS: No goddamn way! I'm not going to grant that whore immunity. She lied on the stand, she's protecting somebody. And she's involved. I want them all.
ARTHUR: Before I leave, let me remind you that you have shit for a case. If you really care about seeing justice for your dead agent, don't blow this deal. Immunity for her testimony is a small price for a bad cop. It's the only way she's going to talk.
ARTHUR: And William McCall walks, right now, all charges dropped.
SIMMS: If what she says is any good, I'll deal. If it isn't, then nobody goes
REPORTERS: How does it feel to be a free man
REPORTERS: Do you remember everything that happened to you? What are your plans?

NATHAN: Good to have you back, Will.
WILLIAM: .I'd like to make one stop.
NATHAN: I know.
ELLIOT: you know, it just didn't make sense, a man wanting to be punished for a crime? How many times does that happen? Once in a lifetime, I can tell you.
ARTHUR: to tell the truth, I had no other witnesses to refute her testimony. But she didn't know that. All we knew was that she was reluctant to testify. You look for signs.
A MAN: My God, we thought you were dead, you know. It's just incredible that you're here.
A WOMAN: Life moves in such strange ways. Oh, I just think what might've happened to you had you not been arrested for killing that poor policeman. You still might be on the street.
ANOTHER WOMAN: Joe, you look wonderful. After what you've been through. I just can't When you're ready to come back to work, let me know. I've already spoken to the board, they're ready to re- certify you anytime. I can put you in the emergency sector until you get warmed up. We all want you back. We can't afford to waste someone of your talent.
WILLIAM: .I'm ready.
DIVINCI: You had to do the right thing.
CYNTHIA: What d'you want?
DIVINCI: What do I want?
DIVINCI: Why're you asking me that? You gonna grant me three wishes? I don't know where to start. Let's see. money would be nice. love would be better. but a little loyalty. you can never get enough of that. .But we'll start with. money.
CYNTHIA: This is all I've got.
CYNTHIA: They'll catch you.
DIVINCI: I don't think so.
CYNTHIA: You wanna bet?
DIVINCI: They don't have a clue, baby. And you wanna know why? Because I am following my heart.
DIVINCI: And they don't know where that is.
CYNTHIA: So tell me about your plans. I think I'd like to hear 'em now.
DIVINCI: Loyalty is what it all comes down to. Nothing holds together when it's gone. And once it's gone, you don't ever get it back. You shouldn't've told 'em.
CYNTHIA: I shouldn't've done a lotta things in my life. But that's not one of Let me tell you something. the only difference between a liar and a witness is that just one of 'em knows what he's doing.
DIVINCI: Let me tell you something. the only difference between a liar and a witness is that just one of 'em knows what he's doing.
DIVINCI'S VOICE: Shut the door and lock it.
MANNY: Jesus Christ!
MANNY: You scared the shit outa me.
DIVINCI: Lock the door.
DIVINCI: One more favor, Manny.
MANNY: Since when did I become such a good I'm takin' some time off. I want a car, here tonight, and a driver. You can do that for your old friend, Yeah, I can do that. But you are a hot fuckin' potato. And drivers that don't talk, don't come cheap.

OTHER SURGEON: Just like riding a bike.
