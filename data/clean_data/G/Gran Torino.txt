GRAN TORINO: Written by Nick Schenk
OLDER MAN: I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt. She was a real peach.
WALT: Thanks for coming, Al. Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953. Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge. Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.
WALT: Jesus Christ. Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from across the pews.
MITCH: Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley. He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral?
STEVE: What do you expect? Dad's still living in the 50s. He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.
MITCH: Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad appreciates that.
STEVE: My point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man.
PAGE 3: It's inevitable. That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings; the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath, it's always What are we going to do with him? Don't you think he'll get in trouble by himself over in the old Why don't you have him move in with you?
MITCH: What are we going to do with him? Don't you think he'll get in trouble by himself over in the old Why don't you have him move in with you?
STEVE: Why don't you have him move in with you?
MITCH: Ha ha.
FATHER JANOVICH: Death. is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics. Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased . and their families. Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits them. And some may ask, what is death. Is it the end? Or is it the beginning? And what is life? What is this thing we call Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips. He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME The house is crammed with people following the service. Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to keep busy. Steve steps over to his father.
WALT: Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips. He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME The house is crammed with people following the service. Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to keep busy. Steve steps over to his father.
STEVE: A lot of people showed up after the service.
WALT: Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew there'd be plenty of ham. I think I'll go downstairs and get some more chairs.
STEVE: I'll do it, Dad.
WALT: Naw, we need them now, not next INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME Grandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in the cellar. A box of old Korea War photos are pawed Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO a young WALT looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are sprawled dead on the ground.
DAVID: Is that Dad?
DANIEL: No, it's Grandpa Walt. Josh turns the photo over and reads it.
JOSH: Third Platoon, E company, March second, 1952, Korea.'
DANIEL: Where's Korea?
JOSH: Hell if I know? David holds up a MEDAL.
PAGE 5: Cool, I found a medal. They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch, pretending to be doing nothing. Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.
DAVID: Cool, I found a medal. They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch, pretending to be doing nothing. Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.
UPSTAIRS: People eat and chat. Ashley marches over to her parents, KAREN and Mitch.
MITCH: Ashley, honey. Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?
ASHLEY: Yes you.
KAREN: Yes you.
ASHLEY: Grandpa Walt, can I help you with the chairs.
WALT: I'll take care of it, you just painted your nails. Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window. It's snowing. Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks relieved to get out of the house.
WALT: I'd better salt the sidewalk before someone falls and breaks a Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his very, very, very old DOG follows him outside.
PAGE 6: EXT. WALT'S HOUSE - EVENING Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk. He deliberately stops at the boundary of his property. The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged to Polish families. Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on. Walt can see through the window that the living room is jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong. And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full- blown, unrepentant racist. Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.
WALT: Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can they cram into a living room? Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.
ASHLEY: Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car? Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still burning cigarette before answering.
WALT: I never knew you had a cool old It's only been in here since before you were born.
ASHLEY: I never knew you had a cool old It's only been in here since before you were born.
WALT: It's only been in here since before you were born.
PAGE 7: So, what are you like going to do with it like, when. you die? Walt lights up a smoke
ASHLEY: So, what are you like going to do with it like, when. you die? Walt lights up a smoke
WALT: Jesus, Joseph and Mary. Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino.
ASHLEY: Then what about that super cool retro couch in the den, I'm going to State next year and I don't have, like, any furniture? Walt walks out without commenting.
WALT: Who the hell are you?
TAO: ( very quietly ) I'm Tao, I live next door.
WALT: What?! Speak up, boy, get the shit out of your mouth. What do you want?
TAO: Do you have jumper cables? My uncle's car is old and.
WALT: No. And have some goddamned respect, zipper head, we're mourning over here. Walt slams the door in Tao's face. Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich. Walt hates situations like this.
PAGE 8: FATHER JANOVICH How you holding up, Walt?
FATHER JANOVICH: How you holding up, Walt?
WALT: Mr. Kowalski.
FATHER JANOVICH: It's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.
WALT: It's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH: Right, Mr. Kowalski. Your wife and I became quite close these last few months. She asked that I watch over you when she passed on. I told her I watch out for my entire flock, but she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.
WALT: I appreciate your kindness to my wife and now that you've spoken your piece, why don't you move on to the next sheep? Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.
FATHER JANOVICH: Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her wish for you to go to confession. She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.
WALT: Is that so?
FATHER JANOVICH: It is. Walt drains his lowball glass.
WALT: Well, I confess I never much liked church and only went because of the wife. And I confess I have no desire to confess to a boy who is fresh out of the seminary.
PAGE 9: EXT. WALT'S HOUSE - LATER People are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling, stiff-jointed old Pollacks. Right next door walking the opposite direction are more Hmong going up the sidewalk. They laugh and chatter and carry big dishes of food and fruit. They are a happy bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home. The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony. A three-day-old baby is named and three souls are located for the CUT TO: ANOTHER ANGLE Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables to their dead battery. Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables to their dead battery. Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window.
MITCH: I'd really like to help, Dad, but we have to get the kids home, they're getting restless. Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance.
WALT: Fine. Go.
MITCH: I'll call in a few, see how you're Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off.
WALT: Kill you to buy American.
MITCH: Did you see him look at the truck? It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Buggy that. Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.
PAGE 10: At least he didn't say anything this time.
KAREN: At least he didn't say anything this time.
MITCH: He didn't have to.
KAREN: Well, what do you expect? The man worked at a Ford plant for twenty- eight years.
MITCH: And I suppose that's my goddamned BACK ON WALT Walt gets his guests' engine running. As they drive off, Walt hears faint SINGING. Walt looks into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes. The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their heads sliced off, right there in the yard. The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder. It's a sacrifice. Walt spits in the snow and says to Barbarians. Goddamned barbarians.
WALT: Barbarians. Goddamned barbarians.
PHONG: ( SUBTITLED ) There's no man in this house, that's why my daughter should remarry. Being a second wife is better than having a woman be the head of the household. It's not our way.
PAGE 11: ( SUBTITLED ) What about Tao?
MAN: ( SUBTITLED ) What about Tao?
PHONG: ( SUBTITLED ) What about him?
MAN: ( SUBTITLED ) He's the man in the house.
PHONG: ( SUBTITLED ) Tao's not a man.
WALT: I thought these zips were supposed to be such hard workers. Christ, I had my own car when I was his EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT Tao exits the store, gets on his bike and rides off.
PAGE 12: A few blocks away, Tao rides past a snowbank when WHAM! A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his front wheel. Tao flies over the handlebars into the A chorus of laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand around the stunned, prone Tao.
HEAD LATINO: Whatta you gonna do, gook? You gonna Kung Fu' us? Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike.
LATINO #2: Surprised it ain't a girl's bike. The Latinos laugh. Tao remains on the ground.
HEAD LATINO: You gonna get up or what? Tao doesn't move.
HEAD LATINO: Tell you what, I'll let you take the first swing. You drop me and you can have your bike back. Tao smiles, he can't help it.
HEAD LATINO: What the fuck you smiling at, gook? Something funny? He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet.
HEAD LATINO: You better get the fuck outta here, bitch. He pushes Tao backwards. Tao falls back into the snow. This time Tao crab-walks back away from the Latinos. The Latinos stroll away with Tao's bike.
PAGE 13: Walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors' houses. Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors' houses are rundown. Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has installed a chicken coop. Walt looks down at Daisy
WALT: Damn chinks let their yards go to hell. Polarski would turn over in his grave if he could see what they did to his lawn. Tao walks past. Walt watches him pass.
WALT: I don't know why these goddamned slopes had to move to my block. This used to be a nice EXT. TAO'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Tao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking chair. PHONG nods back to Tao, then turns her evil eye back on Walt, whom she's been seething at all morning.
PHONG: ( SUBTITLED ) Why doesn't that stupid, hairy white man move? He must be too dumb to realize he's not welcome here. All the Mee-Khah left in the neighborhood should just move away. Look at him strut like a She sees Walt glance at her and spit. Phong glares back and spits beetle juice, which has turned her teeth black.

WALT: Jesus Christ, dog, have you gone totally deaf? Walt opens the door. Standing on his front step is Father Janovich.
FATHER JANOVICH: Hi there, Walt.
WALT: Listen, son, you're not my barber, you're not a friend, so why in the hell do you think you can call me FATHER JANOVICH Sorry. Mr. Kowalski.
FATHER JANOVICH: Sorry. Mr. Kowalski.
WALT: So, what are you peddling now?
FATHER JANOVICH: Oh, nothing. Thought I'd drop by and see how you were doing. Haven't seen you in church in Okay. You've done your good deed, now why don't you run along.
WALT: Okay. You've done your good deed, now why don't you run along.
FATHER JANOVICH: I'd really like to talk, Mr. I don't think so, kid. Sorry.
WALT: I don't think so, kid. Sorry.
FATHER JANOVICH: Why? Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
WALT: You don't want to know.
FATHER JANOVICH: No, I do.
WALT: The problem is I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old women and promises them eternity.
PAGE 15: Walt shuts the front door in Father Janovich's face.
LATINO DRIVER: Is you a boy or a girl, I can't LATINO #2 What you reading, gook, Jackass And The Rice Stalk? Tao laughs, but keeps walking.
LATINO #2: What you reading, gook, Jackass And The Rice Stalk? Tao laughs, but keeps walking.
LATINO DRIVER: That's right, you keep walking. Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man. Why gooks come up in here and fuck up our neighborhood? Down the street is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC with a big SPOILER on the back. Inside are five Hmong gangbangers. The Hmong gangbangers notice Tao being followed by the Latinos. SPIDER, the driver, squints and then points at Dude, that's my little cousin, You sure about that, Spider?
SPIDER: Dude, that's my little cousin, You sure about that, Spider?
SMOKIE: You sure about that, Spider?
SPIDER: I'm sure. Do we do something. or what? Smokie is the gang leader. He looks at Tao for a second.
SMOKIE: Your cousin tight with anyone?
PAGE 16: No, he flies solo, Smokie.
SPIDER: No, he flies solo, Smokie.
SMOKIE: Okay. Let's go help out our little cousin. Smokie nods to Spider, they roar up and stop right across from Tao and the Latinos' car.
SMOKIE: You better not be giving my bro here a hard time or you're gonna wish you never been born.
LATINO DRIVER: Oh goody, more Rice Niggers. The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL. A Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays a sub-machine gun. The Latinos are way out-gunned.
LATINO #2: Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats. Go back to your fucking rice paddy. The Latinos screech their tires and are gone. The Hmongs in the car smile and congratulate themselves. Tao simply keeps walking down the street!
SMOKIE: Where the fuck does he think he's going? Turn us around and go after that cousin of yours. They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with him as he walks.
SPIDER: Hey, cuz, slow down, where you going? You should really think about hanging with us, man. If we all stick together, shit like that won't happen, with those Spicks. Tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer.
SPIDER: You can't be such a little girl. You join up with us, we'll keep you out of trouble, cuz.
PAGE 17: Tao looks at the sub-machine gun cradled by the Hmong gangbanger in the back seat. Smokie takes this all in. He looks down the street and sees that in a half block, Tao will have to pass a group of Latino gangbanger types.
SMOKIE: You think about it and we'll see you tomorrow.
SPIDER: Hey, cuz. Hey, Sue.
SUE: What do you want?
SPIDER: Came to talk to my cousin Tao. Smokie looks over to Sue.
SMOKIE: Spider, who's the other cousin? SUE laughs at the name Spider. Sue is seventeen, has long straight hair with red highlights.
SUE: Spider'? Is that what he just called you, Fong?
SPIDER: This is my little cousin, Sue. Smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue.
SMOKIE: Hey, Sue. how old are you, girl?
SUE: Mentally, I'm way too old for you. I'm going inside.
PAGE 18: That's right, go inside while the men talk.
SPIDER: That's right, go inside while the men talk.
SUE: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing, Fong. Sue rolls her eyes and goes inside. Smokie stares at You think about what we talked A PAUSE. Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a cigarette. Tao shakes his head no and looks at the That's exactly the point, Tao. Spider told me how everyone thinks you're a pushover, how everybody walks all over you and shit.

SMOKIE: It's true, man. Shit, I used to be kind of a quiet little punk like you, everybody fucking with me. But finally I said no more.' You, you're lucky, Tao, we got your back. Me? I didn't have nobody. Had to mold my own tribe.

WALT: I got one. A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy walk into a bar, the bartender looks up at them and says get the fuck out.' The gang laughs, until they see Father Janovich step up to the bar. He smiles as he recognizes several faces.

DARREL: Hello, Father.
FATHER JANOVICH: Hi, Walt. Walt says nothing. He just sips his beer.
DARREL: What brings you in here, Father? The meat raffle?
FATHER JANOVICH: No. I came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay. Mel and Darrel look at Walt. It puts him on the spot.
WALT: I have to hand it to you, Padre. You are persistent.
FATHER JANOVICH: I promised your wife. Walt looks over at Mel and Darrel and then back at Father Oh Jesus Christ, let's grab a INT. VFW BOOTH - SAME TIME The waitress comes over.
WALT: Oh Jesus Christ, let's grab a INT. VFW BOOTH - SAME TIME The waitress comes over.
WALT: I'll have a Pabst and a shot. What are you having, Father?
FATHER JANOVICH: I'll have a Diet Coke.
WALT: Bullshit, this is a bar, what do you want to drink?

FATHER JANOVICH: Ummmm. I'll have a gin and The waitress leaves.
WALT: The waitress leaves.
WALT: So, what do you want?
FATHER JANOVICH: I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.
WALT: Jesus Christ, why'd you do that?
FATHER JANOVICH: She was very insistent. She made You sure are fond of promising people stuff you can't deliver on.
WALT: You sure are fond of promising people stuff you can't deliver on.
FATHER JANOVICH: Let's talk about something else.
WALT: Like what?
FATHER JANOVICH: Life and death.
WALT: What would you know about it?
FATHER JANOVICH: I'd like to think I know a lot. I'm a priest.
WALT: You stand at the altar and preach on and on about life and death without knowing anything other than what you learned in priest school. Everything you say sounds like it's out of the Rookie Preachers Handbook.
FATHER JANOVICH: I don't know about that.
PAGE 22: Walt waves his hand and cuts him off.
WALT: Death is bittersweet? Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.' That's what you know of life and death? Good God, it's pathetic.
FATHER JANOVICH: What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?
WALT: Plenty. I lived with death for three years in Korea. We shot people, we stabbed them with bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year- old kids to death with shovels, for Christ's sake. I did things that won't leave me till the day I die, horrible things, things I have to live with.
FATHER JANOVICH: And what about life? Walt has to think for a second. He struggles with his Well. I survived the war. got married. and raised a family.
WALT: Well. I survived the war. got married. and raised a family.
FATHER JANOVICH: Sounds like you know more about death than you do living. Walt downs a shot.
WALT: Maybe so.
WALT: The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at the clock; it's 3:48 am. Walt looks out his bedroom window. He sees the faint beam of a flashlight in his garage.
PAGE 23: Son of a bitch. Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea. Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and chambers a round with a loud SNAP.

SPIDER: Get in, get in! Tao runs right past him. Spider guns the motor and pulls in front of Tao. Smokie, Spider and another gangbanger get out.
PAGE 24: Get in, Tao.
SMOKIE: Get in, Tao.
TAO: No way. No fucking way. Leave me Smokie, Spider and the other gangbanger grab Tao.
SPIDER: I vouched for you, Tao, because you're family and you're with us Tao struggles.
TAO: He shot at me! I'm out! I'm Tao squirms out of Smokie's grasp. Smokie yells at Tao as he runs away.
SMOKIE: Don't fool yourself, Tao. You don't join us and bail. Dumb Should we go after him?
SPIDER: Should we go after him?
SMOKIE: Naw, he's got nowhere to go. Let's get out of here.
WALT: MITCH ( V.O. ) Morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.
WALT: It's one in the afternoon. The CAMERA now INTERCUTS BETWEEN Walt and Mitch in the kitchen of his huge, modern suburban house.
PAGE 25: Right, good afternoon, then.
MITCH: Right, good afternoon, then.
WALT: So, what do you want?
MITCH: Me? Nothing. What would I want?
WALT: I don't know. Your wife already went through all of your mother's No. I was just wondering how you are, what's going on, anything new in the old neighborhood? Walt looks at the bullet hole in his Hamm's Beer sign.
MITCH: No. I was just wondering how you are, what's going on, anything new in the old neighborhood? Walt looks at the bullet hole in his Hamm's Beer sign.
WALT: Great. Smooth sailing then?
MITCH: Great. Smooth sailing then?
WALT: There's a very painful pause in the conversation.
MITCH: Well good. Say, Dad?
WALT: Do you still know that guy from the plant who has Viking season EXT. WALT'S DRIVEWAY - DAY Walt has parked the Gran Torino at an angle across his driveway. Walt mutters as he rubs Turtle Wax on his car.

SUE: Oh really? What's that?
SMOKIE: We're giving you another shot.
TAO: I don't think so.
SMOKIE: You blew it the first time. We've got another little inauguration planned for you. This time there'll be no mistakes.

SMOKIE: That old woman's got bigger balls than you. You always let little girls and old ladies fight for Tao tries to squirm away. Smokie grabs him by the hair and opens his coat to reveal the PISTOL in his belt.
SMOKIE: I'm not gonna say it again. Let's go. Now. Tao is shoved towards the car. Suddenly Sue jumps on the back of one of the gangbangers and knocks him to the ground. Tao breaks Run, Tao, run! Sue is slapped to the ground.
SUE: Run, Tao, run! Sue is slapped to the ground.
SUE: Tao is tackled by Smokie and punched in the face. Tao's mother comes out the front door. Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay. A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into the yard. All the gangbangers overreact and pull their pistols. The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel. Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie. It becomes a pushing, rolling, surging melee. This mess boils over and spills into Walt's front yard.

WALT: Get off my lawn.
SMOKIE: Listen, old man, you don't want.
WALT: I said get off my lawn. Now. Walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers. The guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big military rifle Walt holds.
SMOKIE: Are you fucking crazy? Go back in your house, old man.
WALT: Get off my lawn.
SMOKIE: I'm not fucking around, Gramps. Walt spits out the side of his mouth. He grins.
WALT: Don't think for a second I won't blow a big hole in your face and it won't bother me a bit, not any more than if I shot a deer. Now get off my goddamned lawn. Two of the Hmong gangbangers take a step back. Walt senses their fear. Only Smokie holds his ground.
WALT: Believe me, kid, I'll blow your damn head off, go back to bed and sleep like a baby. I couldn't care less.
SMOKIE: I'm not gonna warn you again! Walt laughs.

SUE: We brought you some shallots to plant in your garden.
WALT: I don't want them.
SUE: They're perennials, they come back every year.
WALT: No. You keep them. Why do you people keep giving me all this Sue is a little taken aback.

FATHER JANOVICH: Good afternoon, Walt. Walt's eyes narrow.
FATHER JANOVICH: I mean, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT: I already told you I'm not going to confession.
FATHER JANOVICH: Why didn't you just call the FATHER JANOVICH I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood. Why didn't you call the police?

FATHER JANOVICH: I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood. Why didn't you call the police?
WALT: Oh, I prayed for them to show up, but guess what? No answer.
FATHER JANOVICH: What were you thinking? Someone could have been killed. We're talking life and death here.

FATHER JANOVICH: We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski. Walt says nothing.
FATHER JANOVICH: I've been thinking about our discussion on life and death. About what you said. About how you carry around the horrible things you were forced to do. Horrible things that won't leave you. It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden. Things done during war are terrible, being ordered to kill, killing to save others, killing to save yourself. You're right, those are things I don't know anything about. But I do know about forgiveness. And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them. Stronger men than you. Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace. Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost.
WALT: I'm impressed. You came with your guns loaded, for once.
FATHER JANOVICH: Thank you.
WALT: You have balls, Father. And what you said, you're right. I'm sure stronger men than me have found their salvation. Hallelujah. But there's one thing you're way wrong ( CONTINUED ) PAGE 35 FATHER JANOVICH What's that, Mr. Kowalski?

BARBER: There, you look like a human being again. You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap I'm just amazed that you're still alive. I keep hoping you'll die and they'll get someone good in here, but you just hang in there, you dumb, Italian-Wop-Dago, you.

TAO: She was standing over there, orange dress, twisting her hair and smiling at you.
WALT: She was standing over there, orange dress, twisting her hair and smiling at you.
TAO: You mean Wa Xam? Walt takes a long swig off his drink and nods.
WALT: Yeah, yeah. Anyways, she likes you, I know, I talked to her. Great girl, charming girl. Love her. I love Yum Yum. But you? You just watch her walk out the door with the Three Stooges. Why? Because you're a big fat pussy! Walt drains his drink.

WALT: Is that the chicken dumpling thing you brought the other day?
WALT: What now? What? Vu rambles on in Hmong. Walt looks at his watch. He looks at Sue for the translation.
SUE: Tao is here to make amends, he's here to work for you.
WALT: No he's not.
SUE: Mother says that Tao dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt. He'll start tomorrow morning.
WALT: No. The kid is useless, I don't even want him on my property. I thought we already went over that.
SUE: It's very important to my mother that you accept. It'd be an insult to refuse.
WALT: How is this all of a sudden turned around on me? The goddamned kid tries to steal my car and somehow I'm the bad guy if I don't accept?

SUE: My family is very traditional and it will very much upset them if you don't let Tao repay. Tao interrupts from the sidewalk.
TAO: Come on, Sue. If he doesn't want to, let's just go. Sue and Vu yell at Tao to shut up at the same time; Sue in English, Vu in Hmong.
WALT: Fine. Great. Tomorrow. Walt walks past them and into his house.
WALT: Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These Hmong broads are like badgers.
WALT: Son of a bitch, I didn't think he'd show. Walt waves Tao over. Tao barely looks at Walt.
WALT: Okay. What are you good at?
TAO: Like what?
WALT: That's what I'm asking. What are you good at?
PAGE 60: If you're gonna work for me, I have to know what you can do.
TAO: I don't know.
WALT: That's about what I expected. Okay, why don't you go over by the spruce tree and count how many birds feed at the bird feeder.
TAO: Count the birds?
WALT: Yeah, you can count? You slopes are supposed to be good at math, Yes, I can count.
TAO: Yes, I can count.
TAO: You want me to do that?
WALT: Why not?
TAO: Why not?
WALT: I want it done right, that's why.
TAO: But you've got me just standing here. What am I supposed to be doing, anyway?

WALT: You said it, brother.
PAGE 63: A very old Hmong man and his very young GRANDSON walk up Walt's driveway. The Grandson translates for grandpa.
GRANDSON: Grandpa says he want to know if you can have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch? Walt reaches in his pocket and studies a small note pad.

MITCH: I'm fine, fine.
WALT: Fine. That's fine. How about the kids and Karen?
PAGE 66: Everyone is fine.
MITCH: Everyone is fine.
WALT: There is a long, uncomfortable pause. Walt looks at some Xeroxed medical pamphlets scattered on his bed.

MITCH: Right. I s'pose.
WALT: Right. I s'pose.
MITCH: Speaking of busy, I have a lot on my plate right now, unless there's something pressing. Walt looks at a pale, blue pamphlet. Mitch looks at his housekeeping bill.
WALT: No. Nope. Another pause.
WALT: Okay then.
MITCH: Okay. Yeah, so it's not a good time right now. Why don't you call me over the weekend.

PAGE 67: EXT. WALT'S FRONT YARD - DAY While Walt fills a bird feeder, he notices Tao next door. Tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder, trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw. Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao.
WALT: Hey, moron. Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.
TAO: I appreciate you're doing something on your own, but you're the only person I know dumb enough to get himself killed trimming tree branches.
WALT: I appreciate you're doing something on your own, but you're the only person I know dumb enough to get himself killed trimming tree branches.
TAO: What now?
WALT: You don't stand on the top step of a ladder and if you cut through that branch you're hacking away at, you'll end up kaput. Tao looks and sure enough a thick, black POWER LINE is five feet below the branch he's almost severed.
WALT: Go grab the extension ladder from my garage and I'll show you how to do it right, zipper head.
WALT: Looks good. Good job. Tao nods.
PAGE 68: Make sure you put the ladder back when you're done raking up the I know. I will. Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the cooler and watches Tao rake. A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass.

WALT: This kid doesn't have a chance. The Honda now slowly passes Walt's house. Walt just stands there, sipping his beer. The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens. Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN. He closes one eye to better aim his imaginary gun and moves his thumb several times as if firing. Bang bang bang. The Honda takes off. Walt watches it drive off and lights another cigarette. Walt doesn't notice, but Tao witnessed this whole interaction from his yard.
TAO: What do you know about faucets? Walt stares at him for a second and then laughs.
PAGE 69: INT. TAO'S KITCHEN - A MINUTE LATER Tao looks on as Walt turns the faucet on and off, it drips water at its base. Walt looks under the sink.
WALT: For the love of Pete.
TAO: It must be a hundred degrees in here, turn on the fan. Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off. Walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head.

WALT: What are you talking about?
TAO: All the tools and stuff.
WALT: Where the hell do you think I got them, Toad? This may come as a shock to a thief, but I actually bought the things I have with money I earned.
TAO: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what I meant. There's just so much shit packed in here.
WALT: You need the right tool for the right job. Every single thing here has a purpose.
PAGE 70: Okay, what's this? Tao points to a tool.
TAO: Okay, what's this? Tao points to a tool.
WALT: Post hole digger. Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick succession, questioning Walt with his expression.
WALT: Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife. Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but he's too uncomfortable to speak up
WALT: I can't afford to buy all this I didn't buy all this stuff at once, blockhead. I've lived here for fifty years. A man stays in one place long enough he tends to attract a decent set of tools.

TAO: Yeah, but.
WALT: Look, kid, I think I know where you're going with this. You don't need everything to maintain a house. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE items in quick succession.
WALT: This is for you. Roll of duct tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of vise-grips. Any man who's worth a shit can do half his household jobs with these three things. In the odd chance that doesn't work out, you can borrow something.

TAO: You listen, old man. You came and got me because you needed help, so let me help you. Either it's top or I'm out of here. Walt studies Tao for a second. Tao doesn't blink, he holds his ground. Walt nods, trying not to grin.

SUE: Kind of ironic, huh?
WALT: What the hell do you think I'm referring to? Toad washing the car he tried to steal from you.
SUE: What the hell do you think I'm referring to? Toad washing the car he tried to steal from you.
WALT: It seems like justice to me. And if he misses a spot, he's doing it all over.

TAO: What are we doing?
WALT: What are you gonna put all your tools in, an empty rice bag?
WALT: You'll need this. Walt then tosses Tao a utility knife holder.
WALT: And you'll need that. Now where the hell do they hide the hardware I can't afford any of this.
TAO: I can't afford any of this.

TAO: I appreciate all this.
WALT: Aw, forget it.
TAO: No, I really do. Thank you. Walt sticks out his jaw and looks Tao straight in the eye. Tao doesn't know what to expect. A PAUSE. Walt puts out his HAND to Tao. Tao extends his and they SHAKE HANDS. It's really quite a moment for both of them.
TAO: What now?

TAO: Come on, what do you guys want with me?
SMOKIE: Jesus Christ, Tao. What do you think? I've been sooooo easy on you, but I can't just go on like nothing happened.
TAO: You can't just leave me alone?
SMOKIE: Afraid not. The gangbangers grab Tao. Tao kicks and struggles as they yank away his tool belt.
TAO: Keep your hands off my stuff.
SMOKIE: Your stuff? You and everything you have is mine. I own you. Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it against the pavement. Whatever tools Smokie can't destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building.
SMOKIE: You can't just walk away from us, Tao. It looks bad. It makes me look bad. Smokie lights a CIGARETTE and exhales.
SMOKIE: What's the phrase I'm looking for? Oh yeah, I need to save face.' Smokie grabs Tao by the neck and presses the lit CIGARETTE into Tao's cheek. Tao screams as his flesh burns.
PAGE 92: EXT. WALT'S ALLEY - MORNING Walt spots Tao as he takes out the trash.
WALT: Hey there. Tao looks to the ground and heads in the other direction.
TAO: Hey, I gotta run.
WALT: Wait a minute. Where have you been, I haven't seen you in days?
TAO: Walt squints at Tao. He steps closer. Tao looks away. Walt tilts Tao's head up, he sees the burn.
WALT: What in the hell happened to you?
TAO: Don't worry about it.
WALT: Don't worry about it? Look at your goddamned face!

WALT: Forget the tools. Where does your cousin live?
TAO: No, Walt, I can manage. I don't want you doing anything. Walt is angry, but eventually nods at Tao.
WALT: Alright. You need any other tools for work?
TAO: I could use a roofing hammer.
WALT: Go in the garage and get whatever you need.
WALT: That's the last of them. Walt pulls out his Colt .45 automatic and chambers a EXT. DUPLEX - SAME TIME Walt pounds loudly on the door. A moment later the door starts to swing open and a voice is heard.

WALT: It's just you and me. Nobody knows or has to know I was here. You lay off Tao. Tell your guys he ain't worth it or whatever the hell you want. You don't talk to him, you don't go near him. This is your one chance. You lay off and no one will ever be the wiser. Smokie says nothing.
WALT: I'll take that as a yes. I don't want to come back here. But if I do, believe me, it'll be goddamned Walt kicks Smokie again and stalks off into the dark.
PAGE 95: EXT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME EVENING Walt pulls up his driveway and parks. Daisy jumps out and Walt carries his rifle into the house. Walt walks Walt gets to the door and drops his keys.

SUE: No, admit it. You are. You're feeling pretty good, aren't you?
WALT: Well, who wouldn't? I'm surrounded by beautiful women, it's a beautiful day. Great food, good friends. Hell, even Toad isn't driving me nuts for once.
TAO: It never ends.
WALT: I'm just kidding. Let me tell you something, Yum-Yum. If Tao doesn't ask you out soon, I will.
SUE: Don't listen to him, Wa Xam. He's a white devil.
WA XAM: ( LAUGHS ) I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.
WALT: I'll be damned. Movie? Dinner? Wa Xam and Tao nod. They're a bit embarrassed.
SUE: Yeah, they're taking the bus.
WALT: The bus?! That's no good. A charming young lady like this deserves to go in style.
PAGE 97: Like what? Take a limo? Walt nods towards the GRAN TORINO.
TAO: Like what? Take a limo? Walt nods towards the GRAN TORINO.
TAO: The Gran Torino? You'd let me drive it?
WALT: Sure. Why not.
TAO: Walt smiles.
WALT: They shake hands.
WALT: Is everyone okay? Is anyone hit? Sue? Vu? Tao, where's Tao? Tao sits up from behind the couch. Blood pours down his neck. He's stunned.

TAO: What. what is it?
WALT: Hang on. you're just cut, is Is everybody else okay?
TAO: Is everybody else okay?
WALT: Walt looks around at the BULLET HOLES in the walls. Tao follows his gaze.
TAO: It's a miracle no one was killed.
WALT: They aimed high. Sure enough most of the bullet holes are above head level on the walls.
WALT: Where's Sue?
TAO: She went to our aunt's.
WALT: Call her.
TAO: I said call her. Get the goddamned phone and call and see if she's there. Tao scrambles for the phone and dials. Tao speaks Hmong to whomever answered. Tao starts to speak faster. He looks at Walt and shakes his head no. For once Vu and Phong understand what Walt was talking about. There is anguish on every face in the room.

WALT: This is exactly what I didn't want. Damn gooks. Why the hell am I even here?
TAO: Maybe one of her friends called and she just changed plans. Walt sips the rice liquor. Walt now speaks quietly to In Korea I learned not to care. The best friends of my life are still missing somewhere in Korea. You harden yourself. Don't let anything get to you. Phong looks out the window and screams. She runs over and swings open the door. Everyone expects the worst. And it comes like a cold wind SUE WALKS IN LIKE A ZOMBIE. She has been brutally beaten. Her clothes are dirty and torn. BLOOD runs down SUE'S legs from under her shirt. Walt looks at her and the glass falls from his hand. Sue staggers into Vu's arms. Vu weeps. Sue hugs her mother and sobs. Tao reaches to hug his sister, but Phong screeches at him, pointing at Walt and back to Tao. Walt is destroyed. He steps outside into the dark.

PAGE 100: Walt bursts in the door, throws himself in an easy chair and CRIES. He tries to stop and cries harder. It's the first time Walt has cried in fifty years. He wails, crying for Tao, Sue, his wife, kids and himself. He lets it all out. Daisy jumps in his lap and he hugs his old dog as he bawls.
FATHER JANOVICH: Mr. Kowalski, are you in here?
WALT: Come on in. Father Janovich comes in and sits down across from Walt.
FATHER JANOVICH: Are you okay? Walt nods.
FATHER JANOVICH: The police finally left. No one is talking. One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths I've noticed that. Father Janovich picks up a photo album and flips through it. Pictures of Mitch and Steve as babies.
WALT: I've noticed that. Father Janovich picks up a photo album and flips through it. Pictures of Mitch and Steve as babies.

WALT: I'm not.
FATHER JANOVICH: I know that. Believe me, they all know that. Tao especially. He's sitting out there staring at your front door. You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.
WALT: Yeah, well what would you do if you were me? If you were Tao? What would you do? Father Janovich shakes his head.
FATHER JANOVICH: I know what I'd do if I was you, or at least what you think you should do. If I was Tao I guess I'd want vengeance. I'd want to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.
WALT: And you?
FATHER JANOVICH: What would I do? I'd come over here and talk to you I guess. I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski. Walt nods.

TAO: No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not you. This is going to end, today. Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit in.
WALT: Sit down.
TAO: I don't want to sit.
WALT: I SAID SIT DOWN! Just listen up for a second and don't say Tao sits down. Walt rubs his hands together.

FATHER JANOVICH: Yes. Go on.
WALT: I made nine hundred dollars profit selling a boat and motor and never reported the taxes which is the same as stealing.
FATHER JANOVICH: Yes. Fine.
WALT: And lastly, I was never close to my two sons. I don't know them. I didn't know how.

FATHER JANOVICH: I'm begging you to stay.
OFFICER: I just got word from my Sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
FATHER JANOVICH: I'm staying.
OFFICER: No you aren't. My orders are specific. You came with us, you're leaving with us. Father Janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting into the SQUAD CAR. The SQUAD CAR drives off. Walt pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams the door. He looks at the duplex. It's a total eyesore.
WALT: ( MUTTERS ) What a goddamned mess. You slopes should be ashamed of yourselves.
PAGE 114: Walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the Six very scared, very jittery Hmong gangbangers look out at Walt from various doorways and windows.
WALT: Is that all you swamp rats or is there more vermin scurrying in the Smokie and Spider step out and stand on the porch. Smokie smiles at Walt. Walt spits on the ground.
SMOKIE: I wasn't sure that you'd.
WALT: Shut up, gook. I'm not here to listen to one goddamned syllable of what a shrimp-dicked little baby midget like you has to say. Spider pulls his PISTOL.
WALT: That's right, boy. Defend your boyfriend after he or you or whoever rapes a member of your family. Your own blood, for Christ's sake. Go ahead, pull your pistols, just like a bunch of ridiculous miniature toy cowboys. Smokie and several other Hmong gangbangers pull their You have no honor. You're the scum of the earth and when you're gone, do you think anyone will care? No one will mourn. You won't be missed. All the Hmong are spooked at Walt's absolute lack of Where's Tao, old man? He too scared to come and stick up for ( CONTINUED ) PAGE 115 No. Tao is too good for this. You pukes aren't worth one second of his time. Walt slowly puts a CIGARETTE in his mouth. Even this slight movement has the gangbangers waving their PISTOLS Walt laughs.

WALT: You boys are a little bit jumpy.
SPIDER: You watch it, old man.
WALT: No, I think you'd better watch it. Walt looks around. Other than the gangbangers, a small group of people have gathered to watch this showdown.
SUE: Tao? Tao, are you alright?
TAO: Goddamn it!
SUE: What's going on?
TAO: He left without me!
SUE: Where? Where'd he go?!
TAO: He went to Smokie's without me. Tao takes the stairs two steps at a time.
PAGE 116: No! No, Tao! Sue grabs Tao's legs and hangs on.
SUE: No! No, Tao! Sue grabs Tao's legs and hangs on.
SUE: No! Don't you dare! Stay away from them, Tao! I don't want anyone else getting hurt.
TAO: Leave me alone.
SUE: NO, TAO. NO! They struggle at the top of the stairs and spill into the kitchen floor. Tao runs for the door when something catches his eye. The kitchen table. The RIFLE and PISTOL are still there. Walt purposely left the guns at home.
TAO: Oh God! NO!!
WALT: Anybody got a light? No? I got Walt's slight grin fades. He mutters to himself.
WALT: Hail Mary, full of grace. Walt reaches into his coat pocket. Six Hmong gangbangers simultaneously level their PISTOLS and FIRE. BULLETS FLY. Walt is struck down. People scream. Walt falls dead. A ZIPPO lighter clutched in his hand. Walt never intended to kill anyone. Self-sacrifice.
PAGE 117: EXT. SMOKIE'S DUPLEX - LATER Tao and Sue arrive just as Smokie, Spider and company are being driven away in Police cars. Tao looks at Smokie in the squad car. Smokie no longer looks tough or hard, he just looks scared. On the street, Walt is being bagged by the ambulance crew. Father Janovich prays over him. Tao steps up to a POLICE OFFICER.
TAO: What happened?
POLICE OFFICER: You have to step back.
TAO: He was a friend of mine.
POLICE OFFICER: I said step back. Tao turns to the HMONG POLICE OFFICER.
TAO: What happened, man? The Hmong Police Officer looks at the WHITE POLICE OFFICER and then to Tao.
TAO: ( SUBTITLED ) Please, man, it's important. He's my friend. Tell me what happened?
TAO: ( SUBTITLED ) What's going to happen?
PAGE 118: HMONG POLICE OFFICER ( SUBTITLED ) We actually have witnesses for once. These guys are going away big time. The WHITE OFFICER yells at the HMONG OFFICER.
POLICE OFFICER: Officer Chang, get those people HMONG POLICE OFFICER Yes, sir. You have to step back Tao hugs his sister. Sue openly weeps. Tao holds it in. He looks at his friend Walt as the bag is zipped over EXT. TAO'S HOUSE - DAY Tao and Sue wait in front. Tao wears a suit, Sue is in a traditional Hmong dress. A TAXI pulls up and they get Sitting on the porch is Phong who rocks back and forth in her rocking chair. Phong holds Daisy in her arms, gently petting the old dog.
PAGE 119: FATHER JANOVICH Walt Kowalski once said to me I didn't know anything about life or death because I was an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and promised them eternity.' Walt definitely had no problem calling it like he saw it.' But Walt was right. I knew really nothing about life or death until I got to know Walt. And boy, did I learn.

LAWYER: Which brings us to our last item. And again, please forgive the language used in Mr. Kowalski's will. I'm simply reading it as it was written. The LAWYER takes a sip of water before reading.
LAWYER: And to my friend, Tao Vang Lor, I leave my 1972 Gran Torino on the condition that you don't choptop the roof like a damned spick, don't paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash hillbilly and don't put a big gay spoiler on the rear-end like you see on all the other zipper heads' cars. It just looks like hell. If you can refrain from doing any of that, it's yours.
