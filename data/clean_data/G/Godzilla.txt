A TARP: is ripped away, revealing a life boat. Two more life boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately tries to hoist them up and over the side.
THE CREW: Are thrown backwards. The lifeboats swing WILDLY, several of them SMASHING INTO BITS as they slam against the ship.
THE CLAW: Or whatever it is, RIPS INTO THE SIDE AGAIN. This time the entire ship begins to FLIP OVER.
A LIFEBOAT: Bounces off the deck and slides off the side. Following it is the Cook. Desperately, the Cook grabs onto the ship's side railing to keep from falling off. He looks back and SEES something so horrible that he SCREAMS IN TERROR and lets go of the railing. The old Cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker
WINDSHIELD WIPERS: Clearing at their highest speed, we see through the rain doused windshield, DR. NIKO "NICK" TATOPOULOS. Music blares from the tiny headphones of his Walkman.

NICK: ."The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love."
NICK: ."Let the cloudy skies chase."
NICK: ."I'm singin' in the mud, just scooping up my worms."
NICK: ( broken Russian ) Good day. I am here with permission.I have a, a. ( in English ) Permit. How do you say permit?

BRIEFING OFFICER: Nothing yet.
RAYMOND: Are there any other survivors?
BRIEFING OFFICER: Only one, Sir. He was very lucky.
RAYMOND: Get them out of there.
RAYMOND: ( in French ) Ask him what happened.
BRIEFING OFFICER: ( in English ) It's no use. He's been like this since we fished him out of the ocean. Whatever happened to that tanker put him in a complete state of shock.

NICK: You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
MAJOR HICKS: We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.

MAJOR HICKS: We know. Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl Yeah, you're the worm guy.
NICK: Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl Yeah, you're the worm guy.
MAJOR HICKS: Yeah, you're the worm guy.
NICK: The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
MAJOR HICKS: No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
NICK: It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen
MAJOR HICKS: ( bemused ) Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
NICK: They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
MAJOR HICKS: Then you're perfect. Here's your radioactive sample. Study
NICK: What sample?
MAJOR HICKS: You're standing on it.

AUDREY: ( nervous ) Think I should ask him? I'm going to ask him. You think I should? I will.
LUCY: Oh girl.
AUDREY: Did you talk with Humphries?
CAIMAN: This is not the place.
AUDREY: Just tell me, did you talk with him?
CAIMAN: He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
AUDREY: Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
CAIMAN: Why don't I tell you over dinner tonight? Your place.
AUDREY: Mr. Caiman, you're married.
CAIMAN: And you're beautiful.
AUDREY: Mr. Caiman.
CAIMAN: Call me Charlie.
AUDREY: ( stubbornly ) Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
CAIMAN: So have dinner with me tonight.
AUDREY: I can't.
CAIMAN: It's your choice.
ELSIE: Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?

MILITARY JEEPS: Nick hops out and joins Major Hicks et al as they push past the gathered crowd of onlookers. The group gives a collective gasp as they see the ship for the first Three men ( who we'll recognize from the Tahiti hospital ) take measurements of the holes in the ship.
MAJOR HICKS: Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.

LEONARD: She's going sternway!
FIRST MATE: What the hell did we catch?
JULES: Cut us free! Cut the nets!
ARTHUR: ( screaming at his men ) Cut the damned cables!
THE HARPO: Is not so fortunate. The lone boat dragged backwards, faster now without the weight of the other boats. Then suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get PULLED DOWN, dipping into the water. With an unstoppable force the Harpo gets PULLED UNDER WATER. Deck hands LEAP off the boat as the top cabin is CRUSHED as the entire ship slowly DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE For a moment all is quiet. No one can believe what just happened. Hearts pounding, catching their breath. Then with a WHOOSH of air pressure, the Harpo BURSTS out of the water. With a gigantic SPLASH, the boat FLOPS on its side and capsizes. The waters calm, but the nerves of Jules and Leonard don't.
PETRI DISH: A small piece of Nick's SAMPLE is cut away and placed on a glass microscope slide.
SOLDIER: Major, we just got a report of a fishing trawler going down. Exact position, forty seven degrees latitude, 67 longitude.

SOLDIER: The trawler was pulled under.
MAJOR HICKS: Jesus Christ! It's only two hundred miles off the American Eastern seaboard and we don't even know what it is.
ELSIE: enormous reptile the likes of which we haven't seen since the age of prehistoric dinosaurs.
CLIVE: ( sarcastic ) So where's been hiding the last sixty million years?
ELSIE: The depth and breath of the ocean floor has barely been explored. His kind could have survived there completely undetected.
NICK: The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
MAJOR HICKS: Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
NICK: What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty Hence the radiation.
ELSIE: Hence the radiation.
NICK: More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
CLIVE: ( sarcastic ) Like your earthworms?
NICK: Yes! We're looking at a completely incipient creature. The dawn of a new species. The first of its kind.

AUDREY: I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change. I never lost my idealism.
NICK: When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change. I never lost my idealism.
AUDREY: And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
NICK: I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to And you think this creature is one of Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
AUDREY: And you think this creature is one of Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
NICK: Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
AUDREY: Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
NICK: I got pretty close.
AUDREY: What else do you know about it?
NICK: Well, we know he eats fish, he's of reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's amphibious and.
NICK: Are you sure?
AUDREY: Are you sure?
NICK: ( thrilled ) Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
AUDREY: I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
NICK: The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
AUDREY: Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
NICK: Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
NICK: Forgive me but I've got to get this into the lab, to confirm all this. I'll be right back.

AUDREY: ( filtered ) .which is why in this case "all the kings horses and all the kings men" may not be able to put the big apple together again. Audrey Timmons, WNEW.
ED: That's it. You owe me a breakfast.
AUDREY: ( turning to Animal ) So, what do you think?
ANIMAL: It's good. It's a real good piece. But how'd you get a hold of this
AUDREY: Like you said, "Good guys finish
AUDREY: Murray, I need you to look at this Not now, Audrey, we've about to go live with the morning report.
MURRAY: Not now, Audrey, we've about to go live with the morning report.
AUDREY: You're going to want to include this. I've got exclusive footage of other places this thing has attacked.
MURRAY: ( suddenly interested ) You do? Who's story is this?
AUDREY: ANGLE - CAIMAN About to go on, Caiman waves off his make up artist as he watches Audrey hand Murray the tape. His field producer counts down to going live.
MALE VOICE: ( filtered ) .Major Hicks, what makes you believe another attempt to gun that creature down will work?
MAJOR HICKS: General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park. We should be able to take him down.
MAYOR: Last time you didn't even scratch it!
MAJOR HICKS: That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
NICK: Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
MAJOR HICKS: You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking.
NICK: Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
GOVERNOR: Are you trying to tell us there's another one of those things out I don't believe so.
NICK: I don't believe so.
MAYOR: Then how can it be pregnant? What is this, the "virgin lizard?"
NICK: No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
MAJOR HICKS: So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
NICK: It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
CLIVE: How could you possible know that?
NICK: The fish. The fish we found down in the subway. He's not gathering all that food for himself. He's preparing to feed his young.
ANIMAL: They just promo-ed your spot. It's coming on right after this.
MAJOR HICKS: If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we must act quickly before this problem You want to divide our efforts based solely on a wild theory?
GENERAL ANDERSON: You want to divide our efforts based solely on a wild theory?
MAJOR HICKS: He's come through for us before and if he feels strongly.
GENERAL ANDERSON: Come through for you!? Major, your campaign's a disaster. You weren't even able to to prevent this thing from coming to Manhattan.
GOVERNOR: Excuse me Gentlemen, but I think we should see this. How the hell did this get out?
GENERAL ANDERSON: How the hell did this get out?

CABBY: Where to?
NICK: Newark airport.
AUDREY: You're leaving? Why?
AUDREY: Is this cause of me? Because of the Well what the hell did you going to happen?

NICK: I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted I didn't mean for it to turn out like Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.

NICK: So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
RAYMOND: I am not permitted to speak of such
NICK: You said you wanted my trust, then I need yours.
RAYMOND: I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?

AUDREY: It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.

GODZILLA: opens his mighty jaw about to CLAMP DOWN on them. The missiles CONNECT, SLAMMING INTO HIS CHEST, EXPLODING. His torso, rips apart. He SCREAMS OUT. His WAIL a painful death cry. His foot STOMPS DOWN as he tries to retain balance. The impact of the stomp acts like a shockwave that KNOCKS the Cab into a SPIN. SLAMMING into the guard rail, the cab bounces back into the road and keeps going. The injured Godzilla bites the bullet and continues pursuing, his gait slowing. The cab is able to make some ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON Again they FIRE. A group of missiles darting out.
GODZILLA: The missiles HIT, ripping into him. Again GODZILLA SCREAMS out, his forward motion stopped.
GODZILLA: His last breath escaping. Defeated and weary, his eyes blink slowly as we watch his life slip away.
