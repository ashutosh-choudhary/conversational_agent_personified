NICKY: I talked to her two days ago.
JOANNA: Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
NICKY: Our Peter?
JOANNA: Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
NICKY: Can he get through it?
JOANNA: They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
NICKY: I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.

JOANNA: The Red Sox
NICKY: The Red Sox
JOANNA: You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
NICKY: Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
JOANNA: It can't be all that personal.
NICKY: If you have a team you've followed all your life, and they raise your hopes and crush them, and lift them and crush them, do you want me to tell you what it's like? It's like feeling your childhood die over and over. J
JOANNA: I mean Nicky, really, no.

JOANNA: Because we're completely We don't even like each other, do I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
NICKY: We don't even like each other, do I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
JOANNA: I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
NICKY: The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
JOANNA: It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
NICKY: It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning
JOANNA: It's your best play, Nicky.
NICKY: They'll lose because they're my He will absolutely hate it.

NICKY: I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
LAUREL: I go to college. I thought you Do you want to get some coffee?
NICKY: Do you want to get some coffee?
LAUREL: I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
NICKY: What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's
LAUREL: I'm seeing your play tonight, Why do you need a radio?
NICKY: Why do you need a radio?
LAUREL: So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
NICKY: That's completely crazy.
LAUREL: Is it?
NICKY: Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
LAUREL: She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
NICKY: ( indicating driver ) And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family
TABATTABI: Mother is totally, you know, upset.
ABULHASSAN: Mother is totally, you know, upset.
LAUREL: Mother is totally, you know, upset.
NICKY: Abulhassas, we'll be getting out Nicky pays the driver.
GEORGE: Nicky, you don't come in for a while. Everything's okay?
NICKY: Hello George. You're so healthy and thick-bodied I want to punch you in the chest. This is my daughter Laurel. Just to hear the sound it I saw your picture in the paper. Two papers.
GEORGE: I saw your picture in the paper. Two papers.
NICKY: That means they're getting ready to kill me.
GEORGE: That's not what I hear. I have four, five actors working here. `His best play since "Yessiree Bob" I'm telling you, they say it.
LAUREL: He doesn't want to hear it.
NICKY: If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
LAUREL: Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
NICKY: I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
LAUREL: Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
NICKY: Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in Oh please. Not now. She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
LAUREL: Oh please. Not now. She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
NICKY: You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you She is kicking you out.
LAUREL: She is kicking you out.
NICKY: Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
LAUREL: Bullshit, Daddy.
LAUREL: Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
NICKY: Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
LAUREL: I didn't turn her into Mother. You This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
NICKY: This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
LAUREL: Know what Mother said to me? Daddy's demons are so intense he doesn't even know he's lying.
NICKY: It's life, it's taxis. People trying to make contacts, make deals, meet their lovers. Taxis are sexy. You can't have Manhattan without taxis. I was proud of my taxi. I kept my taxi clean.
ELLIOT: Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
NICKY: I don't want to hear about it.
ELLIOT: ( whispering ) A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
NICKY: Shut up, Elliot.
ELLIOT: Quietly effective.
NICKY: You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
ELLIOT: Press a button and they give us Ride with me. We need a haircut.
NICKY: Ride with me. We need a haircut.
ELLIOT: ( whispering ) How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
NICKY: She wants a divorce.
ELLIOT: Don't talk like that.
NICKY: It's over, finished and done with.
ELLIOT: That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
NICKY: I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
ELLIOT: But didn't we know it would happen?
NICKY: Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
ELLIOT: ( whispering ) Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal

NICKY: What do you mean, we must abandon?

BODENHEIM: Nicky pays him.
YEHOSHAFAT: Nicky pays him.
NICKY: I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
ELLIOT: I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
NICKY: You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
ELLIOT: What do I exude?
NICKY: Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
ELLIOT: Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
NICKY: Tonight. What's tonight?
ELLIOT: Shit. They don't have any carrot You mean because What's-His-Name.
NICKY: You mean because What's-His-Name.
ELLIOT: You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review It's just a review.
NICKY: It's just a review.
ELLIOT: It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
NICKY: What's the fuss? I don't get it.
ELLIOT: That's what I said eighteen months What happened eighteen months ago?
NICKY: What happened eighteen months ago?
ELLIOT: Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish And he was there?
NICKY: And he was there?
ELLIOT: Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
NICKY: That's awful.
ELLIOT: I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
NICKY: A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
MAN: Yessirree Bob! Yessisree Bob!
ELLIOT: You don't know about obscure writers, Nicky. How we have our anger to nurture and love. Our murderous fantasies for any amount of fame, money , power and sex.
PAISLEY: Guys ready to order?
ELLIOT: Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
PAISLEY: ( to Nicky ) This is a great young out-of-work Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
ELLIOT: ( to Nicky ) This is a great young out-of-work Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
AISLEY: Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
NICKY: What's good?
PAISLEY: We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
ELLIOT: Say it again.
PAISLEY: Alla puttanesca.
ELLIOT: ( to Nicky ) Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
S: teven is sitting on a mat in the tub, arms in the air and folded so that his fists are close to his ears. He is in lotus position, breathing in serious meditation a deep intake of breath followed by a softer expulsion, matching the beat of the dripping faucet.
FIRST MAN: I got a good feeling about tonight
SECOND MAN: We got Ojeda going. He pitched beautiful last time out.
FIRST MAN: Plus Darryl's due for a big game.
NICKY: I hate the Mets.
SECOND MAN: How come?
NICKY: When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
NICKY: You can analyze a Red Sox defeat day and night for a month and still uncover layers of complex feelings - - feelings you didn't know you were capable of. The pain has a memory all of it's own.
ELLIOT: ( quoting Steven Schwimmer ) `One thing saves Elliot Litvak's work from complete mediocrity, and this is his lack of ambition.'
WAITER: It gets funnier.
ELLIOT: ( zipping up ) It gets funnier. See, Nicky? They chart the laughs. This from a critic who lives like a fallen monk. Whose address is a carefully guarded secret.
WAITER: A critic who has to disguise What do you mean?
NICKY: What do you mean?
WAITER: To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
NICKY: Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
WAITER: Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
ELLIOT: He has to disguise himself, Nicky.
WAITER: For his own safety and peace of
ELLIOT: Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing What was it like?
NICKY: What was it like?
ELLIOT: I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
P: aisley eating lunch at the end of the long table, looking up to see Nicky approach with liqueur and a glass on wine. He sits opposite her, placing the wineglass in front of her.
NICKY: You've worked with Elliot?
PAISLEY: I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
NICKY: There was a review.
PAISLEY: I think I remember.
NICKY: So does Elliot.
PAISLEY: Not one of Steven's finer moments.
NICKY: Oh. You know him.
PAISLEY: A little.
NICKY: And he has finer moments now and He has something. A funny little quality I find
PAISLEY: He has something. A funny little quality I find
NICKY: Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
PAISLEY: Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
NICKY: Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
PAISLEY: A little drastic maybe?
NICKY: Say it again.
PAISLEY: You know what.
NICKY: You know what.
PAISLEY: Alla puttanesca.
NICKY: One more time.
ELLIOT: Is it safe?
NICKY: Do we care?
ELLIOT: I think we Nought to wait.
NICKY: I say we go.
ELLIOT: You say we go?
NICKY: Do not inhale.
ELLIOT: I'm not ready.
NICKY: Here we go.
ELLIOT: The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
NICKY: I don't have the problems that artists have.
LLIOT: You've been saying that for years.
NICKY: ( mockingly ) `I'm just a professional. A dues- playing member of a guild.' Because you're afraid, Nicky. That's the darkest part of you. You don't think you're good enough.
ELLIOT: ( mockingly ) `I'm just a professional. A dues- playing member of a guild.' Because you're afraid, Nicky. That's the darkest part of you. You don't think you're good enough.
WU LI: EXT. THE STREET 38 38 About a dozen people gathered together including several diamond merchants in their beards, black suits and fur hats. They are watching the man in the cutaway dancing with his cloth doll. Someone places a donation in the cigar box. From the tape player: "Dancing in the Dark."
ELLIOT: Where are you going?
NICKY: Don't wait Efor me.
ELLIOT: What about the haircut?
NICKY: You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
PAISLEY: I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, I hear good things about the new So do I. Over and over.

PAISLEY: Peter Redmond is an actor I admire Would you like to meet him?
NICKY: Would you like to meet him?
PAISLEY: He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
NICKY: I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't The fact is, I have to get going.
AISLEY: The fact is, I have to get going.
NICKY: Is it true?
PAISLEY: Is what true?
NICKY: He wears a disguise.
PAISLEY: Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
NICKY: But you're his friend.
PAISLEY: Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
RENEE: I can't take this anymore. He forgets simple lines. He forgets where to stand. We tell him and tell him and tell him. I know he's a sweet man. I love Peter. It's not his fault. But I've never worked in a show where the leading man has
NICKY: aybe we ought to postpone the Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
SIDNEY: Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
NICKY: appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
SIDNEY: I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
NICKY: hat was this morning.
SIDNEY: So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
NICKY: 'm not worried about this kid.
SIDNEY: Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
NICKY: Postpone. We have every right.
SIDNEY: Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
NICKY: I've had three straight washouts, You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.

NICKY: I kissed Shirley Felder on the Yes, Peter.
PETER: I kissed Shirley Felder on the Yes, Peter.
NICKY: Yes, Peter.
PETER: But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
NICKY: You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
PETER: What color?
NICKY: What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
PETER: Burnt sienna.
NICKY: Mine was cobalt blue.
PETER: This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
NICKY: I kissed her while she was
PETER: I kissed her while she was
NICKY: I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
PETER: I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
RENEE: I hear he got the parasite in I heard Borneo.
JACK: I heard Borneo.
RENEE: Why do we blame the Third World for our parasites? Maybe he got it in Denver or Minneapolis.
JACK: Maybe he got it in Borneo.
PETER: I feel shaky about one line in particular. If I can get past this line. I think I can handle the last long speech.
RENEE: Which line, Peter?
PETER: The Son says to the Father, This could be it.
NICKY: And the Father replies?
PETER: That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
JACK: It's the same line. The Father simply repeats what the Son says to This could be it.
RENEE: This could be it.
NICKY: This could be it.
PETER: I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
ACK: This could be it.
PETER: ( long pause ) This could be it.
JACK: Let's work on it.
PETER: ( long pause ) Let's work on it.
AISLEY: Do you think he can do it?
NICKY: I don't know.
PAISLEY: He's a very sweet man.
NICKY: Where are you going now?
PAISLEY: Someone waiting for you?
NICKY: Someone waiting for you?
PAISLEY: No one's waiting.
NICKY: There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
PAISLEY: If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
NICKY: ( quietly ) So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
PAISLEY: But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
NICKY: I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
PAISLEY: Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
NICKY: Never mind.
PAISLEY: Never mind.
NICKY: What? Come on, Paisley.
PAISLEY: Our Steven not only disguises He goes to the theater armed.
NICKY: He goes to the theater armed.
PAISLEY: He goes to the theater armed.
PAISLEY: He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
NICKY: I'm actually beginning to enjoy
STEVEN: You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
PAISLEY: I haven't come to you.
STEVEN: But you're here. So you must have come to me.
PAISLEY: In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
STEVEN: Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
PAISLEY: Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
STEVEN: The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
PAISLEY: Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
STEVEN: And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
PAISLEY: I don't want you, Steven.
TEVEN: Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
PAISLEY: I'm going home to my machine.
W: hen Paisley sees him, she seems to freeze.

ICHAEL: Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
NICKY: Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.

NICKY: Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
MICHAEL: You know the answer to that.
NICKY: I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
MICHAEL: They're only gonna lose.
NICKY: Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
MICHAEL: The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the
NICKY: Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
MICHAEL: It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
NICKY: It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
MICHAEL: But the son is suppose to stop I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.

MICHAEL: Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
NICKY: Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.

NICKY: I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
MICHAEL: You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
NICKY: Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
MICHAEL: You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to

NICKY: We're making too much of this.
ELLIOT: No, we're not.
NICKY: I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.

NICKY: Had to be him.
ELLIOT: She was very evasive.
NICKY: I'm enjoying this more every Elliot takes an after-dinner candy out of his pocket the candy he pocketed in the Italian restaurant after lunch. He blows the lint off and eats it.

TOYOTA: The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
NICKY: Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
TOYOTA: Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
NICKY: How come you got the kid with you?
TOYOTA: Matthew's my grandson.
NICKY: A grandmother. God bless you.
TOYOTA: He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.

NICKY: I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
TOYOTA: Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.

LILLIAN: That's always been my problem.
NICKY: And you've been extremely patient.
LILLIAN: You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
NICKY: You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.

TV SCREEN: Mike Greenwell comes up to hit for Clemens. Two pitches, two
NICKY: He's a twenty-four-game winner. He pitches seven solid innings. We scratch out a one-run lead. Of course he gets a blister. Of course they put up Greenwell even though Baylor's sitting on the bench. Of course Greenwell strikes out.
TOYOTA: You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
NICKY: ( reciting ) "It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
TOYOTA: You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
NICKY: I want to believe.
TOYOTA: If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come iew from the wings. Jack Haskins and Renee Simon looking on.
FATHER: I always thought a night's sleep is what you get for a hard day's work. But these last weeks I lie there helpless. Hour after hour. I've come close to praying for the first time since I was your age. Pray to God to put Sme out.

NICKY: This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.

LAUREL: What do we want?
STEVEN: Mystery. Deception.
LAUREL: Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
STEVEN: What's sexy?
LAUREL: Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
STEVEN: Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
LAUREL: You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
STEVEN: Even if the truth requires a certain adjustment?
NICKY: I used to go to the movies all the I saw a hundred situations like this. A man and a gun and a locked door. Lee Marvin or Steve McQueen. And I used to say to Lillian because we went to a hundred movies that we saw together or that I saw because she had seen them, and I'd say, `Watch him kick in the door with one kick,' And it might be Steve McQueen or Jeff Chandler, holding the gun up like this, and he would turn and kick the door and it would fly open at once, and I would say to Lillian, `How completely phony. Whoever made this movie has no idea how hard it is to kick in an actual door in real life.' I still love Lillian. But it's not easy to kick in a door. I knew they would lose and they lost, so what are we so upset about? They lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's written on the
NICKY: These wives named Lillian. I used to say to her, `You don't kick a door once or twice and expect it to open. It's only in the movies a man can kick in a door with such amazing ease.

NICKY: YOU'RE DEAD!
YOU'RE DEAD!: Laurel puts her hand on his shoulder.
LAUREL: What will we talk about?
NICKY: Nicky sees one of the New York Magazine ads, Steven Schwimmer's face mounted on the cardboard. He fires three times, wiping out Schwimmer's eyes.
LAUREL: Will I believe you when you tell me There's nothing left for me to lie
NICKY: There's nothing left for me to lie
NICKY: You're dead. I see you on a morgue slab drained of all fluids.

NICKY: Why does it matter?
STEVEN: If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
NICKY: Why do you care?
STEVEN: They're my team.
NICKY: No. They're not your team. They're my team.
STEVEN: They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
NICKY: I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
STEVEN: The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
NICKY: If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.

NICKY: I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
STEVEN: When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for What about my play?
NICKY: What about my play?
LAUREL: Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
STEVEN: It's your best play, Nicky.
LAUREL: See, Daddy.
STEVEN: I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
LAUREL: What else?
STEVEN: An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
NICKY: And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
STEVEN: You're out of bullets.
LAUREL: See, Daddy.
STEVEN: And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and We worked very hard on the pauses.
NICKY: We worked very hard on the pauses.
STEVEN: I called Sports Phone from Lhasa, Tibet. Freezing in my little rented Fiat. Sheep on a hillside. Rocky debris dating back millions and millions of years, from the time the Himalayas thrust up when the plates of India and Asia collided. Red Sox 3, White Sox 2. A moment in the history of the world.
