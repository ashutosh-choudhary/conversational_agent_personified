CARTER: Yeah, I'll do that. Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
ERIC: Jack! I didn't like that.
CARTER: You should have told me who you were working for.
ERIC: Cyril didn't like it, either.
CARTER: Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?

CARTER: Once a week you like a gentleman?
MARGARET: ( angrily ) Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or ( She turns and walks slowly along the bridge. ) Why all the bloody needle?
CARTER: What was bugging Frank?
MARGARET: He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both! He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street, I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday. He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
CARTER: I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that. I'm the villain in the family, It's the truth.
MARGARET: It's the truth.
MARGARET: It is. Honestly.
CARTER: ( shouting ) You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed I don't know nothing.
MARGARET: I don't know nothing.
CARTER: Listen, the only reason I came back to this craphole was to find out who did it. And I won't leave until I do. You understand?
CON: Hello, Jack.
CARTER: You bitch! It was you who told them I was here, wasn't it?

GLENDA: To the demon king's castle, of Of course. Where else?
CARTER: Of course. Where else?
CARTER: How'd you know where I'd be?
GLENDA: You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
CARTER: Very lucky, I should think. You're He must have been pretty sure I'd Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
GLENDA: He must have been pretty sure I'd Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.

BRUMBY: A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant. Do you like it?
CARTER: Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother? ( pause ) I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother, One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs. So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole So I'm worried. I can't fight them  I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.

GLENDA: Is he coming here?
CARTER: Is he coming here?
GLENDA: Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.

ALBERT: Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat. I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.

ALBERT: Nothing. What could I do?
CARTER: Did Eric know that Frank was my Yes. I told him.

CARTER: Keep your pants on. Lie down.
KINNEAR: I want you to listen very carefully. Jack Carter, You know what he looks like?
MAN: He taps his cigarette against the ashtray. On his middle finger is a large ring with the initial 'J' on it. He listens until the line goes dead. The woman beside him stirs. He stubs out the cigarette and switches off the light. Darkness.
CARTER: ( calling out ) You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
ERIC: ( wheezing ) Sod off.
CARTER: Stay away from the car or I'll blow you apart.
CARTER: ( panting slightly ) Stand up, Eric. Stand up.

CARTER: Don't stop, Eric.
CARTER: Goodbye, Eric.
