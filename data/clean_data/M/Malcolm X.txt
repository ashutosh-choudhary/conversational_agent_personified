MALCOLM: Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
BEMBRY: That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
MALCOLM: What did you give it to me for then?
BEMBRY: 'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
MALCOLM: What in the hell are you talking about?
BEMBRY: I think you got more sense than any cat in this prison. How come you are such a fool?
MALCOLM: You ain't lying.
BEMBRY: When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
MALCOLM: Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
BEMBRY: Why? Why does everybody conk?

MALCOLM: Leggo. I got to wash it out.
BEMBRY: Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
MALCOLM: Man, you better get off me.
BEMBRY: Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body trying to be white.
MALCOLM: Man, I don't want to hear all that.
BEMBRY: I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't Malcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk. But some of what Bembry has said disturbs him.
MALCOLM: Who are you?
BEMBRY: The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
MALCOLM: Elijah who?
BEMBRY: Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
GUARD BARNES: You taking the yard?

MALCOLM: I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
BEMBRY: What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
MALCOLM: You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
BEMBRY: I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
MALCOLM: Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
BEMBRY: Don't con me. Don't try.
MALCOLM: Okay, okay.
BEMBRY: Don't con me.
MALCOLM: What do you do with your time?
BEMBRY: I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his That's what Mama used to say.
MALCOLM: That's what Mama used to say.
BEMBRY: Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
MALCOLM: Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
BEMBRY: I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
MALCOLM: What? Everybody knows God is White.
MALCOLM: What for?
BEMBRY: Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?

BEMBRY: You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
MALCOLM: Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking Bembry smiles at Malcolm. He is a remarkable man who always takes careful measure of his listener. He never talks down to his audience; he talks to them. ( A manner Malcolm later will adopt. ) Bembry can talk funky or salty or, as we will see, in the cadence and eloquence of the Bible. Right now he goes into street talk.

BEMBRY: Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
MALCOLM: You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
BEMBRY: The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.

BEMBRY: The body is a holy repository.
MALCOLM: I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
BEMBRY: A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
MALCOLM: I will do it.
BEMBRY: But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
MALCOLM: I can't.
BEMBRY: For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth
MALCOLM: I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
BEMBRY: the hardest and the greatest.
MALCOLM: I can't.

BEMBRY: Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
MALCOLM: Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
BEMBRY: Tell Him that.
MALCOLM: I don't know how.
BEMBRY: You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick I want to. God knows I want to.
MALCOLM: I want to. God knows I want to.
ELIJAH: I tell you that the most dangerous creation of any society in the world is the man with nothing to lose. You do not need ten such men to change the world. One will do.

MALCOLM'S VOICE: But I have written everyone else.
SHORTY: Look like Homey got himself a brand new hype.
BEMBRY: "I wrote the Mayor, the Governor and the President, but for some reason I haven't heard from them".
MALCOLM'S VOICE: Tell the Messenger of Allah that I have dedicated my life to telling the white devil the truth to his face. I greet you with the ancient words: "As Salaam Alikum."
ELIJAH: Wa-Alaikum Salaam.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: P.S. I finally worked my way through the 127 INT. PRISON CHAPEL - NIGHT TITLE - 6 YEARS LATER A GROUP OF PRISONERS, mostly white, but with a goodly smattering of black convicts, are listening to a lecture by CHAPLAIN GILL.
CHAPLAIN GILL: Are there any questions?
PETE: Watch out, baby, this cat is heavy on religion.
CHAPLAIN GILL: I see this has become a struggle between good and evil. Satan has a question.
MALCOLM: Yes it is, Chaplain Gill. But I wouldn't want to say which one of us is what.
CHAPLAIN GILL: Why don't you just ask your question?
MALCOLM: You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
CHAPLAIN GILL: I don't think we know for certain.
MALCOLM: They were Hebrew, weren't they?
CHAPLAIN GILL: That's right.
MALCOLM: As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
CHAPLAIN GILL: Just what is your question?
MALCOLM: What color were the original Hebrews?
CHAPLAIN GILL: I told you we don't know for certain.
MALCOLM: Then we don't know that God was white.
CHAPLAIN GILL: Now just a moment, just a moment
MALCOLM: But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
CHAPLAIN GILL: Just what are you saying?
MALCOLM: I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: God is black.
ELIJAH: My son, you've been a thief, drug dealer and a pimp and the world is still full of temptation. When God bragged how faithful Job was, the devil argued that only God's protective hedge around him kept him pure, the devil said remove the hedge and he will curse his maker. Malcolm, your hedge has been removed and I believe you will remain faithful.
MALCOLM: How many you turning out?
SIDNEY: Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
MALCOLM: Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
SIDNEY: Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
MALCOLM: We can always use another good brother.
EARL: I'm a willing servant for Allah.
MALCOLM: You think you are Christians, and yet you see your so-called white Christian brother hanging black Christians on trees. You say that white man loves you and yet he has done every evil act against you. He has everything while he is living and tells you to be a good slave and when you die you will have more than he has in Beulah's land. We so-called Negroes are in pitiful shape. Get off your knees praying to a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed Jesus. Come out of the sky. Build heaven on earth. Islam is the black man's true religion.
MALCOLM: And that the white man is the devil. Yes, God is black and you are made in His image and don't know it. That's how brainwashed you are. The crowd is listening, caught up in Malcolm's intensity.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: Have you ever seen a black man who wasn't down on his knees begging the Lord to give him in heaven what the white devil enjoys right here on earth?
SPEAKER: The Harlem Council fights for rat control, for rent control and for community control of our PAN CONTINUES to take in ANOTHER SPEAKER, a few feet away. WE SEE the street corner is Harlem's Hyde Park, with half a dozen SPEAKERS haranguing the crowd with half a dozen panaceas. That Malcolm is just one among many:
SECOND SPEAKER: If the man behind the counter ain't black, don't go in. Boycott the man. Be black. Think black. Buy black.
MALCOLM: Come to our Temple and hear the truth. Because, brother and sister, you are dead. Yes you are, mentally dead, spiritually dead, morally dead. And we are here to resurrect the black man back from the dead.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: My beautiful sister, for you are beautiful. Beautiful because you are black. Because black is beautiful. You work in the white folks' kitchen so I don't have to tell you that they're devils.
MALCOLM: We're not American, we're Africans who happen to be in America. We were kidnapped and brought here against our will from Africa. We didn't land on Plymouth Rock, brothers and sister. Plymouth Rock landed on us.
MALCOLM: Put an end to your begging. No more "Please, Mr. White Man, Lawdy boss, brush me another crumb from off your table, kindly, sir." We are a nation, a great nation and don't need a thing from them.
SHORTY: I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
MALCOLM: It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
SHORTY: Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
MALCOLM: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
SHORTY: Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
MALCOLM: I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
SHORTY: You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
MALCOLM: How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
SHORTY: Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: How about Old Cadillac?
SHORTY'S VOICE: Hooked on horse. Been in and out of Lexington Ave times.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: You seen Sophia?
SHORTY: I ain't seen Archie, but the vine tells it he's living somewhere's in the Bronx. If you can call it living.
ARCHIE: Git the hell away, you bitch, I'll pay you Door opens, Malcolm enters.
MALCOLM: Hello, Archie. Archie sits up from his bed and stares. He tries to bring back some of his old juice, tries to stand up.
ARCHIE: My man, Red. Come on in, man. Hey, I can't make it.
MALCOLM: Take it easy, baby.
ARCHIE: That really you, Red? The contrast is shocking: Malcolm tall and straight; Archie ruined.
MALCOLM: You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
ARCHIE: I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
MALCOLM: I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
ARCHIE: Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
MALCOLM: Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
ARCHIE: No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
MALCOLM: Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
ARCHIE: You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
MALCOLM: You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: Women who could be mothers, teachers, ANGLE - ALLEY Laura kneels down to unzip her John's pants.
MALCOLM: and what has the white devil made of them: dead souls. Oh, my he has no conscience. He should fall on his knees and say, "My kind commits history's greatest crime against your kind every day of your life." But does he? No. He scorns you, splits your head with his nightstick and calls you nigger. If you've had it, then stand up and come forward. If not us, then who? If not now, then when?
BETTY: ( whispering ) He ought to try to make it a little easier, Brother Bembry.
BEMBRY: Why don't you try telling him that, Sister 137 INT. A LARGE ANTEROOM IN TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT The Muslim movement has grown enormously.

MALCOLM: ( little out of breath ) Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
BEMBRY: I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Malcolm nods at her; she nods in return.
BETTY: The Sister wonders if the Brother knows what Harriet Tubman did between taking souls to the Promised Land?
MALCOLM: She ate.
BETTY: She ate.
MALCOLM: Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
BETTY: If you want to tell me.
MALCOLM: If you want to tell me.
ELIJAH: Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
MALCOLM: Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
BETTY: Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose CLOSE - ELIJAH No. We are not Catholic priests. We do not practice celibacy.

BETTY: Could we sit down someplace?
MALCOLM: I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
BETTY: You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
WAITER: You're the strawberry soda and you're the hot fudge sundae. He plunks down the order before Betty and Malcolm. Malcolm takes a long, long satisfying pull on his straw. Then he sighs:
MALCOLM: That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
BETTY: Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
MALCOLM: Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
BETTY: How do you like it?
MALCOLM: She laughs. He blushes.
BETTY: There's nothing to talk about.
MALCOLM: 0h, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.

BETTY: I can handle it.
MALCOLM: They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
BETTY: You have enough worries of your own.
MALCOLM: No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
BETTY: Why do you ask?
MALCOLM: Just an idle question.
BETTY: If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
MALCOLM: How old are you, Betty?
BETTY: There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and Are you?
MALCOLM: Are you?

MALCOLM: ( shaking ) Only a pig could do a thing like that.
PLAINCLOTHES: Watch your tongue, boy.
MALCOLM: Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
LIEUTENANT: All right, break it up. You got what you wanted.
MALCOLM: I'm not satisfied.
SHOTS: of the growing crowd. of the nervous cops, including some big brass.
CAPTAIN GREEN: All right, that's enough. I want these people moved out of here.
MALCOLM: They're all disciplined men. They're doing nothing except waiting.
SHOT: The unruly crowd behind the Fruit of Islam. They are restive, milling,
CAPTAIN GREEN: What about them?
MALCOLM: That's your headache, Captain. And if he dies, I pity you.
DOCTOR: He'll live. He's getting the best care we can Thank you, Doctor.
MALCOLM: Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I had to put a plate in his head.
MALCOLM: ( to Captain ) You bastards.
CAPTAIN GREEN: All right, okay. Now disperse this mob.
CAPTAIN GREEN: That's too much power for one man to have.
SIDNEY: Brother Minister, we need to strike back.
BROTHER EARL: Put fear into those devils.
MALCOLM: I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and I'm tired of praying.
BROTHER EARL: I'm tired of praying.
MALCOLM: That's enough, Brother Earl.
MALCOLM: Sit down, son.
BENJAMIN: Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
MALCOLM: Do you know what it means to be a true Muslim?
BENJAMIN: Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
MALCOLM: I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
BENJAMIN: Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
AIDE: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad would like to see you now.
ELIJAH: If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
MALCOLM: Let me do it then.
ELIJAH: No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
MALCOLM: Allah Akbar.
ELIJAH: Tonight I shall introduce you as my National Representative. It will be a difficult task. Your assignment is to build temples all over this nation. More work than you have ever done in your life and you will be in the public eye. My son, beware of those cameras, they are just as bad as a narcotic. ANGLE - AIDES and OTHERS come into the room now. They are listening. Yes, the white devil will watch your every step. Even your own Brothers will become jealous, and hostile, go slowly. So I offer you a parable regarding your work.
BETTY: MALCOLM'S VOICE Sister Betty?
MALCOLM'S VOICE: Sister Betty?
BETTY: 153 EXT. A PAY PHONE AT A GAS STATION - DAY
MALCOLM: I'm in Detroit.
BETTY: I know.
MALCOLM: At a gas station. Will you marry me?
BETTY: Did you hear what I said?
MALCOLM: Did you hear what I said?
BETTY: Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
MALCOLM: I think so. Can you catch a plane?
BETTY: Yes. Did you eat?
MALCOLM: I love you.
MALCOLM: It won't be easy.
BETTY: Just hold me.
MALCOLM: It will be rough.
BETTY: Hush your mouth.
MALCOLM: I'll be away a lot.
BETTY: You're with me even when you're away.
MALCOLM: What do you think?
BETTY: The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love Full embrace.
BEMBRY'S VOICE: We're waiting on you folks. You trying to starve 155 INT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Malcolm has just cut the cake and handed a slice to Betty. Amid laughter and great warmth, Sidney unfurls the front page of the _Messenger_, the Muslim newspaper. Headline reads: "MALCOLM X WEDS BETTY SAUNDERS." Betty kisses her husband and Bembry, Lorraine, Earl, Sidney, Peter and VARIOUS BROTHERS AND SISTERS applaud.
MALCOLM: I must emphasize at the outstart, that the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is not a politician, so I'm not here this afternoon as a Republican, nor a Democrat, not as a Mason nor an Elk, not as a Christian nor a Jew, not as a Catholic nor a Protestant, not as a Baptist nor a Methodist, not even as an American. For if I was an American the problem that confronts our people today would not exist. So I stand here as what I was when I was born: A BLACK MAN!
CROWD REACTIONS: MALCOLM ( contd ) Before there were any such things as Democrats or Republicans, we were black. Before there were any such things as Masons or Elks, we were black. Before there were any such things as Jews or Christians, we were black people. In fact long before there was ever any such place as America, we were black people. And after America has long passed from the scene there will still be BLACK PEOPLE.
BENJAMIN 2X: Take your time.
MALCOLM: What kind of black people does the Honorable Elijah Muhammad speak for? Black people who are jobless. the black masses who are poor, hungry, and angry, the black masses who are dissatisfied with the slums and ghettos in which we have been forced to live. the black masses who are tired of listening to the promises of white politicians to correct the miserable living conditions that exist in our community. the black masses that are sick of the inhuman acts of bestial brutality practiced by these semi-savage white policemen that patrol our community, like the occupation forces of a conquering enemy army. the black masses who are fed up with the anemic, Uncle Tom leadership set up by the white man to act as a spokesman for our people and to KEEP US
MALCOLM: If the black man cannot go back to his own people and his own land, Elijah Muhammad is asking that a part of the United States be separated and given to the Muslims so they can live separately.
BETTY'S VOICE: Attallah is fine. Our firstborn is an angel and a beauty. And misses you as I do. But the news that you've dedicated four new temples is almost as good as having you with us.
158J: MALCOLM/HIS VOICE The white people who are guilty of white supremacy try and hide their own guilt by accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of teaching black supremacy when he tries to uplift the mentality, the social, and economic condition of black people in this country. And the Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting the black people economically, civilly, and otherwise, hide their guilt by accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic simply because he teaches our people to go into business for ourselves and trying to take over the economic leadership in our own community. The black people in this country have been the victims of violence at the hands of the white man for 400 years, and following the ignorant Negro preachers, we have thought that it was God-like to turn the other cheek to the brute that was brutalizing us. 100 years ago they use to put on a white sheet and use a bloodhound against Negroes. Today they've taken off sheets and put on police uniforms, they've traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs. And just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them to love their enemy or pray for those who use them as spitefully today. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is showing black people that just as the white man and every other person on this earth has God given rights, natural rights, civil rights, and any other kind of rights that you can think of when it comes to defending A-C INT. TV STUDIO CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM'S FACE With a studio mike around his neck, he's on a panel show.
MODERATOR: Mr. X, before we start our discussion tonight The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers would you mind explaining for us the meaning of your name, which is the letter X.
MALCOLM: Yes sir. As you know, during slavery time, the slavemasters named most of the so-called Negroes in America after themselves. Mr. Elijah Muhammad teaches us once you come into the knowledge of Islam, you replace your slave name with an X. Since we've been disconnected, cut off from our Eastern culture for so long that we don't know the names we originally had, we will use X until we get back to the East.
MODERATOR: Thank you. Now Dr. Payson.
DR. PAYSON: Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
MALCOLM: Please, go ahead.
DR. PAYSON: Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
MALCOLM: For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
MODERATOR: Certainly, Mr. X, you must admit there has been I'll talk about "progress" in a minute, but let me finish with my brother. Malcolm gestures to the Negro panelist. The BLACK MEMBERS of the TV audience are lapping it up. Betty and Earl also sit in the TV studio Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
MALCOLM: I'll talk about "progress" in a minute, but let me finish with my brother. Malcolm gestures to the Negro panelist. The BLACK MEMBERS of the TV audience are lapping it up. Betty and Earl also sit in the TV studio Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
DR. PAYSON: You put it very well.
MALCOLM: You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
DR. PAYSON: ANGLE - MALCOLM
MALCOLM: Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
MODERATOR: I think, perhaps, Dr. Payson has something to
MALCOLM: Don't you want to hear about the Field Nigger?
DR. PAYSON: Let him finish.
MALCOLM: Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
BROTHER BENJAMIN: Tell it.
MALCOLM: there's another one. The majority of black Americans today are Field Negroes. They don't talk about OUR progress, about OUR government, OUR navy, OUR astronauts. Hell, they won't even let you near the plant.
BEMBRY: Your holy apostle, dear Messenger, I am your true servant and the brothers asked me to tell you Malcolm is getting too much press. The brothers think he thinks _he_ is the Nation of Islam, that he has aspirations to lead the Nation. It was you who made Malcolm the man he is. You lifted him out of the darkness.
ELIJAH: Go and tell the brothers what Brother Minister is doing, has done, has been of great benefit to the Nation.
BEMBRY: Great benefit for himself.
MALCOLM: Brother Man, put that bottle down, take that poison away from your lips. That's what the devil wants you to do, stay high, out of your natural mind. I know, I've been there.
MALCOLM: It's time you received your X. But first you must copy this letter, exactly as I give it to you; down to the dotted "i's," crossed "t's," everything. And you must go on a fast, just water and juices, that's it.
BENJAMIN: I'll have it tomorrow.
MALCOLM: Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be Benjamin goes off in a corner and very quickly copies the letter, he's so anxious.
MALCOLM: When you live in a poor neighborhood, you're living in an area where you have poor schools.
MALCOLM: You are now Benjamin 2X.
BENJAMIN 2X: All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
MALCOLM: Come, sit with us.
MALCOLM: We are now sitting with Brother Benjamin 2X.
EARL: Allah Akbar.
SIDNEY: You will be good.
BENJAMIN 2X: Brother Minister, can I have something to eat?
MALCOLM: Let's get this man some food.
COED: Mr. X, I've read some of your speeches and I honestly believe a lot of what you say has truth to it. I have a good heart. I'm a good person despite my whiteness. What can the good white people like myself, who are not prejudiced, or racist, what can we do to help the cause?
MALCOLM: CLOSE - COED She is absolutely crushed and runs away in tears.
MALCOLM: .My high school was the black ghetto of Roxbury. My college was the streets of Harlem, and I took my masters in prison. If you look out the window
MALCOLM'S VOICE: you can see my burglary hangout. I lived like an animal. Had it not been for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad I would surely be in an insane asylum or dead.
MALCOLM: Mr. Muhammad is trying to get us on God's side, so God will be on our side to help us fight our battles. When Negroes stop getting drunk, stop being addicted to drugs, stop fornicating and committing adultery. When we get off the welfare, then we'll be MEN. Earn what you need for your family, then your family respects you. They'll be proud to say "That's my father." She's proud to say "That's my husband." Father means you're taking care of those children. Just 'cause you made them that don't mean you're a father. Anybody can make a baby, but anybody can't take care of them. Anyone can go and get a woman but anybody can't take care of a woman. This is the type of teaching that the honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us so we can build the moral fiber of our people.
MALCOLM: I can see the gentlemen of the press, also the FBI and CIA. are with us. Get it straight 'cuz if I said, "Mary had a little lamb," they'd write Malcolm X lampoons poor Mary.
MALCOLM: We have built temples in Boston, in Detroit, in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington 100 temples in fifty states. From a handful we have grown to scores of thousands.
MALCOLM: Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
SIDNEY: Please make way, please
GREGORY: Can I ask you something?
MALCOLM: Sure, man.
GREGORY: Are you Elijah's pimp?
MALCOLM: ( scornfully ) "His greatest greatness."
GREGORY: ( scornfully ) "His greatest greatness."
MALCOLM: Say what you're saying.
GREGORY: If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: Okay, last hug.
MALCOLM: Long day. Long night. Long year. Long ten years.
BETTY: Because you're in trouble.
MALCOLM: How do you know?
BETTY: Dear heart, because I know you.
MALCOLM: I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
BETTY: I'm not made of glass.
MALCOLM: I just want to sit here and be still.
BETTY: We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
MALCOLM: Talk about what?
BETTY: The talk is everywhere!
MALCOLM: There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
BETTY: We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
MALCOLM: There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the "Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since
BETTY: "Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since
MALCOLM: I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
BETTY: To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
MALCOLM: Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
BETTY: No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
MALCOLM: ( rationalizing ) I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
BETTY: Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
MALCOLM: Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
BETTY: A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
MALCOLM: Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
BETTY: What do we have, Malcolm. A broken-down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
MALCOLM: The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
BETTY: Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
MALCOLM: What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
BETTY: We need you too!
MALCOLM: What do you want me to do?
BETTY: Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
SISTER EVELYN: Her name is Eva Marie, she's 2 years old. Brother Minister, I did nothing wrong. I did nothing to be put in isolation. I believed in him. I believed in the Honorable Elijah CLOSE - MALCOLM He cannot believe what he is hearing, but he must. The truth is before his eyes.
MALCOLM: Sister Evelyn, believe in Allah.
SISTER LUCILLE: This is Saudi, she's 3 and you have Lisha, she's 2. Brother Minister the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the father of my 3 children.
MALCOLM: He told you that?
SISTER LUCILLE: Yes sir.
MALCOLM: Are you sure?
SISTER LUCILLE: Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
MALCOLM: Allah will provide.
BEMBRY: What are you talking about "blackout"? Some of the Brothers are a little jealous. Maybe they think you been a little overpublicized. That's all. Forget it. It's nothing.
MALCOLM: ( quoting Bembry back to himself ) "I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
BEMBRY: You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
MALCOLM: We tell the world we're moral leaders because we follow the personal example of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. It's hard to make a rooster stop crowing once the sun has risen. The sun is We hear rifle shots.

ELIJAH: Did you see the papers today?
MALCOLM: Yes, sir, I did.

SIDNEY: Another one?
MALCOLM: How long has this been going on?
SIDNEY: All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love What mission?
MALCOLM: What mission?
SIDNEY: To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
MALCOLM: What does Sidney say?
SIDNEY: I'm with you, Brother Minister.
MALCOLM: No. You'll be marked for death.
SIDNEY: Let me die then.
MALCOLM: I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
SIDNEY: You're my father.
MALCOLM: And don't come back.
MALCOLM: Because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive year on the racial front, and because I myself intend to be very active in every phase of the American Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I have called this press conference, this morning in order to clarify my own position in the struggle especially in regards to politics and nonviolence. In the past I thought the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on I speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. Internal differences within the Nation of Islam forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own free will. But now that it has happened, I intend to make the most of it. Now that I have more independence of action, I intend to use a more flexible approach toward working with others to get a solution to this problem. I do not pretend to be a divine man, but I do believe in divine guidance, divine power, and in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not educated, nor am I an expert in any particular field, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my credentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro leaders or organizations. We must find a common solution, to a common problem. I am going to organize and head a new mosque in New York City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This gives us a religious base, and the spiritual force necessary to rid our people of the vices that destroy the moral fiber of our community. Our political philosophy will be black nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, Inc. will remain wide open for ideas and financial aid from all quarters. Whites can help us, but they can't join us. There can be no black-white unity until there is first some black unity. A host of questions fired all at once: How many of Elijah's followers will join you? etc, etc, etc.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: My darling Betty. Everywhere I go I am welcomed as the representative of our people.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: I wonder who he's working for? If I was a betting man, I'd say CIA. What's your guess?
BETTY'S VOICE: I arrived in Jedda, Saudi Arabia. I have never witnessed such sincere.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: Today, with thousands of others, I proclaimed God's greatness in the Holy City of Mecca. Wearing the Ihram garb I made my seven circuits around the Kaaba; I drank from the well of Zem Zem; I prayed to Allah from Mt. Ararat where the Ark landed. It was the only time in my life that I stood before the Creator of all and felt like a complete human being.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: You may be shocked by these words, but I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass and prayed to the same God with fellow Muslims whose eyes were blue, whose hair was blond and whose skin was the whitest of whites. And we are brothers, truly; people of all colors and races believing in One God and one humanity. Once before, in prison, the truth came and blinded me. It has happened again.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: In the past, I have permitted myself to be used to make sweeping indictments of all white people, and these generalizations have caused injuries to some white folks who did not deserve them. Because of the spiritual rebirth which I was blessed to undergo as a result of my pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca, I no longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of one race. I intend to be careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism. In all honesty and sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing but freedom, justice and equality: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all My first concern, of course, is with the group to which I belong, the Afro-Americans, for we, more than any other, are deprived of these inalienable rights.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: My first concern, of course, is with the group to which I belong, the Afro-Americans, for we, more than any other, are deprived of these inalienable rights.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: I believe the true practice of Islam can remove the cancer of racism from the hearts and souls of white Americans.
MALCOLM: Let's begin.
REPORTER #1: Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad you sensed a feeling of great brotherhood.
MALCOLM: As I recall, I pointed out that while I was in Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the brotherhood that existed at all levels among all people, all colors who had accepted the religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it had done, Islam, for those people despite their complexion differences, that it would probably do America well to study the religion of Islam and perhaps it could drive some of the racism from this society. Muslims look upon themselves as human beings, as part of the human family and therefore look upon all other segments of the human family as part of that same family. Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow and white.
REPORTER #8: Malcolm, are you prepared to go to the United Nations at this point and ask that charges be brought against the United States for its treatment of the American Negroes?
MALCOLM: Oh yes. The AUDIENCE applauds.
REPORTER #3: Are you prepared to work with some of the leaders of some of the other civil rights Certainly, we will work with any groups, organizations or leaders in any way, as long as it's genuinely designed to get results.
MALCOLM: Certainly, we will work with any groups, organizations or leaders in any way, as long as it's genuinely designed to get results.
REPORTER #1: Does the new beard have any religious No, not particularly. But I do think that you will And black people in America, as they strive to throw off the shackles of mental colonialism, will also probably reflect an effort to throw off the shackles of cultural colonialism. And then they'll begin to reflect desires of their own with standards of their One of your more controversial remarks was a call for black people to get rifles and form rifle clubs sometime back. Do you still favor that for self-defense?
MALCOLM: No, not particularly. But I do think that you will And black people in America, as they strive to throw off the shackles of mental colonialism, will also probably reflect an effort to throw off the shackles of cultural colonialism. And then they'll begin to reflect desires of their own with standards of their One of your more controversial remarks was a call for black people to get rifles and form rifle clubs sometime back. Do you still favor that for self-defense?
REPORTER #2: One of your more controversial remarks was a call for black people to get rifles and form rifle clubs sometime back. Do you still favor that for self-defense?
MALCOLM: I don't see why that should be controversial. I think that if white people found themselves victim of the same kind of brutality that black people in this country face, and they saw that the government was either unwilling or unable to protect them, that the intelligence on the part of the whites would make them get some rifles and protect themselves.
REPORTER #2: What about the guns, Malcolm?
MALCOLM: Has the white man changed since I went away? Have you put up your guns? The day you stop being violent against my people will be the day I tell folks to put away their guns.
REPORTER #3: Then you're still an extremist?
