GUARD: Shut up, convict! Get yer hands off the bars! The guard passes through several levels of security doors, deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison home of the scum of the scum. PRISON VISITING ROOM The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read magazines, watch TV. Footsteps someone's here. Which pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do their jobs. The unseen visitor buzzes for help. They take their time getting off their asses. When they finally look up, their gaze becomes a leer. Follow it to: DEVIL GIRL, the visitor. Too tall, too muscled, but hot if you're into that kind of thing an R. Crumb drawing come to She holds a CAKE the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook.
GUARD 2: Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I guess even a turd gets flies to land on it.
GUARD 3: Me, I like a big girl.
GUARD 2: I.D., visitation papers.
GUARD 3: She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but you know. They laugh, buzz her through.
GUARD: Hey, Yaz! You got a visitor. Let's go, pretty boy.
VISITING ROOM: Spare. Just a table and chairs in the middle poured concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face of a guard. The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards looks like they're not taking chances.
BELOVED: YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider. A huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a grubby unshaven face. Everything about him seems strangely independently alive every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket the way Elvis was in his prime. He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING. A smirk plays on his mouth that says I'm smarter than you, asshole. The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and MANACLES. They dump him into one of the chairs. Devil Girl jumps up, they lock in a kiss it goes on too long. A guard pokes them with his billy club
GUARD 2: This ain't a conjugal visit. quit yer conjugating.
YAZ: When's the last time you conjugated I brought you a cake.
DEVIL GIRL: I brought you a cake.
YAZ: Thanks, darling.
GUARD 2: ( MOUTH FULL )
YAZ: I wouldn't do that.
GUARD 2: Why's that, convict?
MOUTH: GUARD 2 ( CONT'D ) WHAT TH
WHAT TH: But in a flash, the mouth SPRINGS OUT IT BELONGS TO A VORACIOUS ALIEN another springs out behind it they consume the guard's entire face.
YAZ: That's why. The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS as vicious and bloodthirsty as their master, snarling and hungry for blood. The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER. he launches his aliens, taking them all out. Yaz "holsters" the aliens and.
YAZ: There's nothing sexier than a girl killing for me. She runs a hand over his bicep.
DEVIL GIRL: You got so strong in prison. Yaz notices the almost-dead guard:
YAZ: I'm not just a man of brute force, you know. I prefer to be known for my rapier wit His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH like a rapier impaling the guard
GUARD: You can't win. You've only got one shot in there! Yaz lets the tension linger he seems to enjoy it. The guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear.
YAZ: You look hot. Mind if I open a The guards share a look - huh?? Yaz grins, turns his RPG towards the wall behind the guards. The guards' faces go
GUARD: Hey! Whoa! What are you doing? Don't do that!
SLAM!: Yaz blasts a hole in the wall the guards are IMMEDIATELY SUCKED OUT like from a hole blown in an airplane. What the.? Yaz steps through the hole.
ON YAZ: As he and Devil girl step through the hole, take a deep, satisfied breath of FREEDOM. Reveal we are on.
YAZ: I'm coming for you. Following Yaz's gaze to the Earth, we launch into.
CREDITS: MiB credits fly us through the Galaxy. Ending on a PARTICULARLY INHOSPITABLE LOOKING PLANET As it revolves, we observe its strange craters and surface, where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases.

KAY: Come to think of it. Why is Wu getting our noodles. outside?
JAY: Because it's about to go down. Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.

KAY: That was too easy.
JAY: I make it look easy. That's the problem with being my partner.

"KAY": We're all gonna die!
JAY: Wait - what is everyone's problem? What about that pan-galactic missile shield thing?
ZED: Sure, great idea, if we had one.
ZED: I wanted to build one years ago, but Kay talked me out of it.
JAY: Kay talked you out of it? Kay wouldn't do that. He's the most distrustful person in the galaxy. He personally set up that system to defend our planet from the scum of the universe.
" KAYÂ: I thought we didn't have any enemies anymore. A stranger's just a friend you haven't met.
JAY: Yeah, that's working out great. Look, I don't know what's frying everyone's brains, but I remember the missile shield - Kay the real Kay loved that thing. He wouldn't shut up about it. I mean, that thing was all Kay.

JAY: Don't worry, he won't have time.
OBADIAH: What do you mean? Jay forces the guy to look up we see the missiles.
JAY: Those hit the sun in 8 minutes. You want to live out those minutes? Or you want me to take you out of your misery? Jay picks up an ancient weapon crossbow, blunderbuss off the blanket and puts it to the criminal's head.
OBADIAH: Okay, okay, but don't say I didn't warn you, man. You just signed your own death warrant.
JAY: I just want a name.

KAY: Florida? I hate Florida. I hate everything South of Virginia. If that's what you came to tell me, you're wasting your time.
JAY: Man, you're as stubborn as you always were. I mean always will be. Look, It's not just about you. Because he kills you, you don't live long enough to build the defense shield. And without a defense shield, the Earth gets destroyed. You get it? He kills you, the Earth gets destroyed. I have to save you from him so we can save the planet. Kay stops writing.
KAY: Huh. Well. This is finally starting to make sense. Jay looks hopeful.

KAY: Why do you keep doing that?
JAY: So Yaz was never after you. he was after the Archanans. You just got in the way.
KAY: Which must make them damn important. But what does he want with them?
JAY: 'No sign of struggle. They must've cleared out before he got here. Like they knew he was coming.
KAY: And he's probably on their trail now. But where the hell did they They look around, puzzling over this place. Jay picks up a $100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money.
JAY: Think this might tell us something? On the $100 bill:
KAY: Looks like some kind of code. We'll take it to HQ, run it through the computer. Figure out where they went.
JAY: How about bible verses? Coordinates? Airplane flights? Shoe sizes?
KAY: So this is how you do it in the future, huh? You just keep guessing until you figure it out?
JAY: ( EUREKA )
JAY: Slow down who's after you?

ARCHANANS: You're in danger. you're in Jay thinks they're playing the "echo game" like little kids:

LAMA: Remember, please, to take the And we begin
JAY: Take the bridge. They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz. At one point, Jay corners Yaz Yaz BLASTS HIM Jay is knocked down. Looks DEAD! But he shakes it off reveal the PONG medallion blocked the shot. Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz compressed into .a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of a garbage truck. The guys give chase they want him captured, but no luck. The truck drives off.
KAY: He's gone.
JAY: Only a matter of time before he comes back. And this time he might be really mad.
JAY: Damn, we lost them. They come all the way across the universe and just when we're about to figure out what all of this is about Then, faintly. a CHEER
KAY: Hold that thought. They follow it out to
THE TRACK: Which is empty. No spectators, no horses. Just the Who stand near the track watching. nothing. And yet They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell?" Look and approach Everybody OK?
JAY: Everybody OK?
ARCHANANS: Everybody is everybody.
JAY: Yeah. guess I can't argue with that. So listen up Yaz is down but he won't be for long, so we need to start coming up with some answers. First of all The Archanans CHEER. Jay shakes it off.

ARCHANANS: The races. Jay and Kay keep approaching. Puzzled the track is What races? Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura. and now The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHING
JAY: What races? Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura. and now The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHING
JAY: You. can see the future.
LAMA: It is what you call the future.
ATTENDANT: Ah, the future. An illusion of the time-bound, borne of the fallacy that one moment follows another.
LAMA: Yaz suffers from this greatly. And so he must have revenge on your Revenge?, For what?
JAY: Revenge?, For what?
LAMA: He mourns the past because he can not see the dead are still as alive as they ever were. Just not now.
JAY: Okay, someday you're gonna explain that to me, but right now you need to stop the riddles because there's about two minutes until Yaz crawls out of his hole and gets back to trying to kill you. So help me out. I need to know IN ENGLISH why Yaz is trying to kill you and what that has to do with saving the We know what he will know.
ATTENDANT: We know what he will know.
JAY: You know what. he will know. ( figuring it out ) You know his plans.
LAMA: ( CHEERFUL )
KAY: Don't you know if he's going to?
LAMA: Sometimes he kills us, sometimes he does not. There are many futures.
JAY: Okay, which future is the one where you live and the Earth doesn't blow The one where you take us home. Jay and Kay exchange a look
LAMA: The one where you take us home. Jay and Kay exchange a look
KAY: Alright, let's get these freaks home, and pronto.
LAMA: You must let go of your. attachment to time, beginning with your concept of "pronto." And on that THUP THUP THUP 12 Blacked-out helicopters.
JAY: No! We need to get them home! But it's all drowned out in the wind and dust. MiB "squad cars" pull up and surround them. Jay and Kay look for an escape route but MiB cars and trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere. MiB agents descend on ropes, round up the Archanans
EX: What's he doing here? Didn't we just bust you?
KAY: That was someone else. All these mooners look alike, right? A beat and Ex buys it completely.
EX: Yeah. So look. We've talked about it. And you are to be commended, Agent Kay. You did a fine job bringing these illegals in. Now it's our job to get them out of the city for containment. Somewhere where if someone decides to blow them off the map, the collateral damage will be insignificant. Toronto.
KAY: But they're in danger. One of the most dangerous beings in the universe is out to kill them ( looks to Jay ) And if that happens, we're all going with them, because they're our only hope of survival.
EX: Christ, if we listened to every Mooner who showed up telling us how they were gonna save the world, that's all we'd do. Do you know why Earth is still standing?
KAY: ( COLD )
EX: Careful, Agent Kay. That sounds like insubordination. Kay walks up to Ex, looks him DEAD IN THE EYE
KAY: It sounds like you need to cut some eyeholes in your stomach, because your head is so far up your ass, that's the only way you could possibly see.
EX: That's it. You're off this case. Stick to dry ice. If I catch you near them or him again, I'll have your badge. ( to a bunch of other
AGENTS ): You four take the Archanans to One of the agents looks up
YOUNG AGENT: Me? I'm just an accountant-
EX: ( TO JAY )
KAY: Don't worry, we'll
LAMA: Yes, we know. Kay looks up sees Jay smiling at him.
KAY: I knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna lie down. So what's the plan?
JAY: I knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna lie down. So what's the plan?
KAY: You heard the man. We've got dry ice to investigate.
MIDDLE OF: GIANT STATEN ISLAND DUMP Where the truck dumps its load. Including YAZ. Who gets PROCESSED AND PRESSED INTO A CUBE. On the cube it begins to swell and force itself back into its natural shape. Around the piles of garbage, other Yaz parts SEEK EACH OTHER
DUMP EXIT: Workers stop what they're doing get out of the way of something, disturbed. We see Yaz and understand the reaction Yaz might be back together, but NOT AT ALL RIGHT a leg stuck in the wrong place, the head at a weird angle. He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself. Pops out an eye, swaps an arm. He unfurls his tongue, smells the air
YAZ: Where did you go.
SHOWWORLD CENTER: A SLEAZY GUY is suprised to see not just an agent. but four agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his peep show window. One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him:
ATTENDANT: ( CHEERFUL )
SLEAZY GUY: Yeah, I know. The agents lead the Archanans through the world's greatest emporium of sleaze.
PASSENGERS: We find a LONG LINE OF UNHAPPY KIDS, MAKING UNHAPPY PARENTS Kids crying, pulling on Mom's dress. We see it's the line to an ICE CREAM TRUCK. And the line isn't moving because KAY IS QUESTIONING THE
KAY: Just a few more questions about dry ice and I'll be out of your hair. A BIRD CALL makes Kay turn .he sees Jay waving him over, pointing at something The MiB agents lead the Archanans into the Station!
VENDOR: I told you ten times I got no idea what dry ice is!
KAY: ( not listening ). Thanks, you've been very helpful. Jay and Kay peel off, follow the MiB agents, leaving the Vendor scratching his head. He turns back to the kids. Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside.
KAY: Damn. Wrong freaks. But Jay spots the Archanans.
JAY: Over there, Kay! As they run off
HARE KRISHNA: Perhaps you'd like to join us for a vegetarian meal? Jay and Kay chase after the MiB agents and Archanans The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs warning WET PAINT! The agents look around, then slip pass the ropes and through a NARROW DOOR marked "WET PAINT" or "MEN WORKING" Jay and Kay follow. Through the skinny half-painted door.
KAY: On your 2 o'clock. They spot the MiBers and the Archanans next to the TUBE TO
KAY: Hold up.
MIB: You're off this case, Kay.
MIB 2: Yeah, but I heard there's some dry ice in Queens. Magic show at a kid's birthday party. Better hustle, you can get there before. the cake. They all LAUGH at Kay.
KAY: Change in plans.
MIB: What? We didn't hear about any change in plans.
KAY: Yeah, Ex just gave us the new orders check this out Kay gestures them closer he reaches for something in his jacket pocket. The MiBers lean in. And Kay GRABS THEM AND SHOVES THEM BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE
TUBE!: The MiB agents stumble, surprised The Archanans, not surprised, step deftly out of the way, the MiBers FWOOP FWOOP FWOOP into the tube. Jay and Kay exchange a smile and realize. One last VERY YOUNG agent is still standing there, wide-eyed:
YOUNG AGENT: Don't hurt me! I'm just the He reaches for his radio. Jay talks him down:
JAY: I know you're a little freaked out and you want to call for backup, but listen: When you've done this job for a while, you realize there's one rule things aren't what they seem. These are innocent beings that need our protection. Are you gonna do the right thing or are you gonna be a company man and send them off to die in Toronto? The young agent thinks puts down the radio.
YOUNG AGENT: Agent Zed, sir.
KAY: You're gonna be okay, kid. Jay can't help laughing
JAY: He's gonna be better than OK. I'm not gonna give you so much shit The radio CRACKLES
ZED: Detainees are on the tube to Toronto. No sign of Kay. Over.
JAY: Be nice to him. Trust me. Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup.
ATTENDANT: Here is the way home. The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and hands it to one of his attendants. The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT. it passes through all the attendants and then to JAY. Jay gives it a look.
JAY: Here, huh? You're sure?
LAMA: The only future that ends with life begins there.
JAY: I'll take that as a strong "yes." Okay, then. Follow me. Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the terminal. Kay catches up
KAY: Where are we going? Jay looks at him a beat.
JAY: Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the biggest T-bone you ever saw when we get there. So you head over to the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help these guys over here for a second. But I'll meet you in a minute. By the Omaha tube. They stare at each other
KAY: Sounds good. See you there. Kay turns to head off then, lightening fast, spins and reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card
JAY: No, no, no. No way. Florida, Kay.
KAY: That's what it says.
JAY: Don't you get it?
KAY: Yeah, it's hot and muggy. The old people drive slow.
JAY: This is why you were there. In Florida. Because of them. You were helping them and that's why. that's why you get killed. Today, July 16. I saw the report myself. Agent Kay, dead at the scene. Killed by Yaz.
KAY: You know what an MiB agent calls it when he faces death? Besides I got you to watch my back, right? They walk to the FLORIDA TUBE
JAY: I just want you to know, I'm doing this out of love, man.
KAY: Doing what? He gets his answer Jay DECKS HIM.
JAY: You stay home and stay alive. But Kay isn't down.
KAY: I told them I'd help them I'm honor-bound to do it. Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney. Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus. Jay winces like he just hit something hard.
JAY: Damn, you used to have some abs. They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches:
KAY: I make my own future! Besides I'm younger and stronger than you!
JAY: Bet you're sorry you taught me The fight continues. They're wearing down, circling each And then Kay fakes a left -
KAY: Had enough yet? On Jay gasping, spent using every last reserve of strength to lift himself off that floor.
JAY: I can't let you go I love you! Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN. Kay LUNGES AT JAY. They CLINCH. it's a stalemate.
KAY: Aw, hell, look at that behind you-
JAY: I'm not falling for that.
KAY: I'm not kidding Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see. The ARCHANANS very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the
JAY: ( yelling over the wind
NOISE ): I have to know can I really prevent Kay's murder?
LAMA: Oh. Okay, then. Thanks, good to But where there was death, there will be death.
JAY: Oh. Okay, then. Thanks, good to But where there was death, there will be death.
LAMA: But where there was death, there will be death.
JAY: What does that mean? The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current. Jay gets CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube.
JAY: TUBE P.A. ( V.0. ) Please make sure all helmet and crash suit straps are securely On Jay no helmet, no crash suit.
JAY: Helmet? No one said anything about
A: EXT. FLORIDA SWAMP/MANATEE PRESERVE - END OF THE TUBE Jay, Kay and the Archanans are launched from the tube like human cannonballs. The Archanans land gracefully, floating down air currents like kung fu masters. Kay hits with both feet and rolls. Jay face plants into the water. Jay looks up FIVE MANATEES STARE HIM DOWN. The ALPHA MANATEE emits along, lowing manatee song which RESOLVES INTO

COUGHING: ALPHA MANATEE
ALPHA MANATEE: Sorry, I have something in my throat. They went that way.
JAY: Surrounded by thick brush, trees. Jay staggers out of the water, looking beat to hell.
JAY: Okay. So we've got. 30 minutes to get past security. Get into Mission Control. Reprogram the flight path, pull the Astronauts off the launch and get them in that Well, then. Better get started.
KAY: Well, then. Better get started.
JAY: Weird. I feel like I've been here.
GUARD: Move and it's the last thing you The security is on Kay and the Archanans, forcing them down. Kay gives Jay a look
KAY: Good work. It's like we're not even here.
GUARD: ( INTO RADIO )
JAY: You've got it wrong, let me explain-
GUARD: Shut up! Anything you have to say, you can say to my superior officer! And boy does he hate your kind. A click. click. click. Someone is approaching. Someone who walks like they mean business.
JAY: Finally, someone I can talk to But the Colonel is on him before you can blink, an equal- opportunity hardass to the extreme:
COLONEL: The only thing we're gonna talk about is what specific breed of dumbass you have to be to try to penetrate my launch site! He begins patting Jay down. Eyes widen
COLONEL: Weapon! You are going away for a long time. ( to his men ) Get them into holding. We'll interrogate them after the launch. A beat. and Jay goes for it:
JAY: Sir, before you do that - my name is Agent Jay. I appreciate your position, but I'm from a top-secret government agency in charge of protecting the world from the scum of the universe and right now, on behalf of the people of Earth, I.: need to commandeer your rocket so
THEY: ( points to Archanans ) can board it. Can we count on your help? The Colonel stares at him for a beat..
COLONEL: So you want us to stop the most massive endeavor in American history, an event being watched by the entire world, the moment that will be the culmination of a challenge put to us by President John F. Kennedy himself. so a bunch of Hare Krishnas can take a joy ride?
JAY: Would it help if I told you I'm from the future?
COLONEL: Get them out of here! He motions to the other MPs, who move to roust the group. But the Lama takes the Colonel by the arm
GUARD: Yes, sir. The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans:
COLONEL: Yes, sir. The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans:
GUARD: Yes, sir. The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans:
COLONEL: The rest of you, come with me. The Colonel heads into the building. They follow.
JAY: Things change when you can see the future, right?
COLONEL: They sure do. This is definitely about some next-level shit. The PA crackles:
MISSION CONTROL: A hive of activity leading up to the launch.. Miles and miles of white guys in buzzcuts and shortsleeve button-down shirts. Thick glasses, slide rules, pocket protectors a sea of IBM men. Everyone smoking, RUSHING AROUND, LAST-MINUTE CHAOS. Hunkered over computer monitors. reel-to-reel data tapes spinning. Less computing power than an iPhone, but we put a man on the moon.
JAY: Attention, everyone! We've got a change in plans! Everyone's consumed with the launch and wearing headsets they ignore him he keeps trying
ENGINEER: You see this card? The rocket's flight path is all on cards just like this one. Right here He indicates a long metal rack, like a mail-sorting machine, that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a An Archanan approaches and BLOWS ON THE CARDS it hits the cards like a mini-whirlwind. The cards spiral everywhere like bats pouring out of a cave chads fly off they're magically re-programmed! And fly back into the rack. The engineers are STUNNED. And then PANIC:
JAY: Slow down there! Everyone be cool!
ENGINEER: Coolness is an inappropriate The Engineer flips the SAFETY off a red button marked "ABORT"
JAY: No! Stop! Do not abort!
ENGINEER: The Engineer raises his ABORTING HAND About to slam it down in the button!
NEURALIZER: What's that? You been holding out on me?
JAY: What's that? You been holding out on me?
KAY: Little something I've been working on. Glasses if you've got 'em. Jay and Kay put on their glasses.
ENGINEER: Jay and Kay in sunglasses for a moment, it's the iconic look of the posters.
JAY: Ha ha, just like old times.
KAY: Oh, and you might want to get under a desk.
JAY: Get under a?
ENGINEER: The engineers hand comes down. but before he can hit the
BUTTON: Kay hits the trigger But instead of a FLASH A MILLION PELLETS EXPLODE OUT OF THE NEURALIZER bouncing everywhere, knocking out the engineers. The pellets KEEP WHIZZING EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING: Jay and Kay have to talk over the sounds of people getting What the hell was that??
JAY: What the hell was that??
KAY: It's a high-velocity non-lethal pellet-gun. The boys in the lab call it the "hiv-nol-pog."
JAY: The Archanans deftly step out of the way or the pellets swerve around them. EX RUNS IN, flanked by security and/or MiB agents.
EX: It's Kay! There he is! Take him down! Shoot him if you have to! EX catches a PELLET TO THE GROIN, crumples. The pellets settle. quiet.
JAY: ( TO CROWD )
KAY: What a waste.
ENGINEER: Raquel Welch was here?
JAY: Five minutes to get to the rocket. And keep your eyes open for Yaz. They head out.
NEIL ARMSTRONG: ( GRANDIOSE )
BUZZ ALDRIN: What in Sam Hill is going on? Reveal the Jeep, pulled in front of the Astronauts, cutting them off.
KAY: No disrespect meant, [major]. I'm a big fan. ( Especially of the haircut. )
JAY: But we've got some bigger fish to fry. Hand over the flight suits. They start pulling the astronauts off the truck. The astronauts protest.
COLONEL: That's right, gentlemen. You need to listen to them. We're going to protocol twelve. The astronauts acquiesce.
BUZZ ALDRIN: I didn't want to get in that death trap anyways.
NEIL ARMSTRONG: I'm still getting my parade, right?
GUARD: WHAT THE
WHAT THE: I want in. The guards look at each other
YAZ: I want in. The guards look at each other
GUARD: Should we radio the Colonel?
LAUNCH PLATFORM: Kay loads the Archanans into the capsule., Technicians in clean suits assist.
JAY: We good yet, Kay? I don't like being out here in the open too many ways for Yaz to get to you.
KAY: I'm almost there. Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch.
TECH: It's called-a hatch.
KAY: Whatever, just get over here.
JAY: Oh, come on what's going on?
KAY: This door is complicated.
JAY: Oh, for.
KAY: What? It's an Apollo rocket, not a Plymouth Valiant, OK? It's Jay goes over to help Kay with the door. They both fuss and fight over the door.
JAY: Lift it. You have to lift it.
KAY: No, I am lifting it. You have to hold the lever.
JAY: No, if I hold the lever, the rubber thingie won't. go in the thing where the thingie goes. Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass.
KAY: Jay. Why do you think a highly trained NASA technician would leave the back of his suit unzipped? They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the Chinese restaurant.
JAY: Because it's about to go down. They turn around, draw weapons on the tech it's YAZ!
YAZ: You can't stop me! Nothing on Earth can stop me!
JAY: Nothing now. Yaz raises an eyebrow.
KAY: What's that?
JAY: Little something I brought with me. Jay points the gun at Yaz but Yaz just LAUGHS As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5. 4.
YAZ: Try it! You wouldn't dare! One false shot and you'll rip space and That's a chance I'll have to take. Jay BLASTS YAZ Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE. The hatch SLAMS him in! Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF
JAY: That's a chance I'll have to take. Jay BLASTS YAZ Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE. The hatch SLAMS him in! Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF
KAY: Uh oh But the Archanans surround them with their aura where the flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them. And then it's over.
JAY: We did it, partner. I hope you remember this when you recruit me you won't give me such a hard time.
KAY: You know I will.
JAY: I guess we'll have to build a prison on the moon or something. Jay realizes grabs Kay
KAY: I guess we'll have to build a prison on the moon or something. Jay realizes grabs Kay
JAY: Do a better job this time, OK? That needs to be one hell of a prison. You don't want that guy coming back, or I'm coming back. Look, once was enough, OK? Jay turns to The Colonel
COLONEL: Not too worried about that.
JAY: Can I ask you what did the Lama show you in there that made you help us? Was it the Earth being No it was my son. All grown up. As a matter of fact, I'm late to see him I promised I'd watch the launch with him.
COLONEL: No it was my son. All grown up. As a matter of fact, I'm late to see him I promised I'd watch the launch with him.
JAY: Oh. Thanks. He's a lucky kid.
COLONEL: I'm a lucky dad. Take care. Jay offers him a handshake. The officer takes it and pulls Jay into a hug.
JAY: The Colonel leaves. Jay and Kay congratulate each other, smile over a job well done. But then they see the Archanans. And realize.
KAY: We're sorry we didn't get you home, guys. It was the only way to get rid of Yaz.
JAY: But we'll make sure you're safe here. And the next rocket out.
LAMA: All is well. You have done well.
JAY: No we didn't. You wanted to go There is what we desire and what must be. And now our gift to Gift? But we didn't get you home.
LAMA: There is what we desire and what must be. And now our gift to Gift? But we didn't get you home.
JAY: Gift? But we didn't get you home.
ARCHANANS: There is the action and there is the intention. It is the intention we reward.
LAMA: You did the right thing. And if humans are capable of such sacrifice, such friendship. perhaps we ARE already home.
JAY: So then what's the gift?
LAMA: You already have it. Jay looks at pong.
JAY: This? Pong?
LAMA: Yes. PONG. The Pan-Galactic Ordnance Negation Grid. Agent Kay will use this technology.
JAY: To make the missile defense system. You use this to save the world.
ARCHANANS: Yes. Don't drop it. They take the PONG and drape it around Kay's neck The Archanans leave, chanting.
JAY: Hey. My watch stopped. We see a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something about it bothers him.
KAY: C'mon. Let's go watch that bastard leave the atmosphere.
JAY: Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a KAY GETS INTO THE ELEVATOR Jay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the So you guys understand all this time stuff, right? So is everything going to be okay now? I mean, if I saved everything, and Yaz is really gone, why am I even here? Shouldn't I not have come in the first place? And why do I still have time left on my watch?
JAY: So you guys understand all this time stuff, right? So is everything going to be okay now? I mean, if I saved everything, and Yaz is really gone, why am I even here? Shouldn't I not have come in the first place? And why do I still have time left on my watch?
UNDERGROUND: The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of underground hallways. Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking.
JAY: 3:59. But Kay didn't get killed And then the AWFUL REALIZATION
WITH KAY: Unaware that his appointment with death is near.
WITH JAY: Running. running. searching. where is Kay?
WITH JAY: Running. more frantic now. And then he sees him! Kay at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to the outside.
JAY: And then Jay sees Yazl Already there! Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot! Yaz pulls his guns.
KAY: See? I knew you had my back. Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL
KID'S VOICE: Dad? What's going on? The kid steps into the light backlit but from the shape of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG
JAY: Where there is death, there will always be death. He saved your life. He swapped his for yours. He saved the world. Kay puts a firm hand on Jay
KAY: I'll take it from here. Kay steps away. but turns back. In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses Kay a modern Neuralizer.
JAY: Leave me some memories this time,
OK?: Sure, partner. I'll see you Yes you will. Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand. Jay watches them from a distance: Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body was hands it to the son.
KAY: Sure, partner. I'll see you Yes you will. Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand. Jay watches them from a distance: Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body was hands it to the son.
JAY: Yes you will. Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand. Jay watches them from a distance: Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body was hands it to the son.
KAY: Hey, look your Dad wanted you to have this. Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain. Jay looks in his pocket the same key chain, scratched and Where is he?
YOUNG JAY: Where is he?
KAY: Your daddy had to go he's part of the space program, now. He's okay, he just had to take a trip up to the stars, but you'll be just fine. I'll keep an eye on you. They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE.
JAY: And then. A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and
JAY: It's good to see you, man. He gives him a hug gets a "what the hell?" face.
KAY: Alright, everyone, give me and my partner here a minute. They leave the guys alone. A beat and Jay just wraps him in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.
JAY: It's good to see you, man. So good. I just. do you remember. I mean, do you know what I've been Kay just stares at him.
KAY: You mean, do I remember that you travelled back in time to save my life and the world? Not bad, slick. Not bad.
JAY: No problem. You'd do the same for me. I just have one question.
KAY: Well, I don't know exactly. Because I was dead. But in a quantum reality, objects can exist in contradictory states. So multiple timelines with varying probabilities can exist, and the one you're closest to
MATHEMATICALLY: Oh, you're talking about our closeness. you're talking about our love. Across timelines! You're saying our love will go on! Kay swats him away but the love couldn't be more clear. Jay feels something in his pocket the keychain. Takes it He was a good man.
JAY: Oh, you're talking about our closeness. you're talking about our love. Across timelines! You're saying our love will go on! Kay swats him away but the love couldn't be more clear. Jay feels something in his pocket the keychain. Takes it He was a good man.
KAY: Yes he was.
JAY: I'm glad I know that.
KAY: So you travelled back in time, huh?
JAY: Wow. And you didn't change You're sure? Because the littlest thing can have huge repercussions.
KAY: Wow. And you didn't change You're sure? Because the littlest thing can have huge repercussions.
