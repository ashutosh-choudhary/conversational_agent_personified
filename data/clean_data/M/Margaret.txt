MARGARET: Written by Kenneth Lonergan
MR AARON: Abrams. Allende. One after the other the students get up to collect their tests, glance at the results and drag themselves back to their chairs. On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her class but definitely in the top five. She listens listlessly, somewhat bad-temperedly.
LISA: Thank you, Mr Aaron. She walks back. On her test he's written: B- "SEE ME1"
MR AARON: Take a seat, Lisa. I just wanna talk about your test for a minute.
LISA: ( SITTING ) MR AARON
MR AARON: Now.I know you had a little help.
LISA: Well I mean I didn't cheat, if that's what you mean.
MR AARON: I'm just saying I know you had a little A lot of people did.
LISA: A lot of people did.
MR AARON: Be that as it may
LISA: I mean I'll take it over again if you want, but like, what would be the point? It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need to know this stuff in my daily life.
MR AARON: Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily true. Haven't you ever developed an interest in something you didn't initially think you were going to develop an interest Um, no, not really. Mr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement. Lisa looks at him with secret adoration. He looks up.
LISA: Um, no, not really. Mr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement. Lisa looks at him with secret adoration. He looks up.
MR AARON: Oh no?
LISA: No. I did some of it. She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back.
MR AARON: Well, next time I'd appreciate it if you did all of it. OK?
LISA: You are so fair.
BECKY: What did he say to you?
LISA: Nothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an understanding about my math problem. Becky laughs. Lisa laughs.
KIRSTEN: OK, Mr Ferrar is such an asshole.
KURT: What'd he do, call on you?
KIRSTEN: Fuck you., Kurt.
LESLIE: Kirsten is really upset.
KURT: I'm sorry.
KIRSTEN: ( TO LESLIE )
BECKY: Kirsten, I didn't know you smoked.
KIRSTEN: I don't. -I'm just really angry. ( to Leslie ) She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa watches them.
LESLIE: Are you serious? Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to some other girls seated on the steps.
MONICA: .I just don't think you can really know a guy until you've slept with him. Lisa, listening, is not so sure, but wouldn't know.
KLEIN: .So the President of the United States, William B. McKinley, authorized the use of private detectives to break the strike, and they went out there and shot them down! Just like they did in Virginia, just like they did in Pennsylvania. Because they did not care! They did not care!
LEWIS: ( low, rumbling ) And that's basically it-That's basically all there is to say.
KLEIN: All right? Go ahead, uhhhhh: Becky.
BECKY: Well, Mr Klein.I mean, was there ever a good President of the United States? There is some laughter from the students.
KLEIN: I don't know, Becky. I think that's a good question. What do you think? You. Lionel. What do you think? Did we ever have a good Um.I don't know. I guess most of them have just been totally corrupt.
LIONEL: Um.I don't know. I guess most of them have just been totally corrupt.
LISA: Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a big fan of all the Presidents of the United States, especially the current one, but I still don't think its necessarily all that useful to categorize every President as universally corrupt, because that just seems very general to me. Especially if you're going to judge them by the standard of whatever they're supposed to traditionally be like in some mythical version of America that probably never existed to begin with. ANTHONY, an intellectual smart-ass, leans back in his chair.
ANTHONY: Lisa has raised a salient point. There are some laughs from the class.
DARREN: Hey, how'd you do?
LISA: Oh hey Darren. It was fine. Thank you so So he didn't give you a hard time or Well, he knows I'm not planning to like, go into Mathematics or anything.He was totally cool about it. He's so cool.
DARREN: So he didn't give you a hard time or Well, he knows I'm not planning to like, go into Mathematics or anything.He was totally cool about it. He's so cool.
LISA: Well, he knows I'm not planning to like, go into Mathematics or anything.He was totally cool about it. He's so cool.
DARREN: Oh yeah, everybody loves Mr Aaron.
LISA: What's that supposed to mean?
DARREN: Nothing. The man is very lovable. They stop at the corner.
LISA: I was gonna go look for a cowboy hat.
DARREN: Why would you want to buy a cowboy hat?
LISA: Because my Dad is supposed to take me and my brother to this ranch in New Mexico to go horseback riding, and I don't think it would be right to appear on horseback in New Mexico without the appropriate equestrian paraphernalia, Darren. You wouldn't understand these things.
DARREN: That is a definite possibility.
LISA: Anyway. Thanks again.
DARREN: Before you venture forth on your bizarre quest for a cowboy hat.?
LISA: Yes, Darren?
DARREN: .what are you up to later? Like tonight.
LISA: I don't know.
DARREN: You wanna go to a movie?
LISA: What do you mean, like on a date?
DARREN: No, not on a date, just go to amovie. I don't know if it's a fucking date!
LISA: All right. Calm down. What do you wanna I don't know, I don't even know what's playing! I don't know if it's a date! Let's just forget it! I hate the fuckin' movies anyway. They're just bullshit. They're all bullshit!
DARREN: I don't know, I don't even know what's playing! I don't know if it's a date! Let's just forget it! I hate the fuckin' movies anyway. They're just bullshit. They're all bullshit!
LISA: OK, take it easy, I was just asking! I'm be so horrendous?
DARREN: What if it was a date, anyway? Would that be so horrendous?
LISA: Oh my God. Are you like are you asking me out? ( Pause ) Are you? ( Pause ) Hello.? Earth to Darren.
DARREN: I don't know. Yeah. I mean.I feel like we're already really close.
LISA: Oh my God.
DARREN: .and I think we'd be a really good match - - What?
LISA: Nothing. This is Nothing.
DARREN: So Yeah. I would. I mean, yes. I am. Yes I am.
LISA: Wow. I mean I am really flattered. But I would definitely not want to do anything to mess up our friendship.
DARREN: I view this as a way of strengthening our It would definitely change it.
LISA: It would definitely change it.
DARREN: I know: It's a fairly dangerous move.
LISA: Well.I would definitely have to think about this.
DARREN: Absolutely. Give it some thought.
LISA: OK, I will. Pause. He is looking at her like he wants something.
DARREN: Like what?
LISA: What do you want from me?
DARREN: Not a thing!
LISA: All right. I'll see you later.
DARREN: All right. She turns and walks away, pleased by the conversation.
LISA: Lisa drops her bag-and goes into the kitchen. She opens the refrigerator. Her brother CURTIS, 11, comes in.
CURTIS: Is Mom home?
LISA: Is Mom home?
CURTIS: She went to the store. Lisa gets out some cold pizza and sits down with it.
LISA: Don't be such a little fuckin' goody two- shoes. -
CURTIS: Fuck you.
LISA: Please don't say "fuck," Curtis.
CURTIS: You just said it.
LISA: Yeah, that's because I know what it means.
CURTIS: So do I.
LISA: Uh, no you don't, Curtis. Take my word for What does it mean? She looks at him and speaks very slowly and deliberately.
CURTIS: What does it mean? She looks at him and speaks very slowly and deliberately.
LISA: It's when a man puts his penis inside a woman's vagina and moves it around really fast until they both have an orgasm and he ejaculates sperm inside her body. No it's not.
CURTIS: No it's not.
LISA: Yes it is.
CURTIS: ( RESUMES EATING )
LISA: ( RESUMES EATING )
CURTIS: Do you want to play a game?
LISA: I don't feel like it, Curtis. Quit bugging Can I have some pizza?

JOAN: I don't know. He sent me flowers.
LISA: Go out with him.
JOAN: You think?

LISA: She kisses and hugs Lisa, squashing her a little. Lisa gets a little tearful. Joan squeezes her tighter.
VICTOR: ( TO JOAN )
LISA: 'Bye Mom.
JOAN: I love you.
LISA: I love you too. Lisa goes out. We stay with Joan, who looks fretful.
JOHN: Matthew, if you would read France. And Anthony, you read Burgundy.

JOHN: And I guess I'm gonna hog the part of Lear 36 INT. HUMANITIES CLASS. MOMENT LATER. 36 John is walking back and forth, play in hand. The students are all reading along.
ANTHONY: "Most royal majesty, I crave no more than hath your highness Offer'd, nor will you tender less."
JOHN: "Right, noble Burgundy, When she was dear to us, we did hold her so; But now her price is fall'n."
DARREN: If you didn't want to go to the movies alone with-me Friday, you could have just told me that. You didn't need to bring Becky along as your bodyguard.
LISA: I didn't bring her as a bodyguard.
DARREN: Then why did you?
LISA: NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 What are you muttering? Oh that whole family's crazy.
DARREN: NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 Nothing. I'll try to Fourteen years! improve my diction. ( Pause )
DARREN: NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Like what? Who's gonna steal him?
LISA: NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Just everything. That's what I said.
DARREN: NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 But what specifically is What's the name of it? fucked up? NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 LISA ( very low ) It's called a bull terrier. Nothing.
LISA: ( Very low, eyes down ) So.I've been thinking about your Uh huh.?
DARREN: Uh huh.?
LISA: I guess I_don't think it's a very good Why not?
DARREN: Why not?
LISA: I guess I don't feel that way about you.
DARREN: But those kinds of feelings can develop. I definitely feel like there's a connection I know there is.
LISA: ( VERY LOW )
DARREN: I just think you're scared. I'think you're scared of your own feelings. I think you've been hurt in the past by other guys and I think what it would feel like to have a real feeling is really terrifying to you. She wipes her eyes because tears are running down her cheeks
RAMON: My family are from Colombia. My.father worked in the diplomatic service.
JOAN: Really. Wow.
RAMON: I grew up five years in Panama, four years in Holland, then nine years in Paris. After I finish university, I moved back to Colombia. So: when I'm speaking French, they think I'm Spanish. When I'm speaking Spanish, they think I'm french.
JOAN: And what do you do, Ramon?
RAMON: I have a company: We design computer software to help companies in South American countries.that use an incompatible software, so the computers can't talk to each other. It's a big problem in Central and South America, where there is not usually so much coordination in computer communications. So right now there's a big opportunity for us, because for the big software companies it's still in the backwoods. That's changing already, but in the last ten years we have done extremely well. It's the next ten years we're going to see what happens.
JOAN: Uh huh? God.
RAMON: Can I give you a lift?
JOAN: Oh no Thank you, I'm just gonna grab a cab, but thank you.
RAMON: May I call you sometime?
JOAN: OK, sure, that would be great. May I have your telephone number? 2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 28A

JOAN: Just one second, honey. Hold on! ( covering herself up ) Come in. Lisa comes in and sits on the edge of the bed.
LISA: Can I talk to you?
JOAN: Sure. What's up.
LISA: How was the show.?
JOAN: It was OK. Are you all right?
LISA: Not really.
JOAN: What's wrong?
LISA: Mom.I have to tell you something.
JOAN: 42 EXT. NIGHT. FROM ACROSS THE STREET. SIMULTANEOUS. 42 A slow pan across the building. We pick out Lisa talking to Joan in one little window.
LISA: So what do you think I should do?
JOAN: Well.it doesn't sound like it was anybody's fault.
LISA: But don't you think I should say something to them now?
JOAN: I don't know, sweetie. I mean, that bus driver probably has a family to support .He could probably lose his job.So I think you should really think about that before you say anything . You might end up feeling even worse. Lisa was not expecting this response and doesn't like it.
LISA: Joan isn't sure what she's done wrong.
JOAN: 43 CONTINUED: 43
OK.?: 43 CONTINUED: 43
KLEIN: .I'm saying what is the frame of reference for the average Arab on the street? Angie!
ANGIE: Yeah, my family is from Syria? And I just want to say that Americans have no idea how much people hate them all over the world. OK?
BECKY: We don't?
ANGIE: And all my relatives in Syria think that what we did in Afghanistan was terrorism. Not to mention Iraq.
ANTHONY: Syria is a theocratic military Um, no it's not: Sorry.
ANGIE: Um, no it's not: Sorry.
ANTHONY: Syria is not a theocratic military Um, I think we have a pretty good idea how much people hate us now actually, Angie.
LISA: Um, I think we have a pretty good idea how much people hate us now actually, Angie.
ANGIE: No we don't.
LEWIS: One at a time
LISA: They blew up our city, OK? So yeah, I think we have a pretty good idea, and personally I don't give a shit. There is some laughter from the class.
ANGIE: You should! 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 31
LISA: because the people who blew up the World Trade Center were a bunch of sick monsters -
ANGIE: Oh they were monsters?
LISA: Why? Because they're Arabs?
ANGIE: Why? Because they're Arabs?
LISA: No, because they killed three thousand people for no reason.
KLEIN: Hey, hey, one at a time.!
ANGIE: Maybe they think they had a reason!
KLEIN: LISA Hey, hey, hey! Like what? They didn't even have any demands! ANGIE They just wanted to kill Why did we drop bombs people! on innocent people in What do you think we doing it! Why did we should've have done? invade Iraq? THE CLASS BECKY ( on "we're" ) They don't care about Because, they declared war civilian casualties! And on us, Angie! Iraq has nothing to do with Afghanistan! It has to do with ANGIE oil! No they didn't! Iraq LEWIS anybody! They didn't co Come on guys, one at a time! anything to us! They did have a reason.
ANTHONY: They did have a reason.
ANGIE: Thank you.
ANTHONY: They want to establish a medieval Islamic caliphat in the Middle East and destroy Western civilization.
ANGIE: Oh, where did you read that?
ANTHONY: It's on their website.
ANGIE: Okay, forget it.
KLEIN: No! Forget it!
ANGIE: No! Forget it!
KLEIN: Go ahead with what you were saying!
ANGIE: No! Why should I?
LISA: But why are you defending somebody who murdered three thousand people!
ANGIE: I'm not! Why are you defending a country that unilaterally invaded two Muslim countries and supports the Israeli occupation of Palestine?! The class ROARS.
LISA: Oh give me a break!
ANGIE: and drops bombs on women and children and then calls other people terrorists for doing the exact same thing!
KLEIN LISA: OK OK Because it's not same Yes it is!
ANGIE: Yes it is!
KLEIN: Lionel! Go ahead.
LIONEL: Yeah, I just want to ask like, why is OK to drop bombs on men, but it's not OK to drop bombs on women and children? Isn't that just reverse sexism?
KLEIN: I don't know. That's an interesting point. I agree it's a bullshit term.
LISA: This is totally stupid.
KLEIN: ( Looking for hands ) Yeah, I think this whole class should apologize to Angie, because all she did was express her opinion about what her relatives in Syria think about the fact that we bombed the shit out of a practically medieval culture
MONICA: Yeah, I think this whole class should apologize to Angie, because all she did was express her opinion about what her relatives in Syria think about the fact that we bombed the shit out of a practically medieval culture
ANGIE: Thank you!
MONICA: and everybody started screaming at her like she was defending the Ku Klux Klan!
LISA: They are the Ku Klux Klan! They like to throw acid in women's faces!
MONICA ANGIE: Who does? The Afghanistans? Why don't you drop bombs Afghanies? The Iraqis? Then why don't you drop LISA Because they're white? Yes! No! The Taliban! Do you wish they were LIONEL still there? There's six people with their hands raised before ANTHONY you, Lisa! The correct term is Afghans.
MONICA: ( TO LISA )
KLEIN: Because that's censorship, right? Right?
MONICA LISA: Yeah! ( a joke: ) Right on! It's not censorship.! Thank you. !
ANTHONY: That's not technically LEWIS true. It's censorship.
LISA: Oh my God, no it's not!
JOAN: 46 EXT. LOCAL POLICE PRECINCT. DAY. 46 Joan and Lisa go into the station.
MITCHELL: We actually work outta Highway One? Up in the Bronx? So for somethin' like this we just borrow a local precinct.
JOAN: Uh huh.
LISA: OK, just describe what you saw to me in your own words? Lisa glances at Joan. Joan smiles at her encouragingly.
MITCHELL: OK, just describe what you saw to me in your own words? Lisa glances at Joan. Joan smiles at her encouragingly.

_ KARL: OK. Well. I would actually seriously recommend you go over to, uh, to Claremont Stables and see about getting some lessons.
LISA: No, I was actually really thinking about doing that.
KARL: So how's everything going? How's school?
LISA: School's OK. I'm kind of fucking up in But my teacher's really cool. So I guess it's not too serious.
KARL: But my teacher's really cool. So I guess it's not too serious.
OK.?: But my teacher's really cool. So I guess it's not too serious.
LISA: But my teacher's really cool. So I guess it's not too serious.
KARL: Yeah. Math was never my strong suit either.
LISA: Well, I am definitely following in your footsteps in that regard-How are you?
KARL: I'm fine. I'm good. Things are picking up a little bit, which is good. How's the boyfriend situation?
LISA: Oh the same. They're all kind of the same.
KARL: Uh huh? Well, next time you come out here I'll try to hook you up with some more interesting people than you seem to be meeting at the moment.
LISA: Thanks, Dad, I don't really go for the California type.
KARL: Well I don't either, per se. It somewhat depends on who it is, obviously.
LISA: Hard to argue with. I think I'll stop OK. Well, that's about all on my end, babe. I'll give you a call in a week or two. Give my love to Curtis, and say hello to your OK, I can't wait for our trip.
KARL: OK. Well, that's about all on my end, babe. I'll give you a call in a week or two. Give my love to Curtis, and say hello to your OK, I can't wait for our trip.
LISA: OK, I can't wait for our trip.
KARL: Yeah. I think we're gonna have a really good time.
LISA KARL: OK. Well, I love you. .It's gonna be really fun.
LISA: Bye Dad.
KARL: Bye sweetie.
JOAN: It's true. Two years of college. Two years at the magazine. Two years with you.
JOAN: What did you think of the play?
LISA: It was OK. Well, thank you, honey.
LISA: What do you want me to say? JOAN I thought it was OK! Nothing! You said it! Next time I'll lie!
LISA: I won't!
PAUL: Yeah, like I would be in a movie, only I would be doing exactly what I'm doing right now: like I'd be sitting here smoking a cigarette, and I'd have my feet up on. the desk, but the camera would be on me and I'd just be acting, except I wouldn't do anything differently from how I'm doing it right now. Nearby, BECKY and LISA are looking at a poster for "Guys and Dolls." It says "ONLY 3 WEEKS BEFORE THIS EARTH-SHATTERING
BECKY: I still don't get why you didn't even audition. You're such a good singer.
LISA: I still might do lights or something. But I'm not gonna make a fuckin' ass out of myself parading around in a play so I can ask everyone how great I was for three years afterwards like my fuck-ass mother.
LISA: Did I tell you guys I saw a woman get her leg cut off by a bus?
GIRLS: What? Really? Are you kidding?
LISA: Check out my boots.
GIRLS: Oh my God! What happened? Where were you? What did you see, etc? Becky looks at Lisa, surprised and hurt that this is the first she's hearing about this.
JOAN: You do know I have two kids, right?
RAMON: Yes. I'd like to meet them.
JOAN: You are really smooth.
RAMON: I would love to meet your kids. I have two boys myself. I'm not smooth. ( Pause ) Would you like to have a nightcap?
JOAN: Oh, God.
BECKY: Are you aware that things have gotten to the point where I now have to hear things about you from other people and I can't even correct them because I no longer have any first-hand information about you What are you talking about?
LISA: What are you talking about?
BECKY: Nothing. I just feel like we used to be really close like, up until a few days ago. And I'm not really getting that from you anymore.
LISA: Becky. Give me a break. I can't believe you just said that to me. That was really hard for me to say, and that's you response?
BECKY: I can't believe you just said that to me. That was really hard for me to say, and that's you response?
LISA: Can we just go please?
BECKY: ( SARCASTIC )
LISA: ( SARCASTIC BACK )
BECKY: Fine. Get fuckin' out of my house!
LISA: Fine. But this is totally stupid because we're both going to the same party.
LISA: It's very hard to be cool under these You don't have to be cool. All youhaveto do is snort it up your nose.
PAUL: You don't have to be cool. All youhaveto do is snort it up your nose.
LISA: I'll try.! He gives her the spoon. She snorts it.
PAUL: And then you wanna do the other nostril because you always want to be symmetrical. Very important. She snorts some up the other nostril. Paul does some too and closes the vial. _
LISA: You are so funny.! ( Pause ) So what do we do now?
PAUL: Now we make out.
LISA: Paul.! What about your girlfriend?
PAUL: I'm sorry. It just sounded like you just asked me about my girlfriend.
LISA: Oh, never mind. They make out. He immediately starts feeling her up. She pushes his hand away.
PAUL: You're not serious.
LISA: Oh. No. He moves his hand back. She lets him.
LISA: Hey. You know I really love you, right?
DARREN: Not really. Pause. She kisses him softly and they make out for a minute.
LISA: I guess I'm not very consistent.
DARREN: I don't mind. He kisses her again. She draws back slightly.
DARREN: 61 INT. RAMON'S BATHROOM. NIGHT. 61 Joan sits on the toilet seat naked, smoking, hair tousled, a little overexcited. Ramon KNOCKS. She jumps.
JOAN: Yes! Fine! Be out in a sec. She gets up, flushes the cigarette, looks in the mirror, tousles her hair, snaps off the light and opens the door.
MR AARON: Yes, Becky? Um Lisa?
LISA: Are you still mad at me about the test?
MR AARON: What's going on, Lisa?
LISA: .Because maybe my mother is right, and the bus driver is completely devastated as it is. And I'm just gonna be this little rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience, and then ends up ruining somebody's life, when I'm the one who was distracting him in the first place.
MR AARON: What does your being rich have to do with You know what I mean.
LISA: You know what I mean.
LISA: Oh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like, every two years, and my Mom lives from like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich compared to the bus driver.
MR AARON: OK.But I still don't see what any of that has to do with what you do or don't want to tell the investigating officers about the accident you witnessed.
LISA: Nothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend to think about these things. Lionel and a girl open the door.
MR AARON: Lionel? Tamara? It's gonna be five minutes.
LIONEL: I just thought you'd want to know there's like a lot of people out here and it's getting kind of hard to breathe.
MR AARON: You better close that door now, Lionel. Lionel closes the door.
LISA: I'd do that. Mr Aaron sighs a little.
JOAN: Does this-make me look fat?
LISA: Um, a little.
JOAN: Well, there's nothing I can do about it.
LISA: Where are you going?
JOAN: The opera.!
LISA: Why are you going to the opera?
JOAN: It turns out he's a really big opera fan.! Anyway, don't you think it's kind of fun? We should all go sometime.
LISA: Uh, no thanks.
JOAN: Why not? I bet you'd like it.
LISA: I don't like that kind of singing.
JOAN: But you like classical music.
LISA: Yes. That's true. But I don't like opera But when have you ever It's like their entire reason for existing is to prove how loud they can be. I don't really find that all that Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not all like that. You like The Magic Flute.
JOAN LISA: But when have you ever It's like their entire reason for existing is to prove how loud they can be. I don't really find that all that Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not all like that. You like The Magic Flute.
JOAN: Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not all like that. You like The Magic Flute.
LISA: OK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like opera singing. I just didn't realize it.
JOAN: What is the matter with you?
LISA: Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I don't want to go to the opera!
JOAN: Yes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not pushing anything! All you have say is "No I did! And then you were like, "Why not?" So then I told you, and then you started like, debating me! Like you assume I've never thought this through for myself! Which I have! Many times!
LISA: I did! And then you were like, "Why not?" So then I told you, and then you started like, debating me! Like you assume I've never thought this through for myself! Which I have! Many times!
JOAN: OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous assumption on my part. I don't actually like the opera that much myself. But I'm trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's wrong! ( Pause ) I'm sorry. I guess I'm a Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so influenced by what me and Curtis think? What Curtis and I think.
LISA: Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so influenced by what me and Curtis think? What Curtis and I think.
JOAN: Because obviously if I'm seeing somebody new it would important to me that you guys would like him and that he like you. Why wouldn't I be nervous about that?
LISA: I guess you would. Withdrawn.
JOAN: Hey.Why does everything I say annoy you?
LISA: Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here!
JOAN: Here: you be me, and say anything, and I'll respond the way you've been responding to me this whole conversation.
LISA: Go ahead: say something to LISA me and I'll say something No! I'm not gonna do to you the way you say that. everything to me Why not?
JOAN: Go ahead: say something to LISA me and I'll say something No! I'm not gonna do to you the way you say that. everything to me Why not?
LISA: Because it's dumb! I'm horrible! I get your "OK, uh, whatever."
JOAN: ( LIKE LISA )
LISA: Was that supposed to be an imitation of me?
LISA: Well, for someone who's supposed to be a professional actress that's a pretty lame- ass impersonation of someone in your own Lisa shakes her head and watches the TV. Pause.
JOAN: Are you coming to my opening night?
LISA: I will if I have to. You're a little cunt, do you know that?
JOAN: You're a little cunt, do you know that?
LISA: Yes. You're a big cunt.
JOAN: OK. Let's not start talking to each other that way.
LISA: You just called me a cunt, Mom!
JOAN: OK, I'm sorry I said that. LISA But if you're really Why? It's refreshing!
SAYING: If you're really saying you're not aware that you've been really annoyed with me, or really irritable with me and it doesn't matter if_I express it exactly accurately: you know what I'm trying to say !
JOAN: If you're really saying you're not aware that you've been really annoyed with me, or really irritable with me and it doesn't matter if_I express it exactly accurately: you know what I'm trying to say !
LISA: Not really.
JOAN: if you're saying you're completely unaware of that, then I have to say I don't think you're being honest about it. Now maybe I'm doing something really horrible to you without being aware of it, but I have a show opening in two weeks, I'm very nervous about it, I'm seeing a new person and I'm obviously anxious about you and Curtis liking him whether you think I should be or not! you were involved in a horrible traumatic accident, you're going on this crazy horseback riding trip with your father
LISA: Oh my God!
JOAN: which sounds like a recipe for disaster to me! And on top of everything else, Lisa, ever since I told you about Ramon you've been treating me like I'm insane!
LISA: Um, I think you're exaggerating slightly.
JOAN: Now what am I supposed to do?!
LISA: What am I supposed to do?!
JUST: What am I supposed to do?!
JOAN: What am I supposed to do?!
LISA: Just stop whining about everything! It doesn't matter. Norte of that matters at all! You've been in a million plays, you always get freaked out because of what some dumb critic is gonna say about your dumb play, I don't frankly give a shit about Ramon or who you're going out with this week
JOAN: I never go out with anyone! LISA Don't talk to me that way! Right! I don't care! I've barely had a date in the last two years!
JOAN: What do you mean?
LISA: and you want to know something else, Mom? There are more important problems in the world than our relationship! There's a whole city out there full of people who are dying! So who cares if I like your fucking boyfriend? It's so trivial! Why are you bothering me about all this? It doesn't Pause. The intercom buzzer buzzes. Joan hesitates.
JOAN: Well should I have him come up now? Or should I have him wait downstairs.?
LISA: Do whatever you want. I don't care!
JOAN: I don't even know what we're talking about.
LISA: I know you don't. That's the problem.
JOAN: Oh give me a break.
RAMON: Everything is all right?
JOAN: Oh, yeah. I'm so excited to be going to the opera! I don't think I've really gone more than one or two times!
RAMON: Well, I wish it wasn't Norma but it's still fun to go.
RAMON: You don't want to hear Norma?
JOAN: No I don't mean that. I just meant wouldn't it be funny if we just walked into one of the other events, like if we just went to see the Daniel Goldfarb play I think you will enjoy this.
RAMON: I think you will enjoy this.
JOAN: It's beautiful.!
RAMON: ( smiling at her ) 69 INT. LISA'S ROOM/PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT. 69 Lisa dials a phone number off a slip of paper. The line rings. WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.

LISA: It's Lisa Cohen.
PAUL: Yeah, how's it going?
LISA: OK. ( Pause ) What have you been up to?
PAUL: Seeing some questionable movies. Not deciding where to go to college.
LISA: Sounds good.( Pause ) So.I was just thinking.This is gonna sound really queer, but.by any chance would you want to meet somewhere and like, take away my Um.all right.
PAUL: Um.all right.
LISA: Really? God, I'm so flattered.
PAUL: To what do I owe this inconceivable honor?
LISA: Actually it's because of my deep passionate feelings for you, Paul.
PAUL: That's pretty much what I figured.( Pause ) So, do you want to come over here? Should I come over there.?
LISA: Well, my Mom just went out for the evening.Except my little brother's getting dropped off at some point, come to think of it, so I'm actually supposed to be here when he gets home.
PAUL: All right. ( Pause ) Do you want to give me your address?
LISA: ( blushing almost to death ) It's 252 West 85th Street. Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 50
LISA: ( on the phone ) Hey. What are you up to?
DARREN: Hey. What are you up to?
LISA: Hey, nothing. Writing my King Lear paper.
DARREN: Really? That's impressive.
LISA: Not really.
DARREN: I've just never known you to be so devoted to your studies before.
LISA: Well, I don't want to fail Humanities.
DARREN: You're not gonna fail Humanities.
LISA: No, probably not.
DARREN: So what did you do tonight?
LISA: Actually, Darren.I don't really feel like talking right now. Yeah. I'll talk to you later.
DARREN: Yeah. I'll talk to you later.
LISA: Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

LISA: 70 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 70
PAUL: Hey, come in. She steps aside. He passes her and comes in.
LISA: Hey, come in. She steps aside. He passes her and comes in.
PAUL: I think I-just alienated one of your neighbors by smoking in the elevator.
LISA: Oh really? What did they say?
PAUL: She basically said there was no smoking in the elevator.
LISA: That's original. TRACKING them as they come into the living room.
PAUL: Very livable.
LISA: We like it.My Mom hasn't read any of these books, by the way.
PAUL: Have you?
LISA: Some of them. Not all of them. Paul looks at The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich.
PAUL: This book is a very cool book.
LISA: Yeah, I think the Third Reich may be a little bit too much for me right now.
PAUL: It's pretty hard to put down once you get started. -
LISA: Do you want anything to drink?
PAUL: I'd take a beer.
LISA: OK, I have no idea where the bottle opener is. -
PAUL: Here, lemme have them. He takes the beers and opens them on the edge of the counter. He makes two marks in the counter doing this.
LISA: Whoops. I think I just permanently damaged your kitchen counter. Sorry.
PAUL: Whoops. I think I just permanently damaged your kitchen counter. Sorry.
LISA: Oh that's OK. Don't worry about it.
PAUL: Won't your "Mother" be "Upset?"
LISA: How come everything you say always sounds so ironic? You don't even have to do anything and it just comes out sounding like, totally ironic and funny.
PAUL: It's just a gift. She laughs nervously. They drink beer.
LISA: So.do you want to see my room?
PAUL: 73 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 73 They come into her room. She closes the door.
LISA: This is my room. Ta da.
PAUL: Very nice. She realizes she has some stuffed animals on the bed.
LISA: And these are my stuffed animals.
PAUL: Always important to meet the stuffed These are some drawings I did.Not that I should be showing them to you, because I know you're like a really good artist, I would like to be a really good artist. At this point I think it would be more accurate to say I'm good at drawing.
LISA: These are some drawings I did.Not that I should be showing them to you, because I know you're like a really good artist, I would like to be a really good artist. At this point I think it would be more accurate to say I'm good at drawing.
PAUL: I would like to be a really good artist. At this point I think it would be more accurate to say I'm good at drawing.
LISA: Yeah, I just do it for fun. But I've always really liked it. He looks at her pictures.
PAUL: This is probably gonna sound very immature, but how can you be so relaxed, knowing what we're about to do? Or is it just like no big deal to you? ( Pause ) OK, that was a really stupid question and I'm like totally embarrassed right now. I'm actually more embarrassed than I've ever been in my life. If you want to go home now that's totally
LISA: This is probably gonna sound very immature, but how can you be so relaxed, knowing what we're about to do? Or is it just like no big deal to you? ( Pause ) OK, that was a really stupid question and I'm like totally embarrassed right now. I'm actually more embarrassed than I've ever been in my life. If you want to go home now that's totally
PAUL: Easy there. Don't be embarrassed. It's basically like, the world's greatest activity, but it's not actually worth getting nervous about.
LISA: Yeah: I don't usually get nervous because I think it's worth it: I usually get nervous because I can't help the way I feel. Although I do think that if anything is worth getting nervous about, it's this. But maybe that's just really idealistic of me.
PAUL: There is that philosophy.
LISA: You are so funny.!
PAUL: Do you have an ashtray?
LISA: Oh you can just chuck it out the window. Paul struggles to open the window and tosses his cigarette. He closes the window and comes across the room to kiss her.
PAUL: I was thinking about it, yeah.
LISA: And am I being really dorky right now?
PAUL: You're not suave.
LISA: I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous. Please ignore.
PAUL: Don't be nervous. I promise this is gonna be a great experience for you. You're gonna have like four, five hundred orgasms at least. He kisses her. They make out.
LISA: What are you like the nicest guy in the 74 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. LATER. 74
PAUL: 74 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. LATER. 74
LISA: Like that?
PAUL: ( Not quite but close enough ) in I supposed to go really fast at the end or something?
LISA: in I supposed to go really fast at the end or something?
PAUL: Yeah, but we're gonna move on before
LISA: You don't have to do that.
PAUL: I know. I want to. Pause. She slides up away from him.
LISA: Don't do that, OK? I'm just embarrassed. Let me do it to you.
PAUL: All right.
PAUL: Are you ready?
LISA: OK. This is a little tricky: It's probably gonna hurt a little, at first, but then it's gonna get better.Just be patient. There are certain technical difficulties on my end that have to be addressed or it's not gonna happen.
PAUL: OK. This is a little tricky: It's probably gonna hurt a little, at first, but then it's gonna get better.Just be patient. There are certain technical difficulties on my end that have to be addressed or it's not gonna happen.
LISA: OK: You sound insane. They laugh.
PAUL: OK, ready?
LISA: ( SUDDENLY FRIGHTENED ) ( IN PAIN )
PAUL: ( IN PAIN )
OK?: ( IN PAIN )
LISA: ( IN PAIN )
PAUL: OK, hang on.
LISA: OK There we go. Does it hurt now?
PAUL: OK There we go. Does it hurt now?
LISA: Kind of, yeah.
PAUL: OK, just try to relax. It'll get better in a second.
LISA: Did you bring a condom?
PAUL: Uh huh.
LISA: Shouldn't you put it on?
PAUL: I will in a second.
LISA: This is really kind of hurting.
PAUL: OK one second.
LISA: I love you.
PAUL: OK hold on Shit
LISA: OK hold on Shit
PAUL: OK hold on Shit
LISA: OK, one second Ohh! Sorry Sorry He comes inside her. Silence. He carefully rolls over.
PAUL: OK, one second Ohh! Sorry Sorry He comes inside her. Silence. He carefully rolls over.
LISA: Did any of it get inside me?
PAUL: I don't know.
LISA: ( FEELING AROUND )
PAUL: Honest to God? It's probably OK. The odds are overwhelmingly that it's OK. O.C. the doorbell rings.
LISA: That's my little brother. She gets a bathrobe and goes out. We TRACK HER through the whole apartment. She opens the door for CURTIS.
CURTIS: We TRACK her back to her room. She shuts the door. PAUL has put on his underwear and is smoking a cigarette.
PAUL: Hey. ( sits down ) Can I have a drag? ( takes
LISA: Hey. ( sits down ) Can I have a drag? ( takes
PAUL: Why? ( Pause ) Why? ( Pause ) Because we didn't use birth control?
LISA: I guess so.
PAUL: It was at the ready.
LISA: Well, I don't really want to get AIDS, you know? And I really don't want to have an abortion, because I know when you have one at my age it, can be really hard to get pregnant later on, and I definitely want to have children some day.
PAUL: Didn't you ever hear of the "Morning After The Guy Came Too Fast Pill?"
LISA: Oh, the "I'm A Total Fucking Moron" Pill?
PAUL: Well.that's the Canadian name.
LISA: Yes. I prefer not to put too many chemicals inside my body if I can avoid it. I'm sure it's fine.Or not.!
PAUL: Try to listen to me. Right about now is when you're traditionally supposed to freak out. So why don't you just not? You're not gonna get AIDS, because I don't have AIDS
LISA: How do you know? Have you been tested?
PAUL: No, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it, because of my demographic. And the odds are you're probably not gonna have to have an abortion either. And since this was your first time, it might as well be a basically happy memory instead of a shitty one.
LISA: I'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of my emotions. ( Pause ) Anyway.Thank you for deflowering me.
PAUL: You're welcome.
LISA: Did it freak you out that I said I love No.It didn't freak me out.
PAUL: No.It didn't freak me out.
LISA: You don't have to say it back, because I know you probably have like no feelings at all for me.
PAUL: I think I_just proved I have some feelings for you.
LISA: You should probably go now.
PAUL: That's my brother.
LISA: That's my brother.
PAUL: What's up?
CURTIS: Lisa walks Paul to the front door.
OPERA FAN: BRAVIL BRAVIL
BRAVIL BRAVIL: 81 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER. NIGHT. 81 Joan and Ramon walk arm in arm away from Lincoln Center.
JOAN: Oh, I loved it! It was so exciting!
RAMON ': Good! We should go again!
JOAN: But how about those people yelling "Bravi!" and "Brava!"
RAMON: How do you mean?
JOAN: It's just so pretentious. "Bravi!" "Bravi!" Why can't they just say "Bravo?"
RAMON: Well, it's the plural.
JOAN: I know
RAMON: It's the plural of "bravo." It's what they say to acknowledge the ensemble.
JOAN: No, I know, I know it's correct, it just don't you think there was something a little pretentious about those people?
RAMON: I don't mean they didn't really enjoy it.But you know how you can really be enjoying something but you're also kind of looking around out of the corner of your eye because you know people are watching you enjoy it.? Does that make sense at Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi" for the whole company.
JOAN: I don't mean they didn't really enjoy it.But you know how you can really be enjoying something but you're also kind of looking around out of the corner of your eye because you know people are watching you enjoy it.? Does that make sense at Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi" for the whole company.
RAMON: Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi" for the whole company.
JOAN: Uh huh? OK, I see what you mean.
RAMON: You use the masculine for the male singer and the feminine for the female singer.
JOAN: Yeah.Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank We'll have to go again.
RAMON: We'll have to go again.
JOAN: It was so glamorous.!
MATTHEW: ( SINGS )
LISA: Cue thirty-six, go.
LISA: ( INTO HEADSET )
MATTHEW: Why are we stopping?
GARY: Now I know there's been a lot of shit going on between a lot of the people in this room..But I wanna tell you something: You've worked too fucking hard for this show to be derailed now by the kind of bullshit I know has been going on around here. Now, I'll bet you there's not one person working on this show who hasn't got somebody they want to say something to, including me. So I'm gonna start. Matthew?
MATTHEW: ( SLOWLY )
GARY: Yes. I mean you. Matthew comes slowly into the middle of the circle.
MATTHEW: You are probably one of the most talented kids who's ever performed at this school. But you're too Goddamn lazy, you think you can just waltz through this part, and it's pissing me off. Because this show cannot come together until you learn your fucking lines. OK? _
GARY: You are probably one of the most talented kids who's ever performed at this school. But you're too Goddamn lazy, you think you can just waltz through this part, and it's pissing me off. Because this show cannot come together until you learn your fucking lines. OK? _
MATTHEW: So you'd like me to memorize them. Everyone laughs.
GARY: Yes, I'd like you to memorize them! Now. ( Brightly ) Your turn!
MATTHEW: But I'm not mad at anyone. I just want everyone to think I'm a great guy. Everyone laughs.
LISA: But I'm jealous of you.
BECKY: Why would you be jealous of me.!
LISA: Because of everything! 'Cause you always get such good grades and your family never has to worry about money, and your parents are still together, and I'm really jealous of your other friends!
BECKY: Well, I'm really sorry if I hurt you!
LISA: Me too! They embrace tearfully. Many of the kids are moved. Some are not. Becky leaves Lisa in the circle. Lisa wipes her eyes.
DARREN: ( WITH UNDERSTANDING )
LISA: ( IN TEARS )
DARREN: Yes you can. Of course you can. You can talk to me about anything.
LISA: I don't love anybody more than you! You're practically my best friend!
DARREN: I love you too. I really do.! They hug and cry. LESLIE raises her hand.
GARY: Can I just say, I think this show is like two and a half seconds away from being fucking amazing, and if we could all just work together, instead of being AT each other all the time, I think we could all just be incredible. Everyone applauds, except ANGIE, who raises her hand.

ANGIE: Yeah. ( Long pause ) Yeah. I'm gonna say it. I feel really fucked over by some of the people in this room. I'm not saying I'm not gonna do my job, but for some reason, a lot of the actors in this show seem to think that this whole show is about them. And I think I speak for a lot of the techies when I say that I feel really unappreciated and basically fucked over. And I don't know if I can get over it. I don't. That's all. Nobody says anything. PAUL raises a hand. His pretty GIRLFRIEND is seated next to him.
GARY: Yes, Paul?
PAUL: Yeah, I'm just playing in the band, you know? This is hicrh school. You know? I don't really feel a strong need to like, all be on the same team with everybody. I just want to come to rehearsals, do the show, go up on the roof and smoke some pot, and then like, go on home. I don't really wanna cry and hug anybody. There are laughs and some cheers.
GARY: Oh you wanna hug me a little, don't you OK, Gary, man, I'll give you a little hug. No kissin' though. Gary charges over and hugs Paul. Everyone laughs and claps. Gary grabs Paul's face and kisses him on the cheek. Everyone is laughing. Lisa looks at Paul, who settles back with his girlfriend. He sees Lisa looking at him and gives her a little salute. Lisa catches DARREN's eye. He is looking at her with the unwelcome gaze of love. She looks away. His heart hardens against her.

ABIGAIL LISA: No. Her daughter She wanted someone No Her's daughter's to get ahold of her? not alive She I'm sorry: passed away quite a long time ago.

ABIGAIL: OK, see, that explains it. See, I think she thought
LISA: OK, see, that explains it. See, I think she thought
ABIGAIL: Could I just interrupt? How did you get this number?
LISA: Oh the police I asked the Accident Investigating investigator who to contact if I wanted to
ABIGAIL: ( ON "IF" )
LISA: ( SHOCKED )
YOU: I have been getting calls about this for three weeks! One of Monica's neighbors gave the police my number and all of a sudden I am the focal point for all these arrangements! And I gotta tell you people, I didn't have any kind of relationship with Monica whatsoever, unless you want to count the fact that she held up my children's inheritance for fifteen years. I guess we're just supposed to forget about all that now. And I am more than willing. But the perso n you should be calling is Emily Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is the person who has been dealing with all of this in New York. But it has nothing to do with me.

LISA: I'm sorry! I didn't really know who to
CONTACT: Now I can give you her number, but I would very much appreciate it if the calls would Yes Please. Can you hold on while I get a pen?
ABIGAIL: Now I can give you her number, but I would very much appreciate it if the calls would Yes Please. Can you hold on while I get a pen?
LISA: Yes Please. Can you hold on while I get a pen?
ABIGAIL: Yes, all right.
EMILY: I guess it would be all right .It's only going to be a few close friends, and some clients I imagine.
LISA: Oh so was she a lawyer?
EMILY: Monica? No. She was a social worker. She used to be, anyway. She had several Were you really good friends with her?
LISA: Were you really good friends with her?
EMILY: Yes I was.
JOAN: Where you going, sweetie?
LISA: I'm going to that woman's funeral.
JOAN: Are you sure you don't want me to come?
LISA: Why? I don't even know her.
JOAN: I would be coming for you.
EMILY: Hi. Are you Lisa?
LISA: Yeah. Thank you so much for letting me Why don't you come on in? We're about to start. Do you want anything to drink?
EMILY: Why don't you come on in? We're about to start. Do you want anything to drink?
LISA: Oh Um no thanks.
EMILY: We have bad hors d'oeuvres and good hors
LISA: Oh - that's quite all right, thank you.
EMILY: Well-thank you all for coming.
WOMAN MOURNER: Thank you for doing this, Emily.
THE MOURNERS: Yes, thank you, Emily.
EMILY: As you all know, Monica was not a religious woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through a wedding or a funeral with her knows how she felt about formal occasions. So Harry and Elise and I, when we were talking about this, decided we would just have everyone over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk. about Monica just talk about her. Maybe share some remembrances of her. Some of us know each other, some of us don't. But we're all here because we loved Monica. ( She stops. Gets a hold of herself ) And because we want to pay tribute to her in a way that might conceivably not enrage her. Everyone laughs slightly.
2ND MOURNER: She sure did.
EMILY: So. Now I've said my little piece. And now I want to talk a little bit about the first time we met. She was twenty one.
WOMAN MOURNER: It's OK, Emily.
EMILY: I know.! ( She waits ) And I was nineteen! her from across the room.
LISA: Emily, thank you so much for letting me be Don't be silly, honey. You were sweet to come by.
EMILY: Don't be silly, honey. You were sweet to come by.
LISA: Didn't she have any family?
EMILY: No, she was the last one. Except for some cousins in Arizona. You talked to Abigail. She's the one who gave you my number.
LISA: Well, she's a living nightmare. They never got along at all.
EMILY: Well, she's a living nightmare. They never got along at all.
WOMAN MOURNER: Excuse me. Good bye, Emily. Thank you so much for doing this. Emily and the Woman Mourner hug each other goodbye.
EMILY: Listen. I still can't believe this is happening.! ( she starts crying ) I mean what the fuck is wrong with her?
WOMAN MOURNER: I don't know!
EMILY: I don't understand why she didn't kill then after all that with her mother, and then her father, she gets hit by a fucking bus? It's like a joke! But that's Monica. Always the worst luck. Always. ( noticing LISA ) OK, sweetheart. Thank you for coming. Please don't stand there staring at me, OK?
LISA: ( startled, embarrassed ) I'm sorry! I just wanted to say goodbye.
EMILY: It's OK. Thank you for coming. You're very sweet.
LISA: ( to Woman Mourner ) As Lisa-goes out she hears:
WOMAN MOURNER: As Lisa-goes out she hears:
EMILY: That's a girl who was passing by at the time of the accident. She was right-there when she died, and she wanted to come to the funeral. I told her there was no 92 TIME PERMITTING. 92 93 TIME PERMITTING. 93 94 TIME PERMITTING. 94 95 EXT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 95

LISA: No M A R E T T I .. What about Brooklyn? . Thank you. She writes down the number and hangs up. Looks at the number. Dials the phone. It rings once. She hangs up.
JOHN: ( READING )
LISA: I don't know.
JOHN: Take a stab. What do you think Shakespeare is saying about human suffering here?
LISA: I don't know. Sorry.
JOHN: You know what, Lisa? That's not good enough. That's not good enough. Shakespeare wrote something: What's your response? And don't tell me you don't have one because I don't buy it.
LISA: I don't really have a lot to say. It seems pretty self-evident to me.
JOHN: ( Pause. Then: ) I think it is self-evident. I think he's saying that human beings don't mean any more to the gods than flies do to little boys who like to torture them for fun.
MATTHEW: I think it is self-evident. I think he's saying that human beings don't mean any more to the gods than flies do to little boys who like to torture them for fun.
DARREN: ( responding in kind ) Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's Gloucester. Maybe another character would have a different point of view.
JOHN: OK: That's a valid point. Just because Shakespeare has one of his characters say it doesn't mean he personally agrees with it. Yes: David?
DAVID: Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying there's a higher consciousness that we can't see. That the gods' perception of reality is so much more developed than ours that compared to their perception, our perceptions are like comparing flies to
BOYS: OK.I don't think that's what he's getting at.I think what he's getting at here is a very dark view of the arbitrary nature of human suffering.
JOHN: OK.I don't think that's what he's getting at.I think what he's getting at here is a very dark view of the arbitrary nature of human suffering.
DAVID: But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing human consciousness to divine consciousness, and he's saying that even though it seems to us that human suffering is just arbitrary, that's just because we're limited by our viewpoint.
JOHN: Well let's look at the text. Let's test David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." I have to agree with Matthew, that seems pretty unambiguous.
DAVID: Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher purpose that we can't see. He's saying that what seems like them killing us for sport could just be because our consciousness isn't developed enough to see what the higher wisdom of their killing us is. 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 75
JOHN: OK, but I still don't think that's what he's trying to say. Um.
DAVID: No, like if you say they kill us for their sport, when our perception of the gods is so meager that we can't even tell what they're doing, then how can we be so arrogant as to think that they would bother to kill us for their sport?
JOHN: ( LOST )
MONICA: I don't think that's what he's saying at all. I think he's saying the gods don't give a shit about human beings and they just kill and torture us for fun
MATTHEW: Yes. Much like flies to wanton boys. Anybody? Anybody?
MONICA: But if the gods' consciousness is so much more developed than ours that we seem like flies to them, then how can we be sure what they have in mind for us or why they do David, I think you've made your point. But it's not what Shakespeare meant. Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that he's trying to say something about human suffering here
DAVID: But if the gods' consciousness is so much more developed than ours that we seem like flies to them, then how can we be sure what they have in mind for us or why they do David, I think you've made your point. But it's not what Shakespeare meant. Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that he's trying to say something about human suffering here
JOHN: David, I think you've made your point. But it's not what Shakespeare meant. Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that he's trying to say something about human suffering here
DAVID: Scholarly opinion.:
JOHN: And in this particular play what I think he's trying to say is pretty black pretty bleak
DAVID: But what are you saying? A thousand Frenchmen can't be wrong?
JOHN: No, I'm not saying that. But I would like to move on
DAVID: I think he is saying that, because he's comparing human consciousness to flies, and he's saying that we can't see the truth around us because our consciousness is No David, that's not what Shakespeare meant! He says it somewhere else in the play, but I don't want to get hung up on this any more because it's not what Shakespeare meant, and I would really like
JOHN: No David, that's not what Shakespeare meant! He says it somewhere else in the play, but I don't want to get hung up on this any more because it's not what Shakespeare meant, and I would really like
LISA: Hi Dad.
KARL: Yeah! Hi! How's everything been going?
LISA: OK. How are you?
KARL: Not too bad. Pretty good. I'm sitting here listening to some music. Having a glass of delicious beer.

KARL: OK good. That was a good answer,.
LISA: Anyway, I do think it's a pretty long- standing relationship.
KARL: OK, then you know what? You do nothing. You do absolutely nothing. And one of two things will happen. Either he's gonna start doing back flips to get your attention, or you're gonna send him a crystal clear signal that if he doesn't do back flips he's not gonna get your attention. OK?
LISA: Well, I think he already knows I like him.
KARL: Uh huh? OK.
LISA: .I think I might have spilled the beans on that one a little
KARL: That's OK. Because now, if now you stop acknowledging him, you just suddenly give him nothing, he's gonna go berserk. Unless he's just not interested. In which case, you gotta take your lumps. OK? Which is Well, thanks, Dad. I'll be sure to try out the technique next time I see him.

KARL: OK. What's up?
LISA: . so do you think I should go back to the police, or what?
KARL: OK, well, first of all, I'm very glad you told me. Second of all, I think you should let me call my friend who's a lawyer, just to get some idea of what the ramifications would be.
LISA: You mean to protect myself before I go There's nothing wrong with knowing what you're getting into. I'm gonna call my friend Lorne, I want to see what he says. ANNETTE, Karl's, girlfriend, 40, lets herself into the house.

KARL: Um I got a message.
ANNETTE: About the flowers? For my mother?

LISA: That's OK.
ANNETTE: Who are you talking to?
KARL: I'm It's could I just
LISA: Anyway, I guess I would just like to know later that I would have done the right thing by myself, if you see what I mean. Because I don't think I have so far.

ANNETTE LISA: Who is that? Not that I'm trying to KARL horrible death into my own Uh Huh? It's Lisa. personal moral gymnasium. ANNETTE Shaw. Good. Will you please ask her

KARL: OK, you know what? I want to talk about this, not right now.
ANNETTE: and if there's anything she can't eat and they put it in the hampers, she's not gonna have anything to eat. The last time she came out here we went to three different places and she couldn't eat anything on the menu.

LISA: All right! Well.the way I remember the accident is that you were wearing this cowboy hat
MARETTI: Yes, it's my cowboy hat that I wear sometimes to amuse myself on the bus, yes. I was probably wearing my cowboy hat, yes. If you could just let me.! From my point of view, I was out that day trying to buy a cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase I was looking for one. and you were kind of waving back.And I know the police already decided it was No Fault, or No Criminality or whatever they call it

MARETTI: No Criminality, that's right.

LISA: So you're just gonna leave it?
MARETTI: I'm gonna leave it, because that's all that it was. If something else would have happened, I'd take it to whatever that was. It was tragic, it was a tragedy. But there's only a certain speed the brakes can react. That's a physical limitation of the machine. I don't know what else to tell you. It was a shock. It's shock. But that's it. Can't bring her back. Cannot bring her back.
LISA: I'm not talking about bringing her back. .I'm talking about telling the accident investigators what really happened.
MARETTI: But you already talked to them!
LISA: I know that. But I lied.
MARETTI: You lied.
LISA: Yes. And I can understand if you don't want to get in trouble, but.
MARETTI: Then how come nobody else saw it?
LISA: I can't help what other people saw
MARETTI: You would think somebody else would see it.
LISA: I just know what I saw!
MARETTI: Then why didn't you say something right Because when they were asking me what happened it seemed like you were kind of looking at me like we were saying to each other, "Let's not say anything about what happened."
LISA: Because when they were asking me what happened it seemed like you were kind of looking at me like we were saying to each other, "Let's not say anything about what happened."
MARETTI: Oh, now I really don't know what you're talkin' about.
LISA: I can't prove that you were doing that Mrs Maretti comes back outside.
MARETTI: What did I say anything to you? Did I threaten you?
LISA: No! And I am not blaming you for any of this! All I'm saying is that I didn't really tell the cops what happened, and I didn't want to go back without
MARETTI: ( AFTER "HAPPENED" )
MRS MARETTI: Gerry! Take it easy!
MARETTI: ( To MRS MARETTI ) No, it's all right. Leave it alone. ( To LISA ) You wanna ruin my life, start tellin' 'em about looks, and you waved at me and I had on my cowboy hat, go ahead! You're gonna go back to school and do your homework and I'm gonna lose my job! And who's gonna feed my kids? You? Are you gonna do it? And for what! She's dead! She's dead! And there's nothin' I-can do to bring her back!
LISA: I just want to say what really happened.
MARETTI: Hey do whatever you fuckin' want.
MRS MARETTI: Gerry !
MARETTI: But those cops are gonna laugh in your fuckin' face because this was not my fault!
LISA: It was both our fault.
MARETTI: What'd you say?
LISA: It was both our fault. Maretti scrambles in his pocket for a pen.
MARETTI: Yeah. Don't say that to me.again without a lawyer. Gimme your phone number.
MARETTI: What's your number? Gimme LISA your number. Oh, you wanna Mjy? No! Why do you want it? come to my house like some anonymous person, I can't get in touch with you? MRS MARETTI What's your fuckin' number, Gerry! Take it easy! Lisa Cohen!
LISA: Fine! It's um 212- 555
MARETTI: Hold on. ( writes ) 555
LISA: 0157. Why do you need it?
MARETTI: Do whatever you're gonna do. I hope you got a good lawyer.
LISA: I don't know why you're Maretti turns and goes in the house.
MRS MARETTI: You know this was very traumatic for him!
LISA: ( FURIOUS )
OFF: MRS MARETTI
MRS MARETTI: Does your mother know you're here?
LISA: 112A INT. SUBWAY ( MOVING ) DAY. 112A CU on Lisa as she rides back toward Manhattan.
EMILY: Why didn't you say anything before?
LISA: I guess I was afraid. I didn't know what to You didn't know what to do? The woman is killed right in front of you and you didn't know what to do?
EMILY: You didn't know what to do? The woman is killed right in front of you and you didn't know what to do?
LISA: I know it doesn't sound very impressive.
EMILY: Impressive! ( Pause ) All right: I know you're trying to do the right thing now. What does your mother say?
LISA: My mother hasn't really been that helpful.
EMILY: What do you mean?
LISA: I mean she's got a lot going on right now and she just hasn't been that interested, I What could she possibly have going on?
EMILY: What could she possibly have going on?
LISA: Her show is opening.
EMILY: What do you mean, her show? What show?
LISA: She's in a play.
EMILY: My friend is dead because some guy was looking at your ass and you lied to the police about it, and your mother can't be bothered because she's in a play?
LISA: Well, it's kind of a big deal for her. She has a really big part.
EMILY: I'm sorry. I don't know your mother, but, that is pretty shocking.
LISA: I guess she's really worried about getting a bad review or something.
EMILY: OK. I'm gonna talk to my friend who's a lawyer, and I'm gonna call Monica's cousin - you talked to her And you're gonna go talk to the police. Do you want me'to-go with you?
LISA: No thanks.
EMILY: Do you think maybe you should ask your mother to go with you?
LISA: I think I can handle this part myself.
EMILY: Oh, I am so angry. I am so angry.
LISA: He didn't do it on purpose.
EMILY: Fuck him! I'm gonna run over his best friend and then coerce some teenage girl into lying to the police about it! He had his chance. Fuck him! Now are you gonna see this through or not?
LISA: I will if you will.
EMILY: OK! Thank you. OK? Emily impulsively and somewhat tearfully embraces Lisa, who is flooded with relief.
JOAN: ( SHARP )
VICTOR: Um you're not fired.? This gets a pretty big laugh from the audience.
JOAN: Oh. ( Abashed, friendly ) What are you guys talking about? Another big laugh.
RAMON: She's good, eh?
LISA: ( Grudging but proud ) 115 INT. COHEN APARTMENT LIVING ROOM. MORNING. 115 Lisa is on the computer. Joan is standing behind her.
JOAN: Did you find it?
LISA: Just a minute!
JOAN: Can we just forget it? If they were any good somebody would have called me last No we can't forget it, because I can't take this anymore. What do you care what they say about you anyway?
LISA: No we can't forget it, because I can't take this anymore. What do you care what they say about you anyway?
JOAN: I don't. It's just a lousy feeling. Can't you understand that? If they wrote mean things about you in the newspaper you wouldn't like it. Even if you didn't agree with it, or base your self-esteem on it. Why can't you understand that?
LISA: I do understand it, because we have this conversation every time! You're great in the play, you're a great actress, everybody thinks you're great, everything about you is great, you're really really pretty
JOAN: Oh shut up.
LISA: So let me just find the review and then we can both kill ourselves, OK?
JOAN: Lisa finds The New York Times review online.
LISA: Did you find it?
JOAN: Did you find it?
LISA: Is it bad?
JOAN: Is it bad?
LISA: Let me read it. ( she reads ) OK, it's really It is?
JOAN: It is?
LISA: Oh my God. Listen to this:
JOAN: Don't read it to me.
LISA: ".. .but it is the frankly extraordinary Joan Kaplan who transforms the savage wit of David Holmes' acid comedy-drama into something approaching sheer luminosity."
JOAN: Get out.
LISA: "But don't be misled by her feather-light touch and expert comic timing. With the canny ( Has trouble enunciating: ) bray.
JOAN: Yes. " of an actor at the JOAN Top of Craft, Ms. Kaplan takes Top of Craft.? us on an emotional roller coaster that is both hilarious and heartbreaking, maddening and magical."
LISA: Yes. " of an actor at the JOAN Top of Craft, Ms. Kaplan takes Top of Craft.? us on an emotional roller coaster that is both hilarious and heartbreaking, maddening and magical."
LISA: OK. This is the best review I've ever read.
JOAN: Just for me, or for everyone?
LISA: ( READING )
JOAN: Fuck him, what does he know? ( A la Noel Coward ) Maddening and magical, eh? If only I knew what that meant.
LISA: Oh my God you're a huge star.
JOAN: Oh my God!
LISA: Can I make coffee now?
JOAN: Yes. Thank you honey. Lisa heads for the kitchen as the PHONE RINGS.

LISA: Um, yeah. Is Detective Mitchell here?
LISA: Oh. Um I talked to him on Monday and he said he'd be here after three.
LISA: Um, well, do you know when do you expect 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE What's this about?
LISA: I was involved in an accident a few weeks
AGO: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE Uh huh?
LISA: And I filled out a report with Detective Mitchell, but wanted to amend the report, so I thought I should
LISA: Well, there was something I didn't tell him, and I wanted to tell him, because
LISA: Yes! Yes! I want to change my statement. ( Pause. Calmer ) Yes.
LISA: Yes. I know. That's why I asked to see Detective Mitchell. Who said he'd be here now. Which he's not. So.
LISA: No. Sorry. It was that woman Monica Patterson, who got run over by the bus, on Broadway it was in a lot of the 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE OK, yeah, sure OK. Sit down, sit down.
LISA: ( SITTING )
LISA: I assume it was. But part of the reason it's closed is because of my statement. And the statement I gave
LISA: 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE What do you mean it was closed because of your statement?
LISA: I mean
LISA: I'm sure it does. I obviously didn't mean I personally closed the case, like, legally. I meant that what I said was probably instrumental in getting the case closed, because I was the
LISA: Lisa Cohen.
OK: Don't call me honey, OK? 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE Are you not gonna help me now that I said 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE Look what's your name?
LISA: Don't call me honey, OK? 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE Are you not gonna help me now that I said 2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE Look what's your name?

LISA: I'm calm right now!
MITCHELL: This guy been givin' you a hard time?
LISA: What's this guy been sayin' to you?
MITCHELL: What's this guy been sayin' to you?
LISA: Nothing. I don't know if you remember me. I'm Lisa Cohen. I called you on Sure I do. What's up?
MITCHELL: Sure I do. What's up?
MITCHELL: So now you're sayin' he ran the light.
LISA: Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road. And I was definitely trying to get his No, I get the picture. So you're flirtin' with this guy, he's wavin' at you, he runs the light, hits the decedent, she dies on the scene.the both of youse lie to me on both of your statements, and then somewheres in there you turn around, decide the guy belongs in jail. That right? That about right?
MITCHELL: No, I get the picture. So you're flirtin' with this guy, he's wavin' at you, he runs the light, hits the decedent, she dies on the scene.the both of youse lie to me on both of your statements, and then somewheres in there you turn around, decide the guy belongs in jail. That right? That about right?
LISA: I don't have any control over if he goes to jail or not. I certainly have my hopes. I just want to set the record straight, so that if he gets away with this I won't have been a part of it.
MITCHELL: And what do you think I should do with you? Just gimmeâ¢a clue. 'cause I'm just a little bit lost over here.:
LISA: Do whatever you want. I know what I did.
MITCHELL: OK. Well. Before we do anything, Lisa, anybody will tell you that just because he ran a red light is not a criminal offence.
LISA: Even if he kills someone?
MITCHELL: ( SIMULTANEOUS )
LISA: ( On 2nd "red" ) So he's not liable to be prosecuted for manslaughter? Or second degree murder?
MITCHELL: No. He could be charged with reckless driving, and fillip' out a false police report. Which, that's no joke
LISA: That's unbelievable! What does he have to do? Kill her on purpose?
MITCHELL: Yes. Because that's the definition of murder. Killin' somebody on purpose. You're not sayin' he ran her over on purpose, are you? All, right, look. Lemme take another statement, and, uh.We'11 look into it,
LISA: All, right, look. Lemme take another statement, and, uh.We'11 look into it,
MITCHELL: All, right, look. Lemme take another statement, and, uh.We'11 look into it,
OK?: 120 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 120
LISA: You're kidding.
MITCHELL: No. I'll go over it with my sergeant, probably pull this guy in again. Reinterview him. Put a little pressure on him. See what he says.
LISA: ( VERY GRATEFUL )
BONNIE: OK, so we're just gonna start with a_couple of simple stretches. She stretches. Lisa notices the boys looking at Bonnie.
LISA: ( holding in smoke ) .Yeah, because the Central Park Conservatory or whatever it's called put up about five hundred miles worth of these cheap shitty-looking fences all over the park. Which is totally antithetical to what the park was originally designed for. She exhales and hands Becky the joint.
BECKY: We are totally gonna miss the game. Oh my God it's John.! It's John! They try to hide the joint from JOHN, the English teacher, who approaches them and stops. Pause.
LISA: Hi John.
BECKY: Hi John. ( Pause ) Want some? They giggle.
JOHN: Come on, guys. You can't be smokin' a j. on your way to a school soccer game! Now come on!
LISA: We're really sorry. John glares at them, then turns and walks away.
BECKY: We're really sorry. John glares at them, then turns and walks away.
LISA: ( STAGE WHISPER )
LISA: Hi, Mr Aaron.!
MR AARON: How are you, Lisa?
LISA: I'm pretty damn good. How are you?
MR AARON: I'm all right, I'm all right-Tell me something. Whatever happened with that Oh.â¢I'm working on it. I'll tell you all about it sometime.( squinting at him in the sunshine ) Hey, what kind of a bike is Um, a Trek.
LISA: Oh.â¢I'm working on it. I'll tell you all about it sometime.( squinting at him in the sunshine ) Hey, what kind of a bike is Um, a Trek.
MR AARON: Um, a Trek.
LISA: I'm supposed to take a horseback riding trip with my father over Christmas break and I was just wondering, does it bear any resemblance to riding a bicycle?
MR AARON: As far as I know, no, it doesn't, no.
LISA: But you must have ridden a lot of horses.
MR AARON: What makes you say so?
LISA: Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming or someplace like that?
MR AARON: Someplace like what?
MR AARON: I'm actually from Indiana. But don't let me overwhelm you with superfluous details.
LISA: God, so what are you doing at a New York private school teaching geometry to a bunch of overprivileged liberal Jews?
MR AARON: Is that a real question, or a Lisa What's a Lisa question?
LISA: What's a Lisa question?
MR AARON: A question designed to prolong the conversation without there being any particular interest in the actual About half and half.
LISA: About half and half.
MR AARON: In that case
LISA: Before you go, I am actually thinking of getting one of these. Can I try it? Just for one second?
MR AARON: All right.
LISA: 122 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 122
MR AARON: You want me to adjust the seat?
LISA: No thanks. This actually feels really, really good. God, I'm kidding! You are so easy to tease! She bikes away awkwardly, turns around and bikes back toward him, wobbling badly.
MR AARON: She tries to stop in front of him but skids and he catches her hard by the arms to stop her.
LISA: Can I just ask you how is it possible that I am totally in love with you and you have almost no interest in me whatsoever? It's not like I'd ever say anything if you ever deigned to like, you know, be with me.
MR AARON: I can tell you like me. It's not like I'm a virgin, if that's what you're worried about. I'm not even close.
LISA: I can tell you like me. It's not like I'm a virgin, if that's what you're worried about. I'm not even close.
MR AARON: I can't even be having this conversation with you.
LISA: Yeah, you keep saying that, but I notice you're still standing here.
MR AARON: You're absolutely right. Goodbye. He gets on the bike.
LISA: It's not my fault if I revere you as a god!
MR AARON: I'll see you in class. We pull away with him as she watches him go.
JOAN: Hi. Where have you been? I didn't know.if you wanted dinner.
LISA: Oh no thanks. I'll order something.
JOAN: Someone named Emily called. And Detective Mitchell called from the Accident Investigation Squad. Is that the one you talked to?
LISA: Yeah, did he say anything?
JOAN: Just to call him back. What's going on? Did you ever go back and see him?
LISA: I'd rather not talk about it when you have one foot out the door. I'll tell you later, if that's OK.
JOAN: Of course it is. Who's Emily?
LISA: She's the friend of the woman who died, the one who had the funeral.
JOAN: Oh yeah, OK. Well, her number's by the OK. How's Ramon?
LISA: OK. How's Ramon?
JOAN: Oh God. I don't know. I mean I really like him. He's really nice.
LISA: Give him a chance, Mom, you just met-the But don't you know what I mean? I just feel kind of lonely when I'm with him. You know?
JOAN: But don't you know what I mean? I just feel kind of lonely when I'm with him. You know?
LISA: You feel lonely when you're with him?
JOAN: Yeah. You never felt that way when you were with someone?
LISA: I guess so. I feel that way all the time. You get used to it.
JOAN: Well .I don't know how serious I want to get with somebody who makes me feel that So don't get serious. That's my advice. All right. I'm gonna go.
LISA: So don't get serious. That's my advice. All right. I'm gonna go.
JOAN: All right. I'm gonna go.
LISA: Have a good show.
JOAN: Thank you. ( calling ) Goodbye Curtis!
JOAN: 'Bye sweetie.
NEIGHBOR: ( SMILES )
JOAN: ( SMILES )
NEIGHBOR: Congratulations on the show.!
JOAN: Thank you.
NEIGHBOR: That was such a wonderful review.! And I read somewhere it might be going to Supposedly. In March.
JOAN: Supposedly. In March.
NEIGHBOR: God! Exciting.!
JOAN: Yeah, it's going well. Knock wood.
EMILY: Lisa, Dave is one of my best friends. He's a terrific lawyer and if he doesn't know what to do himself he'll certainly know someone we can talk to.
LISA: OK, great.
EMILY: So Dave, just tell Lisa everything you told me, if you don't mind repeating
YOURSELF: Not at all. I love to repeat myself.
DAVE: Not at all. I love to repeat myself.
LISA: Are you guys gonna order something?
DAVE: When someone is killed it's what you call a Wrongful Death Suit, which is a statutory case, which just means there's a statute passed by the legislature which gives you the right to bring the case.
LISA: As opposed to what?
DAVE: As opposed to common law, which is law made by judges. Which is why the damages are I don't understand.
LISA: I don't understand.
EMILY: Look, just skip that part. We don't care about that.
LISA: I thought we were trying to get the police to arrest this guy.!
DAVE: No the police are not, uh
LISA EMILY: Why not? They told me they Dave doesn't think the were gonna look into it police are gonna I'm just telling you that even if they do, there is no way in this world they are gonna recommend to the DA that they charge this guy. That's why
DAVE: I'm just telling you that even if they do, there is no way in this world they are gonna recommend to the DA that they charge this guy. That's why
LISA: ( ON "THAT'S" )
DAVE: Well. I'm
LISA: Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 109
DAVE EMILY: That's OK That's OK, honey.
DAVE: I'm just getting to that. You can't do anything unless you're a relative
EMILY: She didn't have any relatives, except for those idiots in Arizona
DAVE: ( ON "EXCEPT" )
EMILY: I am the executor of her estate.
DAVE: which is Emily. I know.
EMILY: So good.
DAVE: Yes. This is good. Because the executor of the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit, but the beneficiary has to be a relative. So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful Death suit you can sue for Pain and Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of Support or Services.. .And also what's called Care, Comfort and Society: like advice, counseling of the parent that the kids aren't gonna get anymore.
LISA: You can really sue for that?
DAVE: Yeah, and that's probably what we would do,
LISA: So I don't understand. Who are we suing? The bus driver?
DAVE: Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't have any money. You basically sue everybody and hope something sticks. The person who pays will be the MTA's insurance company.
LISA: But do you think the driver would get
DAVE: No. Not necessarily.
LISA: Even if all the facts came out at the Maybe. I don't know.
DAVE: Maybe. I don't know.
EMILY: But how much could they be liable for?
DAVE EMILY: It depends: How badly do you think we could ever hurt them?
DAVE: if she was alive, in great pain for an extended period of time, they give more money for that.
LISA: I'd say she was alive for ten minutes.
DAVE: And I gather in a lot .of pain?
LISA: Her leg was cut off.
DAVE: Yes obviously. And but was she conscious? Awake, the whole time?
LISA: I'm sorry, Emily. ( To DAVE ) Yeah, awake.
EMILY: That's OK.
DAVE: Well, if she was in a lot of pain for that long .I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a half a million dollars to get a sustainable verdict? A brain damaged baby would beâ¢ three million. But the truth is, Lisa, after all's said and done, it's not a very good case.
LISA: Why not?
DAVE: Because it's your word against his, and because you already lied on your first deposition. A red light case is a fifty- fifty proposition already. And with only one eyewitness, with two conflicting statements? I wouldn't take-that case.
EMILY: Nobody really cares about getting a lot of money here.
DAVE: I understand that
EMILY: We just want this prick to Buffer. and we want the bus company to take resonsibility for hiring this guy.
DAVE: I understand. But no matter how you slice it, the fact that Lisa lied on her first statement is a disaster for your lawyer.
LISA: Can't I explain why I lied the first time? It's not like I'm trying to get any money for myself.
DAVE: That's true-Since she have no financial interest she can't be impeached for bias.
EMILY: Impeached for what?
DAVE: She can't have her credibility attacked on financial grounds because the jury knows you're not getting any money if you win.
LISA: So that's'something, isn't it?
EMILY: But do you really think we know what that I'm sorry. That's what its called.
DAVE: I'm sorry. That's what its called.
EMILY: But who are you talking to? You know we don't know what that means. It's like you're not really concentrating.
DAVE: I don't know. I am concentrating. I'm just thinking out loud.
EMILY: OX. All right. I'm sorry.I
DAVE: Anyway.. the only thing I could think of is it i@ the MTA. So they're not gonna want a lot of publicity.
LISA: Anyway, the whole point is to get this guy
EMILY: Is to fucking get this guyl
LISA: No, its to get him out from behind the wheel of a bus!
DAVE: Did she know she was dying? I only ask because the terror of knowing you're dying raises the damages.
LISA: I think she had a pretty good idea.
DAVE: If she had lived for a couple of days it would make the case better.I know this sounds horrible, but this is what it comes down to.
EMILY: I know. We know, Dave. That's OK. Silence. Emily starts to speak:
DAVE: I actually did have one more thought.I do know one guy who's, uh. You know what? Yo know what I want to do7 I want to make a few phone calls, and then, just let me get back to you.
EMILY: I would just like somebody to take responsibility for what happened.
LISA: Yes, Detective Mitchell please? . My name is Lisa Cohen? C 0 H Yes, I'll hold. ( On hold ) Fuck you. Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 112A
MITCHELL: Detective Mitchell.
LISA: Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling.
MITCHELL: Hi Lisa, what can I do for you?
LISA: Well, I was just wondering what ever happened, if anything, with the case. You said you might re-interview the bus Yes, we did:.We brought him back in
MITCHELL: Yes, we did:.We brought him back in
LISA: You did? What happened?
MITCHELL: Well, he basically stuck to his original representation, and that was pretty much it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but he agrees with me we still don't have enough to charge this guy, so there's really not a lot more we can do at this But how did you ask the questions?
LISA: But how did you ask the questions?
MITCHELL: Excuse me?
LISA: He's obviously not gonna change his statement if you just ask him like really politely: Why would he? We already know he's a liar.
MITCHELL: Hey, you know, Lisa, in the old days we'd just throw him in the back with a rubber hose and we'd get whatever answer we want out of him. But fortunately we don't do that kind of thing anymore
LISA: Yeah, not to white people.
MITCHELL: Excuse me?
LISA: You don't do it to white people. Anyway, I'm not saying you
MITCHELL: We don't do it to who?
LISA: Oh my God.
MITCHELL: First of all, I don't know why you're bringin' the guy's race into it. There's forty thousand cops in this city
LISA: Yes, thank you, yes.
MITCHELL: and I hate to disillusion you, but most of 'em are pretty good guys, just tryin' to do their job. Bottom line is the DA's not gonna take this case. ( Pause ) Now you could talk to my sergeant if you want to, but
LISA: Yes, I would.
LISA: So there's no way to appeal
LISA: But how do you know Detective Mitchell interrogated him aggressively enough if you weren't there?
JOAN: What's going on? LISA waves her away.
JOAN: so funny: it's the same show, but now they all read how great it is, we get these big standing ovations every night, and it's the exact same show as before.
RAMON: But why do you put yourself down? It's a wonderful show and a wonderful performance.
JOAN: No, it's not I'm not putting myself down. It's just that the audience always reacts differently if they've been told it's good. A lot of actors have that Mm hm? She takes a few steps away.
RAMON: Mm hm? She takes a few steps away.
JOAN: I love this view.( Pause ) You know, Ramon.this may sound very stupid to you, but do you ever worry that we don't have very much in common?
RAMON: What do you mean?
JOAN: Well, I don't mean to sound dissatisfied, or disgruntled. But I feel like we're always misunderstanding each other. Do you feel that way at all? Or am I just completely off the beam?
RAMON: I don't think we should talk about that, You don't? Well.I think it's kind of important or I wouldn't have brought it up.
JOAN: You don't? Well.I think it's kind of important or I wouldn't have brought it up.
RAMON: Joan. I like you very much. But let's not talk about what you are like, and what I am like. That never makes a good result. Talk about it with your friends.
JOAN: My friends.!
RAMON: 2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 116
JOAN: Sure. Just don't tell me what they're like.
RAMON: That's a little place we used to go on holiday, two hours outside of Cartagena.My family is all there still, but Rodrigo is studying in London, and Hector is in Geneva.
JOAN: Uh huh.
RAMON: I'm sure they will go back eventually, because they like to do something for their country. But it's a worry, because it's very bad there now.
JOAN: Yeah.I haven't really been following it.
RAMON: It's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to found an organization to work with children whose families have been killed, or the parents have been kidnapped, so they don't know if they are alive or dead. We try to find homes for them, preferably in Colombia, because if we lose our young people, that's it: That's the future. We have raised a lot of money, but there's only so much we can do. You don't like to say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the Yeah. God.I wish I knew more about it.Do you mind if I ask you something?
JOAN: Yeah. God.I wish I knew more about it.Do you mind if I ask you something?
RAMON: Of course not.
JOAN: Why are you interested in me?
RAMON: You don't think I should be?
JOAN: I just feel kind of ignorant about your whole world.
RAMON: You think it would be better if we knew about all the same things?
JOAN: Not really, not exclusively. It's just unusual. Don't you think it's unusual?
RAMON: Not for me.
JOAN: I guess you travel a lot. I've only been out of the country a few times in my whole You should travel more.
RAMON: You should travel more.
JOAN: I know. I've always wanted to. It's hard when you're in the theater.
RAMON: Still, you should try. It's a big world. You're an artist. You should see more of I know. You don't have to keep saying that. I've always wanted to travel. It's just a little difficult with two kids and no husband, but it's hard to make a lot of money in the theater. I was on a TV show a few years back and I socked away some money because of that, but my ex-husband
JOAN: I know. You don't have to keep saying that. I've always wanted to travel. It's just a little difficult with two kids and no husband, but it's hard to make a lot of money in the theater. I was on a TV show a few years back and I socked away some money because of that, but my ex-husband
RAMON: Karl, yes, you remembered, very good. Karl's very generous with the kids when he can be, but he's struggling too: He's a director: he directs commercials, and now he's trying to produce them. Anyway, I'm not ignorant because I enjoy it.
JOAN: Karl, yes, you remembered, very good. Karl's very generous with the kids when he can be, but he's struggling too: He's a director: he directs commercials, and now he's trying to produce them. Anyway, I'm not ignorant because I enjoy it.
RAMON: I don't say you're ignorant. Do you think Lisa will be interested in acting?
JOAN: I don't think so. I think's she's got a lot of contempt for it. Of course that may be the age.
RAMON: She would prefer the world with no plays? No films?
JOAN: Oh. Who knows.
RAMON: Would you like to see a picture of my These are all my aunts and uncles.See? Big family.
JOAN: These are all my aunts and uncles.See? Big family.
RAMON: These are all my aunts and uncles.See? Big family.
JOAN: She looks at him as he turns the pages.
DAVE: So after I talked to you guys I called this P.I. I know and I asked him to
EMILY: You called a what? A what?
DAVE: Private Investigator to see if he could find anything out about your bus driver
LISA: DAVE EMILY
DAVE EMILY: Yeah: So he Dave!
DAVE: Wait, let me tell you what he said! So he called this guy he knows who used to be a cop for the MTA. Did you know the MTA have their own police? The MTA police? They have their own uniforms.
EMILY: Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
DAVE EMILY: And Just a minutel Jesus Christ! What do we police and their uniforms?!
DAVE: so this guy got someone to let him sneak a look at your guy's file. And it turns out he's had two previous accidents less than two years apart one of them on the job, one in his own car
EMILY: where there was some allegation that he was drinking, which was dropped, but, that he's never been cited or disciplined, just moved around to different shifts
DAVE: where there was some allegation that he was drinking, which was dropped, but, that he's never been cited or disciplined, just moved around to different shifts
EMILY: Are you fucking kidding me?
LISA: Why does this not shock me?
DAVE: Because Surprise Surprise his brother-in- law is a very big muckety-muck in the Transit Workers Union
EMILY: ( i.e., "I get it." ) And if you read the paper, you'll know they're going through a protracted labor dispute at the MTA right now, and according to my PI, the management doesn't want to aggravate the situation by firing this guy. Especially since the police have concluded he was not at fault.
DAVE: And if you read the paper, you'll know they're going through a protracted labor dispute at the MTA right now, and according to my PI, the management doesn't want to aggravate the situation by firing this guy. Especially since the police have concluded he was not at fault.
LISA: This is making me sick.
DAVE: I know, but what it means, Lisa, is that we have a case.
LISA: We do?
DAVE: What it means, in fact, is that we have a very good case, because we can sue for what's called "Negligent Retention." Which means they should have known the guy was a bad risk and was irresponsible and they negligently retained him until he finally killed somebody.
EMILY: And you can prove that?
DAVE: Sure, because we can subpoena their Personnel records, which we already know contain damaging information, because my investigator got a look at them beforehand. Which you're not-supposed to do, but we did it anyway.
LISA: YOU'RE AWESOMEL
YOU'RE AWESOMEL: And that means.
EMILY: And that means.
DAVE: That means we're in great shape and I think we should go in there and sue their fuckin' asses off.
EMILY: But you wouldn't be our lawyer, right?
DAVE: No no. Oh no.
LISA: Why not?
DAVE EMILY: I'm not a personal injury It's not his area. litigator. I don't know enough about it. I would But you could recommend someone?
EMILY: But you could recommend someone?
DAVE: Sure. I know a guy who's very good. His name is Russel Deutsch. He's not a sleazebag. Very experienced. Let me give you his number.
EMILY: Dave, thank you so much.
LISA: Really. My God.
DAVE: But you gotta get that crazy cousin on board because she's gonna be your She's not gonna want to come to New York, I can tell you that right now.
EMILY: She's not gonna want to come to New York, I can tell you that right now.
DAVE: If you win she gets anywhere from three to five hundred thousand dollars. She's gonna come to New York.
LISA: What's with Monica and her cousin?
EMILY: Oh, Monica's father left some money to Abigail's kids and he made Monica the executor of the estate, because he didn't want Abigail and her idiot husband to get their hands on the money before the kids were grown up.
LISA: So that's who we're getting the money for?
EMILY: It's not who we're getting it for, it's who we're getting it from.
DEUTSCH: First thing we do is we file a summons and a complaint against the MTA. They get .twenty days to respond, and when they do we can make our Discovery requests: Accident reports, personnel records, et cetera. But you gotta realize it's gonna take some time. The law says you have to get a court date within a year. Usually it takes about six. Depending.
LISA: Six years!
DEUTSCH: Depending, yes.
EMILY: Now, I mentioned to Dave I have a friend who writes for the Metro section of the Yes: Now this, if it could really happen, this changes everything in our favor. If they think there's gonna be adverse publicity, especially in The New York Times, they're gonna want to settle right away, soon as possible, and as quietly as
DEUTSCH: Yes: Now this, if it could really happen, this changes everything in our favor. If they think there's gonna be adverse publicity, especially in The New York Times, they're gonna want to settle right away, soon as possible, and as quietly as
POSSIBLE: So they'd.make it a condition that
EMILY: So they'd.make it a condition that
DEUTSCH: It's usually done, you get the money but you can't talk about it. Nobody knows the So what good does that do?
LISA: So what good does that do?
DEUTSCH: You get the money. ( Pause ) is that bad? ( Pause ) I thought that's what we're all here for. ( Pause ) This is how our society punishes people for doing bad things.
LISA: By getting money from their employers' insurance. companies?
DEUTSCH: Yes. It's called Punitive Damages. Could we insist they fire the driver? As part of the settlement?
LISA: Could we insist they fire the driver? As part of the settlement?
DEUTSCH: Yes, sure, why not?
LISA: But is that something people do?
DEUTSCH: Sure. It's one of your conditions.
EMILY: And you think we're gonna win? They're gonna settle?
LISA: And you think we're gonna win? They're gonna settle?
DEUTSCH: Oh they're gonna settle.
LISA: This is Emily and Lisa take hands and squeeze.
JOAN: I want to talk to you.
LISA: What'd I do now?
JOAN: Hi. I'm Joan. It's nice to meet you.
EMILY: Nice to meet you too. Come on in.
JOAN: .I had a friend who used to live on this block, at 262.?
EMILY: Yeah, I don't know if you know her. Cheryl Rowan? She's a physiotherapist?
JOAN: Yeah, I don't know if you know her. Cheryl Rowan? She's a physiotherapist?
EMILY: No, I don't know her.
LISA: I think about a thousand people must.
JOAN: Lisa says you're in a play, Joan?
LISA: Lisa says you're in a play, Joan?
EMILY: Lisa says you're in a play, Joan?
JOAN: Oh Yeah.
LISA: You should go see it, it's really good.
JOAN: Well, the play is great, and it's a really nice cast..-.
LISA: She's just being modest. She's gonna win every award in New York.
JOAN: Oh all that stuff's a long way off.
EMILY: I don't go to the theater very much.
JOAN: Well, it's just nice, because you can work a long time in the theater and play really good parts without getting a lot of recognition. And even though you don't necessarily do it for that as your primary motive, it is very nice when people do notice something you've done.
EMILY: Uh huh.
JOAN: I was on a television show a few years ago, and I had been doing theater all my life, and suddenly all my relatives started calling me up to congratulate me because they thought I finally Made It. And it was really just this dumb show that paid the bills for a while.
LISA: That show was so stupid.
JOAN: It wasn't that bad.! Anyway: I realize this is horribly embarrassing for Lisa, but I really wanted to meet you, Emily, because you've frankly become such a big part of Lisa's life, and I don't want to be intrusive, but this whole court case seems to be suddenly dominating everything and I can't get Lisa to tell me anything about it
LISA: That's not true.!
JOAN: Well, I can't.! And I want you to know, Lisa, that I'm very, very proud of you for pursuing this the way you have.
LISA: Yeah, I do.
JOAN: I know you do. I know you do. But you can't not do your homework, and you can't throw away your scholarship because of it.
LISA: I'm not. My grades slipped a little. They'll get better. Anyone can do their homework. You just sit down and do it. I've been distracted. I'll stop.
JOAN: All right
LISA: We didn't need to have a big conference about it.
JOAN: ( EMBARRASSED )
EMILY: Don't apologize. If Lisa hasn't been keeping you apprised of what's been going on, I think she should. You should.
LISA: There's nothing to keep her apprised of., We're just waiting for them to schedule the Discovery conference.
JOAN: Now what is that?
LISA: Mom? It really doesn't matter.
EMILY: A Discovery conference is a meeting with the court where they sign an order. authorizing our lawyer to begin getting the personnel records, interviewing witnesses, talking to Monica's cousin.
JOAN: OK, now where does she fit in?
EMILY: She gets the money.
DEUTSCH: How would you describe the relationship overall? Did you talk on the phone a lot? Were there a lot of visits
ABIGAIL: I would say we talked on the phone a couple of times a month at least. Sometimes more than that.I would call her, she would call me.
DEUTSCH: And what were the nature of these Oh, family stuff, mostly. Her family, my And she would advise you about your family? That kind of thing?
DEUTSCH: And she would advise you about your family? That kind of thing?
ABIGAIL: Oh, I would say so, yes.
DEUTSCH: Would you have any phone records? Or
ABIGAIL: I have all my phone bills, if that's what you mean. I didn't record the actual No no
DEUTSCH: No no
ABIGAIL: ( PRODUCES BILLS )
DEUTSCH: OK, that's terrific. I see you came Well, I wanted to bring everything.
ABIGAIL: Well, I wanted to bring everything.
DEUTSCH: Now when they take your deposition you're gonna say the same thing you just told me. Talk about the relationship.
ABIGAIL: Uh huh?
DEUTSCH: Kind of advice she used to give you.
ABIGAIL: 142 INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT. DAY. 142 Emily, Lisa and Abigail sit over their lunch. Abigail is drinking a white wine.
OK.?: 142 INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT. DAY. 142 Emily, Lisa and Abigail sit over their lunch. Abigail is drinking a white wine.
ABIGAIL: Now, Emily, where did you find this lawyer?
EMILY: He was recommended by a friend.
ABIGAIL: I'm asking because my husband knows a real good New York lawyer, and I'm not entirely comfortable with someone that no one has ever heard of
EMILY: My friend's heard of him. He says he's very I'm sure he does. But I have a responsibility in this situation, and I would feel a whole lot more comfortable with somebody who didn't just drop in out of the clear blue sky.
ABIGAIL: I'm sure he does. But I have a responsibility in this situation, and I would feel a whole lot more comfortable with somebody who didn't just drop in out of the clear blue sky.
EMILY: He didn't drop in out of the clear blue sky. He was recommended by my friend. But even if we switched lawyers we'd still have to pay him. But it all comes out of the settlement, so it's really up to you.
ABIGAIL: No, if you all think he's good.
EMILY: I don't know whether he is or not. My friend thinks he is.
ABIGAIL: All right. Now Lisa, what is your involvement in all this? What's your angle?
LISA: I just wanted to.I was just there.
LISA: Oh my God, is that you?
EMILY: That's me.
LISA: And that's you and Monica obviously. Oh my God. Is that her daughter?
EMILY: Uh huh.
LISA: God. So how old was she when she died?
EMILY: God. I can't even imagine.
LISA: God. I can't even imagine.
EMILY: Neither could we. Emily sits down and starts sorting through pictures to put them in the box. Lisa sits down too.
LISA: You know Monica asked about her when she was dying?
EMILY: No. I didn't.
LISA: Yeah. I think she was confused. like, I think she thought I was her daughter for a minute. And then she was asking me to call her, like to tell her what happened: You know, like she didn't remember she was What do you mean? What did she say?
EMILY: What do you mean? What did she say?
LISA: She just asked if somebody could call her daughter. But then it got confusing because I said, "Sure, what's her name?" And she said her name was Lisa. And I said, "No, that's my name." Because it took me a minute I didn't realize we had the same Emily does not respond.
EMILY: ( VERY DRY )
LISA: I didn't mean she ws literally inhabiting my body. I don't believe in all that stuff at all.
EMILY: I don't give a fuck what you believe in.
LISA: Oh my God! Why are you so mad at me!?
EMILY: Because this is not an opera!
LISA: ( FLUSHING )
EMILY: You think I'm making this into a dramatic situation because I think it's dramatic?!?
LISA: You think I'm making this into a dramatic situation because I think it's dramatic?!?
EMILY: I think you're very young.
LISA: What does that have to do with anything? If anything I think it means I care more than someone who's older! Because this kind of thing has never happened to me before!
EMILY: No, it means you care more easily! There's a big difference! Except that it's not you it's happening to!
LISA: Yes it is! I know I'm not the one who was run over
EMILY: That's right, you weren't. And you're not the one who died of leukemia, and you're not the one who just died in an earthquake in Algeria! But you will be. Do you understand me? You will be. And it's not an opera and it's not dramatic
LISA: I'm well aware of that!
EMILY: And this first-blush phony deepness of yours is worth nothing.
LISA: Oh wow.
EMILY: Do you understand? It's not worth anything, because it'll be troweled over in a month or two. And then when you get older, and you don't have a big reaction every time a d gets run over, then, then we'll find out what kind of a person you are! But this is nothing! I'm sorry, but I didn't start this conversation and I don't play these
LISA: ( drawing herself up ) I am not
EMILY: And don't look so outraged! Because I'm not saying anything very outrageous! I'm telling you to knock it off! You have every right to falsify your own life, but you have no right to falsify anyone else's. It's what makes people into Nazis! And I'm sorry, but it's a little suspicious that you're making such a fuss about this when you didn't know her, and you're having troubles with your own mother
LISA: Oh my God!
EMILY: But this is nm life we're talking about, much more than it is yours! Because it's my real friend who got killed, who I'm never going to see again, really! Whom I have known since I was nineteen years old myself. OK? And I don't want that sucked into some kind of adolescent self- I'm not fucking dramatizing anything!
LISA: I'm not fucking dramatizing anything!
EMILY: ( not having it )
OK: I was there, and you weren't! And if I happen to express myself a little hyperbolically, Emily, that's just the way I talk! I can't help it if my mother is an actress! Why are you being so fucking OK. Um, you should leave.
LISA: I was there, and you weren't! And if I happen to express myself a little hyperbolically, Emily, that's just the way I talk! I can't help it if my mother is an actress! Why are you being so fucking OK. Um, you should leave.
EMILY: OK. Um, you should leave.
LISA: OK. Um, you should leave.
EMILY: OK. Um, you should leave.
LISA: Why? Because I called you strident?
EMILY: Yeah: Strident? You should leave. Thanks. I don't wanna be called strident and you're deliberately misunderstanding me!
LISA: No I'm not! You're insulting me enough as it is: You don't have to call me stupid Well I can't stop you doing this so I think you had better go.
EMILY: Well I can't stop you doing this so I think you had better go.
LISA: OK! I will.
EMILY: OK! Let me get my purse! Lisa grabs her purse and coat. Emily half-walks, half-drives her toward the door.
NOW!: OK! Let me get my purse! Lisa grabs her purse and coat. Emily half-walks, half-drives her toward the door.
LISA: OK! Let me get my purse! Lisa grabs her purse and coat. Emily half-walks, half-drives her toward the door.
EMILY: It means you're leaving. I don't know what else it means.
LISA: All I meant by saying you were strident was that you were being emphatic! I obviously misused the word!
EMILY: Look it up when you get home.
LISA: Jesus Christ. You're amazing.
EMILY: Yeah. Uh huh. I'm amazing.
LISA: ( bursts into tears ) Why are you doing this. .!
EMILY: Lisa, I'm not doing anything! I'm a human being! Monica was a human being! So was her daughter! And so is your mother!
LISA: I never said or thought you were.! And I really didn't mean to call you strident! I totally misused the word! I wasn't trying to insult you, Emily, I really wasn't! I feel so bad about what happened and I'm trying so hard to do something about it! And I don't understand why if I say something wrong you can't just give me a break! I didn't mean I thought her daughter took over my body. I'm not an idiot. It was just this feeling I had because she was holding onto my hand so hard before she died, and because we had the same first But I'm not trying to dramatize anything, Emily. I really know about that trend, and I really don't think I've been doing that.
EMILY: But I'm not trying to dramatize anything, Emily. I really know about that trend, and I really don't think I've been doing that.
LISA: But I'm not trying to dramatize anything, Emily. I really know about that trend, and I really don't think I've been doing that.
EMILY: OK. I believe you. And look up "strident."
LISA: I will. They kiss and make up, but it's still a little ugly.
JOAN: I've been in the theater my whole life and nothing like this has ever happened to INTERVIEWER ON TV( O.C. ) Now, any talk of the play becoming a film?
JOAN: Oh God. Joan buries her face in her hands. Lisa watches scowling.
JOAN: Lisa? Do you think Emily would like to come see the play? I thought you could both come and them maybe we could go out All right. Let me ask her.
LISA: All right. Let me ask her.
JOAN: Dig in everybody. They start eating.
LISA: I was thinking about spending next year with Dad.
JOAN: ( SHOCKED )
LISA: Yeah. You're all worried about my grades. They have really good public schools in Santa Monica, and if Iofficially lived with him, you wouldn't have to worry about my scholarship.
JOAN: Have you talked to him about this?
LISA: We've had some general discussions.
JOAN: ( TO CURTIS )
CURTIS: ( SURPRISED )
JOAN: Yeah. Do you want to move to LA too?
CURTIS: Well, just let me know if you do.
JOAN: Well, just let me know if you do.
LISA: Why are you being like this?
JOAN: Why am I being like what?
LISA: Why are you about to start crying?
JOAN: Because it's your intention to make me start crying!
LISA: No it's not
LISA: But why can't this even be mentioned without you taking it personally? I'm just introducing a possibility!
JOAN: Joan upsets everything on the table and starts to go. She comes back and upsets more things on the table.
OH!: Joan upsets everything on the table and starts to go. She comes back and upsets more things on the table.
JOAN: Here's a possibility that you can make your own fucking dinner! Here's a possibility LISA that you can do whatever you Jesus Christ! want to do, because I don't What is with you? even care anymore, you heartless little fuckin' bitch!
LISA: Fine! Keep it up! It really makes me want to stay here!
JOAN: You think you're so fucking perfect!? She breaks something else and walks out.
LISA: Good one.
CURTIS: Good one.
LISA: Shut up. Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 136
KLEIN: OK. Go ahead: Kirsten. Lionel: Put your drum away. Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers.
KIRSTEN: I think that teenagers should definitely rule the world, because teenagers aren't corrupted by adult life yet, and they're idealists and they care. And I know a lot of people feel that teenagers are really naive, which they are, many of them. But they still haven't had a chance to get burned out by the disappointments and the harsh realities of learning how to play the game. So yes, I would vote yes.
KLEIN: All right: Lisa?
LISA: I would tend to agree with all of that, except I do think that teenagers don't always necessarily think things through very carefully, and they don't have enough experience to know what the right thing to do is all the time. I also think they tend to adhere to ideologies really easily without having actually bothered to think them through for themselves.
LEWIS: Such as what?
LISA: Such as what? Such as, gee, I don't know: the Hitler Youth?
KLEIN: OK. Hitler Youth.
LISA: Or what about all these teenage suicide bombers? Not that I want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again, but assuming you don't think suicide bombing is a good thing, wouldn't you say that's an example of being idealistic without using your critical faculties?
LEWIS: OK, Angie?
ANGIE: Yeah, I don't want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again either, because I realize I'm completely outnumbered
ANTHONY: Not unlike the Palestinians themselves.
ANGIE: That's not really funny, Anthony. ANGIE ( to LISA ) KLEIN and I'm not even going to Segal: Cut the comedy. comment on the fact that you just compared a 19-year-old ANTHONY Palestinian to a member of I thought it was funny. the Hitler Youth, which I personally find so offensive LISA I don't even know where to â¢That's right! Because start Oh, it's not because they both like to kill they've been occupied and Jews. humiliated and bombed out of their homes for the last KLEIN fifty years? Hey! Hey! Lisa! Hey!
LEWIS LISA: Come on, guys. Yes! That's partly why ANGIE still a million Pale- If anyone's acting like stinians who don't blow Nazis it's the Israeli up children on busses government! because they're so OK, OK! Monica?
LEWIS: OK, OK! Monica?
MONICA: Well, I don't know if this is good or bad, but speaking of ideology, it's interesting that the suicide bombers just for example care enough about what they believe in to sacrifice their lives for it.
WHEREAS: 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 138
ANGIE: Yes. Yes!
LISA: I think it's fine if you want to sacrifice your life for what you believe in. I actually think that's really noble. It's a little different when you're willing to sacrifice someone else's life, you know? I personally don't think that's such a big ideological achievement!
ANGIE: Um, even if there's no other way to get you out of my country?
LEWIS LISA: Raise your hands! They haven't tried any ANGIE like killing civilians Yes they have! They're is their last resort! trying it right now! It's their first resort! Because it's easy and they like it!
LISA: Yes! There are bad people in the world! I think they liked blowing up the World Trade Center! They kill their own sisters when they get raped! It's called barbarism!
MONICA LISA: Who kills their own sisters? It's practically all people LIONEL If they didn't like it they You guys are not the only wouldn't do it! Period! ones in this class!
LEWIS: If you ladies can't make your points without yelling or interrupting each other or raising your hands, I'd say it was a pretty good argument for "No."
LISA: Why, adults don't yell and interrupt each
LEWIS: Let's try to put this in a broader perspective. The question was not actually who's to blame in the Arab Israeli conflict
LISA: Let's try to put this in a broader perspective. The question was not actually who's to blame in the Arab Israeli conflict
LEWIS: Let's try to put this in a broader perspective. The question was not actually who's to blame in the Arab Israeli conflict
ANGIE: The Israelis.
LISA: OK, you're a moron.
LEWIS: ( he's had enough ) You're not even Jewish, Lisa! The next Goddamn person who LISA raising their hand is. I'm fuckin' half-Jewish, and outta this class! who cares what I am? I'm anti- murder, not pro-Israel. LEWIS
ANGIE KLEIN: You're not even Jewish, Lisa! The next Goddamn person who LISA raising their hand is. I'm fuckin' half-Jewish, and outta this class! who cares what I am? I'm anti- murder, not pro-Israel. LEWIS
LISA: Fine. Thank you. Lisa passes the blackboard, grabs some chalk and checks "NO. "
ANGIE LEWIS: No I didn't. Lisa, GO! Lisa leaves. Lewis turns to the class.
LEWIS: An O.C. burst of APPLAUSE takes us to
RAMON: That's the best show yet! Every time it's a better performance.
JOAN: God, thank you! Hi, Emily, thanks so much for coming.
EMILY: Oh, thank you for the tickets. Pause. Joan waits for Emily or Lisa to say something nice.
JOAN: Shall we go?
LISA: and I guess I lost my cool a little, but I just love it'when people start comparing the Israelis to Nazis.
JOAN: But who is running these discussions.?
RAMON: Well, but Lisa, you have to remember, it's always easy for the dominant side to be content with the status quo.
JOAN: - EMILY
RAMON: I mean the oppressor is always in favor of law and order because it's his law and his order. He uses violence to maintain his position and calls it the rule of law. But when the person underfoot uses violence to change his status he's called a criminal and a terrorist, and the violence of the State is called upon to put him down, and once again it's called the rule of law. In
COLOMBIA: I see. And what would you like them to do? "They" meaning
EMILY: I see. And what would you like them to do? "They" meaning
RAMON: "They" meaning
EMILY: The Jew oppressors. What would you like them to do? I didn't use that expression. EMILY But since you ask - No, you didn't. ( i.e. "You didn't have to." )
RAMON: I didn't use that expression. EMILY But since you ask - No, you didn't. ( i.e. "You didn't have to." )
LISA: Um, I just spent the whole day arguing about this: I didn't really mean to bring it up again.
EMILY: ( turning on her ) Don't handle me.
LISA: I'm not handling you.
JOAN: ( GENERALLY )
RAMON LISA: And I think it's ironic in Don't bother, Mom. the extreme that the victims of Nazis find it essential EMILY find it essential to If the Israelis were like use the Nazi tactics to Nazis there wouldn't be sustain their occupation. any Arabs left, and I'm ( agreeing with Emily ) That's what I think! Emily tries to unhook her purse from the back of her chair.
LISA: ( agreeing with Emily ) That's what I think! Emily tries to unhook her purse from the back of her chair.
JOAN: That seems excessive, Emily, come on
RAMON: That's the response. That's the Jewish It's the what?
EMILY: It's the what?
RAMON: It's the Jewish response. You don't like what I am saying or what I do, so you
EMILY: That's my Jewish response. Emily throws her drink in his face and walks away.
JOAN: Oh my God.!
RAMON: It's all right.( Wiping off his face ) That's all right. It's a perfect little .encapsule.It's the Jewish response. A horrible silence as they watch Ramon clean his shirt.
LISA: Sorry about all that tonight.
JOAN: Yeah. Your friend is a delight.
LISA: She's a really passionate person. She really cares about things.
JOAN: She's rude, Lisa. Ramon was my guest, not hers. And-so.was she, as a matter of fact
LISA: So what? Why is it so JOAN important that people be No I'm not ar I'm polite all the time? Why not arguing about this with is that the big priority? you! I'm not interested in an exchange of ideas. As it happens Ramon said a few things I wasn't too crazy about either, so I guess that's the end of that.
LISA: Oh is that supposed to be Emily's fault I don't want to talk to you right now. Please go away.
JOAN: I don't want to talk to you right now. Please go away.
RAMON: ( on the phone ) Joan, I won't defend myself. All what I meant was, that was the typical response you will get from someone who will take that position that that woman was taking. But if you like to break up with me because I used the wrong adjective, what I'm going to do? I'm not going to beg you.
LISA: Well.? How's that anti-Semitic piece of shit Ramon?-
JOAN: Oh God, I don't know. The PHONE RINGS. Lisa picks up.
LISA: ( ON PHONE )
KARL: ( ON PHONE )
LISA: Hi, Dad, how are you? I'm really looking forward to our horseback riding trip.
KARL: Yeah. That's why I'm calling. I don't think it's going to happen.
LISA: Really? What's the matter?
KARL: Nothing's the matter. Nobody seems to really want to go, and I don't really feel like spending three thousand bucks on something nobody has the slightest interest in. So I think it's obviously better for everyone if we just cancel.
LISA: I never said I didn't want to go.
KARL: Well, I can't seem to get a straight answer about what anybody wants to eat, um, Annette is giving me a hard time about her schedule, I talk to Curtis and all I get are monosyllables, so
LISA: I think-he's really looking forward to it
KARL: Uh huh? Well, you know, that hasn't really been my impression. So, uh.I also think it would be good to shelve the idea of your coming out here next year.
LISA: We don't detest each other
KARL: OK, well, it doesn't really strike me as something you're that serious about anyway, so what do you say we just table it for the time being?
LISA: OK. So tell Curtis, uh, that New Mexico's off.Ummm, and I will talk to you, ummm, He hangs up. LISA hangs up too.
KARL: OK. So tell Curtis, uh, that New Mexico's off.Ummm, and I will talk to you, ummm, He hangs up. LISA hangs up too.
LISA: He hangs up. LISA hangs up too.
KARL: He hangs up. LISA hangs up too.
JOAN: What's wrong?
LISA: Dad's cancelling the trip.
JOAN: What? Why?
LISA: He's says nobody wants to go and he doesn't want to spend the money.
JOAN: Did you say you didn't want to go?
LISA: No, I know there was some problem with Annette about arranging for food because I don't eat dead animals, but.I didn't think it was.going to wreck the whole trip.
JOAN: Oh boy.
LISA: I thought you said it sounded like it was going to be a disaster. Personally I'm relieved. I'm not moving out there, either, by the way, obviously. Which is fine too.
LISA: Thank you for letting me come up. I don't know who else to talk to. She's talking to MR AARON, who looks very uncomfortable.
MR AARON: That's all right.
LISA: You've always been very sympathetic to my craziness, and I may not show it all the time, but I actually really appreciate it.
MR AARON: It's no problem, Lisa. What's been going I just need to talk to somebody who doesn't completely misunderstand who Iam. Or not even who I am, but what's going on inside me, or all around me. Sound confused enough? Anyway, for whatever reason, I always felt like we understood each other on some level, even though I'm like a mass of conflicting impulses and you're basically the most grown-up, rational man I Well.I doubt that's actually true but thank you.
LISA: I just need to talk to somebody who doesn't completely misunderstand who Iam. Or not even who I am, but what's going on inside me, or all around me. Sound confused enough?

MR AARON: Well.I doubt that's actually true but thank you.
LISA: You seem pretty fuckin' rational to me. Like that seems to be your leading feature. I mean you obviously have a lot of pretty deep feelings.So when you're rational - just to finish my thought it's like this really interesting way of governing And you don't have to get all uncomfortable again: I'm not talking about what you think I'm talking about, because I know that subject is-off-limits. I'm talking about your soul, I guess, and how you feel you have to keep it in check all the time by being sensible. Do you know what I'm saying at all?
MR AARON: Well.We all have feelings, Lisa. I happen to believe that who you are comes out of how you deal with those feelings. Somebody makes you mad, you don't just pick up a gun and shoot them.Or if you do, that says something about who you are, and how you've been raised.
LISA: Well, I don't want to disillusion you, but we happen to be living in a world where that is what people do. More often than That's not true, Lisa. I think it's very sad that you see it that way. There's eight billion people alive in the world and you think they don't all want to kill someone once in a while? But they don't. Most of them. Or they see some person they ( Pause ) I think most people do try to be civilized by some standard. Even if it's a standard you and I might not agree with.
MR AARON: That's not true, Lisa. I think it's very sad that you see it that way. There's eight billion people alive in the world and you think they don't all want to kill someone once in a while? But they don't. Most of them. Or they see some person they ( Pause ) I think most people do try to be civilized by some standard. Even if it's a standard you and I might not agree with.
LISA: No, I get it. That's actually the most hopeful thing anybody's said to me for a long time. I don't know why I take such a dire view of things, I really don't. She removes her jacket. She's wearing a small clingy T-shirt.
MR AARON: Do you allow smoking in your apartment?
LISA: Do you allow smoking in your apartment?
MR AARON: You can smoke. She gets her cigarettes out and lights one. He gets up and brings her an ashtray. They meet at the sofa and sit.
LISA: I like your apartment.
MR AARON: Thank you. She blows some smoke out and waves it away.
LISA: MR AARON
MR AARON: That's all right.
LISA: This is terrible.
MR AARON: What is? What's terrible?
LISA: I just like you so much.( Smooths her ash on the ashtray. ) Sorry. What a moron.
MR AARON: ( taking her hand ) Hey. Lisa. I'm your friend. And that's not gonna change. That's not gonna change.
LISA: Thanks. Thank you. She kisses his hand a couple of times.
MR AARON: Please just let me for a second. I like you so much. I like you so, so much. She kisses his hand more elaborately. He lets this go on. she slides her hand onto his leg.
LISA: Please just let me for a second. I like you so much. I like you so, so much. She kisses his hand more elaborately. He lets this go on. she slides her hand onto his leg.
MR AARON: OK, look.
LISA: Don't stop me yet, OK? They kiss some more. She bends down to unzip his fly.
MR AARON: Please don't do that.
LISA: Just let me for one second. She bends her head over his lap. He lets her.
MR AARON: Are you all right?
LISA: Nothing. It's OK.
LISA: Don't stop. It's OK.
MR AARON: Are you all right?
LISA: Yes, yes, you don't have to keep asking me I think we should stop.
MR AARON: I think we should stop.
LISA: No, keep going.! She keeps pushing against him.
LISA: All I can say is I better get a pretty fuckin' good grade in geometry this year. ( Pause ) Lighten up! I'm kidding.
MR AARON: Sorry. I really didn't expect anything like this to happen. I'm really not sure how to Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I totally initiated the whole thing.
LISA: Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I totally initiated the whole thing.
DEUTSCH: Well, they want to settle.
DEUTSCH: I have a meeting with their lawyer this afternoon, and they want to discuss a settlement. So we should get Abigail on the phone and talk about what-we're gonna do.
EMILY: Lisa gets tears in her eyes and smiles, embarrassed.
LISA: That's OK.
EMILY: That's OK.
ABIGAIL: Mr Deutsch? Mr
DEUTSCH ROB: I'm right here. I just had the thought
QUESTIONS: Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 150
ROB: Mr Deutsch, I had the thought, if they're willing to settle so quickly, maybe we're better off waiting a little bit, maybe rattling the sabre a little bit more.
ABIGAIL: Yes, if they're so quick to agree to a settlement on this basis
DEUTSCH: What you gotta realize What you gotta
REALLY: Abigail, Russel doesn't think Sorry, go No, no.
EMILY: Abigail, Russel doesn't think Sorry, go No, no.
DEUTSCH: No, no.
EMILY: My friend had a lot of trouble getting the one story placed in the paper as it is
DEUTSCH: .Could I interject?
ABIGAIL: But if they responded so strongly based on one story.
ROB: Maybe we're cuttin' our own throats here.
DEUTSCH: They are responding to the story in the .That's just common sense.
ABIGAIL: .That's just common sense.
DEUTSCH: But what you gotta understand is they're offering to settle now because they want to get the story out of the paper.
EMILY LISA: That's why Russel thinks Besides, the main point is not to jack up the price.
ABIGAIL: I'm sorry
ROB: We didn't hear that last. Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 150A
DEUTSCH: ( to EMILY and LISA ) Ladies, let me just Abigail. Rob.
ABIGAIL: What other terms would there be?
ROB: What do you mean, like some kind of a fund?
DEUTSCH: A what?
ROB: Some kind of fund? For the kids?
DEUTSCH: I don't understand what you mean by a ( to ABIGAIL ) Mr. Deutsch? Do you mean What does he mean, "besides some kind of trust fund, the damages?" a fund that would be set up by the bus company for EMILY our kids? For tax purposes? What fuckin' fund?
ROB ABIGAIL: ( to ABIGAIL ) Mr. Deutsch? Do you mean What does he mean, "besides some kind of trust fund, the damages?" a fund that would be set up by the bus company for EMILY our kids? For tax purposes? What fuckin' fund?
LISA: These people are retarded.
ABIGAIL: Because I have to tell you we have just lived through that nightmare with Monica and our children, and it was not a pleasant experience. We just want a clean, straight damages is fine. A regular payment. We'll pay the taxes on it. At least we'll have something in our hand.
DEUSTCH: I don't really know what kind of fund you're talking about.
LISA: We're not talking about Hi, this is Lisa? We're ABIGAIL talking We're talking Hello, Lisa. about Hello?
ABIGAIL: We're still here.
LISA: We're talking about the driver, getting the driver fired
ABIGAIL: Oh, yes
LISA: as part of the conditions.
EMILY: Yes, Abigail, it's very important to us that the company know that's an absolute pre-condition to making any kind of settlement whatsoever.
ABIGAIL: Oh yes. Absolutely. If you think he's at
FAULT: Just as long as they don't think they can buy us off just by gettin' rid of this guy. You see what I mean?
ROB: Just as long as they don't think they can buy us off just by gettin' rid of this guy. You see what I mean?
DEUTSCH: What we're most concerned about here is the Yes, we're getting that, Rob.
ROB: What we're most concerned about here is the Yes, we're getting that, Rob.
EMILY: Yes, we're getting that, Rob.
ROB: But you see what I mean?
DEUTSCH: Yes Rob? Yes I do.
ROB: I just want to go on record as saying I think this whole meeting is premature.
ABIGAIL: Absolutely. We're not lawyers
DEUTSCH: Abigail? Rob? I just wanna make something clear. One conversation does not commit you to anything.
JOAN: Lisa, I'm really proud of you!
LISA: Thank you.
JOAN: Really, really proud.!
LISA: Thank you. Pause. Joan gets to her feet and starts tidying up.
JOAN: No. This house is really beginning to get to me. And I'm a little confused what to do about Ramon. I mean, you were there: What do you think?
LISA: Uh, gee, Mom maybe you should really think about it some more. Because it would probably hurt Ramon's feelings if you broke up with him and I think you better think about it before you do something like that to him.
JOAN: I know I'm supposed to understand what you're doing right now, but if there's some kind of hidden message here I'm not getting No shit. You're on your own, Mom.
LISA: No shit. You're on your own, Mom.
JOAN: Thanks a lot.
LISA: You're welcome. The PHONE RINGS. Joan picks it up.
JOAN: ( INTO PHONE )
LISA: What's the matter?
JOAN: ( LISTENING )
LISA: What? Is he gonna be
JOAN: CURTIS appears. They both watch Joan at the phone. Instead of dissolving, Joan listens, straightens up and calms down as the person on the phone talks.
LISA: OK, I'm really not trying to be funny, but isn't this a Jewish funeral home?
JOAN: I guess they do both. They notice a few too many good-looking women crying a little too hard. Lisa and Joan look at each other. RODRIGO, a handsome slender kid of 20, comes up to Joan. His accent is British, with a slight Colombian cadence.
RODRIGO: Excuse me. Joan?
JOAN: Yes. You must be Rodrigo. Oh my God, oh I'm so sorry. She impulsively embraces him.
RODRIGO: I want to tell you, Joan, my Dad talked about you all the time.
JOAN: He did?
RODRIGO: Yes. The night he met you, he called me in England and woke me to tell me about it, he was so excited. I never heard him talk about anyone like that since my mother I don't know if this is appropriate.
JOAN: I don't know if this is appropriate.
RODRIGO: I don't know if this is appropriate.
JOAN: No it's OK.!
RODRIGO: .but he went out a lot. Do you know the last time I spoke to him he told me from the moment he met you he knew he wanted to marry you, because for the first time since he lost my mother, he finally met a woman he could really connect with.
JOAN: ( at a total loss ) Well he was a very sweet man. And I know he loved you and your brother very much.
RODRIGO: ( GETTING TEARFUL )
JOAN: Thanks for coming with me today. I really appreciate it.
LISA: Oh, you're welcome.
JOAN: I don't want to be macabre, but Ramon and I were supposed to go to hear The Tales of Hoffman the week after next and I still have the tickets. Would you be interested in going? Or should I give them away?
LISA: Um, I'll go.
JOAN: OK. It's Monday night. We can dress up.
LISA: What did you make of that?
JOAN: What did you make of that?
LISA: ( STILL TYPING )
JOAN: Well.I think it's pretty unfortunate that you think that. Because I feel like you and I used to relate to each other really well.
LISA: I'm not trying to hurt your feelings. It's just a general observation.
JOAN: OK.Hey, could I get a hug?
LISA: Lisa rises and hugs Joan. It's not a good hug.
JOAN: I just feel totally at sea. They break apart.
MR AARON: I've thought about this a great deal, and I'm going to come forward.
LISA: Oh brother.
MR AARON: What does that mean?
LISA: "You're gonna come forward." And do what? You didn't kill anybody.
MR AARON: Well, that's what I'm comfortable doing.
LISA: Suit yourself. I'll deny everything and you're gonna look like a total psycho. And then my Mom'11 have you arrested, and then spend the rest of her life feeling bad about it. So why don't we just skip the whole thing and forget about it?
MR AARON: I'm not sure I know how to do that.
LISA: You'll learn.
LISA: Good news!
JOAN: OK. What do you want to do?
LISA: What do you mean? Aren't JOAN you going to tell me. It's your body. It's your what to do? ( half- baby. What do you want to do? laughing ) Baby. .?
JOAN: Yes! Now who is the father?
LISA: It could be a lot of people. Joan looks at her. Lisa haltingly holds her ground. Joan takes a sympathetic step toward her. Lisa shrinks back. Joan stops. Her expression hardens.
JOAN: 165 CONTINUED: 165
LISA: I'm never gonna tell you, Mom! It's against my principles! Such as they are.
JOAN: ( ON "SUCH" )
NURSE: Mrs. Cohen? TRACKING Joan as she gets up and follows the Nurse down a .she's still a little woozy from the Joan goes into the recovery room. Lisa is on the table in a crumpled paper robe, looking like a small crumpled piece of paper herself. Joan sits down.
LISA: Hi honey.
JOAN: Hi honey.
LISA: I'm sorry, Mom.
JOAN: Let's talk about it later.
DEUTSCH: I'm very pleased to be able to inform you all that I had a long meeting with the lawyer for the bus company, and they've agreed to settle out of court for three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
DEUTSCH: I'm assuming this is agreeable to
EVERYBODY: ABIGAIL ROB
ABIGAIL ROB: Yes, fantastic That is fantastic!
ROB: Mr Deutsch.?
DEUTSCH: Now, I know there was a concern after our last call that we were jumping the gun a little bit
ROB: That's OK
ABIGAIL: We're only
EMILY: Abigail? Rob? If we could just listen to what Russel has to say, and then talk about it once he's told us the whole story and given us his recommendation.
ROB: Yes. Sorry. Fire away.
DEUTSCH: I was gonna say I know there was a concern after our last call that we were jumping the gun a little bit
ROB: That's OK
ABIGAIL: We were just
EMILY: Would you let him talk please?!
DEUTSCH: It's OK.
ABIGAIL: We're sorry.
DEUTSCH: I want to tell you I think it's a very good I think they're very anxious to settle, but I also do think that at this moment they're under the maximum amount of pressure we can really bring to bear, and I don't believe they're gonna come up any higher
ABIGAIL: Hey. Three hundred and fifty thousand OK, now let me just
ROB: OK, now let me just
ABIGAIL: .that's nothin' to sneeze at.
ROB ABIGAIL: I just want to introduce Now, 1 think Can the thought you all hear me?
ABIGAIL: Yeow! Was that everybody? OK:
LISA: What about
ABIGAIL: Emily? What do you think?
EMILY: I think it sounds like we should do it. But I'd like to discuss some of the
ABIGAIL: ( ON "BUT" )
ROB: Unless you think there's something to be gained from holding out for more.
DEUTSCH: I think it would be a big mistake.
ABIGAIL: Robbie, what do you think?
ROB: 167 CONTINUED: ( 3 ) 167
ABIGAIL: 167 CONTINUED: ( 3 ) 167
DEUTSCH: OK. Now the only down side to this as it stands and the reason I asked Emily and Lisa to be here is because I know this may be a serious wrinkle for you all is that the bus company will absolutely not discuss the removal of the driver.
LISA: What do you mean?
ROB: The driver?
LISA EMILY: Then forget it. Tell them to What do you mean they forget it. won't discuss the removal
DEUTSCH: Please. Ladies. Let me ROB finish what I'm saying. Whoa hello!
ABIGAIL: It's just a blast in our ears.
EMILY: ( TO LISA )
LISA: Finish what? Forget it!
DEUTSCH: ( TO EMILY )
LISA: What does giving us three hundred thousand dollars mean?
DEUTSCH: Settling out of court does not imply an admission of guilt. It simply does not carry the same stigma. On top of that you may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right
LISA: Yeah, we know all about that! Just tell them to forget it.'
DEUTSCH: I know that's your reaction.
LISA: It's the only reason we're here.
ROB: Can I jump in here? Russel?
DEUTSCH: ( TO LISA )
ROB ABIGAIL: Hello? Are you still with us? Please!
LISA: It's Emily's decision.
EMILY: It's not?
DEUTSCH: It's not?
ROB: It's not?
LISA: It's not?
ABIGAIL: They're not listening, Robbie.
DEUTSCH: It's Abigail's decision because she's the next of kin.
LISA: But she didn't even know about it!
EMILY: That doesn't matter.
ABIGAIL: Could we get back in this conversation Yes. I'm sorry. Obviously there's some very strong emotions going either way on this
DEUTSCH: Yes. I'm sorry. Obviously there's some very strong emotions going either way on this
ABIGAIL: Listen, Emily? I don't know what you're thinking, but Rob and I are thinking we should take Russel's recommendation while we can. Because if they won't fire the guy, they're not gonna fire him. And six months or a year from now we're gonna
ROB: we're gonna be in a situation where we're beggin' them for half this much, which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as now, and they're still not gonna fire this guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do you see what I mean?
ABIGAIL: we're gonna be in a situation where we're beggin' them for half this much, which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as now, and they're still not gonna fire this guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do you see what I mean?
LISA: The entire point of the lawsuit was to get the guy fired so he doesn't kill somebody else !
DEUTSCH: Lemme just clarify
LISA: it was not to get you three hundred and fifty thousand dollars you didn't know you were entitled to, for somebody you didn't even like. !
ABIGAIL: This is a distortion
LISA: And the only reason you're getting the money at all is because I started this whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry for swearing, but you should be willing to trade in all the money for getting this guy off the street
EMILY: For getting him, Abigail!
ABIGAIL: Well I'm sorry, but I have a responsibility to Monica and I take that responsibility very seriously. You are talking about an offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we don't do something about it right now.
LISA: None of that matters
ABIGAIL: Unless I'm wrong about that. Just what is your interest in this?
LISA: Because I'm the one who killed her! I'm the one who killed her! But at least I know I did it, and that guy has no idea! And he's wandering around blaming everybody else and all I want is for somebody to let him know that what he did was wrong! And if they don't fire him and all you want is the money and the police won't do anything, how is he gonna know he's wrong? You can't take the deal, Abigail! It wasn't so you could get any money, it was because we wanted to get him fired! It doesn't matter about the money! You wouldn't have gotten it before!
ABIGAIL: Well it may not matter to you, but where I come from three hundred and fifty thousand dollars is an awful lot of money, and to my mind is a positive result of all this tragedy and not just negative. Not just getting someone fired for one mistake, no matter how bad it was
LISA: Oh SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS! She knocks the speaker phone off the desk and runs to the door in floods of tears.
LISA: You sleazy fucking lawyer! And you're a moralistic cunt! She runs out.
BONNIE: Hey, Lisa. What's Up?
MR AARON: No. I didn't know that.
LISA: Yeah, it cost four hundred dollars.
BONNIE: Um, should I.
MR AARON: No, no, don't go anywhere.
LISA: Yeah, don't go anywhere. Bonnie doesn't know what to make of this. Mr Aaron looks steadily at Lisa.
MR AARON: Do you want to tell us about it?
LISA: Yeah. I do.
MR AARON: OK. -Go ahead.
LISA: She doesn't speak. Pause.
BONNIE: Do your parents know about this, Lisa?
LISA: Have you told the father, honey?
BONNIE: Have you told the father, honey?
LISA: No.There's a couple of people it could I think you better tell them. Whoever they No.No.Never mind .I'm sure he's sorry anyway, whichever one he is.
MR AARON: I think you better tell them. Whoever they No.No.Never mind .I'm sure he's sorry anyway, whichever one he is.
LISA: No.No.Never mind .I'm sure he's sorry anyway, whichever one he is.
MR AARON: I don't see what difference that makes, if he's sorry. And I think whoever it is should know about this.
LISA: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought this up. Please don't tell anyone.
BONNIE: We're not gonna tell anyone. But you're gonna have to tell whoever it could be
LISA: ( On have to" ) That's OK. I gotta go. Thanks for listening. It's It doesn't matter about the father, because the whole thing was my fault. I'm sorry.! She shakes her head and runs away.
BONNIE: What was that.?
CURTIS: Mom's looking for you.
LISA: What for?
CURTIS: She thinks you're going out with her Where are we going?
LISA: Where are we going?
CURTIS: I don't know. Lisa heads for her room. Joan appears, half-dressed.
JOAN: Lisa? Honey? Did you forget we're going to the opera?
LISA: I didn't-remind you because I didn't want to nag you.
JOAN: I didn't-remind you because I didn't want to nag you.
LISA: It's OK.
JOAN: Don't get run over. A cab rattles by. Lisa looks down the street. A BUS is Wait. I want to see if that's him.
LISA: Wait. I want to see if that's him.
JOAN: They wait. The bus gets closer, heading straight toward them and stops at the bus stop. Lisa grabs her mother's arm.
LISA: It is him. Mom, that's the one. Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at them and drives past with a short wave. Joan looks at Lisa. She looks like she's about to throw up.
JOAN: Come on. We're gonna miss the curtain.
JOAN: Well, so far it's not the greatest opera I ever heard.
LISA: What do you mean? It's OK. The end-of-intermission chimes sound. People start going in. Joan turns and goes in too. Lisa keeps smoking.
THE END: Writers : Kenneth Lonergan
