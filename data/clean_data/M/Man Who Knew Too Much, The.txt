DRAYTON: And what about your wife? Did she go outside just to get some fresh air.
BEN: Tell me what you want. I'll do All right you'll see your boy in good time.
DRAYTON: All right you'll see your boy in good time.
BEN: Hank! Hank McKenna! Hank! Where are you? Hank! Hank!
HANK: Daddy! Daddy, I'm here! Dad -
JO: .And Ben is in there now, watching the both of them!
J0: He sent me out to call you so we could do something before they get I see, Mrs. McKenna and you believe your son is somewhere in the chapel?
WOBURN: I see, Mrs. McKenna and you believe your son is somewhere in the chapel?
JO: I don't know, I don't know where he is.but at least these people will know the Draytons. If you'd only send somebody to get them.
WOBURN: I'm afraid it isn't quite as easy as all that.
J0: Mr. Woburn, there isn't any time! My husband is sitting in that chapel waiting for me to bring some help. Can't I talk with Mr. Buchanan? He said when we needed him, to call.
WOBURN: I'm awfully sorry, but I simply can't get hold of him just now. He's gone to a rather important diplomatic affair at the Albert Hall.
JO: Well call him there, please! Call
WOBURN: He's on his way. I don't know quite
JO: ( Filter ) Then can't you do anything right away before we lose the Draytons?
WOBURN: I assure you, I'll do all I cant as soon as I can.
JO: We don't have days to do this. It's a matter of minutes. Can't you send the police. Or do I have to go to the Albert Hall myself.
WOBURN: ( Efficiently ) That won't be necessary. I'll see that the chapel is put under immediate observation. By the time you get back a police car should be there. Please return to your husband, tell him to come straight out of the chapel, and let the police take over.
WOBURN: Woburn, Special Branch, hold on. I must ring off now, Mrs. McKenna. Please believe me, I'll have everything laid on.
JO: There's nobody there!

JO: It couldn't.it couldn't have been more than five minutes ago!
PATTERSON: ( Interrupting ) Let's take a look.
JO: I told Mr. Woburn he had to hurry.
JO: I tried that. It's looked, Let's force it open.
PATTERSON: I'm sorry, madam, we can't break in. Requires a search warrant. It's the law, you see.
JO: Couldn't you get one?
PATTERSON: It all takes time. We'll have a look round, shall we? Matthews, you take the other end.
MATTHEWS: All right.
MATTHEWS: There's no one there, sir.
PATTERSON: Are you quite certain the place was full of people only a few minutes Of course I'm certain. I was there myself, sitting next to my husband. He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.
JO: Of course I'm certain. I was there myself, sitting next to my husband. He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.
J0: It's much too complicated to explain.
PATTERSON: We'll just have to sit tight and wait for the car to arrive from the Yard.
PATTERSON: So far as we can make out, sir, there's no sign of life. I see, very good,
PATTERSON: Walden, you'll stay here, till the car arrives from the Yard.
WALDEN: That's all, Matthews.
PATTERSON: That's all, Matthews.
JO: You're not leaving?
PATTERSO: ( Politely ) Orders, madam. Can we give you lift
JO: Yes, I want to go to Albert Hall.

RIEN: You have a very nice little boy, madame.
J0: Where Is he? Where is he? Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 124.

WOBURN: Mr. Prime Minister, this is the lady
PRIME MINISTER: My dear lady, I shall be for ever in your debt.
WOBURN: And this is her husband A pleasure, my dear sir. I trust you will permit me to wait upon you tomorrow and to express the depth of my gratitude.
PRIME MINISTER: A pleasure, my dear sir. I trust you will permit me to wait upon you tomorrow and to express the depth of my gratitude.
JO: ( Weakly ) It wasn't it wasn't
PRIME MINISTER: ( Gallantly ) Oh but it was, my dear lady.
WOBURN: I think Mr. Buchanan would like to talk to you.
JO: ( Wildly ) Where's our boy? Where's Hank?
BUCHANAN: ( quietly ) We can talk if you'll come in here.
BUCHANAN: ( Coldly ) So you both know the time and place all along.
BEN: ( Roughly ) Don't be a fool.
BUCHANAN: An odd coincidence both of you turning up here.
BEN: ( Coldly ) Too bad you didn't contact your assistant. He sent us both here.
BUCHANAN: ( Quickly ) I beg your pardon.
BEN: You see, we finally needed that help you offered. We still need it.
JO: ( Urgently ) Yes, Mr. Buchanan. We still need it.
DETECTIVE: Buchanan nods to him to speak.
DETECTIVE: We've questioned the woman. Said she bought a ticket that happened to place her in the same box with the man that did the shooting. Doesn't know anything but if she does, she's not talking.
BUCHANAN: I'll see her later.
DETECTIVE: Very good, sir. Please tell me everything, now. There's still plenty of room for hope, Mrs. McKenna.
BUCHANAN: ( Gently ) Please tell me everything, now. ( go turns to Jo ) There's still plenty of room for hope, Mrs. McKenna.
FOOTMAN: His Excellency will see you now.
AMBASSADOR: Yes.yes.I see. Well if the woman won't talk, she won't talk and that's that, I suppose. All right.
DRAYTON: ( Easily ) Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain to you something very unusual has happened. I must also have the money to pay our French marksman.
AMBASSADOR: ( Almost casually ) Wouldn't it be superfluous, considering that he's dead?
AMBASSADOR: His aim wasn't quite as good as you led me to expect. The target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm. Worse than useless.
AMBASSADOR: Then your French friend panicked, and made a fatal crash landing on the floor of the Albert Hall.
DRAYTON: ( Blustering weakly ) I don't see how you can hold me responsible. He was most warmly recommended by our people in
AMBASSADOR: I'm glad you're able to treat the matter so lightly. I am holding a reception here this evening. In a few minutes, I have to welcome our Prime Minister as my guest of honor when I hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend. That amuses you, no I don't know what to say .
DRAYTON: ( Feebly ) I don't know what to say .
AMBASSADOR: ( Brutally ) No. But I do. You've muddled everything from the start. Kidnapping that child in Marrakesh.Don't you realize that Americans dislike having their children kidnapped?
DRAYTON: ( Trying to keep his How else could I make sure the American would hold his tongue?
AMBASSADOR: ( Ignoring this ) And then, to crown it all, you get cold feet and come running along here to hide and bring the child with you: Don't you see what you've done to the diplomatic status of this Embassy?
DRAYTON: ( Weakly ) I didn't think.I only thought.
AMBASSADOR: ( Staccato ) How are you going to get the child out of here, eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?
DRAYTON: ( Struggling for There's no difficulty about that, surely? The car
AMBASSADOR: ( Interrupting ) With plain-clothes detectives planted right round this building? ( Wryly ) You English intellectuals will be the death of us all.
DRAYTON: ( Desperate ) I'll think of some method. Just give me time..
AMBASSADOR: ( He snorts
AMBASSADOR: I want the child removed from this Embassy, and removed in such a way that he won't be able to say any more where he has been tonight.
MRS. DRAYTON: Oh, no! Right, I'll see to it..
DRAYTON: Right, I'll see to it..
AMBASSADOR: Come in.
BUTLER: Your Excellency, the Princess should be arriving at any moment.
BEN: .recognized him, and he recognized me. So he jumped for it. And that is Trying to liquidate one of their own big-shots. I wish they'd stick to their usual custom, and do it in their own country.

BUCHANAN: Right. Bye.
BUCHANAN: The Draytons are at the Embassy.
JO: How do you know?
BUCHANAN: We have ways of finding out from the inside.
BEN: If the Draytons are at the Embassy, Hank has to be there too!
BUCHANAN: ( Grimly ) You're probably right. But we can do Why can't you?
BEN: Why can't you?
BUCHANAN: Every Embassy in a foreign country has extra-territorial rights.
BEN: What does that mean in common language?
BUCHANAN: As far as we're concerned, this Embassy stands on foreign soil.
BEN: Does that mean they can steal children and get away with it?
BUCHANAN: We could have the Foreign Office serve a writ on the Ambassador.
BUCHANAN: .You know, I'm not responsible for the complications of International
BUCHANAN: .If only we had positive proof that the boy really is in there.
BEN: What's the telephone number of this
