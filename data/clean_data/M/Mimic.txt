PETER (OS): How we doing?
SUSAN: We'll see...
ANCHORMAN (VO): Strickler's Disease crept into Manhattan like a thief in the night, claiming its first hundred victims before it was even classified.
ANCHORMAN (VO): Most were children under ten.
ANCHORMAN: Only after the numbers had reached into the thousands were officials able to identify the carrier of the deadly infection...
DIRECTOR: Cut to three.
ANCHORMAN: Blattida Germanica.  The common cockroach.
DIRECTOR: (To a RUNNER) Tell them we're ready for a live feed.
REPORTER 1: ...an insect that has proven virtually immune to chemical control...
REPORTER 2: ...the announcement by the Health Department that an end to the nightmare has finally...
REPORTER 3: ...an ex-colleague of Doctor Susan Wyeth...
PROTESTER: ...Susan has always been opposed to biological tampering. A real advocate for ecological causes, it's not...
PETER: (wrapping up) ...in Nature, evolution is a long, leisurely conversation between an organism and its environment. We, however, did not have the luxury of time...
SUSAN: With the aid of genetic labs throughout the country, we recombined cockroach DNA with genetic information from termites and mantids. We were able to create a biological counter-agent.  A new ally, if you will...
SUSAN: Blattida Traditor.
SUSAN (OS): The "Judas Roach".
SUSAN: The Judas is a non-carrier of Stricklers, with a short life-span and heightened pheromone emission.
SUSAN: The female is basically a sexual magnet; common males travelled miles and fought for the right to mate with them.
SUSAN: When they did, they took away something else we added -- a hormone, passed through sexual congress that causes their metabolism to go into overdrive.  No matter what their food intake, they starved to death in a matter of hours.
PETER: We've achieved almost total eradication of the roach population.  As of today, the disease has been officially contained.
PETER (OS): Sus, come on.  You're missing it.
PETER: Fucking thing! I hope someone's taping this. (Out.) Susan, come on.  It's really good this time. I got most of the lines out. (No response.) Sus?
PETER: Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came and went and all we got was bad cable...
PETER: Hiding from the hard glare of publicity?
PETER: A shame.  You looked great tonight.
SUSAN: Please.
PETER: You did!
SUSAN: Do you think we did the right thing?
PETER: Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
SUSAN: You know what I mean...
SUSAN: We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
PETER: (sighs) Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
NEWSREADER (TV): ...a flawless strategy which has stopped a potential epidemic in its tracks...
PETER: You hear that?  Flawless.
SUSAN: We just don't know.
PETER: We know we saved lives.
PETER: There're gonna be a lot of kids running around next year because of you.
PETER: Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
SUSAN: (smiling now) We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
PETER: Oh, I don't know. People are beginning to talk about us...
SUSAN: Don't worry, I'll save your honor. Maybe I'll even marry you.
CHINESE PREACHER: No.  Please, God, no!
CHUY: (a whisper) Oxfords, 8 1/2. Black...
CHUY: (very low) Funny, funny shoes...
PETER: Excuse me, ladies...
SUSAN: ...no, guys, these have to fit perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let me tell you why. Insects have no hands. All they have is this set of mandibles.
SUSAN: See?  This little piggy will grab the prey.
SUSAN: Then this little piggy will tear it in half...
SUSAN: ...and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in... all the way into the mouth.  These are precision tools here. Can you remember that?
SUSAN: Good.  Then get it right.
PETER: (teasing) "Baby in a bottle..."
SUSAN: Don't tease.
PETER: You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
SUSAN: (laughs) Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
SUSAN: Trust me. I've never been this late. Never.
SUSAN: If nun's pee is what it takes...
SUSAN: You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
PETER: Don't get kinky here...
PETER: Okay, meet me out front. (to Susan) I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
SUSAN: I'll be late.
SUSAN: Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
SIRI: (a wicked smile) Just like Trump Tower, then.
JOSH: ...So I say "buddy, you have every violation in the book.  Gimme one good reason not to close you down." You know what the Kraut says to me?
JOSH: The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
PETER: (distractedly) Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
JOSH: Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex. (honks furiously) We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
PETER: Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
JOSH: Health Department...
PETER: You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
JOSH: Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
PETER: Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were the first on the scene?
WOYCHEK: (gestures to Rice) We were both on patrol, saw this paint mess. Then I looked through that cellar window. We both did...
PETER: You gone in?
WOYCHEK: No. We waited.
PETER: Good.
PETER: (to Josh) Get the EMT's in there, now.
MANNY: C'mon Chuy, we're gonna be late. (discreetly crossing himself) Cops are bad news. Don't look at them.
PETER: Jesus.
WOYCHEK: (from the outside) They look real sick, don't they?
SUSAN: ...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
SIRI: I'm on it.  Don't worry. (Beat) Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
SUSAN: (Smiles ironically) Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
SIRI: I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
SUSAN: What?
SIRI: She used a baster.
SIRI: Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
SUSAN: Oh, Jesus.
SUSAN: Come on, darlin'...
SIRI: (continues) She kept it under her bed. Thing is, it kinda worked.  I mean, she had to hide it from her husband, but...
SUSAN: What's this?
SIRI: Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
SUSAN: Hello.
RICKY: You the bug lady, right?
SUSAN: (smiles) I suppose so.
RICKY: We're here to deal.
SUSAN: Metaxonycha Godmani, Trigonopelastes Delta.  Field Butterflies.  Have you been upstate?
DAVIS: Avenue B.
SUSAN: (sadly) I guess they got lost in this city.
RICKY: So, you wanna buy em?
DAVIS: There's extra wings in the bag.
SUSAN: You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
RICKY: (dismayed) That's it?
DAVIS: (to Ricky) Show her the weirdbug.
RICKY: Cost a dollar just to look.
DAVIS: It's a great bug.  We kinda broke it a little...
SUSAN: Fellas, I'll tell you what...ten dollars for everything.  Plus a killing jar, some tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you catch will be in better shape.
DAVIS: Deal!
RICKY: You crazy! That's the best!!
DAVIS: Bug's almost dead anyway.
DAVIS: Thanks, lady.
SIRI: Ten dollars?
SUSAN: Alphabet City kids- there's much worse things they could be selling.
SIRI: I hate this fucking window...
PETER: (to Josh) There's plenty of systemic infection already, so as soon as we get a preliminary reading, start them on anti-biotics. You saw this?
PETER: Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.
JOSH: Immigration's gonna love you for that.
PETER: Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
JOSH: Two shifts, people rotating from bed to work.  One toilet. We're in Wal-Mart hell, here.
PETER: Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
JOSH: Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor... (eyes his notebook) Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
PETER: Tell her she's going to be alright. We'll take care of her.
YANG: She's delirious.  Keeps saying the "Dark Angels" are coming for her. She says they took some of her people away.
PETER: Dark Angels?
YANG: (Shrugs.) Probably a gang.  Chinese people, man. They come up with some wacky stuff.
SUSAN: Siri? (louder) Siri?!
SIRI: ...the fuck?
SUSAN: (To Siri) Can you...?
SUSAN: (a scared whisper) Could you...help me...?
SUSAN: I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
SIRI: What is it?
SUSAN: I have no idea.  Are you ready?
SIRI: Oh my God...
SIRI: Shit!! Get it!  Get it!
SUSAN: (Noticing Siri's hand) It bit you.
SIRI: No shit.
SUSAN: This wing configuration. I've never...
SIRI: (looking at her injury) Fuck! It broke the skin...
SUSAN: And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
SUSAN: My God.
SIRI: What?
SUSAN (OS): It's breathing.
SIRI: That's impossible.  Insects don't...
SUSAN: I know. (Picks up a SCALPEL) Help me get a sample.
SUSAN: Hold on, big guy, hold on...
SUSAN: Hold on a second...
SIRI: What?
SIRI (O.S.): Susan?
SUSAN: Call security.
MANNY: Not too little, not too much. You rub it in, around and around like this. Let the leather take it.
MANNY: You watching? You should learn to work the shoes. You're good with your hands...
MANNY: Chuy...you gonna get all wet.
MANNY: Did you look at the story book I got you?
MANNY: Our Animal Friends.  Can you say that, Chico?  "Friends"?
MANNY (OS): A friend is the one you can trust.  When you are with a friend, no matter where in the world, you are at home.
MANNY: In this city. A friend is a hard thing to find...
CHUY: Funny Shoes...
CHUY: Alli.  Mr. Funny Shoes.
MANNY: No one is there. Is empty.
MANNY: Chuy, listen to me.  They have Jesus on the cross, but that is not a holy place. You understand?
MANNY: Ah, Nino.  God only knows what goes on in your head, eh?
CHUY: Mr. Funny Shoes...
PETER: Josh, what was Immigration's countdown?
JOSH: Thirty-three workers.
PETER: There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
JOSH: Shit.
PETER: Remember what that woman said, about people being taken? Check with the copsin the area.
PETER: Sus?
PETER: (Looks around once again) Susan?
PETER: (Regarding the laundry.) Thought it was my week for that.
SUSAN: (Shrugs.) I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
SUSAN: This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
PETER: Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
SUSAN: Don't you get it? It's more than that.
SUSAN: You know why insects don't grow larger? Because they don't have a complex respiratory system. What I saw did. It had lungs.
SUSAN: Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
PETER: We?
SUSAN: I did a PH test on its tarsal pads.
SUSAN: There's only two species who match the enzymes I found.  One's a leaf-cutter ant in the Amazon...
SUSAN: The other we released here two years ago.
ARMENIAN DRIVER: Avenue B... again! Maybe you got wrong letter, uh?
SUSAN: Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
PETER: Maybe they lied to you.
SUSAN: Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
ARMENIAN: No... Oh, shit. Get away, you Turk!
SUSAN: Pull over!
ARMENIAN DRIVER: What...?
SUSAN: Metaxonycha Godmani.
PETER: So?
RICKY (OS): If you want your money back, forget it!
DAVIS (OS): We already spent it!
SUSAN: We're here to deal.
PETER: Here, let me...
SUSAN: You sure you didn't see one of these?
RICKY: Gross. What is it?
SUSAN: An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
RICKY: (shakes his head) No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
DAVIS: It was in that corner over there.
RICKY: Sucker was fast, man. (Picks up a pipe.) Had to take it out with one a these.
PETER: Okay, guys.  We'll take it from here.
RICKY: Make it ten an' we won't tell the cops you're here.
PETER: Let's keep it at five and I won't condemn your clubhouse.
PETER: (quietly) Look, a broken tooth...
SUSAN (OS): You okay?
SUSAN: There's something under here.
PETER: Shit.
SUSAN: Let me try.  My hands are smaller.
PETER: Honey, just leave it.
SUSAN: No, there's...
LEONARD: (Wearily) Now don't tell me.
LEONARD (OS): You lost a token, right?
PETER: Look, I showed you my badge...
LEONARD: Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
PETER: The Department of Public Health...
LEONARD: ...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
PETER: Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
LEONARD: Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
CHUY (OS): Gucci.  Flat pump.
ERNEST: Your shoes.
SUSAN: (Laughs.  To Chuy.) That's wonderful!  What grade are you in?
ERNEST: No school. Shoes're all Chuy knows about.
MANNY: (immediately) He's special.
LEONARD: He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
PETER: (Irritably, to Leonard) Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
LEONARD: No, you talkin' at me.
ERNEST: (discreetly, to Susan) Is there some reward for this?
SUSAN: I guess that could be arranged.
PETER: For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
LEONARD: You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
PETER: You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
SUSAN: I heard how you talked to him.
PETER: Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
SUSAN: He was just doing his job.
PETER: Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
PETER: He wants a permit, I'll get him a permit.
ERNEST: Chrissakes...
ERNEST: Guys, c'mon.
ERNEST: I told you to stick by the maintenance area.
BAG LADY: Nah... It's private property now.
SKELETAL BUM: He eats down there.
ERNEST: Who?
HOMELESS MAN: The Stickman.
BAG LADY: Long John.
ERNEST: Graffiti artist, uh? (To Homeless People) Look guys, just get off my beat, you hear?  Get moving.
ERNEST: Hey, buddy!
ERNEST: Get off my track...
ERNEST: Sweet Jesus...
PETER: Heya. (Kisses her on the cheek.) Where's the boss?
SIRI: Ant mound.
PETER: You okay?
SIRI: It's just a headache.  We were sandblasting Trump Tower here since four this morning.
PETER: Maybe you should sit...
SIRI: I'm fine. Go talk to Susan.  She could use a good word right now.
PETER: Great crowd.
SUSAN: No such thing, baby.
SUSAN: I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
PETER: Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
SUSAN: (Distantly) Right.
PETER: What's wrong?
SUSAN: Oh...nothing that a little menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't cure. Least that's what I thought.
PETER: (genuinely moved) Oh, no, you were-
SUSAN: I was just late.
SUSAN: Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
PETER: Susan, we're not b-
SIRI (OS): Susan?
SIRI: (Weakly.) I'm sorry.  I think...I need...
SUSAN: Siri...
SUSAN: Siri!
PETER: ...I think it's some kind of systemic infection, Chris.  I saw a few cases like it yesterday. A sweatshop in Canal.
RAYMOND: (to Peter.) Okay, look.  You better come in with me.  Help me through.
RAYMOND: (To Peter) All hands on deck, Pete. Remember the dril?
PETER: It'll come back to me.
PETER: Looks like a Lyme disease rash.
RAYMOND: It's not consistent with the internal bleeding. Any idea what bit her?
RAYMOND: I think we're gonna need to have that specimen here.
CHUY: Mr. Funny Shoes.
SUSAN: ...you don't even know what you're looking for.
PETER: You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
SUSAN: Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
PETER: No.
PETER: Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
SUSAN: It didn't bite me.
PETER: I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
PETER: Chris is going to run some blood tests on you.  I want you to stay here till he's absolutely sure you're clean.  Okay? Then you'll call me... You'll catch up with us...
PETER: We'll be all right, Sus.  I promise.
MANNY: My father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get a pitcher. Cold water, whoosh, I tell you that's some alarm clock, brrrrr!
MANNY: Ah! There you go! The way you like 'em, Chu-chu... (He pours a glass of milk.) We're low on milk, you remind Grampa to pick some up tonight, okay?
WORKMAN: Hold up!  We gotta block on filter D.
WORKMAN: Oh, God...
CONTROL BOOTH: What's the problem?
WORKMAN: I think it's a baby!
RAYMOND: How you feeling?
SUSAN: You tell me.
RAYMOND: Your blood tests were all negative. You checked out.
SUSAN: What about Siri?
RAYMOND: She's stable.  I don't think there's any immediate danger, but we'll have to keep her under observation...
SUSAN: You think it's some form of Strickler's, don't you?
RAYMOND: Pathology's still working on the tissue samples.  If it is...it must be an errant strain.  Shorter incubation period. (Beat.) I'm sorry, Sue.  We just don't know yet.
JEREMY (OS): ...how many times I gotta tell you, man: we can't accept this!
EMT (OS): Well, what the hell else am I suppose to do with it?
JEREMY: Take it out back and throw it in the friggin' dumpster!
EMT: Not unless somebody signs for it.
SUSAN: Oh, my God.
JEREMY: Hey, you can't...
SUSAN: What's your name?
JEREMY: Jeremy...
SUSAN: Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
JEREMY: Lady...
SUSAN: Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond!
JEREMY: Okay.
SUSAN: (To EMT) Where'd you find it?
EMT: Washed up at the filtration plant on Bank street. Some asshole there thought it was a baby. They called us.
EMT: It's a lobster, right?
LEONARD: Better hurry it up, Doc. My shift's almost over.
PETER: Guess someone requested you for overtime...buddy.
SUSAN: Posterior sternites are gone...half the protonum rotted off.
RAYMOND: Maggots...
SUSAN: Near hatching.  Thing must've died about three weeks ago.
SUSAN: Do you have a polaroid?
LEONARD: You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
JOSH: (Whisper to Peter) New York's finest.
JOSH: There's really people living down here?
LEONARD: Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
LEONARD: Substance abusers, mental cases... Then about a year ago, Poof! All gone. Rumors got started... Someone found a couple of stiffs...
LEONARD: Down here's the land of talk, see? So the wildest version goes the farthest. They mark that area with a sign or a drawing, and its as good as closed. (chuckles) We had one fella... for years said he was Bela Lugosi. Got him on Geraldo.
SUSAN: It's me. Can you hear me?
PETER: (phone, barely audible) Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
SUSAN: I have.
SUSAN: I'm on my way. I've got something for you to look at...
PETER: We'll be back at the platform in...
LEONARD: 20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
PETER: (To phone.) 20 minutes. (Beat.) Susan?
LEONARD: Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
JOSH: What?
LEONARD: Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.
MANNY: No, no, please understand... I can't wait that long.
MANNY: Please. I write it down. (he writes) 2... 8... 7... 3. What does this mean "case number"? Okay. So, now what?  When can you...?
MANNY: No, I can't wait...no, listen...
MANNY: Hijos de puta.
MANNY: Mr. Funny Shoes.
JOSH: (Sniffing) Smells like acid.
PETER: Ammonia.
JOSH: Peter...
PETER: Yeah...?
JOSH: There's some weird shit here.
PETER: Weird shit...?
JOSH: Take a look.
JOSH: Fecal matter, unknown origin: weird shit. (Beat) Whatever it is, it's not human.
LEONARD: And it needs some metamucil.
MANNY: Chuy...
MANNY: Chuy...
REPAIRMAN: Hey, Lady, all power will be down in five minutes, okay?
SUSAN: Okay....
SUSAN: Peter?
LEONARD: I've never been this deep. This area here is the Old Armory station. They built it in the 40's. Ran out of money half-way through...
LEONARD: Okay, the fat lady's singing. Time to go.
PETER (O.S.): (To Josh) I want a team in here by six tonight, hands and knees with toothpicks...
PETER: Don't!!
LEONARD: Did you see the size of that thing?!
PETER: Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
JOSH: Peter!
PETER: It's okay.  I'm all right.
LEONARD: Get the hell away from me!
PETER: (Deadpan) He's all right, too.
LEONARD: Oh, that's gonna work.
PETER: You got a better way up?
LEONARD: (To Josh.) Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
JOSH: H-how do I get...?
LEONARD: Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
LEONARD (OS): Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
JOSH: I think so. One right, two lefts...
LEONARD: And a right.
JOSH: Right.
PETER: Go Josh. Now.
JOSH: Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!
PETER: Any luck?
LEONARD: Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
PETER: You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
LEONARD: Oh, man, there you go again.
PETER: What?
LEONARD: Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
PETER: For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
LEONARD: All right, motherfucker, that's it.
PETER: Shh! Shh!
LEONARD: (tentative) Manny?!
LEONARD: My God, what the hell are you...?
MANNY: Hurry, the woman needs help!
PETER: Woman?
SUSAN: (A whisper) Don't.
PETER: Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
PETER: (To Manny and Leonard) Give me your belts.
LEONARD: (to Manny, as he ties them together) What are you doing down here?
MANNY: Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere... (to Peter) Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
PETER: What's...?
MANNY: Just hurry.
PETER: I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming.
SUSAN: No, Jesus, no.
PETER: (To Leonard) Toss the flare down!
LEONARD: I only got...
PETER: Just do it!
PETER: Oh, Jesus...
LEONARD: What the fuck is that?! What the fuck is that?!
SUSAN: (A desperate appeal) Peter...
PETER: Wrap it around your hand!
PETER: Come on!
PETER: Get on my shoulders!
PETER: Let's go!
PETER: Oh, shit...
MANNY: There!
LEONARD: Get the goddam door!
PETER: Push it! Push it! Don't let up!
LEONARD: What the fuck was that?
LEONARD: You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
MANNY: Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
PETER: (to Leonard) We don't know!! We don't know what it is!
PETER: Wait a minute-
LEONARD: Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
PETER: Its muscles are locked.
LEONARD: (Hoarse) Oh, Jesus!!
MANNY: Wait...
LEONARD: Oh, Jesus! It's hitting the bone man, get it off!!
PETER: (Stopping him.) Hey hey hey...
MANNY: Is how we make loose the ticks back home.
PETER: Just keep holding it.  Can you do that for me? (No reponse.) Susan?
MANNY (OS): Doctor Tyler?
PETER: You feel anything?
LEONARD: Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
PETER: Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back. (No response.) Look, I'm trying to help you here...
LEONARD: Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
PETER: I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
MANNY: Where the hell'd that thing come from?
PETER: (Quietly) A mistake.
LEONARD: "Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
PETER: It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
LEONARD: How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
SUSAN: (Quietly) It doesn't have a heart.
SUSAN: Just inner chambers...
MANNY: But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
SUSAN: No...
SUSAN: That's what it wanted you to see.
PETER: So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
SUSAN: (shakes her head) That's camouflage...
SUSAN: This is mimicry. They evolve to mimic their predators. A butterfly can look like the eyes of an owl.  A catterpillar can copy a snake...
SUSAN: This has evolved to mimic the most dangerous predator it's ever had...
SUSAN: Us.
SUSAN: Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
MANNY: (quotes) "...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
SUSAN: This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
SUSAN: All these...they're like tunnels of an insect colony. Once these things hit a certain population density, they'll have to move out, form new colonies.
SUSAN: We have to get help down here.  Burn the tunnels before...
LEONARD: Get the doors!
PETER: Is there a switch?
LEONARD: Third rail is dead. (To Manny and Susan.) Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
SUSAN: (Whispering to Peter) The lights!
LEONARD: (Starts looking around) Where's the damn crank?!
PETER: (hissing a whisper) They're coming!
SUSAN: I got it!
SUSAN: Hurry! Please!
LEONARD: Come on, you son-of-a...
SUSAN: Oh, God. (Looks at Leonard.) The blood...
SUSAN: His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
PETER: How?!
PETER: It's no use! They know we're in here!
SUSAN: They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
PETER: Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
SUSAN: Exac...
SUSAN: (To Manny) Give me your razor.
PETER: What are you doing?
LEONARD: (covers his nose) Shit!
SUSAN: Rub it on the windows!
PETER: What-
SUSAN: Just do it!!
LEONARD: What are you putting that crap on me for?
SUSAN: Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
LEONARD (O.S.): Okay. That's us.
LEONARD: This track we're on? Goes down into the repair area. (Makes an "X" further down) The elevator's over here. Leads up to the active tunnels.
PETER: Can we get this car there?
LEONARD: Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
SUSAN: But the power...
LEONARD: Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
MANNY: Oh, how you gonna get there, Leonard? Hop?
PETER: (To Leonard) Just talk me through it. I can go with Manny.
LEONARD: It would take a minute or so. (beat) You won't last that long out there.
SUSAN: Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
PETER: We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
SUSAN: Peter-
PETER: It worked before...
SUSAN: (an edge in her voice) The scent won't last...
PETER: That's why we should do it now.
LEONARD: It's just a regular old pump switch, okay? Right by the track signal board.
LEONARD: The lights come up, you pull the switch.
MANNY: I pull.
LEONARD: You don't do that, we're on the wrong track. (turns to Peter) You...
LEONARD: You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
PETER: Depends.  You got a memo?
LEONARD: All right then.  You gonna find two wires.  One's green.  The other's blue...
MANNY: He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
SUSAN: Manny...
MANNY: I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
SUSAN: We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
SUSAN: You're going to have to keep it really slow.  Their eyes react to sudden movements.
SUSAN: Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
PETER: Try not to sweat?
LEONARD: Okay, people...
LEONARD (OS): ...are we ready for this?
LEONARD: Whatever you do, don't step on the third rail coming back. Six hundred volts'll blow your leg right off.
PETER: I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
SUSAN: (overlapping) That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
PETER: In the tool box under the kitchen counter...
SUSAN: Open it.
SUSAN: Choke on it, motherfuckers.
PETER: (to himself) Green...Blue...
MANNY: Chuy...?
MANNY: (Whispering) Nino...
MANNY: Chuy...
PETER: Dammit!
SUSAN: (horrified) The scent's fading...
LEONARD: (tense as hell) What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
MANNY: Nino, please...
MANNY: Dios mio...
MANNY: (barely audible) Chuy...
CHUY: (whispers) Friends.
CHUY: Friends.
MANNY: God has closed his eyes. This, he cannot see...
SUSAN: Over here! Over here! Goddam you!!
SUSAN: (to Leonard)
PETER: Manny...
SUSAN: Peter!!
PETER: Come on, kid...
PETER: (horrified) Jesus!
SUSAN: Run!! Peter!!
SUSAN: (Yelling to Leonard)
LEONARD: The kid...
PETER: The kid's with them!!
LEONARD: What do you-?
PETER: Go!! Just go!!
LEONARD: He didn't do it!
SUSAN: What?
LEONARD: Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
SUSAN: You all right?
LEONARD: (Simply, re: his leg) Can't feel it.
SUSAN: Which way?
LEONARD: Across both tracks!!
PETER: Shit.
LEONARD: (Quietly) Lemme go.
SUSAN: We're no leaving you!
LEONARD: No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
LEONARD: NOW!! GO!! Get the hell off my beat!
LEONARD: Come on.  Come to poppa.
SUSAN: There.
LEONARD: Come here, you mealy-mouthed...
LEONARD: Multi-legged...
LEONARD: Maggot-munchin' motherfu...
SUSAN: I can't tell if it's working!
SUSAN: Oh, come on, come on!
PETER: Jump in.
PETER: You go first. I'll be right below you.
SUSAN: Your arm, you can't...
PETER: I can.  We can do this...
SUSAN: We're gonna make it!
PETER: Don't hold your breath!  Keep it going, even flow!
PETER: C'mon...
SUSAN: Ah...
PETER: Talk to me.
SUSAN: Peter...
SUSUAN: I'm really glad I'm not pregnant.
PETER: Hang onto me.
PETER: Hang on tight!
PETER: Come on!
SUSAN: Don't look back!
SUSAN: No...
PETER: We can do it!
LITTLE GIRL: Mommy, there's people...
PETER: (Adrenaline pumping) We-can-do-this!!!
PETER: It'll be fine... it... They're still down there. We'll seal the whole system, go in with whatever it takes...
PETER: It'll be fine... We nailed them before, we'll do it again...
SUSAN: (barely audible) They've come up...
