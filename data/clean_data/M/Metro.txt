KIMURA: Hi, Roper.
ROPER: Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
KIMURA: The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked .a car.
ROPER: .a car.
KIMURA: That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't.
ROPER: .get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes.
KIMURA: That's right.
ROPER: What's the suspect's name?
KIMURA: INT. DINER - DAY Across from the bank. This is where the "command post" is setup. About a dozen cops and the accompanying support staff are here. Lieutenant SAMUEL BAFFERT is in charge. Roper saunters in.
ROPER: Hello, guys.
BAFFERT: Hello, Roper. Glad you could join
ROPER: Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl?
BAFFERT: This guy is no genius.
ROPER: They're not usually graduate students.
BAFFERT: SWAT wants to go in.
ROPER: What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
ROPER: We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
KIMURA: Well he's a little fucking agitated he ripped the phone out.
ROPER: I have to go face to face.
BAFFERT: No you can't do that.
ROPER: You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded We don't know how bad it is The guy ripped the phone out SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
BAFFERT: I don't know.
ROPER: He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
BAFFERT: Not that we know of.
ROPER: We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him maybe we won't lose anyone.
BAFFERT: Maybe we can get a throw phone in SWAT says it's broken The perp in the last situation rendered it What do you mean?
KIMURA: SWAT says it's broken The perp in the last situation rendered it What do you mean?
BAFFERT: What do you mean?
KIMURA: He urinated on it and shorted out the circuits.
ROPER: We gonna stand here and talk about it or let the guy in there bleed to Give me a dozen donuts.
FORBES: What do you think he's got in the You can't take a guy down with a
MCCALL: You can't take a guy down with a
FORBES: You can't take a guy down with a
ROPER: Hi, Earl, I'm Scott Roper. Wanna donut? I ate the glazed but there's a bunch of chocolate and a
ROPER: I'm a negotiator, Earl. I don't carry a weapon.
EARL: Where's the car?
ROPER: I need to get something straight Who's the manager?
ROPER: Who's the manager?
MANAGER: I am.
ROPER: When did you start keeping longer Last spring.
MANAGER: Last spring.
ROPER: Really! Because I've been thinking of moving to this branch. It would be really convenient for me
EARL: HEY, SHUT UP!
EARL: Do you want me to start killing
ROPER: It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl. Including you.
EARL: Then where's my FUCKING car!
ROPER: I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to do this the right way.
ROPER: First I need you to point that gun away from What's your name?
TELLER: ( voice trembling ) Point the gun away from Debbie.
ROPER: Point the gun away from Debbie.
EARL: Debbie's brains are going to be splattered all over the floor if I don't see a car in five minutes!
ROPER: Alright! But let's be clear about one thing. If you kill someone, I can't help you. The SWAT guys will take you out.
EARL: What are my chances of getting out of here?
ROPER: Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a bank in Daly City.
ROPER: How ya doin'?
ROPER: ( to Earl ) .Cops gave him a car, and he lost them on the freeway.
EARL: Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
ROPER: Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
ROPER: He didn't kill anybody, though.
ROPER: This is gonna hurt.
EARL: Hey, leave him alone. What are you
ROPER: It's part of my negotiator's oath. If there's an injured party and I can help them, I'm duty bound by my oath to do that. You can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same
ROPER: I'll be right back, Earl. Point that gun away from Debbie.
ROPER: ( whispering to Jennings ) Give me your gun.
ROPER: I haven't had to shoot anyone in three years.
JENNINGS: Why not keep the streak alive?
ROPER: Because this strung-out junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody.
EARL: ( yelling )
THERE!: The two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and Roper calmly walks back into the bank. Stops about five paces from Roper glances at Debbie. Gun pressed against her head. Tears start rolling down her cheeks. She's being tremendously brave.
ROPER: As a rule, I need one hostage released as show of good faith.
ROPER: Give me Debbie. Take the old guy.
EARL: Take the old guy.
ROPER: The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
EARL: Am I gettin' the car?
ROPER: You're gettin' the car.
EARL: Take them.
ROPER: You two, leave.
FORBES: This guy is good.
MCCALL: That's what they say.
ROPER: That was fine, Earl. Now I'm going to get your car.
ROPER: Oh, there's one last thing.
EARL: You want a convertible or hardtop?
ROPER: You want a convertible or hardtop?
ROPER: Roper turns around, starts walking again. He keeps his eyes focused on the reflection of Earl in the front window of the
ROPER: ( without turning around ) Manual or automatic?
EARL: You got it.
ROPER: You got it.
EARL: I give up! I give up!
RADIO: The situation is secured. Suspect in custody. Repeat. Situation secured.
RONNIE: There's one for the front page.
ROPER: Ronnie, why are you torturing me? I can't live without you. Don't start.
RONNIE: Don't start.
ROPER: This baseball player you're going out with. He's no good for you.
RONNIE: Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
ROPER: I worship you.
RONNIE: You worship yourself.
ROPER: Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
RONNIE: Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a
ROPER: Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a
RONNIE: You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
ROPER: Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
ROPER: Let me take you out tomorrow night. I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
RONNIE: I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
ROPER: ( frowning ) This Greg is really getting in my
ROPER: Please. I'm begging you.
RONNIE: Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
ROPER: Hey, that's my car.
REPO MAN: Not anymore. Now it belongs to Silver Hills Financial.
ROPER: Hey, Baffert, what's the story for Floor seats.
BAFFERT: Floor seats.
ROPER: You're my hero.
BAFFERT: Dinner's on you.
ROPER: INT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING A quiet contrast to the squadroom. This is the executive branch of Metro. All the big-wigs are officed here. Roper walks down the carpeted hall. No one here except Kevin McCall quietly sitting outside Captain Solis' office. Roper and McCall make brief eye contact. Roper thinks nothing of it. He goes into the Captain's office.
SOLIS: He just walked into my office. The Chief says, "Good work this morning. Congratulations."
ROPER: Tell him to give me a raise.
SOLIS: ( into the phone ) He says, "Thank you very much." ( a beat ) I'll discuss it with him right now. Good-bye, Chief.
SOLIS: Are you going to make this hard for Depends. What's up?
ROPER: Are you going to make this hard for Depends. What's up?
SOLIS: Are you going to make this hard for Depends. What's up?
ROPER: Depends. What's up?
SOLIS: There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
ROPER: Define concern.
SOLIS: What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
ROPER: Your concern is heartwarming.
SOLIS: It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
ROPER: Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
SOLIS: His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to
ROPER: Let me see that.
ROPER: Tested high on his intellectual aptitude. Not as high as me but. National marksman finalist. Attended N. Y. C. Went to college. Very impressive. F.B.I. sniper school. Mayorial commendation.
ROPER: "Additional Skills": Biathelete, marathoner, lip-reading, speaks
ROPER: Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
SOLIS: You let us worry about that.
ROPER: Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
SOLIS: ( gloomily ) What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
ROPER: The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime. training sessions. Not to mention the extra What do you think would be in order?
SOLIS: What do you think would be in order?
ROPER: Like ahh. I don't know. Five thousand dollars.
SOLIS: ( calmly ) Okay, I think I could swing that.
ROPER: ( quickly ) And a car.
SOLIS: Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
ROPER: You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
SOLIS: Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
ROPER: ( firmly ) The car is part of the deal.
SOLIS: What happened to your Trans Am? Repoed this morning.
ROPER: Repoed this morning.
SOLIS: ( relenting ) I'll provide you with transportation.
ROPER: And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background.
ROPER: ( instant character change ) Hey, glad to meet you. I've heard nothing but good things about you.
MCCALL: Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
ROPER: You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
MCCALL: I'm ready to do it. And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
ROPER: Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
MCCALL: Sorry. Habit.
SOLIS: ( intervening ) Let's move past this, gentlemen.
ROPER: We're already past it, aren't we, If you say so.
MCCALL: If you say so.
SOLIS: Then you'll have to excuse me. I have other work to do.
SOLIS: Roper turns back around.
SOLIS: About the transportation issue. You check with the impound sergeant.
ROPER: You ever been in a hostage situation?
MCCALL: Only at the very end.
ROPER: How do you feel after a shooting.
MCCALL: ( self-assured ) Like it had to be done.
ROPER: It rarely has to be done.
MCCALL: I've rarely shot anyone.
ROPER: SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
MCCALL: ( flatly ) I know.
ROPER: Try to remember that.
ROPER: Okay, "Dead Eye", lesson one.
ROPER: Extract that pen cap without touching or moving the bottle.
MCCALL: What's the point of this?
ROPER: A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution. See you tomorrow.
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
BAFFERT: Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
ROPER: "Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
BAFFERT: I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
ROPER: Yeah, okay.
BAFFERT: This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
ROPER: You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
BAFFERT: Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
ROPER: It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player Greg Barnett.
BAFFERT: ( impressed ) No shit! He's good!
ROPER: Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
BAFFERT: Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
ROPER: Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up.
BAFFERT: This is it. Space 742.
ROPER: Then he didn't say 742. He must have said 724 or something, because this can't be right.
ROPER: Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx? I'm not riding in this shit. I can't roll in no shit like this.
BAFFERT: Where's the stereo?
ROPER: Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
BAFFERT: Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
BAFFERT: Apartment 306.
ROPER: You want me to go up with you?
BAFFERT: Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to Good. I don't want to be late.
ROPER: Good. I don't want to be late.
ROPER: You want anything on the game?
BAFFERT: What's the line?
ROPER: It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
BAFFERT: I'll take half of your action.
DETAIL SHOT: A message on the display reads: RECHARGE BATTERY. Roper looks around. There's a payphone across the street. He gets out of the truck and crosses to it.
KORDA: Who is it?
KORDA: What happened? Is there a problem?
BAFFERT: May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
BAFFERT: Count Basie?
KORDA: Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30,
BAFFERT: Yeah. Yeah. Now I can hear it. Where did you find an old recording like that?
BAFFERT: Where did you find an old recording like that?
KORDA: Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Memories. Memory Lane or I've got to stop in there. Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
BAFFERT: I've got to stop in there. Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
KORDA: You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
BAFFERT: No, this is a different Frank. This is a man who deals in jewelry. Stolen jewelry usually. You wouldn't know anybody like that?
HIS POV: Nobody there. Just the truck.
KORDA: I certainly wouldn't.
BAFFERT: Could I please have a little water?
KORDA: ( the perfect host ) Of course.
BAFFERT: The reason I'm asking you is because we arrested him with some stolen jewelry. It was traced to the robbery of a store down on Polk Street. He said he was fencing it for you.
HIS POV: Several glassine envelopes used for raw jewels. They have jeweler's markings on them indicating gem weight and grade.
KORDA: ( calmly ) There's obviously some mistake. I have a cousin who has had run-ins with the law.
KORDA: Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this. situation.
BAFFERT: This cousin of yours. What's his Clarence Teal. Your cough seems to be better.
KORDA: ( forthrightly ) Clarence Teal. Your cough seems to be better.
KORDA: Your cough seems to be better.
BAFFERT: Thank you.
BAFFERT: Well, I'm on my way to the game. I appreciate your cooperation, Mr.
KORDA: Baffert turns back around.
KORDA: Do you believe that story about Robert Johnson.? That he made a deal with the devil at the crossroads?
BAFFERT: Could be.
BAFFERT: ( as the elevator descends ) Hello, Judge Stone. This is Lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a suspect's residence. I'm requesting a telephonic search warrant in connection with an armed robbery at a jewelry store. There's visible evidence on the premises. Glassine envelopes with jeweler's markings were seen in the trash can.
BAFFERT: .I believe a full search of the premises will turn up some stolen
ROPER: ( to the woman ) Get an ambulance!
SOLIS: ( on the phone ) Yes sir. Every resource will be brought to bear. We will find this guy. Yeah, he's here now. I'll tell him.
SOLIS: The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
ROPER: ( still looking out window ) He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said. ( beat; turning to Solis ) I want to be put on this case.
SOLIS: I can't do that.
ROPER: ( emphatic ) I want to be put on this case.
SOLIS: You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
ROPER: Who's running it?
SOLIS: Who's running it!
ROPER: Who's running it!
SOLIS: Kimura and Glass will head the
SOLIS: Scott. Go home. Get some sleep.
ROPER: Hey, hey, hey.
ROPER: Anything on Korda so far?

ROPER: He misses me.
ROPER: I won't stay long. I had to talk to You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
RONNIE: ( a bit surprised at his openness ) You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
ROPER: It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
RONNIE: Scott, You can't save everyone.
ROPER: I've proved that, didn't I?
ROPER: Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
RONNIE: ( gentle ) What do you want from me?
ROPER: Something I guess I can't have Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen.

ROPER: You expecting someone?
ROPER: This day just keeps getting better.
RONNIE: ( soft ) They're on the table where you always leave them. Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were.
GREG: Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were.
ROPER: I was just leaving.
RONNIE: Scottie. take care of yourself.
KORDA: If you weren't family I'd kill you.

MCCALL: I know my job.
WIFE: ( shrieking ) No, Raymond!
RAYMOND: ( to Roper ) Stay the fuck out of here!

ROPER: holds it up so Raymond can see it.
ROPER: Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
RAYMOND: I ain't interested in your life story.
ROPER: Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
RAYMOND: She's the one to blame. Not me.
ROPER: Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
RAYMOND: What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my

RAYMOND: Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
ROPER: I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
RAYMOND: And why the fuck would you do that for me?
ROPER: Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
RAYMOND: Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
ROPER: My name's Scott Roper. I need my coat.
RAYMOND: I need my coat.
ROPER: He rushes over to Ray. Circle of blood soaking into the carpet. Ray's empty eyes. His hand still wrapped in his coat. He was dead instantly. Roper slams his fist into the wall. A couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway. Roper bolts out of the room. Pounds down the hallway. Pounds down the stairs. down another flight.

ROPER: Come on. Let's go for a drink.
MCCALL: I don't really like to drink.
ROPER: You have to. It's a tradition.
MCCALL: Well, if I have to, I have to.
ROPER: You got a girlfriend?
MCCALL: Why? You like my ass?
ROPER: Better than your pool game.
ROPER: You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
MCCALL: I don't gamble.
MCCALL: Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
ROPER: You living together?
MCCALL: She's back in Jersey. going to graduate school.
ROPER: Explain how that works.
MCCALL: She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get She grow up in Livingtston, too?
ROPER: She grow up in Livingtston, too?
MCCALL: ( as if that were unthinkable ) No, no, no. ( a beat ) She's from Hoboken.
ROPER: Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
MCCALL: We see each other every couple of Every couple of months, huh?
ROPER: Every couple of months, huh?
ROPER: That's a lot of commitment. I admire Do you really?
MCCALL: Do you really?
ROPER: No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do Thanks for clearing that up. I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
MCCALL: Thanks for clearing that up. I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
ROPER: Where did you hear that?
MCCALL: Around. Barnett's tough competition.
ROPER: Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
ROPER: Lesson two, "Dead Eye". should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
MCCALL: I think I can handle that one.
ROPER: Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
ROPER: Zack, another round.
ROPER: My partner gave himself in exchange for a ten year old girl. He got caught in the crossfire. Two dead. My partner and the bad guy. Weird thing is, if he was alive, he'd probably do it again. Some people never learn.
ROPER: You think you can learn, McCall?
MCCALL: I think so.
MCCALL: I'm Officer McCall, what's going on?
REVERSE ANGLE: It's a training room. It's built to approximate a convenience store. Several mannequins are placed around the room to represent a hostage situation. The "BAD GUY" has a walkie- talkie strapped around his neck. Roper's voice CRACKLES out of it.
BAD GUY: What the fuck do you think is going on, turdhead? I'm about to waste everyone in this place.
MCCALL: H. how can I help you? Tell me I feel stupid talking to a dummy.
ROPER: What did you think? I'm going to let you practice on real people?
ROPER: First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say, "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you." Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
MCCALL: It'll come. Try again.
ROPER: It'll come. Try again.
MCCALL: My name's McCall. I'm a hostage negotiator. I'm here to help you.
MCCALL: Tell me what you need.
MCCALL: ( hesitantly ) I can't do that.
MCCALL: Is all the name calling necessary.
ROPER: Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
MCCALL: ( exasperated ) So what do I say to this guy?
ROPER: You could say something like, "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
MCCALL: What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
ROPER: If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to I'm not good at lying.
MCCALL: I'm not good at lying.
ROPER: Get good at it.
MCCALL: It's against my nature.
ROPER: You know the ten commandments?
MCCALL: What's the first commandment?
ROPER: What's the first commandment?
MCCALL: Thou shall have no other God before
ROPER: Okay, forget that. What's the main
MCCALL: You tell me.
ROPER: Thou shall not kill. You've killed, To save lives.
MCCALL: To save lives.
ROPER: To save lives.
MCCALL: To save lives.
ROPER: So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
ROPER: Let's try it again.
MCCALL: My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
ROPER: Close your eyes.
ROPER: What did you see?
MCCALL: ( rapid-fire ) A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
ROPER: Very good. You've got good eyes. That's important.
MCCALL: Was that your partner?
MCCALL: Why did he do it?
ROPER: ( quietly ) Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better. We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the ( a sad beat ) Let's move on. Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their
ROPER: You know why I like the track?
MCCALL: You're a compulsive gambler?
ROPER: Because there are a multitude of possibility's. Everything is there to see if you know what to look for. You have to read the conditions, just like in a hostage situation.
ROPER: See the four horse. Dropping in class. No works. Front wraps. Looks like he's broken down. But notice the woman in the sun hat. She's the owner. She wouldn't have come if her horse was broken down. He's live. We use
ROPER: See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off. Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out. What do you think?
MCCALL: I have two words for you. Seek I have three words for you. Ex-ac-
ROPER: I have three words for you. Ex-ac-
ROPER: I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
MCCALL: ( puzzled ) I do.
GAMBLER: Hey, Roper.
ROPER: How you doin', Marv?
ROPER: We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
MCCALL: ( no enthusiasm ) I'm told that newspaper photographer is your former girlfriend.
MCCALL: I'm told that newspaper photographer is your former girlfriend.
ROPER: Ronnie. Yeah, so.
MCCALL: Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
ROPER: So what do you want?. An autograph.
MCCALL: I don't know why she'd pick him over
MCCALL: ( straight-faced ) I'm just practicing my lying.
ROPER: Still needs work.
MCCALL: ( downcast ) You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
ROPER: Okay, we're in good shape. We're in good shape.
MCCALL: The 6 horse is last.
ROPER: That's okay. That's his style.
MCCALL: To run last?
ROPER: To run late!
ROPER: The favorite's fading. I told you he wasn't going to run today. The four horse has got the lead!
MCCALL: ( cynically ) The 6 horse is still last.
ROPER: He'll be running at the quarter pole.
MCCALL: They need to run first and second?
ROPER: Yeah, first and second.
ROPER: Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell.
MCCALL: COME ON RUSSELL!. Who the fuck's Russell?!
ROPER: The jockey!
MCCALL: COME ON, RUSSELL!
MCCALL: We won!
ROPER: ( disheartened ) We lost.
MCCALL: ( confidently ) We won.
ROPER: How much you wanna bet?
MCCALL: You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
ROPER: High fives.
ROPER: That's eight hundred bucks.
MCCALL: How long you been coming here?
ROPER: About six years. My partner took me.
MCCALL: Is it always like this?
ROPER: Occasionally you lose.
ROPER: ( into the phone ) Roper here. ( he listens ) I'm on my way.
ROPER: We gotta go.
SOLIS: We're working on that, Joe. These things aren't quite that simple.
MCCALL: This does not look good.
ROPER: See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
MCCALL: Police corruption. It's everywhere.
SOLIS: This will take time to setup. I'll have to get authorizations. Okay, you relax, and I'll
ROPER: What do we got?
SOLIS: 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
ROPER: Any verification on numbers.
SOLIS: We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
ROPER: What have you promised them?
SOLIS: Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
ROPER: Any good points of entry?
MCCALL: The place is designed to be a vault.
ROPER: ( into the phone ) My name's Roper. How are you people doing in there? ( he listens ) Solis is off the job now, Joe. I'm the guy authorized to give you whatever you want. ( listens ) That's right, but first I need to come down there to talk to you.
KORDA: You don't have to come here.
ROPER: Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
ROPER: Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
KORDA: ( warningly ) Stay there.
ROPER: I'm going to put my hands down, okay.
KORDA: Are you in charge, Roper?
ROPER: I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.

KORDA: I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
ROPER: Is that all?
KORDA: For now that's all.
ROPER: You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
KORDA: No. You just do shit for me right Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal. One hostage.
ROPER: Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal. One hostage.
KORDA: I'll give you something.
DETAIL SHOT: It's a human ear.
KORDA: In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger piece. I assume there are no
ROPER: I understand you completely.
ROPER: ( flatly ) We're going to have to take this guy Can't we wear him down?
SOLIS: Can't we wear him down?
ROPER: I believe there's at least one fatality in there already. The fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire. I believe he's working alone, both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldn't come out beyond the doorway. He was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me. His demeanor is calm and controlled, that's what really scares me. The other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our So, do you want to go in or wait for him to come out?
MCCALL: Let him come out. Too many unknowns in there.
MCCALL: When we drive up the car, make sure it's at an angle about three feet from the curb. Put our best man "highground", Twenty degree down angle.
SWAT CAPTAIN: Have Anderson prep it and notify us when he's on line.
SOLIS: I feel this thing going sideways on
ROPER: There is some good news. He's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity and hasn't determined to kill all the hostages.
KORDA: Drag them behind the counter. I'm not staying here another minute.
WOMAN CUSTOMER: I'm not staying here another minute.
SALESGIRL #1: ( panicky ) No, Mrs. Dotson.

SWAT CAPTAIN: ( into his radio ) All positions, you have the green They're out.
MCCALL: They're out.
HIS POV: Through the haze, we catch glimpses of the hostages circled around the figure in the ski mask. They slowly shuffle toward the Explorer. McCall watches intently.

ROPER: Shit! Where'd that shot come from? Hold your fire!

VET #1: ( rambling incoherently ) I can't fight this technology. They have microprocessors made in totally sterile environments. I've seen those places. Everyone is dressed in white. It's like paper clothing, man. They're not even human. Dave, don't do this, bro. Pull me in. We'll do a few laps in the park and figure out some other way.
VET #2: Dave, don't do this, bro. Pull me in. We'll do a few laps in the park and figure out some other way.

MCCALL: How can I help you with the particles?
DAVE: It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
MCCALL: ( blurting out ) They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
DAVE: McCall even surprises himself with that one. It was a sheer act of desperation. He holds his breath and waits to see what the effect is. Dave turns back around.

FIREMAN: Negative. It's 14 floors up. No nets gonna hold a fall from that high up.

ROPER: Reaches the the chained area, REVEALING an empty DRY DOCK, easily one hundred feet deep and five hundred long. At the bottom of the dry dock is a PORTABLE RADIO, the acoustics of natural amphitheater so intense you could hear a whisper the source of Korda's voice.
