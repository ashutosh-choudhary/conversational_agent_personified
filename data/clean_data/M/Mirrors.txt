MIRRORS: Written by
MAN: I'm sorry. I. I. I wasn't trying to get away.
ANGELA: What time is it?
BEN: Almost 8:30. Coffee?
ANGELA: No, you're going to be late.
BEN: Go back to sleep. I'll call you, OK?
ANGELA: Yeah, I won't be working until later You shaved?
BEN: See you later, Angie.
LARRY: Sorry, I'm late. Have you been waiting long?
BEN: I just got here.
LARRY: You look awful.
BEN: Thanks Larry.
LARRY: You know, you should sleep at night. Come in.
LARRY: So did you find an apartment yet?
BEN: No, not yet.
LARRY: You need a place to stay?
BEN: No, I'm staying at my sister's, in I didn't know you had a sister. What does she do?
LARRY: I didn't know you had a sister. What does she do?
BEN: She's a bartender.
LARRY: That's not too good for you! Anyway, you know you are always welcome to stay at our house.
BEN: You know what I want. I'm ready to come back, I'm feeling much better Listen Ben, I can't bring you back on the force. Nobody in the squad wants you around right now. I'm sorry but I have to be honest with you. You understand, right?
LARRY: Listen Ben, I can't bring you back on the force. Nobody in the squad wants you around right now. I'm sorry but I have to be honest with you. You understand, right?
BEN: Larry, I'm telling you, I'm ready.
LARRY: If it was up to me, I would bring you back tomorrow, but I'm not the only one who decides. Listen, I think I've got something else for you. I know a guy at the Mayflower corporation and they need someone to watch over one of their department stores.
BEN: What?! Come on Larry, a security guard job. I'm not ready to retire yet!
LARRY: Hey! I'm just trying to help here. I know you're over qualified for that position but it's a good opportunity for you for the time being.until the situation here quiets down. Also the money is not that bad.
BEN: I do. The one that burned down?
LARRY: Yes, their night watchman hasn't shown up for work in several days. They need someone right away. Take it, relax, and we will talk about your situation again in a couple months.
BEN: Yeah, in a couple months. I gave everything for the NYPD. I almost died out there. Everyone seems to have forgotten that.
LARRY: I didn't.
BEN: ( on Amy's voicemail ) Amy, it's me. I just wanted to let you know that I got a job today. It's nothing special, just a security guard job. If you still want to go ahead with it, we can sign the divorce papers. I mean, if that's what you really want. ( he hesitates ) I've been thinking about Michael's birthday tomorrow. It would be nice if we could celebrate it together . You know, for the kids' sake. Call me.
LORENZO: You know, the Meredith family acquired this building after St. John's Hospital closed in 1952. It was the very first Mayflower to open on the East Coast.
BEN: Did you clean them?
LORENZO: The mirrors, why are they so clean?
BEN: The mirrors, why are they so clean?
LORENZO: That's Gary Lewis, the fellow who worked here before you. He was completely obsessed with these damn mirrors. He'd spend the entire night polishing them.
BEN: Why did he leave?
LORENZO: No idea. Just didn't show up one night. I take it he's found a better opportunity somewhere else.
BEN: Almost a year.
LORENZO: Why did you resign from the force? You were a detective, is that correct?
BEN: I was wounded during a holdup. It kind of changed my perspective on things.
LORENZO: Third floor. Ladies' department. You gotta be careful here. When the wind blows, sometimes the tiles fly off the roof and they'll just snap your ear off, if you follow what I'm saying.
LORENZO: We were a pretty big team working here before the fire. When you stop to think that of all the department stores in New York, this one was the most beautiful, the most luxurious. It breaks your heart, it really does.
LORENZO: Lorenzo Junior, my grandson. Say hello Lorenzo and I are going to the movies
LORENZO: Lorenzo and I are going to the movies
BEN: How old are you, Lorenzo?
BEN: I do now.
BEN: I think your grandpa just wants to scare you a little.
LORENZO: Here, this should fit you. Lorenzo, put your coat on. We are already late. There's a drop of Jack Daniel's in the cupboard. To keep yourself warm.
BEN: See you tomorrow.
BEN: A few inches of water cover the basement floor. One of the water pipes must have burst due to the cold.
MICHAEL: Why did they say on TV that it wasn't supposed to snow today, but tomorrow instead? Why did they lie?
DAISY: Sometimes they make mistakes, Michael. It happens.
MICHAEL: Grown-ups don't make mistakes. Only little children do.
DAISY: Michael turns around and sees Ben exiting his 1986 Oldsmobile, with a big wrapped package in his arms. The children abandon their snowman and rush towards their father. Ben takes Michael into his arms-
MICHAEL: ( pointing to the wrapped What is that?
BEN: Well I don't know, I just found this package hidden behind a tree.
MICHAEL: Is it for me?
BEN: ( to his daughter ) Daisy, has Michael been a good boy? Does he deserve his birthday present?
DAISY: No! Yesterday he finished the whole bag of candy when mom had told him he could only have one piece.
MICHAEL: Not true!
DAISY: Yes it's true!
MICHAEL: No, it's not true. She's lying Daddy. I've been a very good boy, I promise.
BEN: Is mom back?
DAISY: Not yet. Rosa came to pick us up from school today.
BEN: Hello Rosa!
ROSA: Hello Señor Carson. How are you?
BEN: I'm good, very good. What time will Amy be back?
ROSA: Not before six, Sir.
BEN: OK, I'll wait for her.
ROSA: Do you want me to fix you a snack?
BEN: No, thank you. I'll be fine. Happy birthday, Michael.
MICHAEL: What is it?
DAISY: Duh, open it stupid!
AMY: Hi Rosa. Where are the kids?
ROSA: ( in a low voice ) .With Señor Ben.
BEN: Hey Amy.
MICHAEL: Look Mommy, look what Daddy got me.
AMY: It's great, you will have to show me how it works!
MICHAEL: It's so fast Mommy!
AMY: Ben, can I talk to you, in private?
BEN: ( to his kids ) Ok kids, it's time for your bath. No fooling around. What is this? I already asked you not to drop by without calling, didn't I?
AMY: What is this? I already asked you not to drop by without calling, didn't I?
BEN: I do, but you never take my calls!
AMY: I don't need your calls in the middle of the night. I'm better off without I haven't had a drink in three months but, then again, how would you know?
BEN: I haven't had a drink in three months but, then again, how would you know?
AMY: I don't want to know, Ben. I don't want to hear about it. It's not my problem. You're not my problem. You've done more than enough harm already.
BEN: You don't think people can change?
AMY: We are not talking about people, we're talking about you. How many times did you tell me you were gonna change and nothing happened? It only got worse.
BEN: Just give me another chance.
AMY: I need more time, Ben. Listen, I will never stop you from seeing your children but we have to set up some
BEN: WHAT RULES?! IT'S MY SON'S FUCKING BIRTHDAY TODAY! COME ON AMY, WHAT RULE IS GOING TO STOP ME FROM SEEING HIM?
AMY: Look at yourself. You're still carrying around so much of that anger.
BEN: ( trying to calm down ) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you. Things could be so different between us.
AMY: Yes I know, but it's up to you Ben.
BEN: Yeah. Anyway, I wasn't planning on staying. My shift starts in an hour. I'll just kiss them goodbye and then I'm leaving.
MICHAEL: Yes, honey.
AMY: Yes, honey.
MICHAEL: Is Daddy coming back to live with us?
AMY: I don't know sweetheart. I don't know.
BEN: I haven't managed to find the source of the leak. My guess is it doesn't come from the store. It must be a municipal pipe that blew with the I'll call the company tomorrow morning and have them come take a look at it.
LORENZO: I'll call the company tomorrow morning and have them come take a look at it.
ESSEKER: Ben chews over these seven letters. Is it somebody's name? A place? A code? Initials? He folds it up again and puts everything back, neatly, in the wallet that he stows away in one of the drawers.
ANGELA: ( intrigued ) What are you looking at?
BEN: Nothing special.
ANGELA: ( playfully ) Come on, you've been looking at yourself for more than half an hour. You never used to be so vain.
BEN: You can't avoid them. They're What are you talking about?
ANGELA: What are you talking about?
BEN: The mirrors. In the department store, at every street corner, in the windows of every fucking building in this city. I feel like I'm not the one looking into the mirrors, but rather they're looking at me.
ANGELA: You need a drink.
BEN: No, I'm serious.
ANGELA: Don't you think you're being a little bit paranoid?
BEN: The silhouette remains still.
BEN: Ben opens the door to a UPS deliveryman holding out a package-
DELIVERYMAN: Mr. Carson? Would you mind signing here, please?
LORENZO: I've just been through the craziest day here. No kidding! Your ex- colleagues came to pay us a visit.
BEN: What happened?
LORENZO: You know Gary, the guy who was working here before you, the cops found him dead in a subway station in Harlem. I never liked him too much, but poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like Did they mention the cause of death?
BEN: Did they mention the cause of death?
LORENZO: No. they wouldn't tell me.
BEN: Have a good night, Lorenzo.
BEN: ( to himself ) Damn. What is happening to me?
AMY: Are you OK? What's happening? What are you doing here?
BEN: Amy, I need you to do me a favor.
AMY: Listen, I am in the middle of work, I don't really have time now.
BEN: I need your help. It won't take more than twenty minutes. Please, Amy?
AMY: Why do you want to see him?
BEN: He used to work at the Mayflower as a night watchman, before I replaced him.
AMY: Where did you get his driver's I found his wallet in the department store. I need to find out how he You are no longer a cop, Ben. This isn't your business anymore.
BEN: I found his wallet in the department store. I need to find out how he You are no longer a cop, Ben. This isn't your business anymore.
AMY: You are no longer a cop, Ben. This isn't your business anymore.
BEN: He sent me a package before he died, with newspaper articles about the Mayflower. I think he was trying to tell me something. I don't know him. I've never even met him, Amy. I need to figure this out.
YOUNG DOCTOR: Gary Lewis. Gary Lewis. Oh, there he is, 58B. He slashed his throat.
AMY: ( to Ben ) There you go. There's your answer. Your man committed suicide.
BEN: You know a lot of people who cut their own throats?
YOUNG DOCTOR: ( interrupting ) Well, all I know is that the cops are still investigating this one. That's why we still have the body. People can be very creative when it comes to suicide. I'm sure it's not the craziest thing you've seen.
AMY: I've got to get back to work, Ben. They're waiting for me upstairs.
BEN: How. What did he slit his throat with?
YOUNG DOCTOR: With. with a piece of mirror.
GARY: Ben jumps out of his skin and backs away, terrified. Neither Amy nor the doctor saw anything, of course. They gaze at him with a puzzled look-
AMY: Are you OK, Ben? What's going on?
BEN: ( coming to his senses ) I need to see his files.
AMY: Ben raises his voice.
BEN: I NEED TO SEE HIS FILES! Come on, Ben, what is it you're after? I am not supposed to show you any file. You're not even allowed to be here. I could get fired for this.
AMY: Come on, Ben, what is it you're after? I am not supposed to show you any file. You're not even allowed to be here. I could get fired for this.
YOUNG DOCTOR: Well, I'll be off. Amy, you know where to find me if you need me.
AMY: What is happening to you? What is all this supposed to mean? What is going on, Ben?
BEN: I won't leave until I see that file.
BEN: Look at this picture. Come and see,
AMY: Ben points to the reflection in the mirror-
BEN: Look at the piece of mirror in his hand. In the reflection of the mirror it's covered in blood, and look- in reality, it's clean. Not a drop of So what?
AMY: So what?
BEN: Don't you find it strange that this mirror doesn't reflect an exact image of reality?
AMY: I can't see the difference. It must be an effect of the angle from which the photograph was taken. What is it you are you trying to prove?
BEN: What if the mirrors were showing us something different?
AMY: What? For Christ's sake, listen to yourself, Ben! What are you talking What if the mirrors were reflecting something that goes beyond reality?
BEN: What if the mirrors were reflecting something that goes beyond reality?
AMY: ( irritated ) OK. This is way over my head. I don't have time for your barfly theories. Thanks for your help.
BEN: Thanks for your help.
AMY: You should go home and get some rest. This guy probably just killed himself because he couldn't live with himself anymore. It happens to thousands of people, you know.
ESSEKER: He contemplates the dripping letters for a long moment, trying to interpret their meaning.
ANGELA: I'm off. Amy called me today, she's worried about you. What's happening, Please, not you.
BEN: Please, not you.
ANGELA: I'm your sister, you can talk to me. Is it your new job? That place, the Mayflower, has bad vibes. It's getting under your skin. Just think about what I told you.
BEN: I made a deal, Angie. I can't just walk out on them like that. I need this job, I need the money. I'm not going to sleep on your couch for the rest of my life!
ANGELA: You won't have any trouble finding another one. A daytime job, a regular
BEN: LEAVE ME ALONE.
BEN: Mrs. Lewis. Sorry to bother you. My name is Ben Carson. I worked with Gary, at Mayflower. Could I come up and talk to you for a few minutes? Mrs. Lewis ?
MRS. LEWIS: .5th floor, apartment 3B.
MRS. LEWIS: .My Gary hadn't slept at home for three weeks. At first I figured he had found himself a girlfriend, so I didn't worry much about it. It's terrible. The policeman told me that he was living in the streets. They found his body in the subway. Why? He had everything he needed here. Every morning I would have his breakfast ready when he'd come home from work.
BEN: Did he use any drugs?
MRS. LEWIS: Gary? Huh-huh! Never. He was a good Did you notice anything different, the days prior to his leaving the house, anything unusual in his behavior?
BEN: Did you notice anything different, the days prior to his leaving the house, anything unusual in his behavior?
MRS. LEWIS: Oh yes, but that goes way back to when he started working at Mayflower.
BEN: What kind of changes?
MRS. LEWIS: He didn't care much for anything anymore. Before, we'd sit up and watch television together. But once he started that job as a night watchman, he'd spend all his time-off locked up in his room.
BEN: MRS. LEWIS
MRS. LEWIS: He hardly slept anymore. He was way too busy!
BEN: Busy doing what?
MRS. LEWIS: That, I don't know. I never knew what he was up to.
BEN: Is that you standing next to him?
MRS. LEWIS: Yes, back in the days.
BEN: Mrs. Lewis, I found a note that Gary A piece of paper, where he'd scribbled down the name, Esseker. Does that mean anything to you?
MRS. LEWIS: Esseker, is that what you're saying?
BEN: May I see his room?
MRS. LEWIS: Yes, of course. Come, follow me, it's down the hallway, the door at the very Do you mind if I stay in here for a
BEN: Do you mind if I stay in here for a
MRS. LEWIS: He would spend hours looking at
BEN: ( shouting )
BEN: I'm here Ma'am.
BLACK SCREEN: ( CONTINUED )
MICHAEL: Mom! Mom!
AMY: What is it Michael?
MICHAEL: There's a lady screaming.
AMY: Where Michael?
MICHAEL: There. In the mirror.
AMY: No, Michael. Look, there's nothing I saw her mom. I swear I did.
MICHAEL: I saw her mom. I swear I did.
AMY: It was just a nightmare. It's late, you have to go back to sleep. I'll turn on the night-light, if you want.
DAISY: Mom, can you leave the door open?
AMY: Sure sweetheart. OK, you two go to sleep now.
ANGELA: Hello. Ben?
ANGELA: No, no, I just got home from work. What's wrong? You sound strange.
ANGELA: Are you sure?
ANGELA: What happened?
ANGELA: That's the smart thing to do, Ben. You deserve better than that. You should come back here and get some sleep.
ANGELA: Are you sure?
ANGELA: Be careful. Love you.
BEN: Love you too, sis.
LARRY: What is it?
POLICE INSPECTOR: Look. Isn't Ben Carson in the picture?
LARRY: The water has obliterated most of the marks. No trace of struggle or broken entry, the entrance door was locked.
AMY: He would never have laid a finger on her. When their father died, Ben took care of his sister. Angela meant the world to him.
LARRY: Listen, so far, his statement is pretty consistent with the facts. We checked it out, he did place a call from work at 12:30, and the woman's downstairs neighbors claim they started noticing the water leakage at around two in the morning. The daytime security guard, Lorenzo Sappeli, confirms he came on after Ben's shift at seven a.m. The only strange thing, and it may just be a coincidence, is that Ben told Sappeli that he had decided to quit his job, as if he was planning to go away somewhere. Did he mention anything about it to you?
AMY: No, lately, communication hasn't quite been our strong point. I only found out yesterday that he was staying at his sister's. What are you going to do with him?
LARRY: I figure we'll let him go. At this point we haven't got any real reason to keep him here. And, I think he's had his share for the day.
AMY: You know what's gonna happen if you let him go. He won't stop here. I know him, he won't stop until he finds who did this to her.
LARRY: Listen, where we stand now, we got nothing, not a single clue. I'm sure he can help us.
AMY: What kind of friend are you? You are using him. He's not a cop anymore.
LARRY: He's still the best one I know, even if he's one of the suspects.
AMY: You have to see someone Ben. You cannot stay in this situation any longer. You need help, psychological
BEN: No, I don't want to put them in any What do you mean?
AMY: What do you mean?
BEN: I've got things I need to deal with.
AMY: Ben, look at me! I don't want you to get into any trouble. Think about Daisy and Michael. You are not going to solve this case. Please, stay out of it.
BEN: She asked me to quit and they got to What? Who are you talking about?
AMY: What? Who are you talking about?
BEN: I know who did this Amy.
AMY: In that case, you have to tell them They wouldn't believe me and neither would you. Goodbye. Ben, wait.
BEN: They wouldn't believe me and neither would you. Goodbye. Ben, wait.
AMY: Ben, wait.
RECONSTITUTED!: Ben's shock and disbelief give way to rage. He fires, in a fury, emptying the entire clip this time- Again, the bullet holes vanish, leaving Ben alone, face to face with his own reflection. He breaks down nervously-
BEN: Why did you do it? WHY? WHY DID YOU
WANT?!: Suddenly, one after the other, letters, start appearing in one of the mirrors, as if an invisible finger were tracing them in the dust-
REKESSE: Ben turns around, and in the reflection of the opposite mirror he recognizes the inverted word- the same word he found on the note in Gary's wallet, the word Ben himself had traced in his bathroom mirror-
ESSEKER: CUT TO:
BEN: .Look up Esseker. Yes, Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo, Kilo, Echo, Romeo. Esseker. No idea, my guess is that it's a name. No, I haven't got a first name. Yes, in New York. Over the past five or six years. I know it's hazy but that's all I've got. I already looked it up in the phone book. I also called someone at the IRS and at the DMV, but nothing there. It's very important Larry. You'll call me back?
AMY: Do you want the cereal in your hot chocolate or in a separate bowl?
MICHAEL: In the chocolate.
AMY: .In the chocolate, please, mom.
MICHAEL: ( repeating after her ) .Please, mom.
DAISY: Yuck, that's gross, how can you eat Come on, come on, let's get going, or you're going to be late for school.
AMY: Come on, come on, let's get going, or you're going to be late for school.
DAISY: What is it sweetheart?
AMY: What is it sweetheart?
DAISY: Do you know that Michael has a new
MICHAEL: No, that's not true!
AMY: Really, what's his name?
MICHAEL: ( to his sister ) You promised not to tell.
AMY: Does he go to your school?
MICHAEL: He doesn't want me to talk about him. Why doesn't he want you to talk about him? Is he a grown up?
AMY: Why doesn't he want you to talk about him? Is he a grown up?
MICHAEL: So, he's a little boy your age, then?
AMY: So, he's a little boy your age, then?
DAISY: He lives in the mirror in our room.
AMY: Is it your father who told you that?
MICHAEL: No Mommy.
AMY: OK. Come on, come on guys, let's get our teeth brushed, and our coats on. The first one in the car is the
DR. MORRIS: A feeling of self-hatred, generally triggered by a psychological shock can split the personality in two, hence creating two or more personalities with distinct memories or behavior patterns within the same individual. The patient then has a faulty perception of the existence of two distinct worlds, which are principally the "real" word, and the world "inside the mirror".
BEN: Did you consider Terrence innocent?
DR. MORRIS: In my opinion, he was convinced that he was telling the truth when he claimed he didn't kill his family. I too am convinced that when it happened, Terrence was not himself, but rather his double, his mirror image, one might say.
DR. MORRIS: These recordings are from Terrence's trial. You will find that they speak for themselves.
TERRENCE: In order to. to destroy the mirrors. Only fire can destroy a mirror, isn't that right, Doctor?
DR. MORRIS: What made you think you absolutely had to destroy those mirrors, Terrence?
TERRENCE: They killed Helen and my three little For what reason? Why would mirrors want to kill your family?
DR. MORRIS: For what reason? Why would mirrors want to kill your family?
TERRENCE: Because I didn't.
DR. MORRIS: Didn't do what?
TERRENCE: They asked me to find Esseker. Like they did with the others.
DR. MORRIS: Who are the others you're talking I wasn't the first one they asked.
TERRENCE: I wasn't the first one they asked.
DR. MORRIS: And what happened?
TERRENCE: I didn't succeed. I didn't succeed in finding Esseker.
BEN: ( to Dr. Morris ) I have to go.
DR. MORRIS: Tell me about Esseker, Terrence.
TERRENCE: I DON'T KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS! I DON'T KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS, I DON'T KNOW!!
DAISY: What are you doing dad?
BEN: Don't worry, there's nothing wrong. Everything is OK.
DAISY: But why are you doing that?
BEN: I'm doing it to protect you.
AMY: Do you mind telling me what the hell you're doing?
BEN: Look Amy, you've got to trust me, I know what I'm doing. It's for your own I want you to stop what you're doing and get out of our house right now.
AMY: I want you to stop what you're doing and get out of our house right now.
BEN: You have to trust me Amy, I'm not completely crazy. These mirrors are dangerous. At first, I thought it was only the ones at the store, but now I know they can get you anywhere. They got Angela. I promise I'll leave the house once I've taken them all down.
AMY: Do you realize what you're saying, Ben? What is wrong with you? I know that what you're going through isn't easy. Angela was a part of our lives too, but you have no right to do this to us. Ever since your obsession with these damn mirrors the kids are scared to death. Your son has nightmares. He's scared Ben. Your behavior is starting to rub off on him. He's only 5 years old. And I have to protect
BEN: Come Amy, come with me, I want to show you something.
BEN: Look, you'll see.
AMY: What are you doing with that gun. Put it down, BEN. PUT IT DOWN RIGHT NOW!
COMPLETELY MAD?: Ben smiles, all excited-
BEN: Wait, look, you'll see.
AMY: SEE WHAT, BEN?! WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SEE ?!
SEE ?!: Ben keeps a piercing gaze as the bullet impacts the mirror, waiting for the magic to do its trick and for the cracks to dissolve again-
BEN: But. I swear to you I. I saw.Amy.
AMY: Get out.now! I don't ever want to see you here again, Ben. And I'll have the lawyers make sure the same goes for the kids. You are insane, Ben, and dangerous. You've got to get help.
BEN: Hello, Larry? It's me. I'm going to need your help again-
BEN: Mayflower used to be a hospital before it became a department store. St. John's Hospital. Do you have any idea where all the medical records could have ended up after it closed down?
BEN: Go to the city hall archives. They must have something considering it was a public hospital.
BEN: Larry, Larry stop it. If I could go myself, I wouldn't be asking you. Go to the City Hall archives, and ask them to look up Esseker among the former patients. Please.
BEN: Please, do it for me.
BEN: Talk to you later.
LARRY: This ought to make you happy. Anna Esseker.
BEN: Perfect, Larry. That's perfect.
LARRY: Everyone's real edgy up there. You're still a fuckin' murder suspect. People are wondering why I let you out. You have to tell me more. What does the history of the Mayflower have to do with the death of your sister?
BEN: I don't know exactly. I can't tell you, but some really fucked up things started happening to me when I took the job over there. Nothing makes any sense to me either but I have to follow my instinct.
LARRY: What happened? Did you have an
BEN: Anna Esseker. Where did you find her files? Did you go to City Hall?
LARRY: No, you were wrong about that, they had nothing. All the medical records from St. John's Hospital are still up there with the unclassified cases.
BEN: When the nurses went on their rounds, first thing on the morning of October 6th, they discovered that all the patients had left their rooms during the night and gathered in the main room. All of them were dead, including the girl. Apparently, they had killed one another. A slaughter house. After that they shut down the place. Nobody ever found out what really happened.

BEN: What about the doctor? Dr. Kane?
LARRY: He was arrested. They found him dead on the first day of his hearing. He had slit his wrists with a piece of his cell mirror!
BEN: You're still alive, aren't you?
AMY: Come on, come on. Let's go. Daisy,
AMY: What are you doing Michael? Come on, we're going to be late.
SQUATTING POSITION!: HE LOOKS AT AMY WITH A BIG SMILE. Amy attempts to speak but can't- The mirror image of her son remains silent. Amy steps closer to the mirror and, in the reflection, behind the boy, she discovers-
BEN: Amy ? What's wrong?
BEN: Amy cannot get the words out. The convulsive sobs overtake her
BEN: What's happening?
BEN: Where are Daisy and Michael? Are the kids all right?
BEN: Get out of the house. I'll be right
BEN: I'm right here, Amy. I'm here now. Thank god you're alright.
AMY: We can't stay here, we have to leave the house now. We can go to my mother's or to a hotel.
BEN: Anyplace is gonna have mirrors or windows. Anything you can see your self in is dangerous. We have to make the house safe. The only way is to cover all the reflections. If we keep them in the dark we can avoid them. We need paint, we need tape.
DAISY: When will you be back, Dad?
BEN: As quickly as I can, sweetheart. I
MICHAEL: I love you, Dad.
AMY: What if you don't find her? Maybe she doesn't live there anymore? Maybe she's really dead.
BEN: They want her, I'm gonna find her wherever she is. We don't have any other choice.
AMY: I know.
BEN: Amy, I want you to stay here with the kids until all this is over. All the mirrors are covered, there's no more danger. I'll come back as soon as I
BEN: Hello. Is this the Esseker farmhouse?
WOMAN'S VOICE: What is it Jimmy?
JIMMY: I don't know Mom. What can I do for you sir?
BEN: I am looking for Anna, Anna Esseker.
JIMMY: ( to his mother inside ) There's a man who's looking for. ( back to Ben ) You said Anna? ( Ben confirms ) Anna Esseker, Mom!
JIMMY'S MOTHER: What is it you want with Anna Esseker?
BEN: I huh. I am doing some research for a book on the history of St. John's Hospital, in New York.

ROBERT: You know, up to this day, the visions of Anna's fits still haunt me at

ROBERT: You don't know? She died there with all of Kane's other patients. Anna left the hospital two days before the massacre. Kane changed the records to make her disappear.
BEN: Anna left the hospital two days before the massacre. Kane changed the records to make her disappear.
ROBERT: You're not a journalist, are you? What do you want?
BEN: I want to know. After St. John's, where did she go?
ROBERT: Anna came back to live with us for a For a while?
BEN: For a while?
ROBERT: Because. Because strange things started to happen in the house.
BEN: With Anna?
ROBERT: No, not with Anna.
BEN: With the mirrors?
ROBERT: Before he died, Kane sent us a letter asking us to keep Anna away from mirrors and that whatever happens she should be in a place where the mirrors could never find her.
BEN: Where is she now?
ROBERT: To protect us, she left the house and joined the monastic orders, where mirrors are forbidden. St. Augustine's monastery, on the road to Midwich.
SISTER: Yes, how can I help you?
BEN: Hello Sister. I have come to visit a member of your community. Sister Anna? Her real name is Anna Esseker.
SISTER: Is she expecting you?
BEN: No, not really.
SISTER: Are you a relative?
BEN: Listen, Sister, I must see her.
SISTER: If you are not listed, I cannot help you sir.
BEN: Please, tell her that I came all the way from New York and that I work with Dr. Kane at St. John's Hospital.
SISTER: Wait here for a moment.
SISTER: Sister Anna has agreed to talk to you, you may proceed to the parlor next
SISTER ANNA: St. John's closed down in 1952. Who are you?

SISTER ANNA: What is it you want Mr. Carson?
BEN: I need your help.
SISTER ANNA: My help? I don't quite see how I could possibly be of any help.
BEN: My wife and children are in danger. What is threatening my family is asking for you.
SISTER ANNA: I cannot leave the precincts. It's Tell me why are the mirrors from the old hospital so determined to find
BEN: Tell me why are the mirrors from the old hospital so determined to find
SISTER ANNA: It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me, but of what is imprisoned inside them. The mirrors are merely windows on our world.
BEN: A window. For what? For whom?
ANNA: At the time that I was at St. John's, Dr. Kane's therapy for personality disorders consisted of locking the patient up in a mirrored room for several days on end, in order to force him to confront his own image. I spent the darkest days of my life in that room. On the 6th day the nurses found me lifeless, almost dead. Since that day, I have never had another fit. But deep down inside I've always known the What truth?
BEN: What truth?
ANNA: There is no cure for schizophrenia, it was something else, Mr. Carson. And whatever it was, it entered the
BEN: It entered with you and they need you to get out.
ANNA: The consequences of such an act, Mr. Carson, would be more devastating than letting them suffer where they are now. I'm going to pray for you and your family. That's all I can do right now, Mr. Carson. God bless you.
BEN: Wait. Please, listen to me- Terence Berry, Gary Lewis and many others before me. Those are the people who died trying to find you. Because they failed, their families died too. My sister was murdered two days ago. My wife and kids will next if you don't come with me. Look-
