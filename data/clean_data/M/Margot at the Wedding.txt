CLAUDE: He's met by a severe and pinched face. The eyes have black circles there is a scar above her lip. Claude instantly blushes and mumbles:
CLAUDE: He gets up and hurries a few seats further. He slides next to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder length hair. Her name is Margot.
MARGOT: That was quick.
CLAUDE: I sat next to the wrong person.
MARGOT: Really? Where? Please don't look. She'll see you.
CLAUDE: Please don't look. She'll see you.
MARGOT: Careful with my blouse.
CLAUDE: Will the wedding be crowded?
MARGOT: I don't know. I think she doesn't know anyone anymore.
CLAUDE: How long has she known Malcolm?
MARGOT: Only a year.
CLAUDE: Is that short?
MARGOT: ( pointedly ) Would you marry someone you'd only known a year?
CLAUDE: I'm not going to ever get married.
MARGOT: I can't say I have a lot of hope for the whole thing.
CLAUDE: Why are we going then?
MARGOT: We're supporting her.
CLAUDE: I thought she wasn't speaking to No.no.I wasn't speaking to her, but I'm over it.
MARGOT: No.no.I wasn't speaking to her, but I'm over it.
MARGOT: Why aren't you wearing your new I don't think I need them right You begged for those glasses.
CLAUDE: I don't think I need them right You begged for those glasses.
MARGOT: You begged for those glasses.
CLAUDE: I know, but.I will wear them, I just feel like people might think it's weird that a kid is wearing dark shades.
MARGOT: That's ridiculous. You look very cool.
MARGOT: You look very cool.
CLAUDE: I don't need them right now.
CLAUDE: Do they know we're here?
MALCOLM: Are you.?
MALCOLM: Paul apologizes for not coming, she's still getting the house I'm sorry it was such short notice.
MARGOT: I'm sorry it was such short notice.
MALCOLM: I don't care. Paul's frantic, but I don't give a shit. Oh, and Ingrid wants me to tell you that she made us all bracelets.
INGRID: ( embarrassed ) No, I wanted.I wanted to wait.
MALCOLM: Oh, I thought you asked me to tell them. Anyway. I got Knicks colors.
MALCOLM: I got Knicks colors.
INGRID: They're not Knicks colors!
MARGOT: It's beautiful, Ingrid.
INGRID: ( to Claude ) I made this one for myself.
INGRID: Yours is yellow. Is that okay?
CLAUDE: I guess.
INGRID: Where's your dad and Josh?
CLAUDE: They might come later.
MARGOT: Josh's spring break is next week. Jim teaches through Friday and then they open the house in Vermont on the weekend.
MALCOLM: ( bluntly ) It means a lot to Pauline that you're here.
MARGOT: Oh. Good.
MALCOLM: Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack!
MALCOLM: If you're wondering about the No, I wasn't.
MARGOT: No, I wasn't.
MALCOLM: I had a full beard for a while and then when I shaved it I left this part for last, you know to see how it looked, and. It's meant to be
PAULINE: You're so handsome.
PAULINE: I never thought I'd get you here. You're arriving in the midst of a drama. Ingrid, make sure Wizard is
PAULINE: You're arriving in the midst of a drama. Ingrid, make sure Wizard is
INGRID: It's the Voglers.
PAULINE: The neighbors want us to cut down our tree.
MARGOT: No, that's our tree!
INGRID: They think it's sick and rotting their property.
PAULINE: We're having the ceremony under it.
MARGOT: You took the swing down.
MALCOLM: Pauline thinks this is their way of trying to be friends. I think they resent us because we're.
MALCOLM: I don't know what we are.
INGRID: This is my room.
CLAUDE: Do you like showers or baths?
INGRID: Do you like showers or baths?
CLAUDE: Showers. What about you?
INGRID: I don't care.
PAULINE: Is Malcolm what you thought he'd Well, I didn't know what to
MARGOT: Well, I didn't know what to
PAULINE: The moustache is temporary. He left it for last when he was shaving. It's meant to be funny.
MARGOT: He told me.
PAULINE: They enter the guest room. The windows are wide open, the curtains blowing, but the room is very neatly made up.
PAULINE: I'm sorry with so little time to prepare, we had to put you in Malcolm's storage room
MARGOT: This was Becky's room. Poor Becky.
PAULINE: Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a storage room. I've just started to feel like it's our house not my parents. You know?
MARGOT: Our parents.
PAULINE: Of course. It might still smell like paint, but.
MARGOT: I thought he was a musician.
PAULINE: Well, music's officially a hobby. He's painting now. And writing letters to newspapers and magazines. He's very meticulous, he'll spend up to a week writing a response to a music review. He's incredibly smart. Maybe too smart. I don't know. We're doing very Good. I mean, you must be. I don't know where to begin. What can I tell you? It seems I'm pregnant, but it's really early so. I haven't told anyone. I mean, I haven't told Malcolm or Yeah, if it sticks. We'll see. I hope so. Things are good. We did a couples seminar two months ago or so in Maine. They give you exercises and things to do. I know you're not convinced, but.
MARGOT: Good. I mean, you must be. I don't know where to begin. What can I tell you? It seems I'm pregnant, but it's really early so. I haven't told anyone.

MARGOT: ( vaguely ) Mm hm.
PAULINE: We got engaged right afterwards. The guy who runs it, Strickland, wrote a really interesting book about loving which I'll lend you if you want.
MARGOT: ( non-committal ) But only if you'll read it. Because I need it back. I made notes in the margins.
PAULINE: But only if you'll read it. Because I need it back. I made notes in the margins.
MARGOT: I may not get to it for a while.
PAULINE: Well, I'm not going to lend it to you if you're not going to read it.
PAULINE: It's going to be very informal by the way. Just Mom and Becky. Malcolm's brother. Few friends. And now you and Claude. Nothing like the first one.
MARGOT: ( wary ) Becky's coming?
PAULINE: You go.
MARGOT: I was going to say, "I'd really like some white wine."
PAULINE: Oh. Yeah. We have a. Well.I'm glad you changed your mind and came. I never heard from you after I sent the invite.I even wondered if you got it.
MARGOT: ( quickly ) Well, I'm so pleased we're here.
PAULINE: Did you get it?
MARGOT: Pauline waits for an explanation.
MARGOT: I'm sorry you were so angry.
PAULINE: I wasn't angry. I Uh huh. But you see when you say, "disappointed" it puts me in a crummy situation. Like I let you But you did in a way.
MARGOT: Uh huh. But you see when you say, "disappointed" it puts me in a crummy situation. Like I let you But you did in a way.
PAULINE: But you did in a way.
MARGOT: I don't see it like that.
PAULINE: Fine. I felt betrayed. Is that word okay?
MARGOT: Again, you're making me the You were the aggressor. Let's not. I've become a really good cook.
PAULINE: You were the aggressor. Let's not. I've become a really good cook.
MARGOT: I can't believe you've still got all of our old records.
INGRID: Mom, can you hide this please.
PAULINE: ( for Margot's benefit ) Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek In the late `80's. It was a solo gig after he left the Cars.
MALCOLM: In the late `80's. It was a solo gig after he left the Cars.
CLAUDE: So, you're kind of famous.
MALCOLM: No. No. Believe me, I'm not. I used to want to be, but, No. Do you want to be famous?
MARGOT: Claude wants to be very famous.
MALCOLM: Well, make sure you can handle rejection. I can't. For me, expectation just turns to disappointment. So, ultimately I'd rather not try. It'll all go black for us soon enough anyway.
PAULINE: Claude, ignore him.
PAULINE: When your mother moved to New York she used to send me books and records. She sent me REM's And the Pixies.
MARGOT: And the Pixies.
PAULINE: And X. She was very cool your You only liked top forty.
MARGOT: You only liked top forty.
PAULINE: Yeah, but I love REM now.
MARGOT: I don't really listen to music I was dating that guy, Horace back then. Remember him?
PAULINE: I was dating that guy, Horace back then. Remember him?
MARGOT: Was that the guy who liked to rough you up?
PAULINE: No, that was our dad.
MARGOT: Our father used to strip down to his skivvies and beat us with a That man had a sexual screw loose.
MALCOLM: That man had a sexual screw loose.
PAULINE: It's awful that stuff that happens to kids. Malcolm was fondled by a male baby-sitter.
MALCOLM: Just use that information however you want.
PAULINE: Sorry. We're with family. I
PAULINE: I think Becky got it the worst.
MARGOT: Did she ever. Raped by the horse
TOBY: Alan rolled over in bed and looked at me and he said I can't feel my face. It took three doctors before we knew it was Bells Palsy.
ALAN: They say a brush of wind can do it.
TOBY: Feeling is slowly coming back.
MALCOLM: We're all getting older. Which is terrible I don't care how universal it is. I can't remember names anymore.
MARGOT: I have that. I blank out on certain words now too. Like the other day, I couldn't remember the word for. I've forgotten it again. The stuff in wine. Sediment! That was it.
MALCOLM: I know that. I was talking more about not remembering who was the bassist for Motley Crüe.
PAULINE: Ingrid, why don't you show Claude and Bruce the game trunk.
INGRID: Claude reluctantly follows Ingrid and Bruce. He looks back longingly at the table of adults.
MALCOLM: ( relieved, to himself ) Mick Mars.
MARGOT: Toby, I think you need to have Bruce diagnosed.
TOBY: Margot, I don't want to have this conversation with you.
MARGOT: It's vital. If you keep telling him he's like everyone else he'll wonder why he isn't. He's He's tested very well. He does B's in school.
TOBY: He's tested very well. He does B's in school.
MARGOT: But, that's how autism works. One part of the brain can work fine while the other is damaged.
ALAN: We had him diagnosed, Margot. Nothing was found wrong.
MARGOT: Did you really, though?
TOBY: I'm.I'm not going to have this conversation. I'm sorry.
MARGOT: I know it must be so difficult for you, but I think you have to
JIM'S VOICE: What are you doing?
MARGOT: I left you a note.
JIM'S VOICE: Come back. Or meet me in Vermont on Saturday.
MARGOT: No.no. The wedding is on Saturday. I'm here for that. I can't really pull out. How would that look?
JIM'S VOICE: You haven't spoken to her in years -
MARGOT: Well, we're speaking now. She is my closest friend despite it all. You're the one who's been trying to get me to call her.
JIM'S VOICE: Did you tell Claude what you're Jim, this guy, Malcolm. He's exactly what you'd imagine except I think he's clinically depressed.
MARGOT: ( suddenly laughing ) Jim, this guy, Malcolm. He's exactly what you'd imagine except I think he's clinically depressed.
MARGOT: JIM'S VOICE JIM'S VOICE ( silence )
JIM'S VOICE: You said you weren't a hundred percent on this. You said that like a week ago. Can I come up No. I don't want to see you I feel happier already having done Really? You feel happier. Please don't tell Claude anything please, until we've talked more.
MARGOT: No. I don't want to see you I feel happier already having done Really? You feel happier. Please don't tell Claude anything please, until we've talked more.
JIM'S VOICE: Really? You feel happier. Please don't tell Claude anything please, until we've talked more.
MARGOT: I need to tell him. And we need to tell Josh. Did he do his homework?
JIM'S VOICE: This is happening and you have to get your mind around that.
MARGOT: This is happening and you have to get your mind around that.
MARGOT: Are you asleep?
CLAUDE: ( softly )
MARGOT: Will you remember this?
CLAUDE: I just talked to your dad.
MARGOT: I just talked to your dad.
MARGOT: I'm only going to tell you if you won't remember.
CLAUDE: Margot hesitates. She changes her mind and says Margot stands. She catches herself in a warped mirror and smears some eye make-up off of her face.
MARGOT: Everyone finds you so funny and charming. I always get compliments about you.
MARGOT: Are you having fun? Is it nice to see Pauline?
CLAUDE: ( opens his eyes ) Yeah, I really like her.
MARGOT: Yeah. She is crazy though.
CLAUDE: In what way?
MARGOT: She's really berserk. Maybe it's hormones. You don't notice anything different about Pauline?
CLAUDE: She's pregnant she told me. But she's keeping it a secret I mean from Malcolm and even Ingrid. Which I think is unforgiveable. Now she'll have to marry him. What's she planning to get married and not drink champagne? Then she'll just be lying. I guess she's afraid she'll miscarry. She probably will. I think on some level she's ambivalent about the marriage and that's why she's not telling him.

CLAUDE: Are you stoned, Mom?
MARGOT: Maybe a little.
CLAUDE: I don't like it.
MALCOLM: ( shakes his head ) My scrotum is longer than my penis.
MALCOLM: It's sweet how Claude looks up to
MALCOLM: Margot doesn't seem as crazy as you made her out to be.
PAULINE: What she did to Toby and Alan tonight didn't seem crazy enough for you?
MALCOLM: I guess that seemed pretty crazy.
PAULINE: ( immediately defensive ) Well, she cares deeply.
MALCOLM: Yeah, she's really worried about This has nothing to do with Bruce. She thinks everyone is autistic.
PAULINE: This has nothing to do with Bruce. She thinks everyone is autistic.
PAULINE: Nothing, you keep changing your position I'm just trying to figure out if I should agree with you or not?
MALCOLM: Nothing, you keep changing your position I'm just trying to figure out if I should agree with you or not?
PAULINE: Well, can't she be both, care deeply and be crazy? Do people have to be all one thing?
MALCOLM: I guess not.
PAULINE: Well, okay. It is nice she came for the wedding. She's so pretty, don't you think?
MALCOLM: ( warily ) She's attractive.
PAULINE: A little thin maybe. But it is nice she came.
MALCOLM: Let's fuck.
MALCOLM: Fuck it! Honey, you're up.
MARGOT: Honey, you're up.
MARGOT: Claude, don't just whack it. Think about it before you hit.
CLAUDE: Pauline knocks her ball into Claude's. She holds her ball down with her foot and prepares to swing.
MALCOLM: Paul, what are you doing?
PAULINE: I'm sending Claude's ball into the Take the extra hit.
MALCOLM: Take the extra hit.
PAULINE: I don't want to do that.
MALCOLM: It's the smarter play.
PAULINE: Pauline! See, I knew you couldn't. Your feet are too
MALCOLM: Pauline! See, I knew you couldn't. Your feet are too
MARGOT: You took the awnings down. Well done.
PAULINE: Well done.
MALCOLM: Fuck you.
MARGOT: Honey, you're up. You're going the wrong way.
MARGOT: You're going the wrong way.
CLAUDE: He blushes and laughs. Pauline laughs. Margot shakes her
MARGOT: So stupid.
CLAUDE: Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.
CLAUDE: We're in the middle of it.
MARGOT: This is why I hate games. I hate what it does to me.
MARGOT: Malcolm, do you notice how Pauline sometimes can't make eye-contact. How her gaze hovers just above your Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.
MALCOLM: Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.
MARGOT: I always think I have something in my hair. It's not necessarily bad, Paul. It's just something you do. Claude have you ever seen your mother climb a tree?
PAULINE: Claude have you ever seen your mother climb a tree?
CLAUDE: We don't have much opportunity in As kids Margot climbed everything. She could even climb that tree.
MARGOT: We don't have much opportunity in As kids Margot climbed everything. She could even climb that tree.
PAULINE: As kids Margot climbed everything. She could even climb that tree.
CLAUDE: Can you do it, mom?
MARGOT: Maybe later.
CLAUDE: No, now.
INGRID: Do it now, Margot!
PAULINE: Show him, Margot.
PAULINE: I told you.
MARGOT: ( under her breath )
CLAUDE: What's she doing now?
PAULINE: ( dryly ) She's stuck.
MARGOT: ( annoyed ) I got it.
CLAUDE: You were great on the way up.
MARGOT: Don't patronize me, Claude.
PAULINE: We're all laughing, Margot.
MARGOT: You're laughing in a kind way. Claude is taking too much pleasure out of it.
CLAUDE: I am not.
MARGOT: You are. You like to make fun of me. To see me get embarrassed. It's mean.
PAULINE: What are you doing?
MARGOT: I've got a fucking bug in my ear,
PAULINE: I thought Claude could hand out programs. Ingrid's going to sing. Do you want to read a poem or You know I can't speak in front of people. I'm doing this "conversation" at the bookstore in town on Friday and I totally regret having said I'd do it.
MARGOT: You know I can't speak in front of people. I'm doing this "conversation" at the bookstore in town on Friday and I totally regret having said I'd do it.
PAULINE: You're doing a "conversation?"
MARGOT: Yeah, talking about my work in front of a crowd. I didn't invite you because.I thought it'd be Uh huh.
PAULINE: Uh huh.
MARGOT: What? Say it.
PAULINE: It's nothing. It's just.I would come.I want to come. I get a kick out of it. It's just weird, you know. So, you're not here Okay, I get it. When did they ask A while ago. I'd said, No, but then when I was coming here anyway and.I guess it helps sales I see.
MARGOT: A while ago. I'd said, No, but then when I was coming here anyway and.I guess it helps sales I see.
PAULINE: I see.
PAULINE: Did I tell you, Becky got her tubes Why? Is she seeing someone? She's still obese, I assume.
MARGOT: Why? Is she seeing someone? She's still obese, I assume.
PAULINE: I think it's symbolic.
MARGOT: I bet mom paid for it. We should audit mom.
PAULINE: I considered it in my twenties. You know, when I was fucking everyone. You remember.
MARGOT: I did my share.
PAULINE: But not like me.
MARGOT: You want to count?
PAULINE: No, Margot, I don't want to count. What was it about Dad that had us fucking so many guys?
MARGOT: I think it was the only time we could really feel unselfconscious and get out of our heads.
PAULINE: ( dismissive ) I don't think that's it. I just think it was something we were good
INGRID: Your mom thinks Bruce is gay.
CLAUDE: No, she said she had Aspergers.
INGRID: I thought that's what that means.
CLAUDE: No, it's like lesser retarded.
INGRID: I have adult ADD.
CLAUDE: You mean child ADD.
INGRID: No, for some reason I have the adult one. Maybe I'm retarded.
MAN: Come on!
LITTLE GIRL: I don't want to!
MAN: Come on!
LITTLE GIRL: I don't want
MARGOT: The man and woman turn around sharply.
MARGOT: Be careful!
WOMAN: Be careful the way you pull on that child's arm. You'll take it out of its socket.
MARGOT: Be careful the way you pull on that child's arm. You'll take it out of its socket.
MAN: Don't tell us how to treat our I don't care how you treat your child as long as you don't hurt It's a girl.
MARGOT: I don't care how you treat your child as long as you don't hurt It's a girl.
PAULINE: ( under her breath ) It's a girl.
WOMAN: She threw a rock at me.
MARGOT: She's a little girl!
WOMAN: She knew what she was doing.
WOMAN: There is no hitting in our family. Do you understand?
WOMAN: Stay out of it, bitch.
INGRID: That was the Voglers.
PAULINE: Jesus, Margot, what are you doing. They already hate us.
MARGOT: ( wiping her eyes ) Don't tell me what I can and can't do. That's child abuse.
CLAUDE: Mom, she was psychotic.
MARGOT: Stop picking on me. Everyone.
MARGOT: Oh God.
PAULINE: It could be anyone's.
INGRID: What are they going to do to us?
PAULINE: They're not going to do anything,
PAULINE: We have to cut down that tree.
MALCOLM: Where are we going to get married I don't.we'll do it in the fucking drive-way if we have to.
PAULINE: I don't.we'll do it in the fucking drive-way if we have to.
INGRID: Your mom started a war. We have to make sure we wear shoes because they might start throwing glass.
CLAUDE: Has that happened before?
INGRID: I can't remember. I think so. No, it definitely has. Now I remember.
PAULINE: Where are you going?
MARGOT: ( tersely ) To town. I'll be back for dinner.
PAULINE: Come on, nobody blames you, Margot.
CLAUDE: Is that Dick Koosman?
PAULINE: Yeah. He has a house up here.
CLAUDE: What's he doing with mom?
PAULINE: Good question.
INGRID: How much do your parents make in a I think about a hundred. They bank at Chase.
CLAUDE: I think about a hundred. They bank at Chase.
INGRID: Are they rich?
CLAUDE: No. They're middle class.
BOY: Just let me live!
INGRID: Upper or lower?
CLAUDE: I think just middle.
MARGOT: Dick and his daughter asked us over to swim tomorrow.
PAULINE: We didn't invite them to the You're not really friends.
MARGOT: You're not really friends.
PAULINE: We're friends enough that's it's awkward. Maisy baby-sits for us all the time.
MARGOT: He's doing the interview with me in town on Friday. Did I tell you, he and I are collaborating on a screenplay, an adaptation of one of Dick's novels.
PAULINE: No, I didn't even know you knew he was up here.
MALCOLM: Is he even a good writer? Why do people care about him?
PAULINE: You're competitive with everyone. It doesn't matter if they even do the same thing as you. He's competitive with Bono.
MALCOLM: It's true. I don't subscribe to the credo that there's enough room for everyone to be successful. I think there are only a few spots available and people like Dick Koosman and Bono are taking them
PAULINE: Malcolm, what would ever make you think that's something to draw right now?
MALCOLM: Sorry, I wasn't thinking about it. Sorry, Margot.
DICK: You found it!
PAULINE: What's up?
MALCOLM: I don't want to do this.
PAULINE: Come on, don't be that way. I'm not being that way I just don't feel like it. I'm going to go back and. I have work to do.
MALCOLM: I'm not being that way I just don't feel like it. I'm going to go back and. I have work to do.
PAULINE: Dick doesn't care that you don't make any money.
MALCOLM: Is that why you think. That's not why I'm.I just hate swimming. I really hate it. It's disgusting to me. My mistake was saying I'd do it to begin with. You have fun.
PAULINE: Fine, we'll have fun.
MALCOLM: People always pee in the pool.
PAULINE: I don't think Dick and Maisy pee in their pool.
MALCOLM: I'll bet you 500 dollars there's pee in that pool.
PAULINE: To the end and back. Claude, you say Go.
CLAUDE: Margot knocks on the side of her head with her hand.
CLAUDE: Pauline flings herself in and is off. Margot hesitates then follows. Maisy and Dick watch from the chairs. Ingrid floats on a raft and cheers. Claude runs along the pool-
DICK: How's your dad?
CLAUDE: He and I shared a thesis advisor at Stanford. Did you know that?
DICK: He and I shared a thesis advisor at Stanford. Did you know that?
CLAUDE: Pauline hits the far wall with her palm and flips around. Margot stops short and follows her sister. They're neck and neck. Their arms cut in and out of the water.
DICK: I was dating your mom back then, did you know that?
CLAUDE: Pauline lands touches the wall first. Margot a close Pauline beams. Margot immediately drifts to the ladder. She's panting heavily.
CLAUDE: Pauline wins!
CLAUDE: Mom cheated. You didn't touch the I did so. It doesn't matter. I lost anyway.
MARGOT: I did so. It doesn't matter. I lost anyway.
PAULINE: It was close.
PAULINE: It's okay.
MARGOT: I got him.
MARGOT: It's okay, my baby.
CLAUDE: I'm sorry I laughed about the tree.
MARGOT: Now we're even.
PAULINE: Here you are.
MARGOT: You've got a problem.
PAULINE: What do you mean?
MARGOT: I don't like the girl and I don't like the way Malcolm looks at her.
PAULINE: Oh, come on, it's sexy.
MARGOT: You didn't see it. I saw it. You've got a problem.
PAULINE: I'm not worried. We could teach Claude how to swim.
MARGOT: He won't want to do it. It's too
MARGOT: Are you supposed to be doing that?
PAULINE: She hands it back.
PAULINE: I liked your last story in, was it Harpers? The one about mom. I was very.I liked it very much.
MARGOT: It wasn't really about mom.
PAULINE: I thought it was. Anyway. Why don't you want Claude to know how to swim?
MARGOT: I didn't say I didn't want him to. Why do you care? It's not in his life we're New Yorkers. If he wants to learn when he's older, he can. I'm curious why you're so interested in the whole thing.
PAULINE: I'm not. I'm just. As a safety thing and.I'm. Forget it.
MARGOT: But are you really friends?
PAULINE: Kind of. We're neighbors. We employ Maisy. I mean I don't care, I just think it's interesting. Are you excited about the talk? I thought I'd come if that's okay. My friend, Agnes, asked me, "What's it like to have a celebrity as a sister?" I said, I've got no problem with celebrity. Alice Munro taught at Bennington and was kind of a friend of mine.
MARGOT: I'm not a celebrity.
PAULINE: Well, you're well known.
MARGOT: To a very few people.
PAULINE: Just accept the compliment.
MARGOT: I guess I didn't realize it was a
MAISY: Fumbling, Claude shuts off the tape recorder.
CLAUDE: Hm? A bit. Can I make a suggestion?
MAISY: Can I make a suggestion?
CLAUDE: Uh huh.
MAISY: You should get underarm deodorant.
CLAUDE: Uh huh.
MAISY: You kind of smell.
MAISY: Better I tell you than someone
MARGOT: I think you smell nice. You smell I stink.
CLAUDE: I stink.
MARGOT: that are extremely harmful.
CLAUDE: that are extremely harmful.
MARGOT: that are extremely harmful.
CLAUDE: Like your stomach or your Who told you this, anyway? Maisy?
MARGOT: Like your stomach or your Who told you this, anyway? Maisy?
CLAUDE: ( laughs ) Who told you this, anyway? Maisy?
MARGOT: Who told you this, anyway? Maisy?
CLAUDE: that girl. I find her loud and stupid. She goes on about things of which she knows nothing early all the time.
MARGOT: that girl. I find her loud and stupid. She goes on about things of which she knows nothing early all the time.
CLAUDE: loud and stupid. She goes on about things of which she knows nothing early all the time.
MARGOT: loud and stupid. She goes on about things of which she knows nothing early all the time.
CLAUDE: early all the time.
MARGOT: early all the time.
CLAUDE: Where did you go again?
MARGOT: ( pause ) I just don't think you should do anything with her.
CLAUDE: ( embarrassed ) We're just friends.
MARGOT: If you do, use a condom.
CLAUDE: Where are you going?
MARGOT: Out with Paul and Malcolm and Dick.
CLAUDE: Are kids coming?
INGRID: Who do we know who's gay?
MAISY: How do I know what gay people you Alan and Toby.
CLAUDE: Alan and Toby.
INGRID: And Bruce. He's gay and Aspergers.
CLAUDE: I don't know if Bruce is gay.
INGRID: He might be, it's very common.
CLAUDE: Your mom is pregnant.
INGRID: No she isn't.
CLAUDE: She is.
MAISY: How do you know that, Claude?
CLAUDE: She told my mom. But you can tell - - she's hormonally weird.
MAISY: Holy shit, Ingrid you're going to have a baby sister or brother.
INGRID: ( quietly ) My mom thinks your mom is Who cares.
CLAUDE: Who cares.
MAISY: Do you think your mom is fuckable?
CLAUDE: I don't know.
MAISY: I think she's hot, your mother. I'd do her if I was gay. I might anyway. I mean if she came on to She won't.
CLAUDE: She won't.
INGRID: I'm not going to do anyone. What was that?
CLAUDE: What was that?
INGRID: Is it scary?
PAULINE: Margot used to never speak. I remember when we went on a double date in high school, that kid Ron asked you if English was your first It's true. I used to think I might have some kind of brain defect.
MARGOT: It's true. I used to think I might have some kind of brain defect.
PAULINE: You thought you were aphasic.
MARGOT: I'm still not sure.
PAULINE: Oh, Jesus, Margot.
MARGOT: It's very possible, Paul.
PAULINE: I just.your diagnoses sometimes irk the hell out of me.
MARGOT: Malcolm, can you slow down.
MALCOLM: I can drive if you like.
DICK: I can drive if you like.
MALCOLM: No, you got dinner, the driving's on me.
DICK: Well, I'll let you pay your half if you'll slow down.
MALCOLM: Well, neither Pauline or I ordered Malcolm, let it go. Margot would insist on driving if she knew how.
PAULINE: Malcolm, let it go. Margot would insist on driving if she knew how.
MARGOT: ( to Dick ) My license elapsed. But I know It's probably for the best. I have this theory, I think, historically, women have been held back in so many ways that when they get power, like they do behind the wheel, they can't help but abuse it. It's akin to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory about prison guards and prisoners switching rolls.
MALCOLM: It's probably for the best. I have this theory, I think, historically, women have been held back in so many ways that when they get power, like they do behind the wheel, they can't help but abuse it. It's akin to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory about prison guards and prisoners switching rolls.
DICK: That's a charming philosophy.
MARGOT: Yeah. Tell that one a lot.
MALCOLM: This isn't a blanket thing. I mean, women can be great drivers
PAULINE: Said the man with the moustache that he thinks he's wearing in It's meant to be funny.
MARGOT: It's meant to be funny.
MALCOLM: ( to Pauline, re: Margot ) Are you doing this for her benefit or mine?
MALCOLM: What the fuck?
PAULINE: ( momentarily sober ) No, there they go. Okay. It's fine. I thought I had no brakes for a minute.
MALCOLM: ( momentarily sober ) No, there they go. Okay. It's fine. I thought I had no brakes for a minute.
MARGOT: Dick grabs the lit butt and chucks it in the road.
MALCOLM: ( turning around )
MARGOT: Watch it!
MALCOLM: It's fine, Margot!
PAULINE: ( to Malcolm ) You're just so incompetent.
MALCOLM: ( exploding ) Why don't you fucking drive yourselves home!
PAULINE: ( quietly furious ) Oh, God.
MARGOT: You should go after her.
DICK: Come back with me tonight.
MARGOT: I've got Claude.
DICK: Come on, I've been trying to get you up here all year.
MARGOT: ( vaguely ) She's pregnant.
INGRID: Why are you putting that there?
CLAUDE: I just want to keep it.
INGRID: I left a piece of skin in a movie theater once so it could watch movies all its life.
CLAUDE: I don't know if it's the same Are you obsessed with Maisy?
INGRID: Are you obsessed with Maisy?
CLAUDE: You're always staring at her tits.
INGRID: You're always staring at her tits.
INGRID: You have a moustache.
CLAUDE: My mom bleaches it.
INGRID: I'm going to kiss your cheek and then you kiss mine.
CLAUDE: I don't want to do that.
INGRID: Why not?
CLAUDE: Because it's pointless.
INGRID: Where are you going? I thought we were having a conversation.
CLAUDE: You're starting to annoy me.
CLAUDE: I didn't think you came home.
MARGOT: Where would I be?
CLAUDE: Can't Josh and Dad come to the We've been through this. Go to
MARGOT: We've been through this. Go to
CLAUDE: Can I sleep in here?
MARGOT: No, honey.
CLAUDE: We can put a pillow between us.
MARGOT: Okay. Just for tonight.
MARGOT: When you were a baby I wouldn't let anyone else hold you. I think that may have been a mistake.
INGRID: Why was it a secret?
PAULINE: Because I didn't want to get you excited before it was real. It's not really a baby yet. In two more weeks we can celebrate together, Why did you tell Margot?
INGRID: Why did you tell Margot?
PAULINE: Because she's my sister and I trust her. How do you feel about it?
INGRID: I don't want a sister.
INGRID: I'm going to go get Wizard.
PAULINE: Margot told Claude something I expressly told her in confidence. And he told Ingrid.
MALCOLM: Well it's that thing where
PAULINE: Don't say anything. You know what.just be there for me. Why do I have to be so careful around her, but everyone is allowed to make fun of me?
MALCOLM: Why do I have to be so careful around her, but everyone is allowed to make fun of me?
PAULINE: Why do I have to be so careful around her, but everyone is allowed to make fun of me?
MALCOLM: I don't know if
PAULINE: Malcolm, what did I just say? You know, I just want you to take my side, I don't need you to make it better.
PAULINE: Ingrid's really upset about it. Fuck. I can't believe she did this to me! I didn't tell you because. I didn't want you to feel like you had to marry me. I found out right before our seminar. I'm Uh huh.
MALCOLM: Uh huh.
PAULINE: Well.does that sound good to you?
MALCOLM: I'm still digesting Margot telling Claude. What a fucking nut job. Sorry. I think I'm really happy.
PAULINE: Come here, honey!
MARGOT: Hey. I'm just looking at Pauline's incense and self-help books. I don't understand it. This junk makes her look stupid and she's not. I don't like to think of her this way.
CLAUDE: Uh huh.
MARGOT: She's such a hypocrite. Somehow I'm a kook for going to therapy, but she's got enough drugs here to medicate a. .an elephant. And she's always with these losers.
CLAUDE: Malcolm's not a loser.
MARGOT: Claude.think about it.
CLAUDE: He's cool.
MARGOT: What makes you think he's cool? I'm more talking about her investment in things like the Forum and ashrams.
CLAUDE: What's the Forum?
MARGOT: Like a cult.
CLAUDE: She was in a cult?
MARGOT: Years ago. She and Lenny also followed some guru who was a follower of the Mukdananda who made her drink his bath water. Who knows what she's doing now.
CLAUDE: We move past him, obscured by grass, Pauline and Ingrid yell:
MARGOT: Wizard! Here, boy!
MARGOT: How long has he been gone?
PAULINE: I don't know. Ingrid brought him in last night, but we couldn't find him this morning.
MARGOT: Oh boy.
PAULINE: Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant?
MARGOT: I don't know.
PAULINE: You did.
MARGOT: I guess I said something.
PAULINE: You did. You don't have to tell him everything.
MARGOT: He wants to know. If I don't tell him, he figures it out.
PAULINE: I don't know, honey.
CLAUDE: You didn't let him go out into the road or something where something could've happened to him?
MARGOT: Why would you think I'd do something like that? That's awful.
CLAUDE: I just. I'm just making sure.
MARGOT: That's a terrible thing to say to I didn't mean on purpose, I just meant maybe in case.you knew something. I'm sorry.
CLAUDE: I didn't mean on purpose, I just meant maybe in case.you knew something. I'm sorry.
MARGOT: Malcolm sits at the table, eating saltines out of the box, a pad and paper in front of him.
MALCOLM: Hey, sorry. I'm here.
MARGOT: No, I. I should've looked.
MALCOLM: I'm just writing my vows. Trying to do something appropriate but also funny not jokey, more character based humor.
MALCOLM: You having an okay time?
MARGOT: Oh, yeah. Besides Wizard getting
MALCOLM: Yeah, we'll.we'll find him.or else, I don't know.
MARGOT: We won't.
MALCOLM: Right, or else he's dead or It means a lot to Paul that you
MARGOT: Silence. Malcolm mumbles a tune.
MARGOT: Oh God, this is the same toaster we had here as kids. Paul is so I hear you've heard the news.
MALCOLM: I hear you've heard the news.
MARGOT: Yeah. Congratulations.
MALCOLM: Pretty cool. Hard to fully take in. It's a little abstract still. I haven't had that thing yet where you realize that you're not the most important person in the world. I'm anxious for that to happen. I guess I have to thank you I wouldn't know yet if you hadn't You're welcome.
MARGOT: You're welcome.
MALCOLM: Of course I can't help but worry I'll pass some not so great genes onto the kid. I mean, in my family there's a lot of hand washing, you know. I don't have it, but my brother does. You working on anything now?
MARGOT: Besides the thing with Dick?
MALCOLM: Oh, right.
MARGOT: How about you?
MALCOLM: Oh, I'm working on some acrylic Nobody fills the ice cube trays.
MARGOT: Nobody fills the ice cube trays.
MARGOT: Sorry, what were you
MALCOLM: Nothing. It doesn't matter.
MARGOT: No, what were you saying?
MALCOLM: It really. Nothing.
MARGOT: She treads back to the refrigerator, balancing the full
MALCOLM: I was saying I'm doing these abstractions in acrylic paint. But it's not. I'm not getting paid or anything. I don't know, I hate that question, "What do you do?"
MARGOT: You asked me.
MALCOLM: I know, but.
MALCOLM: I think we shouldn't mention the tree, we should let them know that there will be people and music on Saturday and it will be louder than And that they can come for a glass of champagne. But you tell them. I think they respond to you better.
PAULINE: And that they can come for a glass of champagne. But you tell them. I think they respond to you better.
MALCOLM: Well, I am ultimately one of them. You shouldn't've made me shave the Yeah, right.
PAULINE: ( laughs ) Yeah, right.
MALCOLM: Oh, hey, Ingrid is asking me if I was ever gay. Do you know what that's about?
PAULINE: Mr. Vogler, wearing a fleece vest and carrying a hatchet over his shoulders, tramples out of the brush.
PAULINE: Vogler stops. His face is jagged and worn.
PAULINE: Hi, I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm. We've met before. We're your
VOGLER: You gonna cut that tree down?
PAULINE: Well, we grew up with that tree and we're getting married under it Saturday and
VOGLER: The roots are growing into our property. It's rotting, it's killing our plants.
PAULINE: We had a tree doctor out and he said it was healthy.
PAULINE: Would it hurt you to say anything?
MALCOLM: What? What do you want from me?
PAULINE: You're making me do the whole fucking thing.
MALCOLM: You brought up the tree.
PAULINE: He brought up
PAULINE: I'm sorry. This was better thought-through back at the house.
PAULINE: We were wondering if you and your wife I'm sorry I forgot her name would like to come over for.
VOGLER: You should ask her. She makes the plans. I'm going to go in now.
MALCOLM: I felt like you didn't give me a chance to say what I wanted to say.
MALCOLM: I want to punch that guy in the You've never hit anyone.
PAULINE: You've never hit anyone.
MALCOLM: I have too!
PAULINE: Lots of You don't know them. They're not around because I've punched them.
MALCOLM: Lots of You don't know them. They're not around because I've punched them.
MALCOLM: Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not funny. I'll fucking punch your
MALCOLM: The threat is not out there. It's in our house. It's sleeping in my studio. I mean, I wouldn't actually hit her, but I feel.I feel like doing it. She's such a fucking idiot.
PAULINE: She's not an idiot. You might not like her
MALCOLM: She is. She is an idiot! You're an idiot.
PAULINE: You're both fucking morons. I'm so fucking. I'm trying so hard. You don't give me any credit.
MALCOLM: You're both fucking morons. I'm so fucking. I'm trying so hard. You don't give me any credit.
PAULINE: What is wrong?
MALCOLM: I don't know, I have the emotional version of whatever bad feng shui would be. I don't know. You tell me, you understand this shit.
PAULINE: Did you drink your teas?
MALCOLM: Yeah, I drank my fucking teas! Don't judge me now. Really, I think when you look back at this you're going to see I'm not acting like a crazy person. That this is the right reaction. In proportion with what is going on. This is
PAULINE: You have the most oddly self- conscious form of rage I've ever
MALCOLM: I hate you.
MALCOLM: Let's make love.
PAULINE: They embrace. Her hand cups the back of his neck.
JIM: It was a difficult decision because Claude has so many friends at school now, but it is expensive and Bronx Science is a great public I didn't get into Stuyvesant.
CLAUDE: I didn't get into Stuyvesant.
MARGOT: He's not a good test taker.
MALCOLM: I went to Stuy.
MARGOT: ( caught off-guard ) I'd rather stay at Packer, but it's so expensive.
MALCOLM: I'd rather stay at Packer, but it's so expensive.
CLAUDE: I'd rather stay at Packer, but it's so expensive.
JIM: Josh is a great test taker, but Claude thinks more abstractly. He's more creative. Right?
CLAUDE: I guess so.
JIM: I saw the one armed man who really has two arms at the bodega.
CLAUDE: Did you give him confusing change?
JIM: I did. I tripped him up with some nickels. And a Canadian quarter.
MALCOLM: You know what I tried the other day? Sitting down to pee. Have you done this, Jim?
JIM: I did it as a lark. As a joke really. I was going to call Pauline in and say, guess what I'm doing here.
MALCOLM: I did it as a lark. As a joke really. I was going to call Pauline in and say, guess what I'm doing here.
PAULINE: I'm sorry I didn't get to have that I was thinking, you know, my dad used to say, "Why stand when you can sit." And this is a really good example of that. I mean, it took me so long to try because I was embarrassed. You guys do it all the time.
MALCOLM: I was thinking, you know, my dad used to say, "Why stand when you can sit." And this is a really good example of that. I mean, it took me so long to try because I was embarrassed. You guys do it all the time.
MARGOT: I never sit down in a public place. I squat and hover.
MALCOLM: Anyway, I recommend it. At least to try it.
PAULINE: Jim, I'm sorry about the room. It's usually Malcolm's storage room so it's kind of make-shift right It's fine.
JIM: It's fine.
JIM: Margot, open your gift. I get self-conscious opening presents in front of people. This weekend is about Pauline.
MARGOT: I get self-conscious opening presents in front of people. This weekend is about Pauline.
PAULINE: Oh.poo. Open it Margot.
PAULINE: Come on, get to it.
MALCOLM: Those look warm.
JIM: I remember last year in Vermont you said your feet were freezing.
MARGOT: Thank you.
MARGOT: I already have slippers.
JIM: Well, that's okay. Two sets are fine, right?
MARGOT: It makes me sad to get a present that I already have.
JIM: It makes me feel like you don't know me.
MARGOT: It makes me feel like you don't know me.
JIM: What's wrong with your ear?
MARGOT: I asked you not to come. I was so clear and you did it anyway so We need time alone to sort this out. You can't just run away
JIM: We need time alone to sort this out. You can't just run away
MARGOT: Okay, so we're here. I'm giving you this time.
JIM: ( trying a joke ) Well, now you're putting too much pressure on me.
JIM: What is that? Keep driving.
MARGOT: Keep driving.
MARGOT: No.no.no. Jim, no.
JIM: Let me just.
WOMAN: Please help me.
WOMAN: Please help me. He got hit by a car. Please help me.
MARGOT: ( warily )
WOMAN: Help me!
MARGOT: Careful, he might bite you!
WOMAN: Hurry.he's dying. He's dying.
WOMAN: He didn't do anything. Roger is an innocent. He's an innocent Oh, God.
MARGOT: Oh, God.
JIM: ( whispering ) I can't stand her.
MARGOT: ( whispering ) I can't stand her.
MARGOT: You paid, didn't you?
JIM: She didn't have her purse with her. It wasn't so expensive. Roger's going to live.
MARGOT: I don't give a fuck about Roger. And.that makes me feel like shit. You make me feel like shit. I wouldn't have stopped.
JIM: Of course you would've.
MARGOT: No, I wouldn't've. I would have kept driving. I hate myself when I'm with you.
JIM: ( frustrated ) Margot, I'm not. I can't talk to you when you're this fucked up.
MARGOT: You're just like Claude in that way.you make me feel guilty. Sometimes I find you so despicable.
JIM: What's wrong?
MARGOT: I don't know. Before you gave me your sweater I think I didn't realize I was cold.
MARGOT: ( quietly ) Take me home and go away.
MARGOT: If it were someone else I'd understand it, I'd feel sympathy even. But since it's me, I just feel bad. And horribly critical. I haven't been able to tell Claude what's happening. And I have to. I'm going to. How can I be all these people? How can I be married to Jim. And fuck Dick. And want them both and then neither of them.
PAULINE: I know. We're at the age where we're becoming invisible to men and if a guy wants to fuck us, it's very tempting.
MARGOT: What are you saying?
PAULINE: I'm saying, if you get your sense of self from being fuckable and that starts to wane it's very hard. I almost had an affair too. But you know, you don't have to do it. You can, I don't know, get a manicure or something.
PAULINE: You know I tell people you're my closest friend. I really miss you.
MARGOT: ( barely ) Me too.
PAULINE: But I can't help feeling that you really came to my wedding because I live a mile away from the guy you're fucking.
MARGOT: Come on, Pauline. You make it sound like I'm using you.
PAULINE: There is a long silence between them. Finally, Pauline indicates to Margot that she has something in her nostril.
PAULINE: You have a.
MARGOT: Did I get it?
PAULINE: Yeah, I think so.
MARGOT: ( suddenly ) Paul, what are you doing getting married to this guy? He's not good enough for you. He's so coarse, he's like guys we rejected when we were sixteen. You know.don't make a mistake like this. ( pause ) I'm sorry, maybe I have no right to say that, but you know I'm truthful so. Would you rather I lie?
PAULINE: Who should I be with then?
MARGOT: 53 EXT. DRIVEWAY - MORNING 53
CLAUDE: Dogs usually come back, I think.
INGRID: What happened to your dad?
CLAUDE: He went to Vermont.
INGRID: He didn't want to come to the I don't think he could. I think he couldn't. You want to see me dance?
CLAUDE: I don't think he could. I think he couldn't. You want to see me dance?
INGRID: Claude dances. The gangly weeds blow around him. There's a rustling in the brush. A patch of fur catches Ingrid's eye.
INGRID: ( under her breath )
CLAUDE: You're not watching.
BOY: Where are you going?
CLAUDE: ( stopping ) We have to get home.
BOY: Is that your girlfriend?
CLAUDE: No, she's my cousin.
BOY: You a fruity?
CLAUDE: ( to Ingrid ) You a fruity?
BOY: ( to Ingrid ) You a fruity?
INGRID: ( with certainty ) We will hurt you.
BOY: We will hurt you.
INGRID: He's a Vogler.
CLAUDE: He's just a stupid boy.
INGRID: Hold it, I have a rock in my Come on, Ingrid.
CLAUDE: Come on, Ingrid.
INGRID: Claude leans down to help her. The boy leaps on Claude. They both crash to the ground and roll through the grass.
CLAUDE: Get him off me. Ingrid!
CLAUDE: Ayy! Help me!
MARGOT: Woa, don't run so fast.
CLAUDE: There's a boy! He bit me!
MARGOT: ( alarmed ) Who bit you?
CLAUDE: A boy. A Vogler! Where's Ingrid?
MARGOT: Let me see.
MARGOT: ( rising ) I'm calling the police.
CLAUDE: No, don't! It'll get worse. Why did you say anything to them?
MARGOT: Claude, this isn't my fault.
CLAUDE: That boy bit me because you couldn't keep your fat mouth shut.
MARGOT: Claude, you're being a jerk.
CLAUDE: You shit in your shoes and then you fuck them!
PAULINE: You really want to know? I'll tell you. She wrote a story about Lenny and me. Yeah, it's in here. I mean we were talking almost every day at this point and there was no warning. Maybe a couple of remarks that she'd used some things of ours. Then The New Yorker comes we have a subscription and there's the story and. It's things we said and did stuff I told her in I think it helped end our marriage. I read it and thought, "She hates She doesn't hate you.
CLAUDE: She doesn't hate you.
PAULINE: You think? Margot tried to murder me when we were girls. She put me on a baking sheet, sprinkled me with paprika and put me in the
MARGOT: Jim was here.
DICK: Is Jim still writing?
MARGOT: ( nods ) I told him to go to Vermont without I'd love to see him tell a linear story for a change. Jim never wanted to make it easy for the reader, did he. The nicest man I've ever met, but he can't play the game.
DICK: I'd love to see him tell a linear story for a change. Jim never wanted to make it easy for the reader, did he. The nicest man I've ever met, but he can't play the game.
MARGOT: I'm not joining him. I'm going to stay here and then.we'll see. Right. Okay?
DICK: I didn't ask you to do that. The guy's pointing at us.
DICK: I'm very interested in your story "Middle Children." The father is a loathsome character yet we also feel a strange sympathy for him.
DICK: The father is a loathsome character yet we also feel a strange sympathy for him.
MARGOT: Yeah, well I was very interested in exploring a father-daughter relationship. While he clings desperately to her, suffocates her really, he also silently resents the responsibility of parenthood.
DICK: There's this sexualized push-pull with Daphne which I find
MARGOT: He craves isolation really. I always thought of him as someone who so over identifies with everyone around him that he begins to lose all sense of himself.
DICK: You make his only recourse to abandon his family, including his beloved daughter.
MARGOT: Right, that's true. That's true.
DICK: I write historical fiction so I don't have to answer to this, but I wonder for someone who writes so nakedly about family, how autobiographical is this portrait?
MARGOT: My father was a loving person. He had his days, of course, but.he was devoted to us as children. I wouldn't have written this portrait were it true.
DICK: But I'm interested in how the father could be in fact a portrait of you.
MARGOT: Umm.I don't. Why do you assume it's based on. We all take from life. I had to have our refrigerator repaired the other day at our apartment in Manhattan. I was alone with a guy, I think he was Puerto Rican, sent over by.Whirlpool, I think it is who made our fridge. Although he said he worked for an independent organization who Whirlpool subcontracts. I think he was retarded. There was an anger in him and suddenly I became afraid for my life. I called Jim at NYU. I asked him to come home.
MARGOT: It might be Frigidaire. I'm sorry. I don't. I'm not sure what I'm. I think I need to take a moment.
MARGOT: ( almost incoherently ) You're an asshole.
MARGOT: I need to be alone right now, okay?
CLAUDE: What's wrong?
MARGOT: I don't know. I'll tell you sometime. Go on.
CLAUDE: Are you sure?
MARGOT: Yes. Go with mom. I'll see you You said, mom.
CLAUDE: You said, mom.
MARGOT: ( snapping ) But you know what I mean. Go with Pauline. Jesus, do I.do I need to spell it out for you? ( she points ) Go. With. Her.
PAULINE: Are you okay?
CLAUDE: I'm okay.
PAULINE: You're your mom's favorite. Do you know that?
CLAUDE: I don't think she has a favorite.
PAULINE: She's always liked you best. More than Jim even.
CLAUDE: But they're married. It's But she still loves you best. It's hard, I think, to find people in the world you love more than your I like Malcolm.
PAULINE: But she still loves you best. It's hard, I think, to find people in the world you love more than your I like Malcolm.
CLAUDE: I like Malcolm.
PAULINE: Yeah? Good. I don't know. I do I can teach you to swim if you No, thanks.
CLAUDE: No, thanks.
PAULINE: Has your mother talked to you yet?
CLAUDE: I don't think so. About what?
PAULINE: Are you okay? It's hard to see your mom like that get attacked like that. Right? It was mean what he did. I think it was really Mm hm.
CLAUDE: Mm hm.
PAULINE: You know, I think your mom's going through a rough time right now and.whatever she tells you.like if she says she's leaving your father.remember that she often changes her mind and.
INGRID: He's cutting it down.
PAULINE: Pauline passes Maisy reading on the patio.
MAISY: My dad's late to pick me up. I hope I'm not a pain.
PAULINE: You're not a pain. I told Paul I didn't want you guys to come.
MARGOT: I told Paul I didn't want you guys to come.
CLAUDE: I thought it was interesting.
MARGOT: What did Paul say?
CLAUDE: I think she liked it.
MARGOT: Yeah, right. Did you talk about me I can tell you're lying.
CLAUDE: I can tell you're lying.
MARGOT: I can tell you're lying.
CLAUDE: We didn't, mom.
MARGOT: I don't trust her.
CLAUDE: She really loves you. She does.
MARGOT: Pauline told me she's very disappointed in you.
CLAUDE: She thinks you laze about the house. Ingrid is always offering to help clean or cook. She made bracelets for all the guests. Even Malcolm puts up the tent. You just wait until everyone else does it for you.
MARGOT: She thinks you laze about the house. Ingrid is always offering to help clean or cook. She made bracelets for all the guests. Even Malcolm puts up the tent. You just wait until everyone else does it for you.
CLAUDE: That's not true.
MARGOT: It is true. You're never helpful. I wish I had taught you better I can try to make popovers. If I can remember how.
CLAUDE: I can try to make popovers. If I can remember how.
MARGOT: Don't bother.
CLAUDE: Why are you looking at me like
MARGOT: I just see how much you've changed. Your body language. You used to be rounder and more graceful. You're so stiff now. So blase.
CLAUDE: What do you mean?
MARGOT: ( retreating ) I can't explain it.
MARGOT: It's okay though.
CLAUDE: Uh huh. You're still handsome.
MARGOT: You're still handsome.
PAULINE: Are you able to do this yourself?
MALCOLM: Pauline, do you want me to cut it down or not?
PAULINE: Watch the tent.
MALCOLM: ( indicating his fleece ) I liked how it looked on Vogler.
PAULINE: I think it's over between Dick and Margot. He was so cruel to her today. And poor Claude had to watch it all. She should just get out of the marriage and then she can fuck whoever she wants, you know. It's cowardly. And Dick Koosman. What a choice. I mean.you know?
MALCOLM: I agree. I hate the idea of Dick fucking Margot.
PAULINE: What does that mean? You want to fuck Margot?
MALCOLM: Pauline, that's not what I said.
PAULINE: I know you have a crush on her, you already told me that.
MALCOLM: I didn't say that. I said I thought she was attractive after you grilled me. She has no interest in me anyway. Not that it would matter if she did.
PAULINE: Have you ever done anything like What do you mean?
MALCOLM: What do you mean?
PAULINE: Have you ever cheated on me?
MALCOLM: Malcolm shuts the motor.
MALCOLM: Can I do this?
PAULINE: student of mine.
MALCOLM: ( exhales ) Uh huh.
PAULINE: the tree?
MALCOLM: the tree?
PAULINE: the tree?
MALCOLM: the tree?
PAULINE: that reading at the college and. You know we were friends.
MALCOLM: that reading at the college and. You know we were friends.
PAULINE: between you and a twenty year old to say it.
MALCOLM: to say it.
PAULINE: you're with me and now when she's around you look for things.
MALCOLM: you're with me and now when she's around you look for things.
PAULINE: ( hesitates ) You promise.
MALCOLM: Pauline looks at him long and hard. Malcolm takes off his
PAULINE: Okay. I'm sorry.
MALCOLM: It's okay.
MALCOLM: I'm going to tell you something.
PAULINE: ( suddenly terrified ) I don't want to lose you, though.
MALCOLM: I don't want to lose you, though.
MALCOLM: I'm going to tell you. Just let me. Maisy.
PAULINE: I don't want to know.
MALCOLM: .we didn't really do anything. We were goofing around, I was making fun of her cause she dates a I don't want to know.
PAULINE: I don't want to know.
MALCOLM: I shouldn't've put myself in that position, I know that. We brushed lips really. It was barely a kiss. And then we stopped. That was it.
MALCOLM: Our tongues touched. I don't want to under-sell it either. I mean. We made out. I made out with her. I don't know why. I don't even like her. It's been a heady time. What are you thinking? Please, tell me what you're thinking.
INGRID: Has anyone seen Wizard?
PAULINE: No. Where's Maisy?
INGRID: Upstairs, I think with Claude.
MAISY: Oh, hi. Sorry, I had to go. I hope that's okay I used yours.
MAISY: I love your wedding dress. It's so unconventional and great.
MAISY: Is everything okay?
PAULINE: ( pause )
MAISY: Claude, do you want to play
CLAUDE: Pauline raises her leg her foot hovers at Maisy's lower back. She hesitates. Claude reacts with horror. Maisy turns around to see Pauline with her foot in the air like she's doing karate. Pauline's eyes dart around aimlessly. Maisy stares, confused. Pauline slowly lowers her leg. Something dawns on Maisy. She races down the stairs.
INGRID: There's Dick.
INGRID: Is it almost ready?
MALCOLM: ( distracted )
MALCOLM: I didn't do anything! I didn't do Fucking sleazebag!
DICK: Fucking sleazebag!
DICK: I don't ever want to see you again.
MALCOLM: Fuck off, dickhead.
MALCOLM: Dick lights a brown cigarette and walks away. Malcolm He touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers.
MALCOLM: Fucking dickbag! She's lying!
MALCOLM: ( choking on tears ) Oh, man.
MARGOT: Come with me to New York.
PAULINE: I can't talk about it
MARGOT: Okay, but you can't marry him. You have to go now. We can think about what to do with the baby
PAULINE: ( stands ) Margot, I can't
MARGOT: Don't turn vague, listen to me
PAULINE: I want you to pack all your things and get out of here. You can take our car and leave it at the ferry.
MARGOT: ( startled ) I'll help out more. I can make
CLAUDE: I'll help out more. I can make
PAULINE: Do you love me? Don't take this out on me? I'm on your side.
MARGOT: Don't take this out on me? I'm on your side.
PAULINE: No, you're not. You're not.
MARGOT: I've kept my mouth shut because
PAULINE: No, you haven't kept your mouth shut! No you haven't.kept your mouth shut.
MARGOT: Okay, I told you and I was right. He's done an insane thing. You don't know this man. What he did is criminal.
PAULINE: Margot, I can't.
MARGOT: It's pedophilia.
PAULINE: Get out! Becky and I talk about you about what a monster you are. Is it cause Mom gave me the house? Can't I have anything? What was I thinking? I let you in. Get! What? What are you saying? I don't recognize you it's like you're channelling someone.
PAULINE: Becky and I talk about you about what a monster you are. Is it cause Mom gave me the house? Can't I have anything? What was I thinking? I let you in. Get! What? What are you saying? I don't recognize you it's like you're channelling someone.
MARGOT: What? What are you saying? I don't recognize you it's like you're channelling someone.
PAULINE: ( suddenly ) The purple of Ingrid's batik shirt shines in the grass beneath the tree. The trunk a gash at its base teeters. Pauline takes off into the field. Ingrid sings to herself and traces the branches in the air with her finger. Pauline sprints
PAULINE: Ingrid says to no one in particular:
INGRID: Pauline's breaths are rapid, jagged. Ingrid stands. A wind whips up. The tree sways. Pauline thrusts her arms out, seizes Ingrid and hurls herself away from the tree.
INGRID: Ingrid sobs as they run. Pauline looks back. The tree is still standing. They embrace a few feet out of its range.
INGRID: It wasn't going to fall!
PAULINE: I'm sorry.
INGRID: She hugs the dog and holds him by the collar. The three of them stand a few feet apart. There's a horrible creak and suddenly
CLAUDE: I thought you couldn't drive.
MARGOT: ( irritated ) I can drive. Why does everyone say that? I used to drive.
PAULINE: We have to call people and cancel.
INGRID: What happened? Can I still sing?
MARGOT: ( to Claude ) You do smell.
CLAUDE: Well, I'm not wearing any I don't think. No. We don't have brakes.
MARGOT: I don't think. No. We don't have brakes.
CLAUDE: I don't think. No. We don't have brakes.
MARGOT: I don't think. No. We don't have brakes.
PAULINE: ( resigned ) The brakes are bad, that's right.
CLAUDE: What does that mean?
MARGOT: What do you think it means?
CLAUDE: I mean, what can we do?
CLAUDE: Margot places her arm stiffly across Claude's front. Pauline wraps her body around her daughter. Margot swerves into the shoulder she makes a sharp turn into the forest and crashes through the bramble and muck. The car slows until it comes to a sudden stop at the base of a tree.
MARGOT: I ruined these shoes.
INGRID: Mom, are you okay?
INGRID: Mom, what happened?
PAULINE: Margot turns to the kids. Ingrid hides a smile.
CLAUDE: Did she poop in her pants?
MARGOT: It happens to everyone. Not just babies. It'll happen to you too
PAULINE: I left mom and Becky a message.
MARGOT: I don't think mom knows how to work the machine.
MARGOT: I can hear it flapping.
PAULINE: You should take care of that. It can hatch eggs.
MARGOT: Sweety, there's a bus that leaves to Vermont from town tomorrow morning. I just talked to your dad and he's going to pick you up.
CLAUDE: Aren't you coming?
MARGOT: Why not?
CLAUDE: Why not?
MARGOT: I have to help out Paul and Ingrid.
CLAUDE: I don't want to go tomorrow. There's Malcolm. I can't live in that house alone.
PAULINE: There's Malcolm. I can't live in that house alone.
PAULINE: I can't live in that house alone.
MARGOT: You're going to be fine.
PAULINE: Maybe.maybe I could get a place in Brooklyn Williamsburg or something. People are living there You don't want to live there. It's all young people.
MARGOT: You don't want to live there. It's all young people.
PAULINE: But what do you think of that idea?
MARGOT: Maybe. Let's see. You know if you don't want to come with me, I'm sure mom will let you stay with her
PAULINE: ( through tears ) You're already trying to pass me off on mom.
MARGOT: Don't say that. Come on, you'll come home with us.
PAULINE: You don't even know where you're going to live. You might have to move in with mom too.
PAULINE: What? Oh. Didn't you tell him?
PAULINE: What have I done? What have I
CLAUDE: Nothing. Just then I felt so much love for you.
MARGOT: Nothing. Just then I felt so much love for you.
MARGOT: You cannot write about this. You can't have it.
PAULINE: You cannot write about this. You can't have it.
MARGOT: I wasn't writing about you.
PAULINE: You already took a part of my life, you can't have any more. And that goes for Ingrid and Malcolm and Wizard. We all own our own rights. They're not for sale.
MARGOT: Give it back.
PAULINE: If I could read your handwriting I'm sure I'd be furious. But if I ever see a story that involves a hotel room or any of this shit, I will fucking take your bowels out.
PAULINE: You've now successfully ruined two of my marriages.
MARGOT: You're not wearing any underwear.
PAULINE: It's hot, I'm pregnant. Move over. You're not hot, your feet are cold.
MARGOT: You're not hot, your feet are cold.
PAULINE: Stop touching me. I am so hot. Feel my head.
MARGOT: You have a fever.
PAULINE: I don't have a fever. I'm pregnant.are you always like Get used to it. Mom and Becky share a bed you and I will probably get the other.
MARGOT: Get used to it. Mom and Becky share a bed you and I will probably get the other.
PAULINE: You should just go to Vermont.
MARGOT: I was thinking you know if you want you and Ingrid could go to Vermont. Keep Claude company and Jim adores you.
PAULINE: You don't like Malcolm because you're not attracted to him.
MARGOT: Will you do it?
PAULINE: No. I won't do that for you.
MARGOT: ( pause ) Did you two talk about me in town? What did you say?
PAULINE: ( pause ) I told him you often change your
MARGOT: I'm sorry, sweety. There's something wrong with me.
PAULINE: I'm going to call him.
MARGOT: No. Don't. I'm telling you.
PAULINE: I.I need some clothes and things.
MARGOT: He should get the hell out of our Okay. I'll tell him to get the hell out of our house.
PAULINE: Okay. I'll tell him to get the hell out of our house.
MALCOLM'S VOICE: The tent looks so lonely.
PAULINE: It has no one to get married in it.
MALCOLM: I know. And it's smashed. I'm such a fucking idiot. Please don't take me seriously. I mean take me seriously, but not the fucked up parts, you know. I love you so much. Please marry me.
PAULINE: You can't do what you did again. Do you understand?
MALCOLM: I promise.
PAULINE: No matter how tempting. You left it in my room.
INGRID: You left it in my room.
PAULINE: I don't know. I don't know.
MALCOLM: I ate some of the cake. I don't know why, but I did it.
PAULINE: What was. How was it?
MALCOLM: It's not too sweet? They sometimes make their stuff too sweet.
PAULINE: It's not too sweet? They sometimes make their stuff too sweet.
MALCOLM: Maybe. Maybe it was. I didn't even notice. They fucked up the cake. How sad. I love our little baby. I miss you.
PAULINE: I miss you too. Maybe we should do another seminar.
PAULINE: I can't understand you, honey. There's gramma and Aunt Becky!
INGRID: There's gramma and Aunt Becky!
PAULINE: They didn't get my message.
MARGOT: I told you she can't work the
PAULINE: What? You're not coming?
MARGOT: I'm coming, I'm coming. What did he say? What did he say?
MARGOT: What did he say?
MARGOT: ( to herself ) Don't worry, I got it.
MARGOT: Don't look. Keep walking.
CLAUDE: Why are we
MARGOT: We have to get you to your bus.
CLAUDE: Did you do something?
MARGOT: What do you mean, do something?
CLAUDE: I mean, why is the wedding not happening? Is there something that you did?
MARGOT: Pauline has transferred all her stuff onto me. I don't understand her anymore. Why'd she pick this man? It is really berserk. And you know, she referred to me as her closest friend. We never see one
MARGOT: I mean we're not close. Even if we want to be. You know?
CLAUDE: But was there anything real?
MARGOT: No! How many times do I have to say it? Jesus. You think so little of me. It's good you're going. You shouldn't be around me either. I'd go if I were you.
CLAUDE: Will you find Pauline and Nana after I leave?
MARGOT: ( half-serious ) I don't know. Maybe I'll go to
CLAUDE: ( growing nervous ) Are you angry at me?
MARGOT: No, honey. I'm not mad at you.
CLAUDE: I don't want to go with you mad at Everything's fine. I'm not mad at

CLAUDE: I don't like Vermont.
MARGOT: Your dad will be very happy to see you. And I'm sure Josh is dying to hang out.
CLAUDE: Please come, mom.
MARGOT: ( suddenly irritable ) Claude, stop it. Okay?
MARGOT: You used to need me to watch you when you played.
CLAUDE: What do you mean?
MARGOT: ( vaguely ) When you first started to play with friends, you wouldn't do it unless I watched you. You were afraid I would go out the back door. I don't know where I would go. Our yard didn't lead anywhere anyway.
CLAUDE: I masturbated last night. While everyone was asleep I went into the bathroom and did it.
MARGOT: You don't have to tell me, sweety.
MARGOT: You've got to go.
CLAUDE: How will you get home?
MARGOT: I don't know. I'll see. Maybe Dick can drive me to the. Jesus, I lost the word for a second. The train.
CLAUDE: Uh huh.

CLAUDE: See you soon.
MARGOT: Bye, sweety.
CLAUDE: Say, you'll see me "soon."
MARGOT: You're acting like a baby.
CLAUDE: Don't see Dick.
MARGOT: Don't worry. I don't think he wants to see me anyway.
CLAUDE: Please, Margot. Promise me.
MARGOT: ( hesitates ) Don't call me that.
MARGOT: She's runs full speed, waving her arms wildly.
MARGOT: Wait! Wait!
MARGOT: ( almost euphoric ) Did you see me running out there?
CLAUDE: Margot cranes her neck to see outside.
MARGOT: Good. That was a lot of running. I'm out of breath.
