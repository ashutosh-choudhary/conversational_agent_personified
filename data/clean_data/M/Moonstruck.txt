ZITO'S VOICE: ( barely discernable ) Three times they cancel the order with me, and three times they come back. Who they kidding? They cheap, cheap, cheap. The other bread they get is no good. They save pennies. Everybody complain and they come back. "Zito, your bread is the best." They're like children stupid in school who cannot learn. The water. It's the water.

ZITO: You want me to make you some coffee?
LORETTA: What d'you know about coffee? Gimme a loaf of bread.
OLD WOMAN: He looks great.
RUBY: That Al Conti is a genius.
CONTI'S VOICE: I am a genius. If you're such an artistic genius, why can't you keep track of your receipts? How am I going to do your income tax?
LORETTA'S VOICE: If you're such an artistic genius, why can't you keep track of your receipts? How am I going to do your income tax?

LORETTA: If you're an artistic genius, how come you got butter on your tie?
LORETTA: Give it here. I'll give you this, Al, you make good coffee.
FLORIST'S VOICE: Red roses. Very romantic. The man who sends these knows what he's doing.
LORETTA: The man who sends those spends a lot of money on something that ends up in the garbage can.
FLORIST: I'm glad everybody ain't like you, Loretta. I'd be outta business.
LORETTA: Without me, you'd be out of business. I like flowers.
MUSIC: A VIOLIN PLAYS a melancholy Neapolitan air. MR. JOHNNY and Loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly. They have their menus and glasses of red wine. Mr. Johnny is Italian, around 42. His wavy salt-and pepper hair is impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work. Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity. Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life. BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their
BOBO: Are you ready?
MR. JOHNNY: Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
BOBO: Very good, Mr. Johnny.
MR. JOHNNY: We will both have the Salad Ticino.
BOBO: MR. JOHNNY
MR. JOHNNY: And I'll have the special fish.
LORETTA: You don't want the fish.
MR. JOHNNY: It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
LORETTA: It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
MR. JOHNNY: Maybe you're right.
LORETTA: Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, Yes, Miss Loretta.
BOBO: Yes, Miss Loretta.
LORETTA: ( to Mr. Johnny ) That will give you a base. For your stomach. You eat that oily fish, you go up in the air, halfway to Sicily you'll be green and your hands will be sweating.
MR. JOHNNY: ( smiles ) You look after me.
PERRY: Patricia, please don't go!
PATRICIA: What do you think I am, a talking I was just making a point about the way you said. the way you stated your aspirations.
PERRY: I was just making a point about the way you said. the way you stated your aspirations.

PERRY: Kiss my aspirations. Oh, very clever. The height of cleverness. Waiter!
SHY WAITER: Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
PERRY: Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
SHY WAITER: But absolutely!

MR. JOHNNY: On the floor?
LORETTA: Yes, on the floor.
MR. JOHNNY: This is a good suit.
LORETTA: I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
MR. JOHNNY: Mr. Johnny slowly gets out of his chair. There's not enough room for him to kneel down. He has to ask two off-duty PRO WRESTLERS who are eating dinner to move their chairs. They do so with bemused expressions. Their names are BOB and MOOK.
WAITER: Is that man praying?
PERRY: Is that man praying?
JOHNNY: So. Will you ma.

MR. JOHNNY: Loretta. Loretta Castorini Clark. On my knees. In front of all these people. Will you marry me?
LORETTA: Yes, Johnny. Yes, John Anthony Cammareri. I will marry you. I will be your wife.
MR. JOHNNY: Bobo! The check!
PERRY: I feel like I have just witnessed a car accident.
SHY WAITER: When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
PERRY: What happened?
SHY WAITER: She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
LORETTA: What time is it?

MUSIC: VICKI CARR is SINGING "IT MUST BE HIM." The front hall is typical of big old brownstones. There's a big old oak coat rack with a built-in mirror and an umbrella stand. There are several coats hanging from it. The floor is littered with boots. There's also a side table. On the table is a large cut-glass bowl filled with a couple of pounds of hard candy. Loretta comes in and takes off her coat. A single MAD HOWL is HEARD, followed by a PANDEMONIUM OF BARKING. FIVE DOGS charge into the hall to greet Loretta. They are totally cockeyed, crackpot mutts. Their names are JUDAS, LUCY, LEO

I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another That's the bad blood between you and That's it.

CHRISSY: This is the most tormented man I have ever known. I am in love with this man. He doesn't know that. I never told him cause he can never love anybody since he lost his hand and his girl.
CHRISSY: Here. Why don't you just kill him? It would be so much more kind than coming here and inviting him to a wedding like he'll never have.
LORETTA: Where you live?
RONNY: She touches his shoulder.
LORETTA: Come on.

And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake What are you doing!
RONNY: What are you doing!

RONNY: Stop it!
LORETTA: Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a Because I have no Luck!
RONNY: Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a Because I have no Luck!
LORETTA: Because I have no Luck!

RONNY: Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
COSMO: Where's Loretta? We're gonna start without her.
ROSE'S VOICE: She must be eating out.
RAYMOND'S VOICE: She don't know what she's missing.
ROSE'S VOICE: It's not like her not to call.
RITA'S VOICE: Well, she's got a lot on her mind.
RITA: I mean, can we talk about it, Rose? Everybody's heard. She's getting married again.

RAYMOND: Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
RITA: Marriage is happy news.
COSMO: Rose, pass the wine.
RAYMOND: I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
COSMO: You were altogether asleep. You were No. You were there.
RAYMOND: No. You were there.
COSMO: I don't wanna talk about it.
ROSE: ( suddenly angry ) Well, what do you wanna talk about!
COSMO: Rita. Pass the wine.
ROSE: Why you drinking so much?
ROSE: Old Man, if you give another piece of my food to those dogs, I'm gonna kick you till you're dead!
ROSE: He doesn't stir. She goes to him and runs her hand through his hair.
ROSE: You drank too much and now you sleep too hard, and later you'll be up when you should be down.
LORETTA: What's that?
RONNY: That light.
LORETTA: That light.
RONNY: I don't know. I think it's the moon.
LORETTA: Ronny appears behind her, pulling on a robe. They speak in low voices, as if they were in church.
RONNY: It's so bright.
LORETTA: I've never seen a moon like that.
RONNY: It makes you look like an angel.
RONNY: Yeah. Looks like a big snowball.

RITA: Is who down there?
RAYMOND: What would he be doing down there?
RITA: What would he be doing down there?
RAYMOND: I don't know.
RITA: You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
OLD MAN: Alright now. Howl. Howl.
OLD MAN: How long must I wait? Quanto tempo devo aspettare!
LORETTA: Oh my God.
RONNY: Loretta jumps from bed, grabs her clothes to cover herself, and backs into closet.
LORETTA: What? What have we done?
RONNY: ( perturbed ) Take it easy.
LORETTA: ( from closet as she hurriedly gets dressed ) This time I was trying to do everything right.
RONNY: ( he grabs a bathrobe, pulls it on, puts it on and moves towards the closet. ) Don't just become excited.

LORETTA: Alright. Meet me at the Met.
RONNY: Alright. Meet me at the Met.
LORETTA: Alright. Where's the Met?
LORETTA: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last What sins have you to confess?

MUSIC: Loretta waltzes around in front of the mirror, flirting with herself in a very serious way. She starts to unbutton her EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT The moon is overhead as music continues to PLAY. The CAMERA SOARS UP CLOSE to the moon, until it completely FILLS THE FRAME with its magic. The moon dissolves into:
MUSIC PLAYS: END OF MUSIC EXT. LINCOLN CENTER PLAZA - NIGHT LINCOLN CENTER - LORETTA'S POV CROWDS OF PEOPLE in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created by the three great buildings. A glorious fountain filled with lights forms the centerpiece. Behind the fountain, grand and splendidly lit, is the magical Metropolitan Opera House. Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left, inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN The fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled. She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water, like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon.
RONNY: You look beautiful. Your hair.
LORETTA: You look beautiful. Your hair.
RONNY: You look beautiful. Your hair.
LORETTA: I thought I'd try it. You look good.
RONNY: Thank you.
LORETTA: I said I'd go to the opera with you. Nothing else.
LORETTA: Who painted that?
RONNY: Marc Chagall. A Russian.
LORETTA: Kinda gaudy.
RONNY: He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead. Come on, let's go in.
RONNY: Thank you!
LORETTA: For what?
RONNY: I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For. you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
LORETTA: So. Where are we sitting?
RONNY: Come on.
RONNY: Here we go.
JIMMY: Hello, Mrs. Castorini. Who's coming?
ROSE: It's just me. I want to eat.
JIMMY: I got a table for you right now.
JIMMY: I got a table for you right now.
JIMMY: This alright?
ROSE: He seats her.
JIMMY: Enjoy your meal. Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You eating alone tonight?
BOBO: Good evening Mrs. Castorini. You eating alone tonight?
ROSE: Hello, Bobo. Yes. Let me have a martini, no ice and two olives.
BOBO: Very good.
SHEILA'S VOICE: I'm trying to explain to you how I feel. Every time I try to explain how I feel, you explain how you feel. I don't think that's really much of a response.
BOBO: You wanna see a menu?
ROSE: Not yet. I'll wave.
SHEILA'S VOICE: I really do hate it though, when you take that tone with me. Like you're above it all and isn't it amusing.
MAN'S VOICE: But it is, isn't it?
SHEILA'S VOICE: Not to me! This is my life, no matter how damned comical it may seem to you. I don't need some man standing above the struggle while I roll around in the mud!
MAN'S VOICE: I think you like the mud and I don't. That's fair, isn't it? If I don't care to.
PERRY: Sorry about that, folks. She's a very pretty mental patient.
PERRY: Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
SHY WAITER: The Shy Waiter heads for the bar. For the first time, Perry notices Rose. They are facing each other with no obstacles in the way now.
PERRY: I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
ROSE: I'm not disturbed. By you.
PERRY: My lady friend has a personality She was just too young for you.
ROSE: She was just too young for you.
PERRY: ( to the Waiter ) Thanks, comrade.
SHY WAITER: It's nothing!
PERRY: ( Rose's comment strikes home ) Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
ROSE: None of your business.
PERRY: Sorry. That was rude.
ROSE: Will you join me for dinner?
PERRY: Are you sure?
PERRY: Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
ROSE: What do you do?
PERRY: I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
ROSE: That woman was a student of yours?
PERRY: Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
ROSE: There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
PERRY: Don't shit where you eat.
ROSE: Don't shit where you eat.
PERRY: ( taken aback, then recovering ) I'll remember that. What do you do?
ROSE: I'm a housewife.
PERRY: Then why are you eating alone?
ROSE: I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
PERRY: Go ahead.
ROSE: Why do men chase women?
PERRY: ( considers ) I think it's because they fear death.
ROSE: I think it's because they fear death.
PERRY: Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
PERRY: I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
ROSE: What you don't know about women is a
LORETTA: They get some turnout for this stuff.
RONNY: It's the best thing there is.
LORETTA: I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
MONA: You haven't once said you like my I like your dress. It's very bright.
COSMO: I like your dress. It's very bright.
MONA: Why you looking around so much?
COSMO: I don't know. I got a feeling.
MONA: I'm wearing your bracelet.
PERRY: May I walk with you a ways?
ROSE: They set off to the left.
PERRY: You knew that man?
ROSE: INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT THE STAGE - THE OPERA IS IN PROGRESS It's the SCENE in which MIMI is standing in the falling snow. She SINGS to RUDOLPH. It is a beautiful, poignant moment. The snow is falling, falling. Mimi is SINGING her heartbreaking aria of farewell. The lighted tavern window is behind them, glowing with a golden light.
LORETTA: That was just so. awful!
RONNY: Beautiful. Sad. She died!
LORETTA: Beautiful. Sad. She died!
RONNY: ( giving the check to the checker ) I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was
LORETTA: I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was
RONNY: She had TB.
LORETTA: I know. She was coughing her brains out. And still, she had to sing all the time.
LORETTA: Ronny looks at Loretta. He waits to follow her lead.
COSMO: Wait for me by the doors, Mona.
LORETTA: Pop? What are you doing here?
COSMO: Excuse me.
LORETTA: What'd you do to your hair?
COSMO: What'd you do to your hair?
LORETTA: I got it done.
COSMO: What are you doing here?
LORETTA: What are you doing here?
COSMO: Who is this man? You're engaged!
LORETTA: You're married.
COSMO: You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
LORETTA: You're my father.
COSMO: Alright. I didn't see you here.
LORETTA: I don't know whether I saw you or
RONNY: Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a
LORETTA: That wasn't my mother.
ROSE'S VOICE: That's my house.
PERRY'S VOICE: You mean the whole house?
ROSE'S VOICE: PERRY'S VOICE
PERRY'S VOICE: My God, it's a mansion!
ROSE'S VOICE: It's a house.
PERRY'S VOICE: I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
ROSE'S VOICE: He's a plumber.
PERRY'S VOICE: Well. That explains it.
PERRY: Temperature's dropping.
ROSE: I guess you can't invite me in?
PERRY: I guess you can't invite me in?
ROSE: People home.
PERRY: People home.
ROSE: No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
PERRY: I'm a little cold.
ROSE: You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
PERRY: We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
ROSE: I'm too old for you.
PERRY: I'm too old for me. That's my Good night.
ROSE: Good night.
PERRY: Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
ROSE: He kisses her on the cheek.
PERRY: I'm freezing
ROSE: Good night.
AL: Another Old-Fashion?
RONNY: No thanks.
LORETTA: No thanks.
RONNY: ( to Al ) I think that's it.
RONNY: What do you want to do now?
LORETTA: I wanna go home.
LORETTA: It's really cold.
RONNY: Yeah. It smells like snow.
LORETTA: My mother guessed that my father was seeing somebody and I told her she was crazy. She looked like a real piece of cheap goods. But who am I to talk?
RONNY: What's the matter?
LORETTA: How can you ask me that?
RONNY: You're making me feel guilty again.
LORETTA: You are guilty. I'm guilty.
RONNY: Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
LORETTA: I know what I know.
RONNY: And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
LORETTA: He didn't come!
RONNY: I'm here!
LORETTA: You're late!
RONNY: We're here.
LORETTA: This is your place.
RONNY: That's right.
LORETTA: This is where we're going!
RONNY: The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
LORETTA: The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
LORETTA: I went with you. Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone. A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what? Ronny? Are you listening to me?
RONNY: I'm really afraid.
LORETTA: I'm really afraid.
RONNY: I'm afraid of who I am.
LORETTA: I'm afraid of who I am.
RONNY: I was.
LORETTA: And you're not now?
LORETTA: Why not?
RONNY: I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
LORETTA: Let me go home.
RONNY: Let me go home.
LORETTA: Let me go home.
RONNY: I'm freezing to death.
LORETTA: I'm freezing to death.
RONNY: Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!

MR. JOHNNY: 19 Cranberry Street.
MR. JOHNNY: Hello. I'm sorry to call so late.
ROSE: Moving in?
MR. JOHNNY: I came right from the airport.
ROSE: Come on in.
MR. JOHNNY: Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
ROSE: She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
MR. JOHNNY: Thank you. Where is she?
ROSE: MR. JOHNNY
MR. JOHNNY: Where is she?
ROSE: Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
MR. JOHNNY: It's late.
ROSE: There's a pause. Mr. Johnny is uncomfortable with it.
MR. JOHNNY: Maybe I should go?
ROSE: What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
MR. JOHNNY: That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
ROSE: A miracle. Well, that's news.
MR. JOHNNY: My mother's recovered.
ROSE: You're kidding?
MR. JOHNNY: The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
ROSE: That's incredible.
MR. JOHNNY: The front door can be HEARD SLAMMING, out of view, and then Dogs can be HEARD BARKING. Mr. Johnny and Rose look to the entranceway. The Old Man appears there, holding the Five The Old Man looks at Rose. He is a specter. He stares, and then he makes a long low accusing NOISE. Then he disappears.
ROSE: Hello Pop.
MR. JOHNNY: Who was that?
ROSE: That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
MR. JOHNNY: Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
ROSE: But why would a man need more than one woman?
MR. JOHNNY: I don't know. Maybe because he fears
ROSE: That's it! That's the reason!
MR. JOHNNY: I don't know.
ROSE: No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
COSMO: ( taking in Mr. Johnny ) Hello, Mr. Castorini.
MR. JOHNNY: Hello, Mr. Castorini.
ROSE: Where you been?
COSMO: I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going. You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
MR. JOHNNY: I have my eyes open.
COSMO: You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
MR. JOHNNY: I don't know what you mean.
