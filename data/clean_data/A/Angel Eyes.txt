SHARON: Okay one thing I don't believe is that 'supposed to' business. We were 'supposed to' meet. That sounds a little fringy to me, like something you might hear on public access TV. You believe that?
CATCH: Some people say we each give off a particular odor that can only be detected by one other person's So, we. smell each other? Who says that?
SHARON: So, we. smell each other? Who says that?
CATCH: I have no idea. I'm more in the destiny school, we-met-in-another-life school. Do you believe that? Do you think when we die we come back in another form?

CATCH: You know the cop the woman cop? She. visited me.
ELANORA: Oh? Where did she sit?
CATCH: I have a chair now.
ELANORA: You're. seeing her?
CATCH: She has a lot of questions. She wants to know everything.
ELANORA: Of course she does. Everybody We could start from today. What's so wrong with that?
CATCH: We could start from today. What's so wrong with that?
ELANORA: Tell her.
CATCH: Tell her what?
ELANORA: Tell her, Catch. Tell somebody. It's been almost two years.
CATCH: ( a warning )
ELANORA: Every time I tell somebody, it gets a little bit easier. I'm not saying it goes.
CATCH: She is silenced. The moment hangs. She rolls her chair to him, takes a box of cookies out of his hand, opens the box and eats one, defusing the moment.
ELANORA: She nice?
CATCH: She's tough.
ELANORA: She pretty?
CATCH: That doesn't matter.
ELANORA: ( smiles ) She is pretty.
CATCH: She's sort of pissed-off at me.
ELANORA: For what?
CATCH: For what?
ELANORA: It doesn't matter. We like it when men apologize.
CATCH: I'm sorry I yelled at you.
ELANORA: Have a cookie. See?
SANDERMAN: ( typing )
SHARON: ( typing )
SANDERMAN: Anything bothering you?
SHARON: Why? What'd I do?
SANDERMAN: Nothing. I'm talking about your general attitude lately.
SHARON: My attitude's fine. End of a long day. I'm tired.
SANDERMAN: Family matters getting to you?
SHARON: Your brother, Larry.
SANDERMAN: Your brother, Larry.
SHARON: What about Larry?
SANDERMAN: You know Nester on the Culver City P.D.? He went out on a violent domestic dispute yesterday. A neighbor called it in. It got a little ugly. No arrest a warning.
SHARON: Larry. Oh Christ.
SANDERMAN: Nester said it's not the first
SHARON: Thanks for telling me.
LARRY: Jesus, you're up early.
SHARON: I wanted to catch you before you went to work.
LARRY: I thought you were on late shifts.
SHARON: I don't sleep much. Can I come
LARRY: What's up?
SHARON: Where's Kath?
LARRY: She's busy with Larry Jr. right
SHARON: Hey, Champ.
SHARON: Y'know, they call this one a woody 'cause it has wood on the sides.
LARRY: Why'd you come by?
SHARON: To see Kathy.
LARRY: She's not feeling good.
SHARON: I'll just say hello.
KATHY: Don't make it worse.
SHARON: It gets worse?
KATHY: He's okay now. He's torn up about it. Don't make him mad. When Larry and I were growing up, our mother said that all the time. 'Don't make your father mad.' Has he hit Larry Jr. yet?
SHARON: When Larry and I were growing up, our mother said that all the time. 'Don't make your father mad.' Has he hit Larry Jr. yet?
KATHY: He never would.
SHARON: Oh. Just you, huh?
LARRY: What d'you think you're doing in my house, Shar? In my home.
SHARON: You see a pattern here, bro?
LARRY: I lost my temper. Things got out of hand. It won't.
SHARON: People always say that: 'I've got a temper.' Like it's an excuse.
LARRY: I don't need a goddamn lecture.
SHARON: You want to hit someone? Next time your 'temper' flares up, Lar, and you just have to hit somebody, you go home and hit your father.
LARRY: You blame everything on him.
SHARON: I'm blaming you, you fucking He grabs her shirt hard.
LARRY: You don't come in here.
LARRY: You don't come in here and call me What do you call a man who uses his wife as a punching bag?
SHARON: What do you call a man who uses his wife as a punching bag?
KATHY: Don't hurt her, Lar.!
SHARON: I know how it feels, 'cause I remember. I remember standing between you and Dad and taking the blows for you and for what?! You turned out to be just like him, you bastard. And so did I.
SHARON: ( quietly ) Oh, God. Oh, shit.
SHARON: It's you, right?
SHARON: Can you just shut up? Just shut up and listen.
CATCH: I didn't say anything.
SHARON: I don't want to talk. I don't care if you have to play some game and pretend you're a. 'angel of mercy' or. whatever. I don't care, but I don't want to hear about it. All right? I don't want to hear anything.
SHARON: It's a bad night.
SHARON: This is good. but I'm too tired to stand up anymore.
SHARON: You want to kiss me?
SHARON: Kiss me someplace I've never been Why do you stop? You always stop.
SHARON: Why do you stop? You always stop.
CATCH: New day.
PINDELLA: ( to Sharon ) Drive, will you?
CATCH: ( to Sharon ) Drive, will you?
CATCH: The light changes. Pindella hurries to the curb as the cars surge forward. Sharon drives slowly, checking the mirror to see Pindella stare after them then enter the office building on the corner.
CATCH: Will you get off this street?
SHARON: What? You owe him money? If you take a right and stop we can walk from here. I'd rather
CATCH: If you take a right and stop we can walk from here. I'd rather
SHARON: If you're in trouble.
CATCH: I'm not.
SHARON: If you're in trouble with him, maybe I can help.
CATCH: Forget about him. Somebody I used to know. I don't want to know him anymore. That's all. Forget about it. Walk with me.
SHARON: This is not a great place to walk.
CATCH: I like it here. It's fine.
SHARON: I work here. It's not fine.
CATCH: What's the problem?
SHARON: Besides the shootings, break-ins, rapes, cart thefts? We've got a loose dog raiding garbage cans, knocking 'em over. Can't catch him. Got somebody blowing a trumpet between midnight and three. Can't find him.
SHARON: You know everybody here?
CATCH: How's it goin'?
YOUNG MAN: Goin' uphill, man.
CATCH: ( to Sharon ) You try it.
SHARON: Try what?
CATCH: Go ahead. We need this. I feel like a jerk. I feel like a smiley face.
SHARON: I feel like a jerk. I feel like a smiley face.
OLD MAN: Catch looks at her. She tries to shrug it off, but can't quite hide her pleasure. Now Catch is pausing as a woman is walking her six-year-old daughter to their parked car. Catch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy wave that makes her smile. Sharon smiles, too. As the girl's MOTHER is unlocking the car, the girl shyly looks back at Catch for more fun. He does that quick finger trick trying to catch his own thumb, and the girl giggles But the Mother is impatient.
MOM: Go on.
MOM: Move your arm!
MOM: What are you staring at?
CATCH: She feels bad 'cause you yelled at What?! Who the hell do you think you are?
MOM: What?! Who the hell do you think you are?
CATCH: She just needs you to smile at
MOM: It's none of your business!
CATCH: Why not smile at her? What's it Who the hell are you to talk to
MOM: Who the hell are you to talk to
CATCH: You're so damn impatient.
WOMAN: Get away from me!
CATCH: You're so busy being pissed off, and time is going by.
WOMAN: It's not her fault.
CATCH: It's not her fault.
WOMAN: I'm calling the police!
CATCH: No. I'm calling the police. Hey police. Jesus Christ, Catch.
SHARON: Jesus Christ, Catch.
CATCH: Maybe she'll think about it now.
SHARON: You had no right to do that. God! You think you know everything?! Who the hell are you, some expert on raising kids?! The neighborhood angel?! Jesus!
CATCH: No. No, I just. some people are walking around blind.
SHARON: That's not your problem!
CATCH: Don't tell me what my problem is!
SHARON: Okay, fine you tell me what it Maybe it's not my problem. Maybe it's your problem. Maybe you're going around blind.
CATCH: Maybe it's not my problem. Maybe it's your problem. Maybe you're going around blind.
SHARON: Blind to what?!
CATCH: Blind to what's going on around you. Blind to what people need. We're supposed to take care of each other. We're supposed to keep each other safe. That's the way it should be if you're not going around blind, like that
SHARON: Or like me, right? What about you? How come you can see?
CATCH: I think I'll. walk the rest of the way on my own.
SHARON: Yeah. Fine.
CATCH: I'll call you later about the I'll be out.
SHARON: I'll be out.
CATCH: Shar. wait. Hey!
SHARON'S POV: She is watching the people on the street, NOTICING, for once, just how isolated they are, each in a box, passing without connecting.
ON SHARON: INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY We've never seen the apartment flooded by sunlight like this, all blinds open.
CATCH: Do we go for. symmetry? Or. more off-center. Japanese.
CATCH: Are you into this? Bob?
LARRY: I don't want you around here.
SHARON: Let's go talk in the yard.
SHARON: You took a swing at me.
LARRY: You asked for it calling me a coward. You knew I'd swing. You think I look bad now? Look at
LARRY: Nice, huh? Beautiful. The cops'll love this, right? Evidence. Don't you guys love
LARRY: You wanted me to swing.
SHARON: I'm sorry I hit you so hard.
LARRY: But you're not sorry you hit me.
SHARON: Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy's That's not your business! Nobody called you, right? She didn't ask for you to come here. This is my family. You don't get it, 'cause you've got no family. Nobody. So you try to run everybody else's life. Jesus Christ get your own life. That's the goddam problem. Get your own goddamn

SHARON: Okay. I'm sorry I came here. I'm sorry I hit you. Okay?
LARRY: Okay what?
SHARON: Don't go to my department, all Why the hell not?
LARRY: Why the hell not?
SHARON: Why not?!
LARRY: Why not?!
SHARON: Because the job's all I got.
LARRY: That's what I said, right? No
SHARON: That's what you said.
LARRY: And you won't come around here. You won't call. Ever.
LARRY: And I don't want you to come to Mom and Dad's celebration.
LARRY: Not the church. Not the party. Stay away. I don't want you around. I don't want to see you,
LARRY: Go get a life.
SHARON: I got a life!
SHARON: How the hell would you know about my life?!
LARRY: I know.
SHARON: You know nothing about me, because you don't want to know. The family doesn't want to know me. Well, too bad. Sharon's got a life. Sharon's got a boyfriend. Sharon's going hiking in the morning with her boyfriend. She's not sitting alone miserable like you want. Too bad!
CATCH: Hey. Hey! Can you wait up a
SHARON: I thought you walked all over the The city is flat. Okay? Can we stop here? Can we examine the view? Have a Milky Way? I've burned every calorie I ever had.
CATCH: ( gasping ) The city is flat. Okay? Can we stop here? Can we examine the view? Have a Milky Way? I've burned every calorie I ever had.
SHARON: My favorite lunch spot is another half mile.
CATCH: She smiles and walks on, and he follows, calling out.
CATCH: I'm not one of those competitive guys, you know!
CATCH: No thanks. I can't eat and have a heart attack at the same time.
CATCH: As soon as you get happy, you get I'm okay. Everything's code four.
SHARON: I'm okay. Everything's code four.
CATCH: Everything's what?
SHARON: Everything's fine.
CATCH: Fine? This isn't fine. I know fine. This is something else. Something happened yesterday.
SHARON: Yesterday you mean you want to hear about it?
CATCH: Sure I do.
SHARON: No kidding. Why? You never talk about yesterday.
CATCH: All my days are the same.
SHARON: Yesterday. Okay. Yesterday we rolled on a 415. Juliette and Sanchez had these four guys against a wall, but they were H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It got pretty jumpy, but we got them in the car with a couple of bruises and Robby got a sprained wrist, so I did the rest of the shift with a rookie who lost it over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old woman who'd been dead maybe six, seven days, and I usually do all right but the smell got to me, and I can still smell her. Then we arrested a prostitute working out of her home, and I carried her little girl out to the social worker, and the kid was holding on real tight and making my shoulder wet and I wanted to punch her rock-head mother, and then shift ended and I had a nice visit with my brother Larry.
CATCH: ( softly ) I'm sorry. That would make anybody sad.
SHARON: Sorry you asked?
CATCH: No. No, you can always tell me.
SHARON: Well. I feel better now. You feel better?
CATCH: I feel fine. Great.
SHARON: What are you doing?!
SHARON: Catch! There's no swimming here! And you can't be naked in a state
CATCH: Take the day off, Pogo!
SHARON: What if a park ranger comes?!
CATCH: Take your badge off for once. Don't be such a damn Marine about everything. Just.
CATCH: Someplace I've never been kissed.
CATCH: They tell me I was in an accident. Long time ago.
SHARON: Looks like a bad one.
CATCH: I don't remember it. I.
SHARON: We should be thinking about lunch. We have to pack up.
CATCH: So soon?
SHARON: Some of us have to work. You ever work?
CATCH: Yeah. I worked.
SHARON: Oh? You remember that? Working?
JACK: Catch Jesus!
JACK: How are you? Sit down. Been years. You been out of town?
CATCH: ( sitting ) I've been around.
JACK: Oh, man, I'm really sorry about what happened. I never got a chance to say.
CATCH: We don't need to go there.
JACK: Okay. All right. So. what d'you want, a coffee?
CATCH: I want my old job back. What d'you think?
JACK: You been workin'?
CATCH: No, but I'm up to speed.
JACK: ( thinks ) Well, it's not good with Randal No, he's out of it, but Danny Coley's got something going. Wanna go see 'im?
CATCH: No, he's out of it, but Danny Coley's got something going. Wanna go see 'im?
JACK: No, he's out of it, but Danny Coley's got something going. Wanna go see 'im?
CATCH: Finish your coffee.
SHARON: I have to check these jacket pockets. What's your name
SHARON: I need to unsnap this, Allison. I'm checking your waistband. You got to Whitney School?
ALLISON: St. Mark's.
SHARON: Lift your arms higher. Got a good basketball team at St. Mark's. You play basketball?
ROBBY: What's going on, Pogo? You're not happy or anything?
SHARON: Well, it's a mix, Robby. Life is shit, but I'm dating this great dead guy.
SHARON: He says before I came along, he thought he was dead. Sounds better when he says it Shhh. Sh!
ROBBY: Shhh. Sh!
SHARON: Shhh. Sh!
SHARON: The trumpet player.
ROBBY: This time we got his ass.
SHARON: Got 'im?
ROBBY: Got 'im?
SHARON: Look at that moon.
ROBBY: Full moon, man. Hey!
DRIVER: This guy's crazy!
SHARON: Are you McGuire?
SHARON: Mark McGuire?
SHARON: Then put that bat away. Put it in your trunk. Now.
DRIVER: I never touched his car.
SHARON: Ow. Ow!
CATCH: No. That's good. Deeper.
SHARON: No. That's good. Deeper.
CATCH: ( as he works ) How heavy was this guy?
SHARON: Like a truck.
CATCH: God. Tractor-trailer?
SHARON: Pickup. Ow. Ow! That's really She begins to moan as he digs out the pain. He is fighting against the erotic charge of this, trying to keep it medicinal, but he's got his hands all over her naked back, and she is moaning so he stops and takes a He reaches to the bed table and puts oil on his hands, noticing a card that stands open on the tabletop, a very pretty invitation.
CATCH: I better. More oil.
CATCH: This is pretty.
SHARON: Don't get oil on it.
CATCH: Renewal of vows that's great. Is this your parents?
SHARON: Yes. Just put it down. I'm not Why not?
CATCH: Why not?
SHARON: If I go, my brother'll hurt me with the department. I got mad and knocked him down. All they need is a complaint. Just leave it alone and keep rubbing. Okay?
CATCH: So. he says you can't go?
SHARON: Can't you rub without talking? It's been bad with my family a long time, so the hell with it anyway. If they don't want me there, I don't want to be there. All right?
CATCH: All right. Bad how?
SHARON: Oh, Jesus!
SHARON: My father used to knock us around, all of us. But I'm the one who called the cops finally. They say I turned against the
CATCH: But. they invited you.
SHARON: You don't know anything about it. So forget it.
CATCH: Well. I know about family.
SHARON: Oh, yeah? What about it?
CATCH: It's. a door you don't close.
SHARON: I didn't close the door.
CATCH: You're closing it now. Right? Family invites you, you go. Family shows up, you welcome them in. That's family.
SHARON: Oh, sure. What if they don't deserve it?
CATCH: Then you forgive.
SHARON: You have all the answers.
CATCH: No. I just. It seems like a chance, doesn't it? A chance to make things right. I'd take it. Then you tried y'know? And it's up to them.
SHARON: You close with your family?
SHARON: See? So why should I listen to
CATCH: What's your favorite song?
SHARON: Catch, I'm beat. So are they. I think they're finished.
CATCH: One more. It's a surprise.
SHARON'S POV: From the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano, Catch picks up a trumpet case, opens it. Now Sharon's tired smile is changing to curiosity, wonder.
ON CATCH: As he puts the mouthpiece on the horn, nervous, but excited, too, speaking to the Piano Player.
CATCH: Thanks, Danny.
ON SHARON: Mouth-open surprise and then smiling with the wonder - - and Catch begins to play, closing his eyes and rendering a ballad, like the haunting "ANGEL EYES." Sharon's smile slowly fades, replaced by a much deeper look, not only because he is so good, but because he is showing her his heart, his love and even his pain more than he can show her any other way. We INTERCUT as he opens his eyes briefly, watching her, sending her the music, closing his eyes again to fall into the song as Sharon's eyes fill at the beauty and sadness of it, and at this look inside her man. We LINGER. Then.
SHARON: Where I've never been kissed.
SHARON: Oh, God. Are you in danger there?
RAY: Are you in danger there?
SHARON: Go away.
RAY: I was talking to him, Pogo.
CATCH: No thanks, Ray. Everything's code four. Go away.
SHARON: See that place? He's going to be playing there every weekend.
RAY: ( impressed; to Catch ) Oh, yeah? What d'you play?
SHARON: It's music, Ray. You wouldn't like it.
SHARON'S POV: She sees Catch and Bob on their way into the park across the street from the building.
ON SHARON: She smiles and moves into the bedroom to dress.
CATCH: You like these?
TOMMY: Well. They're for you. We can pretend it's your birthday.
CATCH: Well. They're for you. We can pretend it's your birthday.
CATCH: I hope you don't mind.
TOMMY: They're for me, Mom!
CATCH: Yeah. I've. kind of been saving them up.
CANDACE: For Tommy?
CANDACE: Well, thank you. Thanks a lot.
ON CATCH: He watches Tommy at play with the figures, but it's almost too much for him. He touches the boy and rises, smiles and nods at Candace and begins to walk off.
ON SHARON: She hurries her steps to intersect with Catch.
CANDACE: Wow, Tommy Look at them all. Did you say thank you? Excuse me!
CANDACE: Excuse me!
ON CATCH: But he is walking on, some of the emotion seeping through, not darkness, some old joy welling up. We see, in b.g., Tommy starts to run after him to say thanks. We now have a convergence of Tommy, Sharon and Catch, who is moving steadily toward the street, crossing a bike path now. A BIKER is coming on. All in one moment Catch hears the WHIZZ of the BIKE, Tommy calling out "Thank you," and Candace shouting "Be careful!" And Catch goes cold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike path, taking the collision with the bike so Tommy is sure to be safe. Catch and the biker fall hard. Sharon stops holding her breath. Tommy watches, wide-eyed, and Candace comes running. Catch is rising, a little sore and soiled. The biker is But Catch is walking away with that frozen, numb look, all shut down by his fear and his memory as Bob trots along beside him and the Biker comes after him and Tommy and Candace watch him go and Sharon hurries her steps to catch up. The Biker reaches Catch first.
BIKER: Goddammit I saw the kid. Jesus. I wasn't even close.
BIKER: Wait a minute! Hey!
BIKER: Why the hell did you cause a wreck?! I told you I saw the kid, you idiot. I was.
CATCH: One more word, and your life will change forever.
SHARON: Catch! Catch!
SHARON: Are you all right? Your elbow's bleeding. I.
SHARON: What's wrong?
SHARON: Where are you going? Catch you're scaring me. Please.
SHARON: Please, Catch, don't. Can't you talk to me?!
SHARON: Please. Wait. I. Catch!
ON CATCH: As the traffic moves around him and the dog a HORN BLARES, BRAKES SCREECH, and he thrown into a storm of.
FLASHBACKS: That come sharper and faster than before, bits and pieces of memory outside any order: He is driving, Annie smiles at him, headlights blind him, Annie screams, the little boy in Annie's arms grins at him, BRAKES SCREAM, Annie says something to him, calmly, but he can't hear her, the headlights blind him again and BRAKES SCREAM again, and:
ON SHARON: Watching him, shocked and frightened for him. She sees the traffic let up, and Catch crosses and walks toward home. She watches him go.
ROBBY: Are you going to tell me why we're sitting outside this building Watching for somebody. Tall guy. 40s. Grey-blond hair.
SHARON: Watching for somebody. Tall guy. 40s. Grey-blond hair.
ROBBY: What's it about?
SHARON: It's personal.
ROBBY: Fine what am I supposed to do?
SHARON: She watches the building, studying the people who come and go.
CATCH: ( softly )
CATCH: I've been. remembering.
CATCH: It's awful.
CATCH: I'll call you.
SHARON: Give me fifteen.
PINDELLA: Oh. is there a problem?
SHARON: I'm not sure. Who am I speaking I'm Dr. Pindella.
PINDELLA: I'm Dr. Pindella.
SHARON: What kind of doctor?
PINDELLA: What is this?
SHARON: Do you know a Catch Lambert?
PINDELLA: Oh. Yes! Is he in trouble?
SHARON: I. need to talk to you.
PINDELLA: Well, I have a patient in five minutes. But I can.
SHARON: Are you a.?
PINDELLA: I'm a psychiatrist.
SHARON: And Mr. Lambert.
PINDELLA: My relationship with Mr. Lambert is confidential.
SHARON: He's your patient. He's your patient we. know all this. This is police business. I'm officer Sharon Pogue L.A.P.D.
PINDELLA: Look. I want to help Mr. Lambert but I can't tell you anything that isn't public record.
SHARON: In general. In general. He's your patient, and he.
PINDELLA: He's not my patient. He walked away from treatment. That was. nearly a year ago.
SHARON: Why did he walk away?
PINDELLA: I can't discuss that, but if you know how to reach him, I would appreciate being able to talk to You can help by just telling me what's in the public record. It'll take me half a day to do a search. Can you tell me? Just.
SHARON: ( desperate ) You can help by just telling me what's in the public record. It'll take me half a day to do a search. Can you tell me? Just.
SHARON: Can you please tell me what's in the record?
PINDELLA: You were with him in the car. Your uniform threw me. Are you his friend?
SHARON: He takes that in, leans back on the desk.
PINDELLA: I can tell you he was in an accident, hospitalized, referred to me as an outpatient.
SHARON: What accident?
PINDELLA: A bus. a city bus hit his vehicle. That was a couple of years ago. It was. an awful thing. His family was in the van. His wife and child. His wife's A bus. and a van. Where? On. the freeway?
SHARON: A bus. and a van. Where? On. the freeway?
SHARON: Survivors? Only him? I. don't Yes. I was there. I was there.
PINDELLA: ( CONTINUED )
SHARON: ( quietly ) Yes. I was there. I was there.
PINDELLA: His wife's mother survived, but. she was paralyzed.
PINDELLA: Elanora Chu. She's still in town, I believe.
SHARON: Does he. still see her?
PINDELLA: He used to. I don't know. I'm glad to see. he has someone else who cares about him. I know he's running from this. He left all his friends, his home, his whole life.
SHARON: He says. he doesn't remember the He lost a lot of memory. I tried to help him with that. He resisted. Walked away.
PINDELLA: He lost a lot of memory. I tried to help him with that. He resisted. Walked away.
SHARON: I think he remembers me.
SHARON: How does he live?
PINDELLA: He received a large settlement from the city, but he.barely touches it. He was a professional
SHARON: As he says that, we hear our TRUMPET MUSIC begin a fast and furious MUTED TRUMPET, incredible RIFFS, and we use this to carry us, as we.
SHARON: Catch, it's me. Can you pick up?
SHARON: Why don't we. meet tomorrow? I'll be in Westwood. Can you meet me there? Westwood and Cole. About two o'clock. Okay?

CATCH: You going to tell me where we're That's okay. I mean. I'll go anywhere with you, Shar. Jaws of death. The mall on a Saturday. Just about any.
HIS POV: We see an ivy-covered brick building there, with a sign that is too far away for us to read.
SHARON: You can trust me, you know.
SHARON: I've got you now. I'm holding on like before.
CATCH: What d'you mean?
SHARON: Like I held you before. Like I did at the accident.
SHARON: What makes it so. unspeakable, Catch? What makes it like that?
SHARON: Is it because you were driving?
SHARON: I read the reports, and it wasn't your fault. It wasn't. Is it because you survived and they
SHARON: Catch. Please. Hold on, and we'll go in there together.
SHARON: You can talk to them. You can say goodbye or I love you or
CATCH: This is wrong! It's wrong! Why are you doing this?!
SHARON: To help you.
CATCH: I don't need your help! I don't need this. We don't need this we're fine.
SHARON: We're not. We're not fine, Catch. Nothing is fine no matter how much you pretend. You pretend that nothing happened. You walk all over the city helping people, but you're dying inside.
SHARON: You pretend that nothing happened. You walk all over the city helping people, but you're dying inside.
CATCH: I'm not dying! I'm not pretending! I don't remember! I don't remember any of it. So leave me alone! What good does it do? It's gone! And I'm all right this way! Why do you have to change it? I'm all right.

SHARON: Don't walk away. Okay?
FATHER: She gestures toward his hearing aid.
SHARON: Is it working? Do you need to check it?
FATHER: It's fine.
SHARON: But the kitchen door opens. We hear the party going on out there. Larry and Sharon's Mother enter, her Mother looking at her husband and back to her daughter, very frightened. Larry is raging in a near whisper.
LARRY: What the hell are you doing?!
MOTHER: Sharon, please.
SHARON: Please? Please what?! Will you stop protecting him? You were always protecting him! Don't talk to your father. Don't bother your
SHARON: I'm going to bother you for one minute, Dad. Okay? Can you handle that?

HER FATHER: watching this. Her Mother is near panic, Larry staring hard, Kathy wondering. INTERCUT their reactions
