BASIL EXPOSITION: As you know, gentlemen, Dr. Evil had himself frozen in 1967. Soon after, Austin Powers volunteered to have himself frozen, in the event Dr. Evil should ever return. We believe Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot to take over the world. And that, gentlemen, is why we're here.
COMMAND GILMOUR: Outstanding re-cap, Exposition.

BASIL EXPOSITION: You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
AUSTIN: ( shouting )
BASIL EXPOSITION: The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
AUSTIN: Yes, I'm having trouble
BASIL EXPOSITION: You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
AUSTIN: Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
BASIL EXPOSITION: A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.

BASIL EXPOSITION: We won, Austin.
AUSTIN: Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya! Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
COMMANDER GILMOUR: Mr. Powers, the President's very concerned. We've got a madman on the loose in Nevada.
BASIL EXPOSITION: It's Dr. Evil.
AUSTIN: When do I begin?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
AUSTIN: You mean Mrs. Kensington?
BASIL EXPOSITION: No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms. Kensington is her daughter.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Vanessa's one of our top agents.
AUSTIN: ( out loud, to himself ) My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue? ( pause ) I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
VANESSA: Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
AUSTIN: Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding My mother's told me all about you.
VANESSA: My mother's told me all about you.

VANESSA: My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Yes, well.Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated. She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.

AUSTIN: BASIL EXPOSITION
BASIL EXPOSITION: Be careful.

You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
VANESSA: Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
AUSTIN: ( excited ) My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
AUSTIN: Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
VANESSA: I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative.
AUSTIN: That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and I beg your pardon?
VANESSA: I beg your pardon?
AUSTIN: I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
VANESSA: Excuse me?
AUSTIN: My wedding tackle.
VANESSA: I'm sorry?
AUSTIN: My meat and two veg.
VANESSA: Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
AUSTIN: Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
VANESSA: A Chigro?
AUSTIN: You know, a Chigro Chinese, part Negro&emdash; Chigro.
VANESSA: ( offended ) We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
AUSTIN: That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right? Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'? We're called 'flight attendants' now, thank you very much.
AUSTIN: Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a whore, I'm a sex worker', baby.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: My name is Mrs. Wilkenson. There are a few things we need to discuss. First of all, we're not wearing these.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: ALSO, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ITINERARY. IT SAYS HERE, '4:30 - DINNER, 5:30 - Everyone Gets Naked and Covered with Baby Oil, 6:00 - Orgy'?
AUSTIN: Seems pretty straightforward, don't you think.listen darling, I think you're a fabulous bird. Can I get your telephone number?
FLGHT ATTENDANT: ( mock sexy ) Sure, it's easy to remember. ( writing on his hand ) It's 777-FILM. We have to prepare the craft for take-off now.
AUSTIN: Smashing! When we land I'll give you a tinkle on the telling bone.
AUSTIN: Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!
VANESSA: Do I make you horny?
AUSTIN: Do I make you horny?
VANESSA: Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
AUSTIN: Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
VANESSA: I hope this is part of the unfreezing Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger that's what I do, I swing.
AUSTIN: Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger that's what I do, I swing.
VANESSA: I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever. If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
AUSTIN: What's you point, Vanessa?
COMPUTER VOICE: You've got mail!
BASIL EXPOSITION: Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Thank you, Exposition.
AUSTIN: Thank you, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Oh, and Austin
AUSTIN: BASIL EXPOSITION
BASIL EXPOSITION: Be careful.
PILOT: ( over loudspeaker ) Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning our final descent into Las Vegas International Airport. Flight attendants will be coming by to collect your drinks, and I'll ask you at this time to please return to the main cabin and put your
DR. EVIL: ( face again unseen ) Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a long time, but I'm back. It's all gone perfectly to plan except for one small flaw. Because of a technical error, my right arm was not frozen. I was therefore by definition only partially frozen.
MUSTAFA: But my design was perfect! Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
DR. EVIL: Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
MUSTAFA: But Dr. Evil, all you need to do work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm.
DR. EVIL: And look what you've done to Mr.
MUSTAFA: We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation
DR. EVIL: ( face unseen )
MUSTAFA: ( blood-curdling scream ) ( face unseen ) Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
DR. EVIL: ( face unseen ) Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
DR. EVIL: Gentlemen, let's get down to business.
DR. EVIL: We've got a lot of work to do.
DR. EVIL: ( slightly distracted ) Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
DR. EVIL: ( very frustrated ) You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
DR. EVIL: Right. Okay. Moving on.
DR. EVIL: Let me go around the table and introduce everyone. Frau .founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army. Random Task.
DR. EVIL: .founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army. Random Task.
DR. EVIL: .a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman extraordinaire. Show them what you
DR. EVIL: Thank you, Random Task. Patty
DR. EVIL: .ex-Irish assassin. His trademark?
DR. EVIL: A superstitious man, he leaves a tiny keepsake on every victim he kills. Scotland Yard would love to get their hands on that piece of Yes, they're always after me lucky
PATTY O'BRIEN: ( heavy Irish accent ) Yes, they're always after me lucky
PATTY O'BRIEN: What? What? Why does everyone always laugh when I say that? They are after me lucky charms.
PATTY O'BRIEN: ( angry ) ( through suppressed laughter ) It's a television commercial with this little cartoon Leprechaun who is a benevolent imp who is very concerned that these children will steal his lucky charms which are foodstuffs fashioned into various shapes&emdash; hearts, moons, clovers, what have you. ( pause ) It's a long story.
FRAU FARBISSINA: ( through suppressed laughter ) It's a television commercial with this little cartoon Leprechaun who is a benevolent imp who is very concerned that these children will steal his lucky charms which are foodstuffs fashioned into various shapes&emdash; hearts, moons, clovers, what have you. ( pause ) It's a long story.
DR. EVIL: Finally, I come to my number two man. His name: Number Two.
DR. EVIL: For thirty years, Number Two has run Virtucon, the legitimate face of my evil empire.
NUMBER TWO: Over the last thirty years, Virtucon has grown by leaps and bounds. About fifteen years ago, we changed from volatile chemicals to the communication industry. We own cable companies in thirty-eight states.
NUMBER TWO: In addition to our cable holdings, we own a steel mill in Cleveland.
NUMBER TWO: Shipping in Texas.
NUMBER TWO: Oil refineries in Seattle.
NUMBER TWO: And a factory in Chicago that makes miniature models of factories.
NUMBER TWO: We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors. Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
DR. EVIL: Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to
NUMBER TWO: Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
DR. EVIL: People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here. OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser." Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around
NUMBER TWO: Umm, that also has already happened.
DR. EVIL: ( pause ) Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage. ( pause ) Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom. ( dramatic pause )
NUMBER TWO: Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
DR. EVIL: All right then.
NUMBER TWO: Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
DR. EVIL: ( pleasantly surprised ) Oh, really? ( slightly irritated ) One-hundred billion dollars. ( pause ) OK, make it happen. Anything else?
FRAU FARBISSINA: Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
DR. EVIL: FRAU FARBISSINA
FRAU FARBISSINA: Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
DR. EVIL: My son?
FRAU FARBISSINA: ( calling out )
SCOTT EVIL: DR. EVIL ( emotional ) ( gesturing to globe ) SCOTT EVIL
DR. EVIL: Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son! Someday, Scott, this will all be I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
SCOTT EVIL: I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
AUSTIN: You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
VANESSA: Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally,
AUSTIN: Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
VANESSA: No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
AUSTIN: Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
AUSITN: Which side of the bed do you want?
VANESSA: You're going to sleep on the sofa. I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, that the only reason we're sharing a room is to support our cover story that we're a married couple on So, shall we shag now, or shall we shag later? How do you like to do it? Do you like to wash up first? Top and tails? A whore's bath? Personally, before I'm on the job, I like to give my undercarriage a bit of a how's-your-father.
AUSTIN: So, shall we shag now, or shall we shag later? How do you like to do it? Do you like to wash up first? Top and tails? A whore's bath? Personally, before I'm on the job, I like to give my undercarriage a bit of a how's-your-father.
AUSTIN: ( off her angry reaction ) I'm just joking, Vanessa. Trying to get a rise out of you.
VANESSA: Let's unpack.
AUSTIN: Gor blimey, nerd alert.
AUSTIN: Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me! Honestly, this isn't mine.
VANESSA: ( suffering ) I'm sure.
AUSTIN: I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- Hello! And welcome to 777-FILM!
AUSTIN: I got her answering machine.
AUSTIN: I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
VANESSA: Here, use mine.
AUSTIN: I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to
AUSTIN: Do you mind if I join you?
NUMBER TWO: Not at all.
DEALER: Zoom in on Number Two's eyepatch.
NUMBER TWO: Hit me.
DEALER: You have seventeen, sir. The book says not to, sir.

ITALIAN WOMAN: ( Italian accent ) My name is Alotta ( quickly ) Alotta Fagina.
AUSTIN: I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it. It sounds like you're saying your name is a lot of.never mind. Listen, cats, I'm going to crash. It's been a gas.
NUMBER TWO: Bye-bye, Mr.Cunningham?
AUSTIN: Peace, baby.
VANESSA: Why did you leave so soon?
AUSTIN: That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
TEXAN: Good luck, buddy. You don't buy food, you rent it.
AUSTIN: Too right, youth.
AUSTIN: ( grunting ) Uh, uh!
TEXAN: Hey pardner, just relax, don't force it! Use some creative visualization.

MRS. KENSINGTON: ( on phone ) Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the How's Austin?
MRS. KENSINGTON: How's Austin?
MRS. KENSINGTON: You didn't.
VANESSA: Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the
VANESSA: MRS. KENSINGTON ( V.O. )
VANESSA: Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
VANESSA: What about his teeth?
MRS. KENSINGTON: You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
VANESSA: I just don't see it.
MRS. KENSINGTON: Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get Did you ever.
VANESSA: Did you ever.
MRS. KENSINGTON: Of course not. I was married to your father.

VANESSA: We can't just sit here, Austin.
AUSTIN: Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the I don't get it.
VANESSA: I don't get it.

AUSTIN: Oh, yes you are.
VANESSA: I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
AUSTIN: I can't. You're drunk.
VANESSA: It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about. What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
AUSTIN: ( sentimental ) She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was

AUSTIN: What, and watch all my earnings go. Down the toilet?
ALOTTA: What do you want, Mr.Cunningham, was it?
AUSTIN: Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta. You may.
ALOTTA: You may.
AUSTIN: Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
ALOTTA: Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
AUSTIN: ( smug ) I didn't, baby, you just told me.
ALOTTA: It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
AUSTIN: MUSIC: "The Look of Love" by SERGIO MENDEZ AND BRAZIL 66 Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen. In silhouette she takes off her clothes and puts on a robe. She opens a pair of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto.
ALOTTA: Come in.
AUSTIN: I'd rather talk about Number Two.
ALOTTA: Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
ALOTTA: May I wash you?
AUSTIN: She washes his back. Behind his back, she pulls out his wallet and looks through it. ANGLE ON HIS IDENTIFICATION. It reads "AUSTIN POWERS, INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY."
ALOTTA: In Japan, men come first and women come second.
AUSTIN: Or sometimes not at all.
ALOTTA: Care for some saki?
AUSTIN: Sak-i it to me! How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
ALOTTA: How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
AUSTIN: Mmmm.I feel extreme relaxation.

DR. EVIL: Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.
DR. EVIL: In a little while, you'll find out that the Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing. Well, it's in safe hands. If you want it back, you'll have to pay me.ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
DR. EVIL: ( frustrated ) Sorry. ONE-HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS!
DR. EVIL: ( angry ) Doctor Evil! I didn't spend six years in evil medical school to be called 'mister'.
DR. EVIL: Fine, have it your way. Gentlemen, you have five days to come up with
DR. EVIL: Really? So long.
DR. EVIL: ( to evil associates ) Gentlemen, in exactly five days from now, we will be one-hundred billion dollars richer. ( laughing ) ( slightly louder ) ( laughing with him )
EVIL ASSOCIATES: ( laughing with him )
DR. EVIL: Okay.Well.I think I'm going to watch some TV.
EVIL ASSOCIATES: Okay. Sure.
AUSTIN: Hello, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high-jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
AUSTIN: Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear What's the other?
BASIL EXPOSITION: What's the other?
AUSTIN: Excuse me?
BASIL EXPOSITION: What's the other thing you're scared Circus folk. Nomads, you know. They smell like Indeed.If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle. I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.

BASIL EXPOSITION: Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
VANESSA: When did you find that out, Austin?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Austin did some reconnaissance work at Alotta Fagina's penthouse last Our next move is to infiltrate Virtucon. Any ideas?
VANESSA: BASIL EXPOSITON
BASIL EXPOSITON: Our next move is to infiltrate Virtucon. Any ideas?
VANESSA: Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their facilities every hour. I suggest we pose as tourists and do site-level Top drawer, Kensington. Oh, Austin, I want you to meet somebody.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Top drawer, Kensington. Oh, Austin, I want you to meet somebody.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Austin, this is my mother, Mrs. Exposition. She's in from Tunbridge
BASIL EXPOSITION: My God, Austin, what have you done?
AUSTIN: That's not your mother, that's a
MRS. EXPOSITION: Owww.my hair!
BASIL EXPOSITION: Get away from my mother!
VANESSA: Austin, have you gone mad?
MRS. EXPOSITION: ( through pain ) Who is that man? Why did he hit me?
BASIL EXPOSIION: Don't worry, mother. Lie down. Austin, you have a lot of explaining to do.
AUSTIN: I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
AUSTIN: You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
VANESSA: Really, Austin!
AUSTIN: Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
BASIL EXPOSITION: All right, Austin, I think you should I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
AUSTIN: I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.

AUSTIN: Basil escorts his mother out.
VANESSA: Austin, may I have a word with you?
AUSTIN: Of course, luv.
VANESSA: Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this
AUSTIN: Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
VANESSA: ( stunned ) I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use Of course, I had my nine-millimeter No, did you use a condom?
AUSTIN: Of course, I had my nine-millimeter No, did you use a condom?
VANESSA: No, did you use a condom?
AUSTIN: Only sailors use condoms, man.
VANESSA: Not in the Nineties.
AUSTIN: Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port. Alotta meant nothing to me.
VANESSA: ( pause ) Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
AUSTIN: It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
VANESSA: You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
AUSTIN: Hello, luv.
VANESSA: Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
AUSTIN: Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
VANESSA: Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
AUSTIN: Out and about, doing odds and sods.
VANESSA: I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
SON 1: ( crying ) I love you, Dad.
DAD 1: I love you, Son.
THERAPIST: That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr..Ehville?
DR. EVIL: Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
GROUP: Hello, Dr. Evil. Hello, Scott.
SCOTT EVIL: ( into it ) Hello, everybody.
THERAPIST: So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
SCOTT EVIL: Well, it's kind of weird.
THERAPIST: We don't judge here.
SCOTT EVIL: OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
THERAPIST: And how do you feel about that?
SCOTT EVIL: I don't wanna take over the family But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
DR. EVIL: But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
SCOTT EVIL: Not me.
THERAPIST: What do you want to do, Scott?
SCOTT EVIL: I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
DR. EVIL: An evil vet?
SCOTT EVIL: No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
DR. EVIL: An evil petting zoo?
SCOTT EVIL: ( shouting ) You always do that! ( calm ) Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
THERAPIST: We don't label people here, Scott.
SCOTT EVIL: No, he's really evil.
THERAPIST: DR. EVIL
DR. EVIL: No, the boy's right. I really am Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
THERAPIST: Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
SCOTT EVIL: I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
THERAPIST: OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
DR. EVIL: Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
THERAPIST: We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
DR. EVIL: The details of my life are quite That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
THERAPIST: That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
GROUP: Yes, of course. Go ahead, etc.
DR. EVIL: Very well, where should I begin? My father was a relentlessly self- improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. A sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical.
AUSTIN: Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
VANESSA: ( in her own world ) Do you think she's prettier than I?
AUSTIN: You know who.
VANESSA: You know who.
AUSTIN: No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
VANESSA: I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
AUSTTIN: Well put. Listen love, we can't keep having this fight. I'm an International Man of Mystery. Sometimes in the course of my work to save the world I have to shag some crumpet.

VANESSA: Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
AUSTIN: Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.
GUARD: Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
AUSTIN: They flash their security badges to the guard.

"VIRTUCON: STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY." INT. STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY It is a room the size of a large gymnasium overseen by a large observation booth. Six STEAMROLLER go around a test track very slowly. Austin and Vanessa hide behind one of the slowly moving steamrollers. Security guards enter the facility and begin fanning out in a search.
AUSTIN: Our only way out of here is to drive
AUSTIN: Hang on! I'm going to floor it!
GUARD: Where did you learn to shoot?
AUSTIN: Where did you learn to shoot?
VANESSA: Where did you learn to drive?
GUARD: Austin, watch out!
VANESSA: Austin, watch out!
AUSTIN: ( looking around ) Where? Where?
GUARD: ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA. AUSTIN IS FRANTICALLY JERKING THE STEERING WHEEL AND TRYING TO downshift. SFX: Metal grinds. The shifter breaks off along with a gaggle of wares. He desperately jams on the breaks.
VANESSA: Thank God, Austin, we made it.
AUSTIN: Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in,
MRS. HARWIN: Sit down, Billy, I have some bad news. As you know, your brother Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army.
BILLY: Was? What is it, Mom?
MRS. HARWIN: Your brother was run over by a A steamroller? No, not Steve! Since Dad died, Steve's been like a father to me.
BILLY: A steamroller? No, not Steve! Since Dad died, Steve's been like a father to me.
MRS. HARWIN: I'm sorry son. People never think how things affect the family of the I love you, Billy. I wonder if we'll be able to receive Steve's henchman's comp.
DR. EVIL: Frau Farbissina, check on our guests.
DR. EVIL: Welcome to my underground lair, Mr. Powers. Mrs. Kensington's daughter, how lovely. I believe your name is Vanessa? I'd shake your hands, except for obvious reasons.
VANESSA: I don't understand.
DR. EVIL: My hand, dammit! Look at it!
AUSTIN: What's wrong with your hand?
DR. EVIL: Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak!
AUSTIN: I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
DR. EVIL: Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr. Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final

BASIL EXPOSITION: ( the light shifts towards dramatic as he speaks ) My God, man, don't you understand? It won't just be active volcanoes, inactive ones will erupt as well. Seven-eighths of the Earth's land mass will be deluged with hot magma. Tectonic plates will shift, causing massive earthquakes. Imagine no United Kingdom. Think of it, no cricket, no tea, no freshly toasted crumpets smothered with Devonshire clotted cream, the diving mystery of Stonehenge. Imagine severing forever the continuity of Britannic majesty, the demise of this sceptered isle, this jewel, this England.
BASIL EXPOSITION: ( back to normal ) I'm afraid we've lost contact with I see.
DR. EVIL: Gentlemen, your deadline is in three hours. You have your instructions.
DR. EVIL: Come join us for dinner, won't you Mr. Powers?
DR. EVIL: I think you'll enjoy the food. I have the best chef in the world. His name is Ezekial. He's made of seventy-five percent plastic.
DR. EVIL: Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
SCOTT EVIL: Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
DR. EVIL: ( trying to hide contempt ) Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
SCOTT EVIL: Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
DR. EVIL: And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
SCOTT EVIL: Yeah. What?
DR. EVIL: Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
SCOTT EVIL: Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
DR. EVIL: In due time.
SCOTT EVIL: But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
DR. EVIL: I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
SCOTT EVIL: Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
DR. EVIL: One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
DR. EVIL: Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of mine are joining us for dinner.
AUSTIN: Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
DR. EVIL: No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping
DR. EVIL: Release the sharks! All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
FRAU FARBISSINA: ( clearing her throat nervously ) Dr. Evil?
DR. EVIL: Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
FRAU FARBISSINA: It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
DR. EVIL: ( disappointed ) ( to Austin ) Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
DR. EVIL: What is it now?
FRAU FARBISSINA: Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
DR. EVIL: I have one simple request sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people?
FRAU FARBISSINA: Sea bass.
DR. EVIL: FRAU FARBISSINA
FRAU FARBISSINA: They're mutated sea bass.
DR. EVIL: Really? Are they ill-tempered?
FRAU FARBISSINA: Please allow me to demonstrate.
DR. EVIL: Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill- tempered sea bass it is. Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
SCOTT EVIL: Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
DR. EVIL: No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
SCOTT EVIL: I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
DR. EVIL: No Scott. You just don't get it, do
VANESSA: What's your plan? First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
AUSTIN: First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
VANESSA: Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
AUSTIN: All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
VANESSA: No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
AUSTIN: Smashing idea! Give it to me.
AUSTIN: Judo chop!
GUARD: ( screaming, rubbing his eyes ) My eyes! My eyes!
AUSTIN: Hold on, Vanessa! Austin, watch out!
VANESSA: ( shouting ) Austin, watch out!
AUSTIN: Not a good time to lose one's head.

VANESSA: Shut up.
AUSTIN: Fair enough.
GUY 1: I can't believe John Smith is getting married tomorrow.
GUY 2: Where is Smittie anyways? It's not like him to be late for anything, especially his own stag party.
GUY 3: Well, you know he's a henchman for Dr. Evil. Sometimes they work late. Can I just say something that may sound a little sappy? I think it's a testament to our friend John that so many of his buddies showed up in his honor. There's a lot of love in this room.
WAITRESS: Hi, I have a phone call here for the John Smith party.
GUY 1: ( pause ) Yes, I have a friend named John Smith. ( pause ) That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's private army. ( pause ) What? He's dead? ( pause ) Decapitated by mutated flying sea bass? Oh my God! OK, thank you.
GUY 2: ( to Guy 1 ) Hey Bill, what's wrong? Was that John? Is he coming late?
GUY 1: Guys, John's not coming.
GUY 2: GUY 1
GUY 1: He was decapitated by mutated flying sea bass.
GUYS: ( upset ) Oh no, oh my God, etc.
GUY 1: All right, to Smittie!
GUYS: To Smittie!
VANESSA: What do we do now?
AUSTIN: We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag. You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
VANESSA: I'm not going anywhere. We're a Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
AUSTIN: Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
VANESSA: I'll hurry back.
AUSTIN: Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her&emdash; I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!&emdash;
VANESSA: ( cutting him off ) Austin, what's your point?
AUSTIN: Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because.I love you.
VANESSA: Oh, behave!
DR. EVIL: Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you I don't want to.
SCOTT EVIL: I don't want to.
DR. EVIL: Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
