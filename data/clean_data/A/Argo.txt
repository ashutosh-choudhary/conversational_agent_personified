BOB ANDERS: Carnival's bigger today. MARK LIJEK, 29, a consular officer, joins Anders at the 4 EXT. ROOSEVELT GATE - MORNING 4 Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate and makes it to the other side. And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This isn't archive footage anymore. We're looking at the POV of TOM AHERN, 48, the CIA station chief here.
CLOSED: When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket raises his fist, we can see that he has a concealed PISTOL in his clothes. More STUDENTS climbing the wall dropping the 12 feet to the other side, one after another.

TITTERTON: Put him on a plane. Fuck him.
JORDAN: He's half dead and he's in chemo.
BUTLER: We took him in. He's ours now.
TITTERTON: So we'll take in any prick as long as he's got cancer?
JORDAN: No. Just the pricks on our side. So all our other pricks on their prick thrones know, when they get run out on a rail, they won't be getting their spleens out by a camel vet in the Sinai.
TITTERTON: The six with the Canadians. Now Jordan is looking at a monitor showing footage of a BLINDFOLDED HOSTAGE in front of the Embassy. AL GOLACINSKI being prodded and led down the front stairs of the embassy.
JORDAN: We've got 60 in the embassy with guns to their heads right now
TITTERTON: The eyes of the world are on the embassy. That makes them safer than the six on the street.
ANALYST: ( coming to the door ) Bani-Sadr's saying it'll be over in 24 hours.

O'DONNELL: The six of them went out a back exit. Brits turned them away, Kiwis turned them away. The Canadians took them in. They've been there since. O'Donnell hands Mendez pages with STAFF PHOTOGRAPHS of SIX PEOPLE the escaped embassy employees as he continues to toss stuff into his folder.
O'DONNELL: Traffic calls them The Houseguests. Haven't left the Canadian ambassador's house since it happened.
MENDEZ: ( shakes his head ) Just a matter of time. We've got Revolutionary Guards going door-to- door like Jehovah's Witnesses, looking for escapees. They're out for blood, Tony. Half of them think Khomeini's been too lenient with the ones in the embassy. Walking out of his office, Mendez following.

O'DONNELL: Carter's shitting enough bricks to build the pyramids. He wants the six of them out.
MENDEZ: Who else knows?
O'DONNELL: Just the families. Meanwhile, some genius in the embassy was keeping a mug book of everybody who worked there.
MENDEZ: Jesus Christ.
O'DONNELL: We think it got shredded before they got in, but the fuckers have sweat-shop kids in there re- assembling the shreds.

O'DONNELL: State's coordinating in-house.
MENDEZ: They don't do exfils.
O'DONNELL: They do now. They want to run it by us, strictly as consultants. Off his look.
O'DONNELL: Engell's saying it's lose-lose. These people die, they die badly. Publicly. State wants the blame, he'll give it to them.
MENDEZ: Then why's he want me?
O'DONNELL: So he can tell State he ran it by his best exfil guy. They stop in front of a conference room. Jack looks at Tony. This isn't the kind of meeting where you talk.
O'DONNELL: Tony. This isn't the kind of meeting where you talk.
ENGELL: Okay. This is Bob Pender from State O.S. He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

Pender indicates the first two photos and during this, we may flash to scenes of the Houseguests in the Canadian ambassador's residence
PENDER: Mark and Cora Lijek, 29 and 25. He's a consular officer and she's an assistant. Newlyweds. They just got there a couple of months ago. No language skills or in- country knowledge.

MENDEZ: Exfils are like abortions. You don't wanna need one, but when you do, you don't do it yourself. The meeting is breaking up. Pender, followed by Bates, leaves the room. Engell, who has just been made to look bad and inherited a problem, stops by Tony.

NIGHT: At dinner around a dining room table: the SIX HOUSEGUESTS; KEN TAYLOR, 40s, Canadian ambassador. He ds much to support the myth that Canadians are always in a good mood. Next to him is PAT TAYLOR, Filipino, 40s. We're joining various conversations, including one with LEE SCHATZ, 29, an American agricultural attache, the sixth escapee we heard about.
TAYLOR: Martin was the worst one. Martin the Maximo King

MENDEZ: Can you teach a guy how to be a director in a day?
CHAMBERS: You can teach a rhesus monkey to be a director in a day. Look, if you're gonna do it, you've got to do it. The Khomaniacs are fruit loops, but they have cousins selling eight tracks and prayer rugs on La Brea. You can't build cover stories around a movie that dsn't exist. You need a script. You need a producer.
MENDEZ: I'm the producer.
CHAMBERS: No, you're not. Associate' at best. If it's a twenty-million dollar Star Wars rip-off, you need somebody who's a somebody to put his name on it. Here we see some AUTOGRAPHED 70s CELEBRITY 8X10s hanging on the wall. The waiter brings a bill.

SIEGEL: Naah, bullshit me, Max.
KLEIN: Okay. Because I enjoyed your films, the early ones. I took this meeting out of respect because I wanted to tell you no' to your face.
SIEGEL: Thank you. Very respectful.
KLEIN: You're done, Lester. You've gotta get your cataracts fixed and read the trades. MGM just capitalized for six new films and they're desperate for Sci-Fi. They've already offered me four times what you are.
SIEGEL: ( A BEAT )
SIEGEL: But see it worries me, what you said, and I'll tell you why. A couple weeks back I was sitting in Trader Vic's enjoying a Mai Tai when my pal Warren Beatty came to wish me well and we had a little chat. Seems he was attached to star in Zulu Empire which was gonna anchor that MGM slate but Warren confided in me that the picture's gone over-budget cause the Zulu extras wanna unionize.
SIEGEL: The way this looks to me through the cataracts, I grant you is that you can either sign here and take ten thousand for your toilet-paper script or you can go fuck yourself. Siegel smiles kindly and holds a pen and the contracts out to Klein. Klein takes them.
MENDEZ: You know Warren Beatty?
SIEGEL: I took a leak next to him at the Golden Globes.
MENDEZ: You got kids, Lester?
SIEGEL: Two daughters.
MENDEZ: You see them much?

MENDEZ: So if they look, they'll know six people didn't come in with me.
NICHOLLS: If they look. Nicholls and Tony turn away from the mosaic, surreptitious work now done, and meander toward the middle of the great room.
NICHOLLS: When you land, you should go straight to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to kiss the ring. Get on record as having applied for a film permit. If they catch you later, at least they'll be confused while they're torturing you. Your biggest problem may be convincing the six of them to go with you. They're foreign service. They're willful. Nicholls takes a picture.
MENDEZ: How's June?
NICHOLLS: I'm sorry.
