ELAINE: Eat this spaghetti, Ted. It'll make you feel a lot better.
ELAINE: Who's that, Ted?
TED: Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since.
TED: Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
ELAINE: And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
ELAINE: What's his problem?
ANGLE: On BEARDED MAN in rags chained to wall.
MAN: It does work. No, it doesn't.
ANGLE: On Ted and Elaine.
TED: His name's David Stockman. He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
ELAINE: Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick. Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time. And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
ELAINE: I just can't go on living with a man who refuses to deal with reality, Ted. I have to go now. Believe me, it's best for all Elaine leans over to kiss Ted. He turns away.

KRUGER: I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
COMMISSIONER: I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down.
KRUGER: You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur. He's got a lunar flight today. I want him pulled. Jacobs, pull Oveur!
JACOBS: Not in your size, but I have a cardigan.
COMMISSIONER: I'll trust you on this, Bud, but I'm a little nervous about Oveur's record.

MARY: ( to Joe Salucci ) Welcome aboard. Can I take your case?
JOE: ( clutching case )
HENRY: There's a whole new world in front of us, Ma. Where the dictatorship of the proletariat will lead workers and peasants into socialism without the revisionist diversions of bourgeois liberals, Trotskiests, or disillusioned Maoist The Okies pass inside.
MARY: ( looking at them; to self ) Doesn't he realize that a weak proletariat needs a strong liberal bourgeoisie in a joint struggle against monopoly

ELAINE: Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
RUMACK: The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.
CAMERA ): Let me show you. Ted's problem is in this area. This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here.
RUMACK: So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
ELAINE: What can I do, Doctor Rumack?
RUMACK: You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
ELAINE: I mean for Ted.
RUMACK: You can be gentle with him, Elaine. He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.

MARY: ( on intercom ) I don't think we do poached eggs on toast over, Captain Oveur. Over.
OVEUR: That's how I want them. Poached. Over.
MARY: All right, Captain Oveur. Over.
OVEUR: Poached! Not over! Over!
MARY: You should really put that case in the compartment above your head, sir.
JOE: ( nervously ) That's okay.
MARY: ( touching his shoulder ) I can help you if you can't get it up.
JOE: I said, no!
JIMMY: I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
JOHN: I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
JIMMY: Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
JOHN: It's going to be terrific. A whole new world, new kids to play with.
ALICE: You're going to love it, Jimmy.
JIMMY: No more headlines about the rape trial and the fraud charges?
JOHN: ( starts to twitch ) How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
JIMMY: No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
JOHN: ( grabbing Jimmy ) Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it! They're all asking for it all the time!!
PSYCHIATRIST: You must admit that you're sick, Ted. sick, Ted. sick, Ted.
DUNN: We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
OVEUR: You better check it, Unger.
UGER: ( getting up )
DUNN: INT. CABIN - OUTSIDE TOILET Ted spots Elaine coming.
TED: Ted. I don't know why you got on this flight. I don't know what you're trying to prove.
ELAINE: Ted. I don't know why you got on this flight. I don't know what you're trying to prove.
TED: Elaine, we have to go back.
ELAINE: We can't go back. We had something very special, but it's all over.
TED: Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted. This ship should never have passed FSA inspection. This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
ELAINE: Ted, get a grip on yourself. You should never have left the hospital.
TED: Then you do think I'm insane.
ELAINE: I've never used the word insane, Ted.
TED: ( facetiously ) What word would you use, Elaine?
ELAINE: The word is sick. Ted very, very, very What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
TED: What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
ELAINE: I'd use the word insane.
TED: There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine. I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
ELAINE: Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
STELLA: You've been hurt.
TED: I'm getting over it. If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
STELLA: No, I mean your head. Sit down. I'll take a look at it. I'm a nurse.
STELLA: Do you want to talk about it.
TED: I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
STELLA: No. I mean your relationship.
TED: We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
STELLA: Love's the same as it always was. It's people who change.
TED: People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
STELLA: Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
TED: Sure. But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
STELLA: Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
TED: I just wish it was that simple. We really were in love. You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
STELLA: No. It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
TED: Well, we laughed. We laughed all the TED AND ELAINE IN A FIELD OF DAISIES - DAY They run towards each other. Elaine grabs Ted by the waist, picks him up and swings him around in SLOW MOTION. They We laughed when times were good.
TED: That's our story.
DUNN: ( to Oveur ) Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit You better check on it, Mr. Dunn. I'll stay here and fly the ship.
OVEUR: You better check on it, Mr. Dunn. I'll stay here and fly the ship.
OVEUR: You better take this.
DUNN: You better take this.
OVEUR: You better take this.
MARY: Mind if Jimmy here takes a look around, Of course not. Come on in, Jimmy. That's strange.
OVUER: Of course not. Come on in, Jimmy. That's strange.
SIMON: Now what?
OVEUR: That's an asteroid field. There shouldn't be anything like that in this sector Scraps looks at Simon.
SIMON: Scraps looks at Oveur.
OVEUR: Unless those sunspots are interfering with our scanner or.
SIMON: Scraps looks at Oveur.
OVEUR: Or we're off course, but.
SIMON: Scraps looks at Oveur.
OVEUR: But we couldn't be off course. Our coordinates are computer-locked barring.
SIMON: Scraps looks at Oveur.
OVEUR: Barring a computer failure. There was talk of sub-par wiring in this ship. I hope that's just talk.
OVEUR: Come on up, Jimmy. Say, that's some puppy. What's his name?
JIMMY: Can I hold him?
OVEUR: Can I hold him?
JIMMY: ( handing over Scraps ) ( holding him up and looking at He's a boy dog.
OVEUR: ( holding him up and looking at He's a boy dog.
JIMMY: Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
OVEUR: Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
TED: They kept me in the asylum for eight months. I know everyone in those places claims they're sane, but I was different, I was sane.
ELAINE: Holy shit.
STELLA: Ted, I want you to relax. Let your mind go back, back past your youth, past your childhood to your mother's womb.
STELLA: Try to remember your birth. Was it Striker, listen to me! This is Doctor Krane! You're twisted around, Striker. You've got to come out feet first! You're too low in the womb! You're too low, Striker! You're. . too low.

ELAINE: ( panicky and confused ) Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight just you and me. We can be alone. I can get rid of everyone else on the ship I've already proven

JIMMY: Do you want to talk about it, Commander?
DUNN: Did you feel that?
MARY: ( looking at his pants ) Yes I did.
DUNN: Felt like a large asteroid.

DUNN: What is it, Mary?
MARY: Um. Do you people scream right when you. you know.
TESTA: Hand me your cup. This is very hot.
DAVE: Thank you. And, stewardess, can you please tell my wife that there is nothing that can go wrong. I think she'd like to hear it from you.
ELAINE: I don't think we have any alternative, I see. What do you think our alternatives We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
OVEUR: I see. What do you think our alternatives We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
ELAINE: We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
OVEUR: You can do it from up here, Captain.
ELAINE: You can do it from up here, Captain.
OVEUR: I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
ELAINE: No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
OVEUR: Roger. You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
MARY: Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
OVEUR: Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
TESTA: Captain Oveur, Dunn and Unger have been sucked out through disposal unit four!
OVEUR: Both together?!

O'BRIAN: Get me Jack McCrosky and fast!
CONTROLLER 3: McCrosky? He hasn't handled a tower in twenty years.
CONTROLLER 4: Ever since Reagan fired the controllers, he's been completely senile and hasn't done a day's work.
O'BRIAN: What about McCrosky?
CONTROLLER 3: Pretty much the same as Reagan.
O'BRIAN: Get him.
NURSE: It's for Mr. McCrosky.
NURSE 2: Do you think we should bother him? He's been acting a bit odd lately.
NURSE 1: He's fine. He just thinks he's Lloyd Nurse 1 takes the phone to McCrosky. He is a lot older than in "Airplane."

ELAINE: Can't we change course?
SIMON: We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
ELAINE: Then Ted was right!
SIMON: My career is shot.
ELAINE: Your career! What about the lives of those people out there. Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?

ELAINE: We've been thrown off course just a tad.
PASSENGER: What's that mean?
ELAINE: In space terms, about 70 million miles.
ELAINE: The bumps you feel are car-sized asteroids smashing into the hull.
ELAINE: Also, we're heading right for the sun and can't seem to change course.
PASSENGER: Are you telling us everything?
ELAINE: Not exactly. We're also out of coffee.

TED: The last thing I wanted was Elaine to see me down on my luck. Well, it was just my luck. In she walked with a group from the space program.
HOURS LATER: Elaine's singing is just as bad as Ted's sax. They have cleared the joint and play and sing alone. Elaine's group finally pull her out. She hasn't recognized Ted.

TED: ( on radio ) This is Striker.
KRUGER: ( on radio ) Look, Striker, I don't know how you got into that driver's seat but I want Simon Kurtz on that radio and I want him now!
TED: ( on radio ) Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place. You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly. You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what the prestige of your precious space program.
ELAINE: That was very well put, Ted.
KRUGER: ( on radio ) Striker, you're heading right for the sun, so don't you think it's a little late for that bleeding heart liberal crap now?

ROK: What are you doing, Ted? Why are you wearing that mask, Ted?
ELAINE: Simon! Wait! What are you doing?!
O'FLANAGAN: Under the 'B', sixteen!
SIMON: I've lost the ship and now I've lost you, Elaine. I'm getting out.
ELAINE: Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends! You'll die out there.
SIMON: Simon, what are you saying?!
ELAINE: Simon, what are you saying?!
SIMON: I'm saying, I can't take the singles scene again, Elaine.
ELAINE: Simon, no!
JIMMY: You want to talk about it now, Commander?
COMMISSIONER: Give me the President of the United States. Tell him it's the Commissioner. I don't know how the old man's going to take this.
AID: Houston, sir.
PRESIDENT: ( taking phone ) This is the President. What?!. What?!
COMMISSIONER: I don't think that shuttle's going to make it, sir.
PRESIDENT: Damnit, Mister, the dignity and integrity of this presidency depends on the success of that mission. And that's my last word!
COMMISSIONER: Yes, sir.
AID: What's our strategy on this one, sir?
PRESIDENT: I work for the people of these United States, Frank. I have to do what's best for them. Al, kill social security, cancel school lunches only for the poor, dismantle welfare, close all hospitals and public toilets, green light the MX-6, invade Brazil, and bring my horse around after my INT. COCKPIT Ted is at the controls. Elaine rushes in.
ELAINE: Simon just ejected!
TED: Sit down, Elaine. If this bomb trick works we just might make it. Simon was a fool to eject now.
ELAINE: You mean.
TED: That's right premature ejection.
ELAINE: What will happen to him, Ted?
TED: The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds. He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
TED: ( looking at wristwatch ) Are you afraid?
ELAINE: Not when I'm with you, Ted.
TED: I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
MRS. GOOCH: ( looking at her hands ) Are these my hands?
FATHER O'FLANAGAN: ( to Stella ) Are you afraid?
STELLA: I'm a nurse. I can't afford to be afraid, ANOTHER AREA Are you afraid, Scraps?
ANOTHER AREA: ( to Scraps ) Are you afraid, Scraps?

TESTA: Fifty-six percent of the passengers are afraid. Twenty-nine percent are not afraid. Eight percent are undecided and seven percent think Israel should give back Finland.
TED: You better strap yourself in, Testa. Mission control, this is Mayflower. Over.
TED: ( on radio ) We've got about 60 seconds before that thing blows. We're set to reprogram for Mercury at zero point five WORP.
JACOBS: Last spring we did Europe in nine days.

STINSON: Al Hammil?
CONTROLLER 3: Not anymore. It's Rex Kramer, now.
CONTROLLER 3: No, Rex Kramer.
KRAMER: I know this guy, Ted Striker. I flew with him during the war. He was a crack pilot but he didn't have it in the crunch. That is.
KRAMER: Until that day over Chicago. He brought that busted up 767 out of that storm like a paper glider coming outta the baby blue.
KRAMER: But flying that shuttle is a whole different ballgame.
KRAMER: What's the latest, Lieutenant?
OFFICER: They'll hit our atmosphere in about three minutes, if they hold together. They've lost their computer and are coming in at zero point five WORP on manual control, INT. COCKPIT Ted shifts a stick shift on the steering column.
KRAMER: Down scope!

KRAMER: The big man. The numero uno honcho.
KRAMER: The head cheese.
OFFICER 2: Sir, we have radio contact.

ELAINE: Ted, the lever!
TED: ( on radio ) Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
TED: There are no more handles, only switches.
TED: ( looking around madly ) Just switches, lights, and knobs.
KRAMER: ( looking at buttons and levers I'd give my right arm to get just one of these buttons or levers up there right ( on radio ) Okay, Striker. You're going to have to pull that lever panel off.
TED: ( to Elaine ) Screw driver!
ELAINE: Will this work, Ted?
TED: ( on radio ) I've got something that might work.
KRAMER: What the hell is a man doing with a. forget it. It'll have to do, Striker.
TED: It's working.
KRAMER: ( on radio ) Okay, Striker. We have you on visual. Just keep her level.
TED: She's coming apart!
TED: I'm trying but she's fighting me!
ELAINE: Ted, that's Alpha Beta!
KRAMER: ( on radio ) Now, Striker, there are a few things you have to keep in mind as you get close to the planet's atmosphere.
KRAMER: ( on radio ) First and foremost you have to make one very important decision.
ELAINE: Ted! We're not stopping!!
KRAMER: ( on radio ) Now, once you've made that decision you have to be very clear about your responsibility to those people on that

MARY: ( to one passenger ) Seat backs up. Thank you.
MARY: ( looking up ) Sir, you really must take your seat.
KRAMER: ( on radio ) We're all with you on this one, Striker. Now get ready to position landing gear, cut engines, and fire your retro­rockets.
KRAMER: ( on radio ) Timing's of the essence on a lame duck approach, Striker. Don't fight her. Hold her steady. Nose up.
