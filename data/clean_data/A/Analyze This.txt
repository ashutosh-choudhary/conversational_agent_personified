DOMINIC MANETTA: a man in his 70s, narrates nostalgically OVER a MONTAGE of related news photos.
WISEGUY: You wanna be a ribeye? Get away from the fuckin' car.
MANETTA: Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of it capo de tutti capi, and that was the last time the whole commission tried to meet until I don't know. I don't like it. What do we need a meeting for? Let everybody worry about their own business.
VITTI: ( brooding ) I don't know. I don't like it. What do we need a meeting for? Let everybody worry about their own business.
MANETTA: The '57 meeting was about how we were going to divide up the whole country. This meeting is about how we're gonna survive. You got 'made' guys informing for the Feds; bosses going to jail; everybody's dealing drugs; people are getting whacked without permission. And on top of everything, now we got the Chinese Triads and these crazy Russians to deal with. Everything's changing. We need a leader. Someone with fresh ideas. Someone like you. It's gonna be a new century, Paul. We gotta change with the times.
VITTI: What are we gonna get, a fuckin' web site?
MANETTA: You remember what else happened in 1957, Paul?
VITTI: Yeah, I remember.
MANETTA: When your father died, I promised him I'd always look out for you. Come to the meeting.
VITTI: Wait a second. I'm just gonna grab a toothpick.
CAROLINE: ( weepy ) I kept telling him that I needed room to grow and find myself as a person. Not just as a woman but as an independent entity.
BEN SOBOL: her therapist, seems to be listening intently.
CAROLINE: I told him I needed to get in touch with my uniqueness, but he couldn't handle that. He said I was driving him away. Do you think I was driving him away, Dr.
BEN: Things end, Caroline. That's just a part of life. It's how we deal with things ending that's important.
CAROLINE: I just can't believe it's over between me and Steve. Maybe there's still Well, he did take out a restraining order against you. I have to be honest, that's usually not a good But what should I do?
BEN: Well, he did take out a restraining order against you. I have to be honest, that's usually not a good But what should I do?
CAROLINE: But what should I do?
BEN: Well, Caroline, I think the first thing you have to do. . is stop whining about this pathetic loser! You're a tragedy 'Steve doesn't respect me. Steve doesn't love me anymore.' Who gives a shit! Get a fucking life! You are, without a doubt, the most boring human being I have ever met! Please, say something interesting before I lapse into a goddamn coma!
CAROLINE: Dr. Sobol?
BEN: Lost in his fantasy, not really listening. He comes to attention and tries to cover.
BEN: Yes. Yes. I was just reflecting on your whole situation. It's very interesting what you were just saying. I want you to think about it, and I'm going to think about it, so we'll both think about it and we'll continue next week when I get back from my

MICHAEL: You're late.
BEN: ( changing hurriedly ) I know. I couldn't get rid of my last patient. I think she was a tick in a past life.

BEN: Michael! What did I tell you? You can't listen to my sessions! It's private stuff.
MICHAEL: I can't help it. I hear you through the vent in my room.

BEN: Mr. Vitti, when I got into family therapy, this was not the family I had in mind. I'm turning you down.
VITTI: You with your schmucky little office in your schmucky little house out there in Schmuckville you're turning me down? What, so you can spend more time listening to housewives piss and moan about how nobody fucks them right?
BEN: I'd like to go now.
VITTI: ( starts to cry ) You see this? This is what I'm talking about! I'm a dead man!
VITTI: ( through the tears ) You call yourself a doctor? You should be ashamed. A real doctor couldn't turn his back on a person who's suffering!
BEN: ( finally ) All right. ( hands him a What happened with your wife tonight?
VITTI: ( wiping away his I wasn't with my wife. I was with my girlfriend.
BEN: You have a girlfriend? We could do two months on that alone.
VITTI: What, you're gonna start moralizing with me now?
BEN: Okay. Do you have marriage Then why do you have a girlfriend?
VITTI: Then why do you have a girlfriend?
BEN: Then why do you have a girlfriend?
VITTI: I do things with her I can't do with my wife.
BEN: Why can't you do those things with your wife?
VITTI: Hey. That's the mouth she kisses my children good night with. What's the matter with you?
BEN: Okay, okay. Have you been under a lot of stress lately?
VITTI: You mean like seeing your best friend murdered? Yeah, I got Well, based on what you told me before about your attacks, I'd say that's probably it then.
BEN: Well, based on what you told me before about your attacks, I'd say that's probably it then.
VITTI: It's just stress?
BEN: I doubt if there's anything physically wrong with you.
VITTI: ( brightening, pointing You. You. You're very good.
BEN: There's a lot more to it
VITTI: No, you're right. You're right on the money. I can feel the juices rushing back to my manhood as we Well, I didn't need to know that.
BEN: Well, I didn't need to know that.
VITTI: This settles it. You're my I can't treat you, Mr. Vitti. I don't think you're really ready to open up and deal with
BEN: I can't treat you, Mr. Vitti. I don't think you're really ready to open up and deal with
VITTI: Listen to you. The honesty. Nobody and I mean nobody talks to me like this. I'm ready. Let's do it.
BEN: You don't hear the word 'no' that often, do you?
VITTI: I hear it all the time. Only it's more like, 'No, no, please, no!'
BEN: ( relenting ) All right. I'm here for two more days. When we get back to New York, I'll treat you exclusively for two weeks. I just need to figure out what to tell my other You want me to clear your schedule for you?
VITTI: You want me to clear your schedule for you?
BEN: No thanks, I'll handle it. Now can I go?
VITTI: Thank you.
LAURA: What is wrong with you? I woke up, you were gone, no note or anything. I've been going out of my mind, Ben. I walked all over the hotel looking for you. I almost called the police!
BEN: Okay, listen. I'm going to tell you the truth. I had a serious patient emergency.
LAURA: You have patients in Florida?
BEN: Just one. He followed me here from New York. I had to go.
LAURA: Who is this patient?
BEN: Paul Vitti! Paul Vitti.
LAURA: ( worried ) Oh, Ben.
BEN: I know. But don't worry. It's not like he's a real patient. He's got this idea in his head that I'm helping him. It's crazy.
LAURA: You're not going to treat him.
BEN: Tell me you're not.
LAURA: Tell me you're not.
BEN: I'm not!
LAURA: That would be too scary. You don't want a person like that in your life, believe me. I've covered the mob down here. I've seen what they can do.
BEN: Listen, it's been taken care of. I told him I couldn't see him again. He understood and it's You sure?
LAURA: You sure?
LAURA: ( tearing up ) I was so worried.
MOONY: It doesn't figure. We take out Manetta, what does Vitti do? Nothing. Why doesn't he move?
SINDONE: Fuck him.
MOONY: I'm telling you, Primo, he's planning something big. The shit is really gonna come down.
SINDONE: Then let it come down. Vitti's a tough guy but a lot of tough guys got fed to the crabs off Red Hook over the years. You been down there a long time. Are you measuring my inseam or contemplating a lifestyle change?
MOONY: Primo? What about Vitti?
SINDONE: Vitti. Vitti. The whole time we were growing up, he was the smart guy; I was the dope. My father was a nickel-and-dime shitheel; his father had it all. Vito Genovese blew it at Apalachin because he forgot to kill Gambino before the meeting.
HANDSOME JACK: You got it, Primo.
LAURA: ( to Ben ) Come on. Get into it.
BEN: I don't understand. They jump out of the water, they splash, they eat fish. It's not a real stretch for a whale. If they did a number from West Side Story, then I'd be into it.
LAURA: Just stop. We're having fun, right?
MICHAEL: Well, to be real honest. I'm not having as much fun as it looks like I am. I'm pretending, you know, because we have to bond and everything.
BEN: ( to Laura ) You've got to admire the openness.
MICHAEL: ( a tad too excited ) Here comes the whale again!
JIMMY: Fuck me!
STANDS: Ben looks and sees Jelly beckoning him.
BEN: ( to Laura and I'm hungry. Yeah, I'm going to get a hot dog. Who wants a hot dog?
MICHAEL: ( rising ) I'll go with you.
BEN: No, I'll go. You're pretending to have a good time. I don't want to spoil that. Be right
BEN: What is this? Are you guys following me?
JIMMY: Fuckin' fifteen-hundred dollar suit. You think the whales piss in that water?
JELLY: No, I think they use the men's room next door at the Burger King. Mr. Vitti wants to see you.
BEN: Is this a joke?
JELLY: You're an employee of Mr. Vitti's. That means you're on call twenty- four hours a day just like the rest of us.
BEN: No, he and I discussed this. I told him I'd see him when I got got back to New York.
JELLY: Don't be a skavootz. It is what it is. If he needs you sooner, you go.
BEN: No, I'm not going, and if you bother me again I won't treat him at all. Understand? That's it. End of story.
BOY: After a beat, a ten dollar bill falls where the sandcastle was. The Boy's face instantly brightens.
BOY: Thanks, mister.
BEN: They threw me in the shark tank, Paul. The shark tank!
VITTI: They were trying to make a point.
BEN: What, that you're a scary guy? I get it.
VITTI: You're in a mood, you know that?
BEN: Yeah, I get that way when a shark tries to chew on my ass.
VITTI: Okay. Okay. Calm down.
BEN: I don't want to calm down. My girl friend saw me all wet? I told her I fell into a tank with the manatees. I lied to her last night, now this. I don't like it.
VITTI: Manatees. That's a funny word. I'm glad you're entertained. What's the problem?
BEN: I'm glad you're entertained. What's the problem?
VITTI: Oh, I can tell you really care.
BEN: Okay. What's going on?
VITTI: I had an episode. Not an actual panic attack, but I started panicking a little thinking I might have one. Does that seem weird to you?
BEN: I'm redefining 'weird' on an hourly basis. What were you thinking about when you started feeling anxious?
VITTI: I don't know. The usual bullshit. Family problems.
BEN: Which family? This one?
VITTI: No, regular family.
BEN: ( stops ) I want you to draw a picture of a house. In the sand.
VITTI: What kind of house? A warehouse? A whorehouse? My house? What A house.
BEN: A house.
VITTI: I'll tell you after you do it.
BEN: I'll tell you after you do it.
VITTI: This is good. I come to Florida and draw pictures in the sand like a jerkoff.
TINO: I don't know what they're doing. He's talking to some guy. Looks like Vitti is drawing something in the sand. What's he drawing? What am I, Superman? I'm a hundred yards away I can't see shit. No way, he's got that fat Jelly with him and his partner, Jimmy Boots. We could take him out with a rifle and a scope, but I don't have any of that shit with me. My scope's in the shop. Nah, it's a warranty item. Hey, don't sweat it. You told me to take care of him, I'll take care of him. Okay, I'll call you
VITTI: There. You happy?
BEN: Where are the people?
VITTI: What people? You told me to draw a house.
BEN: I know. But usually when people draw a house they draw people. Where are the people who live in your house?
VITTI: Well, you see, they'd come out and say hello, but the whole family's in the Witness Protection Program. It's very sad. What the fuck you want from me?
BEN: Okay, forget the house. I'm going to say some words, and you say the first thing that comes into your mind.
VITTI: Good, more games. Shoot.
BEN: forgive me for I have sinned.
VITTI: forgive me for I have sinned.
BEN: forgive me for I have sinned.
VITTI: forgive me for I have sinned.
BEN: forgive me for I have sinned.
VITTI: forgive me for I have sinned.
BEN: ( clears his throat )
VITTI: ( clears his throat )
BEN: Vitti looks out to sea.
BEN: Ben can't see his face, but Vitti's eyes are full of tears. He wipes his eyes.
VITTI: See this? Again with the crying. Let's get out of here. We're being watched. Don't look. There's Feds on the roof of the hotel.
BEN: How do you know that?
VITTI: I'm a criminal. It's my job.
AGENT RICCI: Who's the new face?
AGENT STEADMAN: I don't know. Get somebody down there to see what he drew in the Whoever this guy is, he must be important to the family.
AGENT PROVANO: Whoever this guy is, he must be important to the family.
AGENT STEADMAN: Maybe he's Vitti's new consigliere. Put his picture on the wire and see what you come up with.
VITTI: Look at this, the whole crew. You all right? Good flight?
MARIE: Yeah, we're fine. We're on our way to the pool. Kids, get your stuff. We'll get out of your way.
VITTI: That's okay. Marie, this is a friend of mine, Ben Sobol. He's from the boat. A fishing boat captain. Cuban refugee.

ANTHONY: You and me?
VITTI: Of course, you and me. Have fun at the pool. Stay out of the deep end. And don't swim for a couple hours after you eat.
ANTHONY: Okay, Papa.
VITTI: ( to Jelly ) Send Jimmy down with them.
JELLY: Already done.
BEN: Nice family. Cuban fishing boat I can't tell Marie you're a shrink. She'd worry, you know.
VITTI: I can't tell Marie you're a shrink. She'd worry, you know.
BEN: About this? I think she'd be more worried about your career Just keep going with the therapy.
VITTI: Just keep going with the therapy.
BEN: You know, normally a patient wouldn't smoke or drink during a That's an interesting fact I'll have to remember if I'm ever on So tell me about your father.
VITTI: ( blowing smoke ) That's an interesting fact I'll have to remember if I'm ever on So tell me about your father.
BEN: So tell me about your father.
VITTI: My father. He was a big man in the neighborhood very well respected. Everybody loved him, God rest his soul.
BEN: He passed away?
VITTI: No, I just like saying 'God rest his soul.' Yeah, he passed away. He died when I was about twelve.
BEN: Heart attack. Sudden thing.
VITTI: Heart attack. Sudden thing.
BEN: Were you and your father close?
VITTI: Close? Yeah, you know, pretty close. I guess we weren't getting along that great right then.
BEN: Why was that?
VITTI: I was hangin' out in the neighborhood. I had a borghata like a kid gang hooligan shit, nothin' big. But my father didn't like it.
BEN: You fought about it?
VITTI: He slapped the shit out of me.
BEN: And then?
VITTI: And then that night he died.
BEN: How did that feel?
VITTI: It felt great! How did it feel? I don't know.
BEN: Well, think about it. Were you angry, were you afraid? Sad?
VITTI: Yeah, I guess.
BEN: Any feelings of guilt?
VITTI: About what? I didn't kill him.
BEN: I'm just speculating, but maybe in some way you wanted him to die.
VITTI: Why would I want my father to die?
BEN: Well, you said you were fighting. You were rebelling against his authority. There may have been some unresolved Oedipal conflict.
VITTI: Oedipus was a Greek king who killed his father and married his Fuckin' Greeks.
BEN: Oedipus was a Greek king who killed his father and married his Fuckin' Greeks.
VITTI: Fuckin' Greeks.
BEN: It's an instinctual developmental drive. The young boy wants to replace his father so he can totally possess his mother.
VITTI: Are you saying I wanted to fuck my It's a primal fantasy
BEN: It's a primal fantasy
VITTI: Have you seen my mother? That is the sickest fucking thing I've ever heard.

SCOTT: Ben, there's a lot I'd like to say to you, but I'm going to skip the big father-in-law speech because I know you've been married before.

BEN: You're right. Sorry.

DOROTHY: ( a beat ) So you're not going to invite us Well, I'm going to wait in the car. There's too much spray.
BEN: ( a beat ) Well, I'm going to wait in the car. There's too much spray.
DOROTHY: ( insulted ) Well, I'm going to wait in the car. There's too much spray.
ISAAC: All right. What's with you and Paul Vitti?
BEN: Well, Dad, I'm not at liberty to discuss that.
ISAAC: He's your patient? Are you joking? Have you thought about what this could do to your You, know, I always wanted to be great, but then I realized that I might have to settle for just being good enough. Now I've got this guy who's hurting and I'm thinking that if I can help this guy, maybe I can be a little bit great.
BEN: You, know, I always wanted to be great, but then I realized that I might have to settle for just being good enough. Now I've got this guy who's hurting and I'm thinking that if I can help this guy, maybe I can be a little bit great.
ISAAC: Jesus, Ben, you're the one who's going to be hurting. I want you to stop seeing him.
BEN: Didn't you read your own book? Instead of trying to run my life, why don't you just close your eyes, take a deep breath, tell me what you feel, tell me what you want.
ISAAC: ( uncomfortable ) This is bullshit.
BEN: You wrote it.
ISAAC: ( with difficulty ) I love you and I'm afraid for you I want you to be safe and I want you to have a good life.
BEN: ( deeply touched ) Is that really it?
ISAAC: That's it.
BEN: You know why I became a shrink? Because I grew up with a great one walking around the house.
ISAAC: I thought you became a shrink because you were sleeping with your psychology professor at Yes, and because of you.
BEN: Yes, and because of you.
BEN: Okay, so you were saying?
AGENT STEADMAN: Let me cut to the chase. Sometime in the next week or so, the heads of every major crime family in the United States are going to meet together somewhere in the New York
AGENT PROVANO: We think the stage is set for a major bloodbath. Has he mentioned anything about it to you?
LAURA: A bloodbath?
BEN: No. If he said anything about a bloodbath, I probably would've remembered it. Bloodbath is one of those words that, you know, stands out in a conversation.
AGENT STEADMAN: ( gathering photos ) You could really help us out by supplying information about that And if I don't?
BEN: And if I don't?
AGENT STEADMAN: If you don't, I will personally make your life a living hell. I want you to think about that and call me at this number when you change your mind.
BEN: You mean if I change my mind.
AGENT STEADMAN: I mean when.
LAURA: ( tough ) Okay. Guess what, fellas? You don't scare me.
BEN: Sit down! There's going to be a bloodbath. Oh, yeah. Only it's going to be between you and me. You think you can break into our home and intimidate us? That ain't the way it works here, boys. Whatever he and Paul Vitti talked about is privileged. He doesn't have to tell you a thing.
LAURA: Sit down! There's going to be a bloodbath. Oh, yeah. Only it's going to be between you and me. You think you can break into our home and intimidate us? That ain't the way it works here, boys. Whatever he and Paul Vitti talked about is privileged. He doesn't have to tell you a thing.
AGENT STEADMAN: We'll be in touch.
BEN: ( impressed ) Laura, that was really
LAURA: ( furious ) Oh, shut up!
MASIELLO: Paul, I don't mean this in a disrespectful way. You know I was a good friend to your father and I will always be a good friend to you. But the word is out that you've been talking to a shrink. Is that right?
VITTI: What's the point here?
MASIELLO: This concerns the whole family. Right now, we're the only ones who know about it, but if it gets out on the street what then? Who knows what you've been saying in It's none of anybody's business what I say in there.
VITTI: It's none of anybody's business what I say in there.
MASIELLO: Paul, I beg to differ. If you're doing this to establish some kind of insanity defense later, that's one thing. But everybody's gonna think you're falling apart, and that ain't good. They'll take it as a sign of weakness, and that makes us all vulnerable. Sindone would take over everything.
VITTI: So what do you want me to do?
MASIELLO: It's time to end it.
VITTI: What do you mean, end it?
MASIELLO: Get rid of this shrink. He knows too much already.
VITTI: You want me to whack my doctor?
MASIELLO: If you don't do it, somebody else will. It's the only way.
VITTI: No. Nobody touches him. You hear me? Anybody lays a finger on him, I'll kill 'em. Is that clear?
BEN: I'm going to buy some fruit. You want anything?
VITTI: No, go ahead.
VITTI: Papa! Papa!
VITTI: You look lousy. You all right.
BEN: Listen, Paul, please don't send me any more gifts.
VITTI: You didn't like the fountain?
BEN: That's not the point. It's a boundary issue.
VITTI: Boundary issue? I say if more people gave from the heart, we'd all be better off. Let's see your Piece of junk. You're getting a Don't buy me a Rolex.
BEN: Don't buy me a Rolex.
VITTI: Who said anything about buying it?
BEN: Listen, I really need to talk to you.
VITTI: Tommy Angels. We grew up together. Worked for a crew out of Jersey How did he die?
BEN: How did he die?
VITTI: He was on his way to talk to a federal prosecutor. Got hit by a truck twice.
BEN: Do I need to know that? I'm having nightmares as it is.
BEN: Last night I dreamed we were walking down the street, I stopped to buy some fruit, and they shot me like Brando in The Godfather.
VITTI: Good scene. Was I there?
BEN: You dropped your gun, then you ran over to me and started yelling, 'Papa, Papa!'
VITTI: I was Fredo. I don't think so.
VITTI: You're losing it, Doc. You may need therapy yourself.
VITTI: Him I don't know. Let's get
BEN: Don't you see? You called me 'Papa.' It's all about your What're you, nuts? It was your Yes, but that's what your black milk dream was about, too.
VITTI: What're you, nuts? It was your Yes, but that's what your black milk dream was about, too.
BEN: Yes, but that's what your black milk dream was about, too.
VITTI: Uh-uh. I don't buy it. In my dream, I'm bringing the baby the black milk.
BEN: Freud believed you're everyone in your dreams.
VITTI: Yeah, well, that guy I don't need to hear about. I can't even call my mother on the phone after that thing you told me.
BEN: Let's say you are the baby. What kind of milk did you get from your father?
VITTI: Could we stop talking about my That's the whole point! We have to start talking about your father. You know what it's like dealing with you? This is you. You gotta help me, Doc. I'm a mess. I'm in pain. Okay, Paul, I can help you. Fuck you. Nobody helps Paul Very good. Now I'll do you. 'Boo-fuckin'-hoo.' I never said this would be easy. Let's see how you like it. Let's talk about your father.
BEN: ( losing it ) That's the whole point! We have to start talking about your father. You know what it's like dealing with you? This is you. ( imitating Vitti ) You gotta help me, Doc. I'm a mess. I'm in pain. ( as himself ) Okay, Paul, I can help you. ( as Vitti ) Fuck you. Nobody helps Paul Very good. Now I'll do you. 'Boo-fuckin'-hoo.' I never said this would be easy. Let's see how you like it. Let's talk about your father.
VITTI: Very good. Now I'll do you. 'Boo-fuckin'-hoo.' I never said this would be easy. Let's see how you like it. Let's talk about your father.
BEN: Let's not.
VITTI: Is he still alive?
BEN: Yes, he's still alive.
VITTI: What kind of work does he do?
BEN: ( a beat ) That's not important.
VITTI: You paused.
BEN: You paused. That means you had a feeling. What does he do?
VITTI: You paused. That means you had a feeling. What does he do?
BEN: He's a psychiatrist.
VITTI: Ooh, you're fucked up. Next patient, please.
BEN: We're running out of time, Paul. Let's not waste it talking about my problems.
VITTI: Your father's a problem?
BEN: That's what you just said! You seem upset.
VITTI: That's what you just said! You seem upset.
BEN: I'm not upset!
VITTI: Hey, I'm good at this.
BEN: We have three days left. If you want to spend it screwing around, I can't help you. Call me when you're ready to get Say hello to your father for me!
VITTI: Say hello to your father for me!
POTATOES: We could just pop him right now.
HANDSOME JACK: In front of a church? What are you, a fuckin' animal? It's a holy place.
POTATOES: Is the sidewalk holy, too? I mean, where does the holiness end?
HANDSOME JACK: ( thinks ) I don't know. Second Avenue?
BEN: ( quietly ) What do you want me to do?
MASIELLO: Paul, he talked to the Feds.
VITTI: I know this guy. He would never talk to the Feds.
MASIELLO: The FBI was at his house today.
JIMMY: It's the truth. I saw 'em.
MASIELLO: You'll see. Next thing is he's gonna call you and ask for a Come on. You don't know this
VITTI: Come on. You don't know this
JELLY: It's Dr. Sobol. He says he needs to see you right away.
JELLY: Sit up front with Jimmy.
BEN: ( anxiously ) You want me to sit in front? Paul usually sits in front.
JIMMY: So this time you'll sit up front. Why you making a federal case?
BEN: ( getting in the car ) Federal case? I'm not making a federal case? Let's go.
BEN: ( prattling nervously ) Wow, this is really good. Delicious. I love Italian food. I've never been to Italy but I'd love to go. I've been to France. And Jamaica. That's nice, but I'm sure it's very different from Italy. A whole different, uh ( silence ) So what's everybody doing this
VITTI: This is Ben. He's a friend of Say hello to Carlo Mangano.
MANGANO: How you doin'?
VITTI: ( to Ben ) Carlo was on my father's crew. He's always been like a I don't know like a cousin to me.
MANGANO: I am your cousin.
VITTI: I know, that's what I'm saying. It's like a family thing. The Anything you need, anything I can do for you, Paul, you know. I'm here for you.
MANGANO: Anything you need, anything I can do for you, Paul, you know. I'm here for you.
VITTI: I know. So did you take care of that thing I asked you about?
MANGANO: Is it all right to talk business in front of your friend?
VITTI: It's okay.
MANGANO: Yeah, I took care of it.
VITTI: How about that other thing?
MANGANO: I'm waiting for that first thing to come through. I can't move until it does.
VITTI: Did the guy give you a problem?
MANGANO: A little. He's a lunatic.
VITTI: You always gotta nip that shit in the bud.
MANGANO: Yeah. But if the first thing is okay, that should fix everything.
VITTI: Including the second thing.
MANGANO: Yeah, but
VITTI: ( to Ben ) Don't repeat any of that to What? The first thing or the second thing?
BEN: What? The first thing or the second thing?
VITTI: That's Stevie Beef over there. I gotta go say hello to him for a Come on.

VITTI: ( to Jelly and Jimmy ) Leave us alone.
BEN: Why didn't you tell me about your What about him?
VITTI: What about him?
BEN: You said he died of a heart So what's the problem?
VITTI: So what's the problem?
BEN: What's the problem? Your father was murdered!
VITTI: Heart attack, murdered, what's the difference? He's dead.
BEN: There's a big difference. Why didn't you tell me?
VITTI: Because it's private. You think I tell you every little thing?
BEN: That is not a little thing!
VITTI: Okay, you want to know? Analyze this. I was twelve years old, the whole family was having dinner together right over there, two guys walked in and shot him dead right in front of us. Okay?
BEN: And you didn't think this was important enough to tell me?
VITTI: What am I supposed to do? Spend the rest of my life crying about the past? Forget about it.

VITTI: I'll reach out to you
BEN: I think we have some major trust issues here.
SINDONE: ( studying the paper ) I'd like to see a movie but there's nothing out there. It's all this shoot-'em-up action bullshit. I get enough of that at
MOONY: That was our friend. He marked your guy at Paretti's.
SINDONE: Yeah? Then let's make it the last supper. Jack?
HANDSOME JACK: You got it, Primo. Let's go.
SINDONE: ( as they exit ) Hey, Jack. Just for fun, tear out his heart and bring it to me.
BEN: Jimmy, you can have shotgun this time. I don't mind.
JIMMY: Nah, sit up front. There's more room for your legs.
BEN: My legs are short, it's fine in the back.
JIMMY: Get in the front.
BEN: You know what? It's late. I think I'm just going to call it a night. Why don't I just grab a cab and head on home.
JIMMY: Get in the car.
BEN: No really, it's all right.
JIMMY: ( pulls a gun ) Get in the fucking car.
VITTI: Do what he says.
BEN: You know, we call this a transference neurosis. It's when the patient starts acting out his problems with his therapist instead of out in the world. It's usually considered a good sign. Not for me, in this case, but
AGENT RICCI: What's he doing in there? He's been in the bathroom for half an
VITTI: ( to Jimmy and Jelly ) Leave us alone.
JELLY: Sorry, Doc. It's not personal, you know.
BEN: Don't kid yourself, Jelly. It doesn't get more personal than
VITTI: You know why I have to do this, don't you?
BEN: Because you're a paranoid? No, actually you're a reverse paranoid. You think you're out to get everybody.
VITTI: Don't bullshit me! You betrayed me! You stabbed me in the back.

BEN: Yes, you do.
VITTI: No, I don't!
BEN: I think you do.

VITTI: ( a beat ) What did you order?
BEN: What did you order?
VITTI: What did you order?
BEN: What did you order?
VITTI: That night. What were you eating the night your father got killed?
BEN: That night. What were you eating the night your father got killed?
VITTI: How the hell do I know?
BEN: You don't remember?
VITTI: It was 35 years ago.
BEN: What did your father have?
VITTI: I told you! I don't remember.
BEN: ( CONTINUED )
VITTI: What's the matter with you?
BEN: It's a simple question. What was your father eating!
VITTI: ( after a long Good. And you.
BEN: Good. And you.
VITTI: The food was on the table?
BEN: The food was on the table?
VITTI: They were just serving it.

VITTI: His pants. They looked too good for a busboy.
BEN: He walked over to the table?
VITTI: I watched him the whole way.
BEN: Did you say anything?
VITTI: My father was so mad at me.
BEN: And you were mad at him.
VITTI: I couldn't say anything.
BEN: And then.
VITTI: I never saw the second guy. My mother started screaming.
BEN: And you blame yourself?
VITTI: I coulda saved him.
BEN: But you were mad at him.
VITTI: ( starting to I killed my father.
BEN: You didn't kill him, Paul. You were angry but you didn't kill him. That's the life he chose.
VITTI: I never got to say good-bye.
BEN: Say it now, Paul. Talk to him. What do you want to tell him?
VITTI: I can't.
BEN: You have to. Tell him, Paul.
VITTI: ( breaks down ) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
BEN: It's okay, Paul. You can let go of it now.
JIMMY: What's taking so long? I'm ruining my goddamn shoes here. Fuckin' $350 Bruno Maglis.
JELLY: What's wrong with you? Don't you have any respect? This is a very difficult thing for Paul.
JIMMY: Shoulda let me do it. I'd be home watchin' E.S.P.N.2 by now. World's strongest man. You should see these guys.
BEN: You couldn't save him, Paul. He was trying to save you. That's what you fought about. He didn't want this for you, and you don't want it for Anthony. You don't want him to grow up the way you did without a father.
JELLY: Jesus, the guy's fallin' apart.
JIMMY: Why doesn't he just pop him? It's
BEN: Your father's not dead, Paul. He's alive in you. And he's trying to tell you something.
BEN: Oh, my God!
BEN: ( in a panic ) Paul! They're shooting!
JELLY: He FIRES back at Handsome Jack.
POTATOES: He rakes the Lincoln with a BURST from the ASSAULT RIFLE.
JELLY'S CAR: All the WINDOWS ARE BLOWN OUT by the GUNFIRE. Ben Vitti just sits there on the ground, still sobbing He reloads and FIRES again.
BEN: Paul! For God's sake, shoot
JELLY: He reloads and FIRES again.
POTATOES: Jelly's last SHOT strikes him right in the chest, and he goes down.
HANDSOME JACK: He sees Potatoes fall and starts moving out, covering his retreat with another BURST from his MACHINE GUN.
JELLY'S CAR: Something snaps inside Ben.
BEN: Goddamn it!
JELLY: He sees Handsome Jack emerge from cover and takes him out with FIVE QUICK SHOTS.
HANDSOME JACK: He goes down FIRING, dead before he hits the ground.
SCRAP YARD: It's suddenly quiet. After a long moment, Jimmy rolls over and moans. Jelly goes to him and starts examining his wound.
BEN: Oh my God! Did I do that?
JELLY: No, Doc. That one's mine. You got the Chevy Camaro and the side-by-side refrigerator-freezer.
VITTI: Pretty fuckin' ironic, isn't it? You can give me back the gun now,
VITTI: It's okay. I wasn't really gonna whack you. All right, maybe I was gonna whack you, but I was real conflicted about it. Progress, right?
BEN: I don't think I can see you Yeah, I figured.
VITTI: Yeah, I figured.
BEN: This was big tonight. You might feel a little raw for a while.
VITTI: So good luck. It's been
BEN: So good luck. It's been
ELAINE: I want to please him in bed, but whatever I do it seems like it's never enough. Now he wants me to say things when we're making love.
BEN: What kinds of things does he want you to say, Elaine?
ELAINE: Well, he wants me to call him 'big boy.' And he's my bucking bronco, and I'm supposed to ride him hard and put him back in the barn wet.
ELAINE: Are you all right, Dr. Sobol?
BEN: Let me suggest something, Elaine. If the man wants you to say things . damn it, you should get down on all fours and bark like a dog if that's going to get the job done. Break out the wine, baby. Smoke a joint. Do what you have to do, because life is too short. It's just too fucking short.
ELAINE: CUT TO:
JELLY: How you feelin', boss? You need
VITTI: No, I'm great. Never felt better in my life. When this meeting is over they won't know what hit 'em.
DOROTHY: Is Ben going to step on the glass?
ISAAC: No. He doesn't want to hurt his foot, so they're going to drop a person on it.
RABBI: We are put on this earth to find a love, a soulmate, someone with whom we can create joy. How glad we are today that Ben and Laura have found each other, and we anticipate and celebrate the years of joy they will share together from this day on.
RABBI: Ben, do you take this woman, Laura, to be your lawfully wedded wife, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do you part, so help you God?
BEN: ( hissing ) Excuse me?
RABBI: Excuse me?
BEN: No, not you. I was talking to him.
RABBI: Who him?
BEN: It's not important. Yes.
RABBI: Yes what?
BEN: Yes to the thing before. To her. That's a yes. Pick it up from
JELLY: ( to Ben ) Doc, we're going to need to hurry it up here. ( to Michael ) Hi, kid.
LAURA: I do not believe this!
JELLY: ( to the Rabbi ) Haul ass, buddy. We got a problem.
LAURA: Who the hell do you think you are?
JELLY: ( to Ben ) Ooh, she's feisty. Watch out, Doc. ( to the Rabbi ) Tick tock, let's go. Hurry up and pronounce them, huh?
RABBI: By the power vested me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you man and wife.
JELLY: Okay. Kiss, kiss
JELLY: I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Sobol, but duty calls, you know?
LAURA: ( tearing up ) Oh. You're the first person to call me Mrs. Sobol.
JELLY: Nice, huh?
LAURA: Laura, I'm sorry. It's the job.
BEN: Laura, I'm sorry. It's the job.
LAURA: Go. Just go. Have him back here by the salad course or you're in serious trouble. Capiche?
JELLY: You're a pistol. I like her.
JELLY: He's bad, Doc. Worse than I ever seen him. I think his inner child is all fucked up.
BEN: Have you ever seen an episode like Yes. Once on 'Bonanza,' Hoss Cartwright got bit by a raccoon. He got this fever and he was shaking
JELLY: Yes. Once on 'Bonanza,' Hoss Cartwright got bit by a raccoon. He got this fever and he was shaking
BEN: Never mind.
JELLY: This is serious, Doc. If he doesn't make this meeting, they'll kill him for sure.
BEN: Can't someone else in the family go for him? Tommy the Tongue? Louie the Lip? What about you? You go?
JELLY: That would work except for one little detail. I'm a fucking moron. I'm known for it. You have to go.
BEN: Me? You must be a moron.
JELLY: Hey! Watch that.
BEN: You just said it yourself.
JELLY: It's different when I say it. When you say it, it sounds very I'm sorry, Jelly, but I'm not going. I'm not on the payroll anymore, so forget about it. My wife is waiting
BEN: I'm sorry, Jelly, but I'm not going. I'm not on the payroll anymore, so forget about it. My wife is waiting
JELLY: Ben feels a gun pressed against his back.
BEN: You can't shoot me, Jelly.
JELLY: Correction. Mr. Vitti couldn't shoot you. But here's something about me you should know. I never got married, Doctor Sobol. I don't have a hobby. I never got a dog or a cat. I don't even have a goldfish. I live for one reason only, and that's to serve Mr. Paul Vitti. He's what I'm thinking about when I wake up, and he's what I'm thinking about when I close my eyes to sleep. If he told me to jump off a tall building, not only would I do it, I would hope to survive so I could do it again and again until he told me to stop. This is all I know. This is all I got. So please don't think I won't kill you, because I'd hate for your last thought to be a wrong one. You're going to that meeting.
STEADMAN: ( desperately ) Which one is it?
AGENT PROVANO: The black one.
JIMMY: ( his shoulder bandaged ) Just remember. That's a fuckin' $1200 Valentino suit. You spill anything on it, I'll mess you up Shut up. You're making him nervous. If he gets nervous and fucks up, they'll kill him for ( to Ben ) Let's go over it again.
JELLY: Shut up. You're making him nervous. If he gets nervous and fucks up, they'll kill him for Let's go over it again.
BEN: This is insane.
JELLY: Mr. Vitti's been detained, apologies all around, blah, blah, blah. Then you say you're the new consigliere, and you're prepared to speak for Mr. Vitti.
BEN: Then what?
JELLY: Then you just keep your mouth shut, and hope nobody asks you Boy, this is some fuckin' plan.
JIMMY: Boy, this is some fuckin' plan.
JELLY: Shut up. If you have to talk, just be vague. Can you do that?
BEN: I'm a psychologist. Believe me, I can be vague.
VITTI: Shouldn't you be outside playing or something?
ANTHONY: No, it's all right.
VITTI: How long you gonna sit there?
ANTHONY: ( shrugs ) How long you gonna lay there?
VITTI: I'm done.
BEN: ( sotto voce ) I can't do this. I'm telling you, I cannot do this.
JELLY: Don't fucking whine! Whining's a dead giveaway. Come on! You're the consigliere, for Chrissake.
BEN: These are the bosses? That one looks like my Uncle Max.
MANGANO: ( surprised ) What's goin' on? Where's Vitti?
JELLY: On his way. Don't worry.
MANGANO: What's he doin' here?
JELLY: He's it's okay. Forget about Forget about it? What the hell is
MANGANO: Forget about it? What the hell is
SINDONE: Who's the guy with Jelly?
MOONY: I don't know.
BEN: ( to Jelly, borderline I can't do this.
MOONY: All right, gentlemen. I think we better start. We have a big agenda, so for now let's stick to the big issues. And it would help if you identify yourselves when you speak, since we don't all know each other, and we didn't think anybody would be into wearing any fucking name tags.
SINDONE: I'm Primo Sindone. They call me Sonny Long. It's good to see so many of the old faces here, and to welcome the new ones from all over the country. I see Frank Zello, and Joe Baldassare, but I'm a little disappointed to see that the head of our other New York family isn't here today.

VITTI: About two and a half weeks ago, somebody killed my friend, Dominic
SINDONE: Don't look at me. Everybody knows you whacked him so you could take over everything.
VITTI: What I really came here to say is that I've come to a very important decision in my life. I want out.
VITTI: I'm going away for a while, but I will respect the oath I took the day I was made, and whatever I know about anyone else's business, I take with me to the grave. You have my word.
VITTI: As for my own organization, I know Carlo Mangano would like to be the new boss.
MANGANO: Thank you, Paul.
VITTI: That's why he betrayed Dominic and me to our enemies and sent his own man to kill me in Miami.
VITTI: But I leave it to my people to deal with that and choose their own boss. And even though it's my right, I won't take revenge, mostly because I'm in a good place mentally and feeling good about me.
ZELLO: ( perplexed ) I don't know, Paul. I can see where some people might have a problem with this.
VITTI: I realize that, so as an extra token of good faith between us, I've taken the liberty of writing down everything I know and putting it in a safe deposit box in case anything happens to me or my
ZELLO: I don't know what anybody else thinks, but I say good luck and God bless, Paul.
BALDASSARE: Good luck, Paul. Salut.
BEN: ( to Vitti ) Well done.

VITTI: I don't want to do this, Primo.
SINDONE: You don't want to do this? That's fuckin' rich. What did you think, you could just quit and walk away? You think this is a fuckin' civil service job? What are you, crazy?
VITTI: Not anymore. Hey, Carlo, tell me. You gonna stab me in the back like the piece of shit I always knew you were?
MANGANO: I'm not gonna stab you in the back, Paul. I want to see your face when I do it.
VITTI: I don't think so.
VITTI: Johnny Bigs steps out from behind a shed holding an assault rifle.
VITTI: The back of a van opens to reveal Eddie "Cokes" and Tuna manning a military air-cooled machine gun on a tripod.
VITTI: It's over, Primo. Now get the fuck outta here.
BEN: Good thinking. I was going to bring a machine gun but I don't have one. Of course, we haven't opened the wedding gifts yet.
ZELLO: Oh, shit.
AGENT RICCI: ( screaming ) Don't move! Don't you fucking Hey! Take a pill, Robocop.
SINDONE: Hey! Take a pill, Robocop.

DONNY: ( suddenly vulnerable ) Yes, I do.
BEN: Paul, what would you say about what Donny's feeling?
VITTI: Donny, when you're thirsty, you don't go to the wall you go to the well. You know what I'm saying? Your mother may never be able to listen to you, but you have friends here who will.
BEN: And be patient, Donny. Most people's problems take months, sometimes years to resolve.
DONNY: I'm doing twenty-five to life.
BEN: That should be plenty of time.
BEN: You know they found Primo Sindone dead in a field near LaGuardia.
VITTI: I heard. I had nothing to do with it. There were guys lined up from Canarsie to Atlantic City who wanted to whack that bastard.
BEN: Okay, just checking.
VITTI: You know, Doc, I don't think I ever thanked you properly for curing me.
BEN: We don't say 'cured.' We say you had a 'corrective emotional You, you, you're very good.
