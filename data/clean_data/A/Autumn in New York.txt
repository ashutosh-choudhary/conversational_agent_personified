WILLS: and I could have waited to tell you, but I wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding.
WOMAN: Well, you certainly didn't.
WOMAN: No, I see how you could feel this way. Of course I do. It's human. But what I don't get is why you'd want to announce it so quickly. I mean, we just met. Feelings change. You don't even know me.
WILLS: Yes, I do.
WOMAN: Oh, really?
WILLS: The minute I laid eyes on you. It's the saddest thing about getting older. You know people so quickly. I even knew you'd end up hating me.
WOMAN: Well, you're wrong. I don't.
WILLS: ( with a weary smile ) Give it time.
CHARLOTTE: and for weeks I sat by her bed and cried. I told her I loved her and I begged her not to leave me. All I could think about was what I'd lose if she died. And then one night. she was in really bad pain. I stopped thinking about myself for a second and I thought about her. I stopped crying. I said goodbye. And in less than an hour Ella was
WOMAN: It's so sad.
CHARLOTTE: I really think it's possible to hold a person back. cry them back. from dying. That's what I did to Ella and I'll never do it to anyone else again. I hope no one ever does it to me.
WOMAN: So what do you know about her?
WILLS: That she's just a kid.
OLD MAN: I met Ella at City College in 1938.
CHARLOTTE: She dumps her boxes and bags, then wheels in the mannequin.
CHARLOTTE: Dolly! The bulb burned out!
CHARLOTTE: She tiptoes through the darkness and lays her ear against INT. LIVING ROOM SAME We hear chuckles and whispers of anticipation. An older woman's raspy, boozy voice growls
RASPY VOICE: My ass hurts.
ALL: The MANNEQUIN bursts into the room, teetering crazily, wearing CHARLOTTE'S JACKET, BACKPACK, and HAT. Everyone FLINCHES and SCREAMS. Amid a chorus of laughter, Charlotte enters. Grinning, she wags a facetious finger
SURPRISE!: The MANNEQUIN bursts into the room, teetering crazily, wearing CHARLOTTE'S JACKET, BACKPACK, and HAT. Everyone FLINCHES and SCREAMS. Amid a chorus of laughter, Charlotte enters. Grinning, she wags a facetious finger
CHARLOTTE: See? Surprises suck!
TANYA: Oh, Wills, please, not again. It's our third date and we're already in a rut.
WILLS: But I thought you loved it.
TANYA: Oh, I do except for the fact that there isn't a single thing on the menu I can eat.
WILLS: ( with a chuckle ) Sure, there is; there's just very little you're willing to digest.
TANYA: Fine then. We'll go, I'll get big, fat, and horrible, and it'll serve you right.
WILLS: No, it won't. Because it takes at least a few weeks to get fat and by then you won't even be speaking to Why do you say that?
TANYA: ( curiously ) Why do you say that?
WILLS: Because we have no future. All I can offer you is this. what we have right now. nothing more meaningful. until it ends.
WILLS: I could have waited to tell you, but I wanted to leave no room for
JESUS: Good evening, Mr. Keane. Will you be dining with us tonight?
WILLS: We certainly will. Table seven, Jesus, if it's available.
JESUS: Yes, sir. How are you, Melissa?
WILLS: How are you, Melissa?
MELISSA: ( blushing ) Fine, Mr. Keane.
WILLS: Good evening, Celia. And how
CELIA: ( with forced cheeriness ) Just dandy, sir, thanks!
JESUS: Table seven.
CELIA: This way, please.
WILLS: I'll be right with you.
WILLS: How's it going?
JOHN: ( covering the phone ) The house specialty.
WILLS: The house specialty.
JOHN: Easy for you to say, ya prick. Waltzin' in here like you own the
JOHN: So who's the new potential ex-wife? I thought you were still wastin' time with Tanya-von-What's-her-name.
WILLS: We wisely agreed to cut our losses.
CELIA: Look, I have no right to say this, okay? And you can fire me if you want, but in the six weeks we've been open you've brought in six different women tonight makes seven and it's really starting to get to me.
WILLS: In what way?
CELIA: I have to greet them! It's like working at a dog shelter! I'm afraid to learn their names or even smile at them because I know any minute they could be put down!
WILLS: I assure you it's an absolutely painless procedure.
CELIA: It is?
WILLS: ( beat ) Especially for me.
WILLS: Actually, I appreciate your concern, Celia. The truth is I'm a little worried myself.
CELIA: Seriously. I've been trying to do But. you know how it is. old habits die hard.
WILLS: Seriously. I've been trying to do But. you know how it is. old habits die hard.
CELIA: So I'm not fired?
WILLS: Nope. In fact, John's been looking for an assistant. Tell him you've just been promoted.
CHARLOTTE: You guys! Let me think! Okay. Okay.
SIMON: Watch carefully, everyone they ought to begin emerging any moment
CHARLOTTE: Very funny! Actually, any moment now you're gonna turn straight and fall at my feet.
SIMON: Oh, darling, you know I would if I
SHANNON: The only time he falls at your feet now is when he wants to borrow your Prada loafers.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Is that Wills Keane? It sure as hell is and he hasn't changed a bit!
WOMAN: It sure as hell is and he hasn't changed a bit!
WILLS: I'm sorry, do I
WOMAN: You little fool, it's Dolores Talbot.
WILLS: My God, it is.
DOLLY: Yeah, I know, time's kicked my ass but good. Come on, Romeo, let's bury the hatchet. Give me a hug. Careful of the cocktail. So what the hell're you doin' around here? Last I heard you were out in earthquake country blowin' the family Actually, I doubled it.
DOLLY: So what the hell're you doin' around here? Last I heard you were out in earthquake country blowin' the family Actually, I doubled it.
WILLS: Actually, I doubled it.
DOLLY: Good for you!
SHANNON: and you know how bouncer's get. He's like, "That's the worst fake I.D. I've ever seen." And I'm like, "Yeah? Well, you have the worst dread- extensions!" And then just when Are you feeling all right? You look positively green.
SIMON: Are you feeling all right? You look positively green.
CHARLOTTE: He's here. And he's staring at me No way!
SHANNON: No way!
CHARLOTTE: ( to Simon ) Wait a few seconds, then go to the How will I know him?
SIMON: How will I know him?
CHARLOTTE: He's beautiful. And much older.
SIMON: ( getting up ) If he's rich you might have a fight on your hands.
CHARLOTTE: Okay, look. He's as old as my dad!
SHANNON: He's as old as my dad!
DOLLY: Sure, L.A.'s okay if you're a cactus or a lizard, but if you're a New Englander, your soul dries up and blows away like a god damn leaf.
WILLS: It only took me twenty years to come to my senses.
DOLLY: So what're you doin' now? You owned some restaurants out there, didn't
SHANNON: And so, after all that, we pay our cover, we get in, and it's totally heinous! Nothing but losers and
CHARLOTTE: Oh, shit.
SHANNON: Dolores walks up, hauling Wills by the arm
DOLLY: Kids! I want you to meet an old chum of mine, the owner of this fine establishment Wills Keane!
DOLLY: And that over there's the birthday girl my granddaughter, Charlotte.
WILLS: Not Katie and Jay's daughter?
DOLLY: You bet. She got her height from her dad. But her talent's all Katie's.
DOLLY: Made it herself from scratch. That one, too. Honey, show 'im.
WILLS: Try as she might to accept the compliment with grace, Charlotte can't help but grin.
CHARLOTTE: The WINE STEWARD stands at a station on which sit TWO BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE on ice. He reaches for one. Wills stops him
WILLS: I think we can do better than that.
WILLS: Happy birthday, Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE: ( under her breath ) Twenty years old and never been.
SHANNON: ( under her breath ) Twenty years old and never been.
CHARLOTTE: ( laughing ) Shut up!
WILLS: I'll let you get back to your A pleasure to see you again.
DOLLY: Same here.
SIMON: Leaving so soon?
SIMON: Be still my beating heart. Or is that your heart?
SHANNON: ( whisper to Charlotte ) You're not really into him, are you?
CHARLOTTE: Hey, Dolly, how do you know him?
DOLLY: ( uneasily ) From Newport. Old friend of your
CHARLOTTE: Okay, bitch, I'm ready!
WILLS: For what?
CHARLOTTE: Oh my God, I'm so sorry! Wait. Who is this?
WILLS: Wills Keane.
WILLS: Who did you think it was?
CHARLOTTE: My friend Simon, actually. He always calls me the morning after to sort of. you know. sum everything up.
WILLS: And how would you sum it up, Charlotte? Turning twenty.
CHARLOTTE: Kinda cool, kinda creepy. Anyway, you wanna speak to my grandmother?
WILLS: ( with a chuckle ) I don't think so. I called because I'm going to be attending a benefit. a black-and- white ball.. and I'd like you to design a hat. for my date.
WILLS: I called because I'm going to be attending a benefit. a black-and- white ball.. and I'd like you to design a hat. for my date.
CHARLOTTE: Really? Wow. Sounds fun. Okay.
WILLS: It's a gift. I don't have her measurements, but she's about your size. What're you, a six?
CHARLOTTE: Good then let's assume your hat size is also the same.
WILLS: Good then let's assume your hat size is also the same.
CHARLOTTE: But that doesn't necessarily
WILLS: It's a risk we'll just have to take.
WILLS: Her dress is a sheath. sleeveless, black. The hat must, of course, be black or white or both.
CHARLOTTE: Any particular style?
WILLS: ( sipping his coffee ) No, just plenty of it. How long will it take?
CHARLOTTE: A week or two.
WILLS: You have till Thursday. I'll need it here by seven o'clock. I'm at the Pembroke on Central Park West and Oh. Wow. Okay.
CHARLOTTE: Oh. Wow. Okay.
WILLS: What's your fee?
CHARLOTTE: ( faltering ) I don't really have one. I usually just make them for friends.
WILLS: How's five hundred dollars?
CHARLOTTE: Really? Wow.
WILLS: His tone has abruptly shifted; it's intimately hushed. It both daunts and excites her
CHARLOTTE: You say "wow" a lot.
WILLS: You say "wow" a lot.
CHARLOTTE: I know.
WILLS: It has to stop. You're a woman now.
CHARLOTTE: I know.
WILLS: She clicks off the phone, wilts into a swoon on the bed, and breaks out laughing. Wills, still holding the receiver, stares dreamily into the middle distance. He snaps to when Olivia enters. Her accent is as much Queens as it is Caribbean
CHARLOTTE: She clicks off the phone, wilts into a swoon on the bed, and breaks out laughing. Wills, still holding the receiver, stares dreamily into the middle distance. He snaps to when Olivia enters. Her accent is as much Queens as it is Caribbean
OLIVIA: See, now you got me worried.
WILLS: What do you mean?
OLIVIA: You slept alone last night. You must be sick or somethin'. You want me to call a doctor?
WILLS: Thank you, no, I'm fine.
JOHN: Save it, pal! Don't even bother! I may not have gone to a fancy school like Bendover
WILLS: ( to Sarah ) That would be Andover.
SARAH: Sure, if his folks could have afforded bottles of Dom to a twenty-year-old girl, then tells me he did it 'cause he likes the kid's grandma, I smell a rat!
JOHN: but when Wills Keane comps three bottles of Dom to a twenty-year-old girl, then tells me he did it 'cause he likes the kid's grandma, I smell a rat!
SARAH: ( looking around ) Oh, is that what that is? I figured there was a dirty diaper somewhere.
WILLS: ( lightly ) Okay, I admit it, she interests me.
JOHN: ( turning to Sarah ) He's gonna do it! I don't believe it! He moved us back here for nothing!
SARAH: So much for that turned leaf.
WILLS: ( amused ) Come on, you're overreacting.
JOHN: Is that what you think? Buddy, since we hit town, I have done nothin' but cut you slack! Every week a new woman on your arm and I didn't say a word. Why? 'Cause I figured at least they're in the right demographic. Maybe by accident you'll trip over something substantial. But this little girl? Best she could be is Miss Right's I know. It's just that there's something about her. She's special. and I just thought
WILLS: ( uneasily ) I know. It's just that there's something about her. She's special. and I just thought
SARAH: "She's young. She's hot. I'm on the verge of menopause. Why not go for
WILLS: There wouldn't be much point in lying to you, would there?
KIDS' VOICES: Mommy, Daddy, look, look!
JOHN: Hey, they're bigger than you are!
CHARLOTTE: Why don't you mark what isn't important? That way you'll save ink.
SHANNON: Why don't you sew your mouth to my butt? That way you'll stop annoying
DOLLY: Now, now, if you two kids can't play
SHANNON: God, I hate school.
CHARLOTTE: Oh, come on, just last week, you said you were on a roll. You loved Well, now I'm on the rag and I hate
SHANNON: Well, now I'm on the rag and I hate
CHARLOTTE: I think you're incredibly lucky. I'd love to be going to college.
SHANNON: Am I the most spoiled brat in the world or what?
CHARLOTTE: Spoiled brats don't even ask questions like that. What do you think?
SHANNON: That you're the most beautiful person in the entire world.
DRIVER: Mikey! How ya doin'?
DOORMAN: A bit early, aren't you?
DRIVER: Hey, in this soup, better safe than sorry, you know what I mean?
CHARLOTTE: She runs right past Michael
KEANE!: She runs right past Michael
MICHAEL: He's goin' to a fancy party tonight. Oh, really?
CHARLOTTE: Oh, really?
MICHAEL: Watch your step, Miss.
CHARLOTTE: Thank you.
OLIVIA: He's waitin' for you, Miss Fieldin'.
WILLS: What happened?
CHARLOTTE: I couldn't get a cab, so I took the subway. only it was an express and it didn't stop at
WILLS: You realize, don't you, that you're a full eighteen minutes late?
CHARLOTTE: I know. I'm so sorry. I
WILLS: Charlotte, relax. What's the point of being a beautiful young woman if it isn't to keep your admirers waiting? In fact, you disappoint me: I was looking forward to at least another half hour of suspense.
CHARLOTTE: I could leave and come back.
WILLS: Nope, too late. Anyway, I want to see the hat.
WILLS: Try it on.
CHARLOTTE: I can't. I'm soaked.
WILLS: It's all right.
WILLS: It's perfect. It's like a tiny I wanted it to be a tiny poem.
CHARLOTTE: I wanted it to be a tiny poem.
WILLS: If only I had some use for it. My date canceled a few hours ago.
CHARLOTTE: I don't know. She was vague. Would you. like to come in her place?
WILLS: I don't know. She was vague. Would you. like to come in her place?
CHARLOTTE: Like this?
WILLS: The outfit I bought her is hanging in the guest room closet.
CHARLOTTE: ( anxiously ) It's okay? Are you sure?
WILLS: ( amused ) Of course.
WILLS: Nonsense. You're very good. Where did you learn?
CHARLOTTE: From Ella. The woman whose memorial you crashed.
WILLS: So you did see me there.
CHARLOTTE: Uh-huh. And the next time I saw you, you were on the cover of New York magazine. And I had to pick a place for my birthday. So. Of course he moved back. I mean, he'd already seduced every A- and B- list actress in town. What was left for him?
LISA: The C-list?
LISA: Why do you say that?
CHARLOTTE: I met Ella in the fourth grade. She was my teacher at the Little Red School House. We stayed friends after she retired. She taught me how to cook and sew. speak Italian. basically enjoy life, have fun that's what she was best at. even when she knew she was dying. The most important thing she did was introduce me to poetry. She believed it was the highest form of art and that everything we say and do should aspire to it.
WILLS: It sounds as though, in a way, she took your mom's place.
CHARLOTTE: My mom and my dad's. After they died, Dolly was so devastated she pretty much gave up on everything. It was like if something that tragic could happen, there was no way she was ever gonna care about anyone else ever again. Including herself. She wasn't a horrible parent. she didn't abuse me or anything. she just ignored me. She was more like a weird landlady than a grandmother.
WILLS: I'm sure she did the best she could.
CHARLOTTE: For a long time I kinda thought that, too, and I made excuses for her, but now I don't. I was seven years old and I needed her and she wasn't there.
WILLS: I remember when I heard the news about your parents. You know how after a crash they print a long list of names in the newspaper? Well, I grew up outside Boston, so I naturally started to scan the list. But casually, not expecting to
CHARLOTTE: Oh, no, come on! I love this stuff! Don't you? Didn't you grow up on it?
WILLS: How old do you think I am?
CHARLOTTE: Holding his hand, she starts moving to the music. Wills laughs
WILLS: I have no idea what to do!
CHARLOTTE: Have fun!
LISA: I had to come. I work at the Met. What's your excuse?
CHARLOTTE: Sort of a date.
LISA: With Wills Keane, right?
CHARLOTTE: You know him?
LISA: Just by reputation.
CHARLOTTE: A major womanizer, right?
LISA: That's what they say. I'm Lisa.
CHARLOTTE: Charlotte Fielding.
LISA: Anyway, I should keep mingling. But it was nice to meet you.
CHARLOTTE: Same here.
WILLS: Who was that?
CHARLOTTE: Lisa something.
WILLS: ( lifting his glass ) Here's to
CHARLOTTE: Wills smiles slowly and they toast.
CHARLOTTE: God, you talk like you're a hundred and sixteen!
WILLS: That's usually how I feel. But not tonight. Tonight I feel sixteen. just sixteen. and three-quarters.
WILLS: He asked nonchalantly.
CHARLOTTE: He asked nonchalantly.
WILLS: You see, Charlotte, the way you know you're getting older is that you start to notice patterns. People start falling into types. Pretty soon you know a person before you've even been introduced. And if it's a woman, before the romance even starts, a whisper in your head tells you exactly what it is and how long it's going to last. And the saddest, the most tedious, part of all is that that little voice is almost always Now, what I like about you and I think that's actually what inspired this little lecture is that I find you completely unprecedented. and, therefore, wholly unpredictable.
CHARLOTTE: God, it must be a relief.
WILLS: ( confused ) To finally deliver that speech to a woman and actually have it apply to Now wait a minute.
CHARLOTTE: To finally deliver that speech to a woman and actually have it apply to Now wait a minute.
WILLS: Now wait a minute.
CHARLOTTE: No, because coincidentally I am all those things you just said. And more. I'm a "unique". At least that's what my yoga teacher says. He says there are very few uniques in the world and I'm one of them.
CHARLOTTE: I'm a "unique". At least that's what my yoga teacher says. He says there are very few uniques in the world and I'm one of them.
WILLS: Well, he's a wise man.
CHARLOTTE: You, on the other hand, are what he'd call a "typical."
WILLS: Oh, really?
CHARLOTTE: Uh-huh. And I can prove it. Want me to? Come here.
CHARLOTTE: Wills walks even closer, until they are just a few feet apart.
CHARLOTTE: No, come on, really close.
CHARLOTTE: Perfect. Now watch very carefully.
CHARLOTTE: See? You're a typical. And for what you just did, most girls my age would slap your face. Or ask to be put in a cab. Lucky for you, I'm a unique.
CHARLOTTE: Boy, do you look guilty.
CHARLOTTE: Didn't anyone ever teach you that it's bad manners to stare at a girl when she's eating like a pig?
WILLS: Uh-oh. Here it comes.
CHARLOTTE: Uh-oh. Here it comes.
WILLS: That's right, because, look, I could put this off, but I genuinely like you. So I want to be clear. right now. from the start, so there's no chance for misunderstanding later.
CHARLOTTE: What I want to say you is.. well. that all I can offer you is this. what we have right now. nothing more substantial. just this. until it ends.
WILLS: What I want to say you is.. well. that all I can offer you is this. what we have right now. nothing more substantial. just this. until it ends.
WILLS: The truth is, we have no future I know. I'm dying.
CHARLOTTE: I know. I'm dying.
WILLS: What. what do you mean?
CHARLOTTE: What I said. Nobody thought I'd even last this long. I could have put off telling you, but I genuinely like you, so I wanted to be clear. you know, right from the start.
CHARLOTTE: I could have put off telling you, but I genuinely like you, so I wanted to be clear. you know, right from the start.
CHARLOTTE: Thanks, Olivia!
SIBLEY: Mr. Keane? Dr. Sibley.
WILLS: Thank you so much for taking the It's my job, sir. Please, sit down.
SIBLEY: It's my job, sir. Please, sit down.
SIBLEY: Now, Mr. Keane, on the phone you referred to Charlotte's condition as cancer. That isn't strictly accurate. Neuroblastoma is a soft tissue malignancy, but it isn't cancer although it sometimes can be just as It's most common in children. In young adults, the condition is extremely rare. In Charlotte's case, the tumor is located in her chest. It's growing rapidly and has proved resistant to both irradiation and chemotherapy. And because of its proximity to her aorta, surgery is out of the question.
WILLS: So then what treatment is she getting?
SIBLEY: At present? Nothing.
SIBLEY: Eventually she'll be treated for pain. In the end, surgery could become an option, but her chances of survival would be slim. Right now Charlotte's against it. She's signed a directive forbidding any sort of heroic There's more here if you're interested, but it won't mean much to you.
SIBLEY: There's more here if you're interested, but it won't mean much to you.
WILLS: How long?
SIBLEY: Optimistically? A year.
CHARLOTTE: A real charmer, isn't he?
CHARLOTTE: How are you on Cambodian money units?
CHARLOTTE: Are you okay, old man? You look kinda Is there a doctor in the house?
CHARLOTTE: Wills slowly turns his head. She smiles sweetly
CHARLOTTE: Look on the bright side: if I weren't sick, there's no way we could hang out together. I'm serious. You'd be scared of hurting me and I'd be scared you were just using me for my perfect young body.
CHARLOTTE: And then our friends would say we were just into each other for weird psychological reasons. You know, because I'm looking for a daddy substitute and you're looking for someone you can feel superior to so you won't have to confront how scared you are of real intimacy and, of course, they'd be right and eventually we'd break up. But since I'm so sick it doesn't really matter what deep-seated weirdness has brought us together because there's no way we can possibly screw each other over. or up. because that takes time. And I don't have much left.
CHARLOTTE: So considering everything, don't you think we should just sort of chill out, forget I'm sick, and enjoy what we have. right now. no strings. just this. until it ends? 'Cause that's really all I have to offer.
CHARLOTTE: Think about it, okay? But not too
CHARLOTTE: Last night was so incredibly hot. By the way it was my first time. And I picked you for the job. I hope you're flattered.
DRIVER: Okay, pal, where to?
SHANNON: I don't believe it! I don't believe I think what Miss Harris is trying to say, is that you've strained her Really? Better put some ice on that.
SIMON: I think what Miss Harris is trying to say, is that you've strained her Really? Better put some ice on that.
CHARLOTTE: Really? Better put some ice on that.
SHANNON: Girlfriend, you are so incredibly So I've been told.
SIMON: So I've been told.
SHANNON: Okay, now tell us everything! Don't leave anything out!
JOHN'S VOICE: Okay, then what happened?
WILLS: Not much. I took her home and she pointed out an irony that fate was now offering us the very same thing that just this morning I'd told her was all I could offer her: a relationship with no future.
JOHN: ( chuckling ) A kid figured that out?
WILLS: She's not a kid! That's what I've been trying to tell you. Nothing's lost on her. I'm the kid. She. I don't know what the hell she is. But I do know what she was.
WILLS: A virgin.
JOHN: The busboys turn their heads.
WILLS: I had no idea. That's the only reason she had her party here, so she could lure me into doing the honors.
JOHN: ( grinning ) She used you, pal.
WILLS: I know.
JOHN: The hangman got hanged. How's it
WILLS: John laughs. Wills settles into a brooding silence. John goes back to work
JOHN: So what now?
WILLS: I end it.
JOHN: How come?
WILLS: What, you're endorsing this now?
JOHN: I don't know, when you talk about her, you're not such an arrogant son of a bitch. You get all whiny and stupid. I like that.
WILLS: And since I don't see you gettin' serious with any of your other victims, I figure why not spend a little time together? Because she's dying.
JOHN: And since I don't see you gettin' serious with any of your other victims, I figure why not spend a little time together? Because she's dying.
WILLS: Because she's dying.
JOHN: I got bad news for you, brother, so are you.
DOLLY: Well, well.
DOLLY: She'll be right down. She's upstairs, gildin' the lily.
HE'S HERE!: ( wryly ) Do come in.
DOLLY: Excuse the mess. My maid died fourteen years ago and it's been simply impossible to replace her. She did windows and spoke English.
WILLS: For you.
DOLLY: Well, aren't they loverly.
DOLLY: Care for a cocktail?
WILLS: No, thanks.
SIMON: It really is uncanny. I tell you, in that dress you're the spitting image of Michel Simon.
CHARLOTTE: ( flattered ) Who's she?
SIMON: A French character actor, long dead, who was not only hideous and fat, but quite male.
CHARLOTTE: So that would be a "no."
DOLLY: What can I say? Time's a thief. One day you're rich as an Arab, the next you're lucky if you can afford a god damn can of pistachio nuts.
DOLLY: How about that, huh? That was the summer you two
WILLS: I know.
DOLLY: Who'd have guessed what time had in store for her, huh? Look at that
DOLLY: Then again, time loves some people. Like you, for instance. Oh, time's just wild about you.
DOLLY: Just as handsome and charming as ever. And still up to the same old
WILLS: What do you mean?
DOLLY: First time you came to pick up Katie, you brought me flowers. Just like Flower the mother; then deflower the daughter. But Katie was too smart for you.
WILLS: Dolly, look
DOLLY: ( abruptly ) Aw, why the hell don't you leave her alone? Christ, she's sick! What? What's wrong?
CHARLOTTE: What? What's wrong?
DOLLY: You look like your mom is all.
WILLS: What do you mean, you knew?
CHARLOTTE: I did! I just didn't think it would take so long!
WILLS: Two days is long?
CHARLOTTE: It is when you're sitting by the phone. You wanna know how I knew?
WILLS: You're psychic?
CHARLOTTE: I am, but no it's because of my birthday wish.
WILLS: But we hadn't even been introduced I know, but I wished that whatever happened. you know, with my illness. I'd go out with a bang. Nothing heavy. No violins. No melodrama. Just fun. A total
CHARLOTTE: I know, but I wished that whatever happened. you know, with my illness. I'd go out with a bang. Nothing heavy. No violins. No melodrama. Just fun. A total
WILLS: He yanks her back just as a TAXI, horn blaring, SPEEDS PAST, nearly hitting her. For a moment, they both stand there, hearts pounding, breathing hard. Then Charlotte looks back at him and grins
CAREFUL!: He yanks her back just as a TAXI, horn blaring, SPEEDS PAST, nearly hitting her. For a moment, they both stand there, hearts pounding, breathing hard. Then Charlotte looks back at him and grins
CHARLOTTE: Wow, it's getting exciting already.
CHARLOTTE: "Lord, I do fear Thou'st made the world too beautiful this year! My soul is all but out of me, let No burning leaf; prithee, let no bird call!"
WILLS: We could go to a museum.
CHARLOTTE: No, that would be a thing! I don't want to do any thing today. I want to do no thing all day.
WILLS: Nothing at all?
CHARLOTTE: Uh-huh. No thing at all.
WILLS: So a movie is out.
CHARLOTTE: Way out!
WILLS: Ice cream at the Plaza? High tea at the Palace?
CHARLOTTE: Both out.
WILLS: What about shopping?
CHARLOTTE: It's not a thing?
WILLS: It's not a thing?
CHARLOTTE: Only when I have money.
WILLS: But all I gave you was champagne. That's not a proper birthday present.
CHARLOTTE: I agree, and I promise I'll let you give me something else, but not today.
WILLS: Soon. But I'm warning you, it's not going to be anything material.
CHARLOTTE: Soon. But I'm warning you, it's not going to be anything material.
WILLS: Why not? Oh, I see. because you're sick. That's right, but we're not gonna talk about that.
CHARLOTTE: That's right, but we're not gonna talk about that.
WILLS: How come?
CHARLOTTE: Because it's my rule.
WILLS: Any particular reason?
CHARLOTTE: Yeah, because everybody always wants to talk about miracles, or about some genius quack-doctor, or their friend's friend who went into remission eating nothing but sunflower seeds. It's boring and pointless.
WILLS: Are you sure? I mean, there are specialists who
CHARLOTTE: Don't start, okay? Now what I would enjoy is taking you shopping. For clothes. I'm serious. It's quality not quantity, you know.
CHARLOTTE: At work you should look perfect, but in everyday life you need to delight in disorder more. Don't you know? "A sweet disorder in the dress kindles in clothes a wantonness."
WILLS: I think that goes without saying.
CHARLOTTE: It was true when that poem was written three hundred years ago and it's true today. Wouldn't it be fun to look wanton occasionally?
WILLS: It's been a lifelong dream of mine. But will a scarf do it?
CHARLOTTE: Totally. Accessories rule. But we have to be careful. I don't want you looking too young. Nothing's worse than an old guy trying to look young.
WILLS: Good advice. I'll remember that for when I get old.
CHARLOTTE: You know what I meant.
WILLS: That I'm old.
CHARLOTTE: INT. BARNEY'S LOBBY LATER Wills walks a little self-consciously. He wears around his shoulders a sloppily draped wrinkly silk scarf. He walks past OTHER SHOPPERS. Among a GROUP OF WOMEN walking past him FIND CHARLOTTE who subtly checks him out as though he were a stranger. As she passes by, she gives him a sexy look, then, not very subtly, she spins around to look at his ass. Finally, she breaks character, runs after him, and throws her arms around his neck from behind.
CHARLOTTE: Perfectly imperfect!
WILLS: I don't know why, but for some odd reason, I feel absolutely compelled to tell you the truth about this. even at the risk of
CHARLOTTE: Hey, you're giving me the creeps. Just spit it out. I never had a date for the benefit. My plan from the beginning was for you to come with me.
WILLS: I never had a date for the benefit. My plan from the beginning was for you to come with me.
CHARLOTTE: So I made the hat for myself? And you bought that dress for me? And you did all this just so you could sleep with me? Why? I mean, why me?
WILLS: The eulogy you gave at Ella's service was so. impressive. You spoke about her death. about loss. in a way that I could never have done. You understood life emotionally in a way that I didn't. Whatever that understanding was, I wanted to get close to it.
CHARLOTTE: And sex seemed like the best way to do it.
WILLS: And the most enjoyable, yeah.
CHARLOTTE: Well, first of all, let me say, you have great taste because that little Dolce & Gabbana was to die for.
WILLS: And, second, don't ever lie to me All right.
CHARLOTTE: And, second, don't ever lie to me All right.
WILLS: All right.
CHARLOTTE: Seriously. There isn't a lie in the whole world I'd rather hear than the
CHARLOTTE: I thought I told you to wait right I got restless.
WILLS: I got restless.
CHARLOTTE: Well, I hope you didn't talk to Not a soul.
WILLS: Not a soul.
CHARLOTTE: You know what would scare me right
WILLS: Charlotte moves slowly through the darkness.
CHARLOTTE: She yanks a cord by the window. The BLIND OPENS and the room is flooded with MOONLIGHT. The room is still dark, but she is far more clearly visible. Her dress is unbuttoned down the front. She walks back to him and stops about five feet away. She releases the last buttons on her dress, then slides it off her shoulders to the floor. She wears only her underwear. She crosses her arms over her breasts, and smiles
CHARLOTTE: Have I told you my latest motto?
WILLS: If it's scary, do it.
CHARLOTTE: If it's scary, do it.
WILLS: I'm not sure I like that motto.
CHARLOTTE: I'm not sure that matters.
CHARLOTTE: Oh my God.
WILLS: You're scared, too.
CHARLOTTE: You're scared, too.
CHARLOTTE: Your turn.
CHARLOTTE: What's the matter, old man? Can't afford a gym?
WILLS: That's it!
CHARLOTTE: "Counting the beats, Counting the slow heart beats, The bleeding to death of time In slow heart beats, Wakeful they lie."
WILLS: So many words in that wonderful head of yours.
CHARLOTTE: If I could give you anything in the whole world, that's what it would
WILLS: They lie in silence.
CHARLOTTE: They lie in silence.
JOHN: Oh no, your boy made it! At ten minutes before close! All night I got a card announcing a halibut special, only I got no halibut! Now it's Sunday and I got three dozen cats lickin' their chops in the alley! Tony, I don't wanna hear it! I don't wanna hear it! I don't wanna MAN,
WILLS: Are you familiar with the phrase, "You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar?"
JOHN: Are you familiar with the phrase, "Mind your own god damn business?"
WILLS: Sure, it's from Poor Richard's Almanac. But the last time I checked
JOHN: No, your business is to smile, make friends, and get rich! My business is the business.
JOHN: What're you doin' here, anyway? You got a girl. Go home. Carve a pumpkin.
WILLS: We can't spend every waking moment
JOHN: Why not? No, seriously. Why not?
CELIA: Special delivery!
WILLS: No trouble?
CELIA: Wills removes a PAIR OF RED PLASTIC HORNS. John shakes his head with disbelief.
JOHN: Every year. You got no imagination.
WILLS: It's a classic. A little spirit gum and voila!
WILLS: young women are rendered helpless.
CELIA: It's true. I see a guy with horns growing out of his head and my knees go weak.
WILLS: Of course it's biological. What's goin' on?
JOHN: What's goin' on?
WILLS: What do you mean?
JOHN: At home.
WILLS: Nothing. Honestly. We're having a lot of fun. We're very happy.
CHARLOTTE'S VOICE: Don't come in! Don't!
WILLS: I'm not even tempted!
CHARLOTTE'S VOICE: ( from another room ) I'll be right out!
OLIVIA: You like hot cider?
WILLS: Sure, thanks.
WILLS: Charlotte made it. I just poured it in the cup.
OLIVIA: Charlotte made it. I just poured it in the cup.
CHARLOTTE: She stands before him, dressed in a WHITE SPINSTERLY VICTORIAN OUTFIT with braids coiled at her ears. Wills smiles with
WILLS: Don't I look just like her?
CHARLOTTE: Don't I look just like her?
WILLS: Absolutely incredible. You have no idea who I am.
CHARLOTTE: You have no idea who I am.
WILLS: Give me a hint.
CHARLOTTE: "Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul."
WILLS: Was that the hint?
CHARLOTTE: You dummy! Emily Dickinson! Only the greatest American female poet ever!
CHARLOTTE: Uncultured swine.
WILLS: The truth is out. I've lost you Wanna bet?
CHARLOTTE: Wanna bet?
CHARLOTTE: When do I get to see your costume?
JESUS: No, I think we make a great couple. A good witch and a bad hombre. That could make for some very interesting
JOHN: O, Ricky, chill out! You're gonna get snot in the water!
JOHN: That's it outta the pool!
SARAH: Where're the girls? I thought you were tucking them in!
JOHN: We got a volunteer!
WOMAN: Guess who?
WILLS: Wonder Woman?
WOMAN: I'll give you a hint. You dumped me.
WILLS: I'll give you a hint. You dumped me.
WOMAN: I'll give you a hint. You dumped me.
WILLS: Princess Di?
WILLS: He turns and sees that it's the woman from the film's opening, dressed as HOLLY GOLIGHTLY.
WILLS: Yup, I'd know that throttle anywhere!
MOLLY: Just one more.
CARLA: All right, but this is the last last
CHARLOTTE: All right, but this is the last last
CHARLOTTE: "Because I could not stop for Death, He kindly stopped for me; The carriage held but just ourselves And Immortality. We slowly drove, he knew no haste, And I had put away My labor, and my leisure too, For his civility."
CHARLOTTE: "We passed the school where children At wrestling in a ring; We passed the fields of grazing grain, We passed the setting sun."
CELIA: Sweet dreams?
CHARLOTTE: I had no idea I was so tired.
SARAH: ( from across the room ) They're down?
CHARLOTTE: And out. Where's Lucifer?
JESUS: ( jokingly ) Last time I saw him, he was in the kitchen going pretty heavily with Holly Golightly.
CELIA: Hey, no gossip! Holly's a valued
CHARLOTTE: Lemme at 'er!
JESUS: Hell hath no fury like a recluse
CHARLOTTE: Hey, shouldn't one of your minions be doing that?
JOHN: You know, in my day, you bobbed for the apple, and, sure, maybe there was a nickel inside it and that was sweet but you ate the god damn apple! These little animals grab the coin and they're out the door!
CHARLOTTE: off to buy crack!
JOHN: Exactly my point.
CHARLOTTE: Seen Beelzebub around?
JOHN: The Prince of Darkness?
CHARLOTTE: Yeah, he went upstairs.
JOHN: Yeah, he went upstairs.
CHARLOTTE: She gets to the end of the hall and is about to give up. When she hears FOOTSTEPS. She walks around the corner and sees a NARROW STAIRCASE leading to the third floor. At the dark at the top of the stairs Wills and Wendy appear. Charlotte smiles
CHARLOTTE: You lost your horns.
WILLS: Hey, looking for me?
CHARLOTTE: We were checking out the roof. John's got quite a set-up.
WILLS: We were checking out the roof. John's got quite a set-up.
WILLS: Wendy, this is Charlotte Fielding. Charlotte my friend Wendy Lister.
WENDY: Actually, I saw you at that memorial service in Connecticut. Your eulogy was beautiful.
CHARLOTTE: Thank you.
WENDY: ( re: her outfit ) Betsy Ross, right?
CHARLOTTE: You guessed it.
WILLS: Is the party over?
WILLS: I have a strange feeling that you're upset with me.
CHARLOTTE: No, I was just wondering if you had sex with that woman.
WILLS: No, the answer to that's pretty obvious. I meant tonight. On the
CHARLOTTE: No, the answer to that's pretty obvious. I meant tonight. On the
WILLS: You're not serious.
WILLS: Of course not. Why would I want to do something like that?
CHARLOTTE: That's what I was wondering. I thought, "We're so happy he'd have no reason to do it. And if he did do it, he'd at least look guilty, wouldn't he? But he doesn't. He looks more relaxed than before the party Well, there you have it.
WILLS: Well, there you have it.
CHARLOTTE: But then I thought, "He's a womanizer that's what they say." Funny word, huh? Sounds like some sorta machine. "And how do you get to be a womanizer? Obviously by sleeping with lots of different women for no good reason and being really good at lying about Sure, except that
WILLS: Sure, except that
CHARLOTTE: Let me finish.
CHARLOTTE: Anyway, there's something about being sick right here
CHARLOTTE: that has made me acutely aware of my heart. Nothing corny I mean, literally. I feel every beat. I know how sensitive it is. It reacts to everything.
CHARLOTTE: If you're lying to me, I'll know it. Did you have sex with Wendy on the
CHARLOTTE: My God. oh my God.
WILLS: Look, I never pretended to be anything other than
CHARLOTTE: ( a piteous cry ) You hate yourself so much!
WILLS: This was all a mistake. Right from the start. All of it. I'm a grown man and you're a child. Anyway, you have better things to do with your last With your time than spend it with me.
CHARLOTTE: ( distantly ) What about you? Do you have anything
CHARLOTTE: You know, maybe you're right. Maybe this is the best time to end it. Because I was actually starting to love you, Wills, and that's the last thing I ever wanted.
DOLLY: Well, if it ain't the Belle of
DOLLY: Seen that face before.
CHARLOTTE: You have?
DOLLY: And for the same god damn reason.
CHARLOTTE: But you said Wills and my Mom were just friends.
DOLLY: Sure, but she was nuts about him. The only reason she didn't sleep with him is 'cause she was sentimental. And smart. She wanted a ring first.
CHARLOTTE: Why didn't he give her one?
DOLLY: 'Cause he knocked up little Millie Tyler instead. In Newport. At Bailey's Beach. During the Labor Day clam
DOLLY: Millie was your mom's best friend from Nightingale. You had to hand it to him. He sure knew how to make a Why did he do that?
CHARLOTTE: Why did he do that?
DOLLY: Aw, who the hell knows? 'Cause the moon was full. 'Cause life's short. 'Cause he's Wills Keane. I'll tell you a little secret after that, your Mom hated his guts, but your dad never made her smile like he 'Course your dad never made her cry like that either.
CHARLOTTE: ( softly ) Why didn't you tell me any of this Oh, I dunno.
DOLLY: Oh, I dunno.
CHARLOTTE: You never talk to me! You never try to help me!
DOLLY: Christ, look at me. I'm gonna tell you what to do?
CHARLOTTE: Yes! You're my family. You're supposed to take care of me.
DOLLY: Aw, you wouldn't listen. That's the thing about people they just do what they want from the day they're born till the day they die.
CHARLOTTE: No, that's you, Dolly! People who have given up don't listen to other people! People who want to die close off! That's not me! I wanted your help! I wanted to learn!
CHARLOTTE: Anything. anything you would ever have told me, I would have listened to! I promise.
DOLLY: ( fighting tears ) Aw, come on, honey. I can throw a party and I can mix a gimlet. After that, what the fuck do I know?
PATTY: Oh, Wills, it's beautiful!
WILLS: Thank you. It was designed by a team So functional! Is that stainless Actually, no, it's velvet.
PATTY: So functional! Is that stainless Actually, no, it's velvet.
WILLS: Actually, no, it's velvet.
PATTY: Oh, my God, it is!
WILLS: How are you?
MELISSA: How are you, sir?
PATTY: Well, if the food's even half as good as the moldings I'm in for a very special treat.
JESUS: Uhhh, good evening, Mr. Keane. Will you be dining with us?
WILLS: Yes, Jesus. Table seven, if it's Certainly, sir.
JESUS: Certainly, sir.
WILLS: Hello, Celia.
CELIA: ( sincerely ) How are you this evening, sir?
WILLS: I've been worse.
CELIA: ( under her breath ) Are you sure?
JESUS: Table Seven.
NEW HOSTESS: This way, please.
WILLS: ( to Patty ) Order a drink. I'll be right with
JOHN: Where the hell you been?
WILLS: Splendid, how are you?
JOHN: Where's Charlotte?
WILLS: Deliveries on time?
JOHN: Who's the broad? She looks like a Holiday-Inn hooker from Ohio.
WILLS: Keep up the good work!
CHARLOTTE: Okay, I'm chugging Scotch, gagging on smoke, and losing my hearing! Now why is this so good for me again?!
SIMON: That's just it! The great spiritual benefit in leaving one's room is that it reminds one of how odious it is to leave one's room!
SHANNON: Excuse me! Excuse me! Sorry! Excuse No problem!
BOY'S VOICE: No problem!
SIMON: There's one thing you don't know about Mr. Keane and his adultery and as painful as it is I feel that I should tell you!
CHARLOTTE: ( alarmed ) What? What is it!
SIMON: That woman on the roof? That was no ex-girlfriend! In fact, no woman at all. It was I, Simon Loring, master of disguise! Willsy and I have moved in together! Look what I found!
SHANNON: Look what I found!
CHARLOTTE: Eric! Wow!
ERIC: Hey, Char!
CHARLOTTE: God, long time no see! One night we show up to rent Eraserhead and you're just gone!
ERIC: Sorry about that!
SHANNON: It was such a drag! You know, having to actually start paying to rent I bet!
ERIC: I bet!
CHARLOTTE: What's up? Ralph said you moved to Rockland County!
ERIC: Yeah, I got a job working for my mom's new boyfriend!
CHARLOTTE: What does he do?
ERIC: He sells pot!
SHANNON: Not really. I was a driver! I got laid off when he got busted. He's awaiting trial!
ERIC: Not really. I was a driver! I got laid off when he got busted. He's awaiting trial!
CHARLOTTE: So what're you doing now?
ERIC: Same thing pretty much. Only for
SHANNON: Whoa, I don't believe it! She hasn't laughed in like a week!
PATTY: so everybody on the conference call starts introducing themselves. Ned Lewey, Paris Office. Takashi Matsuo, Tokyo Office. Whoever, the London Office. And then someone says, "Will the architect from the New York office please identify himself." And I pipe up and say, "Well, guys, I'm not a him or an architect. I'm Patty Strauss and I'm head of East Coast marketing." And there's like total silence. It was hysterical! I'm sorry, would you excuse me?
WILLS: I'm sorry, would you excuse me?
PATTY: Of course.
WILLS: Who is it?
JOHN: John slams down the phone, grabs him by the arm, hauls him through the reception area and out the door. Patty watches, EXT. ELYSIUM CONTINUOUS John walks quickly down the block, still hauling Wills
JOHN: Last time I checked I was your best So after the party, no thank you! I call you three times no call back! And for six days you don't even eat at your own god damn restaurant! What am I supposed to think? Huh?! I was ready to call the morgue!
WILLS: So after the party, no thank you! I call you three times no call back! And for six days you don't even eat at your own god damn restaurant! What am I supposed to think? Huh?! I was ready to call the morgue!
JOHN: So after the party, no thank you! I call you three times no call back! And for six days you don't even eat at your own god damn restaurant! What am I supposed to think? Huh?! I was ready to call the morgue!
WILLS: Relax, I'm alive.
JOHN: Well, you sure don't look it!
JOHN: I'll tell you why it's my concern! Because I had a god damn swimming pool! An ocean view! A fabulous lemon tree hangin' right over my Jacuzzi! And I gave it up for you, brother! Back to a life of concrete and dirt and sirens just so you could get your shit together!
JOHN: On my roof? You gotta be kiddin'! Not on my green chair! Tell me it wasn't on the green chair.
JOHN: Oh, great. Now how am I gonna clean Look, it doesn't matter that she's sick she's still a kid and there's no way we should be together. It's unhealthy. it's. it's What the hell is that? Some sorta shrink talk?
WILLS: Look, it doesn't matter that she's sick she's still a kid and there's no way we should be together. It's unhealthy. it's. it's What the hell is that? Some sorta shrink talk?
JOHN: ( with disgust ) What the hell is that? Some sorta shrink talk?
WILLS: Look, if she were just fun. just some sort of diversion. maybe I could justify it. But the worst part is that it's becoming more. Much more. It's embarrassing how much I like her. She gets to me. She affects
WILLS: And she's gonna be gone and. I'm not sure I can. I mean. I already think about her all the time. Her smile kills me. and the thought. that it'll be gone. forever. that I'll never see her again. I don't know. I can't I don't think I'm that strong, Johnny. It's too much. I'd rather have it be over. over now. I'll start missing her now.
JOHN: Buddy, I hate to break it to you, but in the real world. where I live. there're only two kindsa love stories. Boy loses girl and girl loses boy. That's all there is. Somebody always gets left behind. You try to avoid that, you'll end up an old man toastin' yourself with egg nog in the mirror on Christmas Eve. You'll end up dying in your own
PATTY: Thank you so much. I had such a great Good. I'm. I'm glad.
WILLS: Good. I'm. I'm glad.
PATTY: Didn't you?
WILLS: Patty, I. I want to be honest with you. right now, from the start. so there's no room for misunderstanding. I didn't have a good time, but it's nothing personal. I just split up with someone and rather than admit to myself how much I miss her, I asked you out instead. And it's unfair. If I feel sad I should just feel sad and not try to use you. and your body. as some sort of painkiller, right? Anyway, I think you're a warm and engaging woman and I wish you all the best.
MICHAEL: Mr. Keane
WILLS: Good night, Michael.
MICHAEL: You've got a visitor.
WILLS: She's been waitin' almost an hour. In the lobby. A little surprise for ya.
MICHAEL: She's been waitin' almost an hour. In the lobby. A little surprise for ya.
LISA: Sorry to disappoint you.
WILLS: No, no. Not at all. You surprised me, that's all. I didn't expect to see you. not here. not after your letter.
LISA: Well, I didn't expect you to show up at my job.
WILLS: I followed you in. I wasn't even sure it was you. All I have is an old snapshot.
LISA: My boss thought you were a stalker.
WILLS: I didn't mean to run off like that.
LISA: But you did.
LISA: So you got my letter. What'd you do? Freak out? Burn it?
WILLS: I saved it.
LISA: I was just blowing off some steam, okay? I think I have the right.
WILLS: So do I. Look, why don't we go No. I didn't plan to come. Peter. my husband. he agrees. He thinks it's a futile exercise. But it turns out I'm pregnant. Just a few months, Lisa Congratulations. That's
LISA: ( uneasily ) No. I didn't plan to come. Peter. my husband. he agrees. He thinks it's a futile exercise. But it turns out I'm pregnant. Just a few months, Lisa Congratulations. That's
WILLS: Lisa Congratulations. That's
LISA: Thanks. Anyway, I guess it made me want to meet you. I've been a little sentimental about parent-hood.
WILLS: Is that what you consider me?
LISA: In a lousy absentee sorta way, sure. How's your mom?
WILLS: How's your mom?
LISA: Great. Nuts. She moved to Costa Rica last summer.
WILLS: A guy, what else? He owns a charter airline and wears sunglasses indoors. I think he might be a gunrunner.
LISA: A guy, what else? He owns a charter airline and wears sunglasses indoors. I think he might be a gunrunner.
LISA: You know, you're much better looking in person than in photographs. I always assumed Mom was exaggerating, but she wasn't.
WILLS: Thanks. You're not bad looking
LISA: Anyway. I should go.
WILLS: I really just wanted to meet you and. maybe. I don't know.
LISA: I really just wanted to meet you and. maybe. I don't know.
WILLS: ( gently ) What is it? Tell me.
LISA: Nothing earth-shattering. Maybe just to hear you say you were sorry. I am. I'm very sorry. Okay. Thanks.
WILLS: I am. I'm very sorry. Okay. Thanks.
LISA: Okay. Thanks.
WILLS: Can I call you?
LISA: Before. when you came in. who did you think I was?
WILLS: A friend.
LISA: You must like her an awful lot.
CHARLOTTE: Wills wakes with a violent start. When he sees her, he drops his head back. He closes his eyes again and murmurs sleepily
WILLS: Where were you? I was worried.
CHARLOTTE: So worried you fell asleep. What're you doing here?
WILLS: I've missed you. You have no idea how much.
CHARLOTTE: How'd you get in?
WILLS: Dolly. We watched TV. She fell asleep. What time is it?
CHARLOTTE: I didn't know I had a curfew.
WILLS: Where were you?
CHARLOTTE: None of your business. So what is it? What do you want? To tell you that you were right. I do hate myself. But not so much that I can't see how stupid and despicable And cowardly what I did was. And even though there's no excuse for it, I want you to forgive me.
WILLS: To tell you that you were right. I do hate myself. But not so much that I can't see how stupid and despicable And cowardly what I did was. And even though there's no excuse for it, I want you to forgive me.
CHARLOTTE: And cowardly what I did was. And even though there's no excuse for it, I want you to forgive me.
WILLS: And cowardly what I did was. And even though there's no excuse for it, I want you to forgive me.
CHARLOTTE: Why should I?
WILLS: Because, for better or worse, I'm falling in love with you, and the thought of our not being together is unbearable to me.
CHARLOTTE: Let's sleep.
CHARLOTTE: In the morning, we'll talk about what a gigantic asshole you are.
WILLS: So where were you?
CHARLOTTE: With Shannon and Simon and Eric.
WILLS: Who's Eric?
CHARLOTTE: An old friend who used to work at What'd you guys do?
WILLS: What'd you guys do?
CHARLOTTE: Talked and drank. Simon and Shannon finally went home. Eric and I hung
WILLS: Hung out where?
CHARLOTTE: Stop. We'll talk about it tomorrow.
WILLS: He closes his eyes again. A few beats later, they open.
WILLS: Talk about what? Is there something to talk about? What happened?
WILLS: No, honestly, I think I have a right to know.
CHARLOTTE: And I honestly think I have a right not to tell you.
WILLS: You're being unreasonable.
CHARLOTTE: You're being nosy.
WILLS: You know, in this day and age it's not so outrageous a request. I mean, I don't know this kid. I don't know where he's been.
CHARLOTTE: ( laughing incredulously ) You're worried about where he's been? Give me a break!
WILLS: It requires balance and I have lousy balance, okay?
CHARLOTTE: Oh, come on, what's the worst that can happen? Well, I guess you could break a hip.
WILLS: Look, I'm not in a sporting mood!
CHARLOTTE: How come?
WILLS: I'm jealous, okay?! Is that what you want to hear? Are you satisfied now?
CHARLOTTE: Not even close!
WILLS: All I want is a simple answer and you're torturing me! And I resent it! It's cruel and juvenile! And I
CHARLOTTE: ( exploding )
HEY!: Her anger startles him. She skates over quickly and skids to an abrupt stop
CHARLOTTE: It's not! It's adult! It's revenge! And if you think it's bad not knowing what I did well, it's even worse knowing exactly what you did!
CHARLOTTE: Do me a favor, okay? Never ask me again what happened with Eric. Just accept the fact that you'll never, ever know. And if that hurts, then think about it next time you want to cheat on somebody.
WILLS: I wish I were exaggerating, but I'm not. I slept with every one of them. Really. Look through Dolly's old photo albums. or any movie magazine. visit Aspen at Christmas. I was on a mission. And until recently I really didn't think I had a problem. Or if I did, it was definitely the most pleasurable one I could imagine.
CHARLOTTE: What changed?
WILLS: My house in Malibu burned to the
WILLS: I know, it sounds funny. But it must have triggered something because the next thing I knew I couldn't sleep. I'd lie awake at night absolutely terrified. Like a kid left alone in the dark.
CHARLOTTE: What were you scared of?
WILLS: How quickly time was passing and how adolescent I still felt. How meaningless all my choices seemed. How lonely I was. So I liquidated my portfolio, sold my businesses, and moved back here. To start over, settle down, start acting my age. You were supposed to be my one last dalliance with youth.
CHARLOTTE: Well, for your sake, I hope I am.
SARAH: Judge you? Why would I? Screw the age difference I like the new you! Before Charlotte came along, do you have any idea how hard it was to get you to sit down for a Happy Meal?
MOLLY: Uncle Wills, how come you don't get Yeah, how come, Uncle Wills?
JOHN: Yeah, how come, Uncle Wills?
WILLS: I want to, Carla, but
MOLLY: I'm not Carla! I'm Molly!
WILLS: Well, Molly, I just haven't met the right woman yet.
CARLA: What about Charlotte? She's funny- It means funny and pretty. It's their highest compliment.
SARAH: ( aside to Wills ) It means funny and pretty. It's their highest compliment.
WILLS: I agree. She's also demanding.
JOHN: Where're you goin'?
WILLS: She's decided she wants her birthday present today.
JOHN: But that was last month.
WILLS: The Dom didn't count. This is her real present. She chose it herself and it's not material.
JOHN: Now you got me curious.
SARAH: Yeah, what is it?
HARI: Okay. breath of fire. now inhale deeply. hold the breath. let your heart lotus blossom. feel the energy rise. and exhale. Good. Now peacock pose.
WILLS: When does the enlightenment start?
CHARLOTTE: When you realize that I'm God.
HARI: Are you all right?
CHARLOTTE: Yeah. No big deal. Cramp in the old fifth shakra!
WILLS: Don't worry. You're gonna be okay.
CHARLOTTE: It's no big deal. I just hyperventilated. Really.
WILLS: Excuse me. do you have an extra one of those?
LITTLE MAN: ( eyes narrowing ) You a smoker?
WILLS: Not for years.
LITTLE MAN: Well, hell, if I'm gonna be the one to get you goin' again. Don't mention it.
WILLS: LITTLE MAN
LITTLE MAN: Don't mention it.
SIBLEY: The repeat MRI and CAT scan do show interval progression.
WILLS: ( uncertainly ) Which means the tumor's grown?
SIBLEY: Yes. Yes, it has. Considerably. As for her loss of consciousness, one explanation is a disturbance in her heart's electrical function. We'll be monitoring her overnight for any arrhythmias. If we find something, we'll treat it. Unfortunately, the more likely explanation is that the tumor has begun to obstruct the outflow of her heart. If that's the case, there's little we can do. We could be speaking in terms of weeks not months.
SIBLEY: When she returns home, we'll want her to stay active, but don't let her overexert herself. Don't stay long. She's been sedated.
CHARLOTTE: Wills is terribly anxious. His speech is accelerated
WILLS: Are you all right? You're okay? How do you feel?
CHARLOTTE: I'll let you rest. I should. You'll sleep and then
WILLS: I'll let you rest. I should. You'll sleep and then
CHARLOTTE: ( touching his hand )
CHARLOTTE: You still owe me a birthday present.
WILLS: I do not.
CHARLOTTE: Just 'cause I fainted is no excuse for you to bail on your peacock pose. It ought to be illegal.
WILLS: It ought to be illegal.
CHARLOTTE: Your smile. It's too pretty.
WILLS: Your smile. It's too pretty.
CHARLOTTE: I've ruined you for other women.
WILLS: You have.
CHARLOTTE: All part of my master plan. Do you wanna hear a story. a bedtime Shouldn't I be telling you one?
WILLS: Shouldn't I be telling you one?
CHARLOTTE: Once upon a time, there was a woman on a ship crossing the Atlantic and her little boy got sick. Very sick. And she said whoever saves my boy's life. I'll name my next baby after them. Well, they got into port and they rushed her son to St. Vincent's hospital. to here. and they saved his life. And so the mother named her next baby Edna St. Vincent Millay. And Edna grew up to be, as I am sure you know, the second greatest female poet in American history.
WILLS: The first would be Emily Dickinson.
CHARLOTTE: You're a quick learner I like that about you. "It may be, when my heart is dull, Having attained its girth, I shall not find so beautiful The meagre shapes of earth, Nor linger in the rain to mark The small of tansy through the dark."
CHARLOTTE: I am so pretentious. Charlotte, listen, I
WILLS: Charlotte, listen, I
CHARLOTTE: Uh-oh. Heavy, heavy.
WILLS: I just think
CHARLOTTE: No. No violins. I'm fine. Go home.
SHANNON: It just didn't seem real and now that it is, I hate it! It's so unfair!
DOLLY: Fare is what you pay on the train to Jersey. Fair is the place that smells like manure where, if you're real lucky, you win a blue ribbon for your home-made pickles. Fair is a sky without a cloud and a face with a mark. Fare is food. What fair isn't is everything else.
SIMON: Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say that we've heard quite enough from Dolores.
SIMON: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe what you're saying is that while the end may be in sight, it has not yet arrived.
WILLS: That's right. The tumor's begun to interfere with the function of her heart, but she
SIMON: Then why exactly have you called us
SIMON: I cut short a lunch date, Shannon's missing her low-impact aerobics class, and Dolores has delayed the start of her happy hour surely you must have had good reason.
WILLS: I thought Charlotte's health might be of some interest you.
SIMON: It is. You could have told me all about it on the telephone.
WILLS: I also thought it might be a good idea if we discussed ways to make her as comfortable as possible for Charlotte loathes comfortable. I never sought to bore her with comfort while she was well, why should I start now that she's sick?
SIMON: Charlotte loathes comfortable. I never sought to bore her with comfort while she was well, why should I start now that she's sick?
WILLS: Tell me, are you really so cold? Or is it just a pose that you've It's a pose that I've cultivated. I chose it, as a sort of smoke screen, some time after attending my twentieth funeral in as many months. I'm sorry.
SIMON: It's a pose that I've cultivated. I chose it, as a sort of smoke screen, some time after attending my twentieth funeral in as many months. I'm sorry.
WILLS: I'm sorry.
SIMON: It's quite all right. But, honestly, it shocks me how often you people forget. Our phone books have as many numbers crossed out as written in. So that while death is certainly as painful to us as it is to you, we do not find it nearly so. Don't misunderstand me. I adore Charlotte and when she dies, I would. were it not already in that state. cry my heart dry.
WILLS: She's in the hospital now. She doesn't have long. Weeks maybe and She. Anyway, I have something to ask you. A favor. I have no right to ask. I know. I'd do it myself, but I can't. I'm too. I'm.
LISA: What is it?
WILLS: I want you to find a surgeon. Dr. Sibley told me. Charlotte's doctor told me. he said at some point, when it's hopeless, surgery could be an option. Heroic surgery, he called it. I want to make sure that when the time comes a hero is performing that heroic surgery. Do you understand? You'll have to make calls. I'll get names. Sibley will give me I'm sorry to ask you. I have no right. But, you see, she doesn't want it. this surgery. I'll have to convince her. So no one can know. for now. And I trust you. You're my only family and I. You have every right to refuse me. After what I did. You were a child. and you needed me. and I was nowhere to be found. There's no excuse for that. I'm so terribly sorry! I'd be happy to do it.
LISA: I'd be happy to do it.
LISA: Dad, I'm really sorry she's sick.
WILLS: ( almost inaudible ) I am, too. So sorry. I should be the one. It should be me.
CHARLOTTE: You never talk about my mother. Talk about her.
WILLS: What do you want to know?
CHARLOTTE: Everything. All I remember is that she smelled like vanilla, loved to read to me, and was really good at cutting up fruit. I couldn't believe she didn't cut her fingers off.
WILLS: Well, I remember a little more than that. Let's see. she was blonde. about your height
CHARLOTTE: I've seen pictures, dummy.
WILLS: Oh, okay. She. always ate her ice cream with a fork how's that?
CHARLOTTE: Much better.
WILLS: And she wrote great letters, but couldn't spell at all.
CHARLOTTE: Neither can I.
WILLS: She was a McGovern Democrat but also an incredible snob. She loved blueberries. She had the world's worst backhand. Her favorite singer was Stephen Stills.
CHARLOTTE: Never mind. She was afraid of sharks. And, considering the times, she was pretty square. She only tried drugs once a lifeguard gave her a hash brownie and she threw it up all over
WILLS: Never mind. She was afraid of sharks. And, considering the times, she was pretty square. She only tried drugs once a lifeguard gave her a hash brownie and she threw it up all over
WILLS: And she laughed just like that. And she bit her fingernails. And she couldn't tell a joke. In short, she was a unique.
CHARLOTTE: Did you know she was in love with She told me.
WILLS: She told me.
CHARLOTTE: Were you in love with her?
WILLS: Why? Because she was the only girl in Rhode Island who wouldn't sleep with you?
CHARLOTTE: Why? Because she was the only girl in Rhode Island who wouldn't sleep with you?
WILLS: That's how she got my attention; it's not why I fell in love with I fell in love with her because she charmed me senseless day and night for an entire summer.
CHARLOTTE: Then why did you screw her best friend on Labor Day?
CHARLOTTE: It's just a question.
WILLS: I have no idea. The summer was over. Your mom was going back to Smith. I was moving down here to work on Wall Street. It was our last day together. She was crying. She told me, for the first time, that she loved me. I said I loved her, too. I promised to call and visit. A few hours later I was in a cabana with Millie. When Millie told me she was pregnant and that she wanted to marry me, I escaped to L.A. and I never saw her or your mom again.
CHARLOTTE: ( wryly ) Well done.
WILLS: I think it's part of the reason I never came back.
CHARLOTTE: But why're you like that? What is it? I mean, you weren't born that I might as well have been. For as long as I can remember, I've always run off at the first sign of a woman wanting anything from me. relying on me in any way.
WILLS: I might as well have been. For as long as I can remember, I've always run off at the first sign of a woman wanting anything from me. relying on me in any way.
CHARLOTTE: But I want everything from you, Wills. I rely on you in every way.
WILLS: I know.
CHARLOTTE: So the only reason you don't dump me is because I'm sick? Because you know that it's all going to be over, Maybe. But it doesn't feel that way. It feels as though I'm not afraid
WILLS: Maybe. But it doesn't feel that way. It feels as though I'm not afraid
WILLS: Driver! Quick! Pull over here! Right
CHARLOTTE: I didn't know you could sing!
WILLS: I didn't know you couldn't!
CHOIRMASTER: Well, you all know what time it is!
CHARLOTTE: ( confused to Wills ) No, I don't. Do you?
CHOIRMASTER: HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
HAPPY HOLIDAYS!: As another carol begins, Wills wraps his arms around Charlotte and kisses her. He pulls away, looks deeply into her eyes, and whispers with passionate sincerity
WILLS: I love you, Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE: You call that a rose? It looks more like a hand grenade!
HENRY: Mr. Keane, you get her outta here or, I swear to God, I'm gonna butterfly and stuff her!
WILLS: I'll add it to the specials list.
CHARLOTTE: ( laughing ) No way! I'm too pricey!
CHARLOTTE: Hello, Sunshine!
JOHN: You seen Celia?
WILLS: What's the matter?
JOHN: The matter is I got a half-hour wait and no help up front! You got a call on Two!
WILLS: Wills Keane.
LISA: I've got him!
GRANDY: Listen, I'm not gonna bullshit you. If she were a baby, she'd have a decent chance, 'cause these sorts of tumors can regress like crazy, but she's twenty and. I don't know, man. I've never seen anything like I mean, look! It's wrapped around her vital structures like an octopus! You know, just once I'd like to get sent something simple. A "cabbage," a valve replacement. Even a good old- fashioned transplant. But it doesn't happen anymore. It's the downside of being good at my job.
WILLS: Good? They say there's no one better.
GRANDY: I don't know. I'm like most people. I do the best I can.
WILLS: Can your best save her?
GRANDY: Probably not.
GRANDY: In these sorts of cases, it's best if she signs a consent.
WILLS: ( covering ) No problem.
GRANDY: ( stopping at the main entrance ) The last time Charlotte passed out, she regained consciousness almost immediately. The next time or the time after, she won't. When that happens, call me. ( handing him a card ) Here's my service. They'll reach me no matter where I am. In the meantime, I'll coordinate with Dr. Sibley.
WILLS: I can't thank you enough.
GRANDY: I haven't done anything yet.
CHARLOTTE: By the way where were you today?
WILLS: What do you mean?
CHARLOTTE: When you called I assumed you were at the restaurant, but when I called back later, Jesus said you hadn't been in all day.
WILLS: I was in Montclair, New Jersey.
CHARLOTTE: ( playfully vague ) An opportunity.
WILLS: ( playfully vague ) An opportunity.
CHARLOTTE: Oh, really? Sexual or professional?
WILLS: I was considering opening a restaurant. But the rents are too
CHARLOTTE: Hey! How do you feel about Christmas?
WILLS: ( sleepily ) Bah humbug.
MICHAEL: Will you and Mister Keane be goin' away for the holidays?
CHARLOTTE: I doubt it.
MICHAEL: I've seen so little of America. I don't care for airplanes, you see, and I have so little time to travel. Did Mister Keane enjoy his trip then?
CHARLOTTE: What trip?
MICHAEL: Why, just yesterday.
CHARLOTTE: I wouldn't really call that a trip.
MICHAEL: Perhaps not. But I've never been to Ohio myself. They say parts of it are quite lovely.
MICHAEL: ( calling out ) All right, you little hellions! Get in here!
WILLS: Then he sees her grave expression and freezes.
CHARLOTTE: I thought we had a deal.
WILLS: I'm sure we do. About what?
CHARLOTTE: ( beat ) You were in Ohio yesterday. I met with a heart specialist. He's willing to operate.
WILLS: I met with a heart specialist. He's willing to operate.
CHARLOTTE: But you know I don't want that! You know I've signed papers that
WILLS: Well, maybe I want it.
CHARLOTTE: It isn't your decision!
WILLS: Of course not, but if you'll hear me No! I told you right from the start how I felt and you went behind my back! You lied and
CHARLOTTE: No! I told you right from the start how I felt and you went behind my back! You lied and
WILLS: ( exploding ) Oh, Christ, knock it off! You're such a god damn saint, so above it all, but you're scared to death! You do want to live! And if you were as honest as you say you are you'd let the doctors do whatever they can to help you! I won't give people hope when there isn't any.
CHARLOTTE: I won't give people hope when there isn't any.
WILLS: Why not?! Maybe we want hope! Or maybe we just need to know that we did everything we could! Maybe I need to know that. if I'm going to be able to live. to go on without.
CHARLOTTE: Now I know why you hurt so many women. Because you always knew if you held on to one of them, you'd never let
CHARLOTTE: When we met, I was so lonely. But I didn't even know it. I'd been alone so long.. almost forever.
WILLS: So had I.
CHARLOTTE: But now we have each other. Oh, what would I do, Wills? What would I do if you weren't here? Where would I be?
WILLS: You don't ever have to worry about I'll do whatever I have to! I'll tear up the papers! Whatever you want! Tell the doctor! Because. I really do want. I don't want to leave you!
CHARLOTTE: I'll do whatever I have to! I'll tear up the papers! Whatever you want! Tell the doctor! Because. I really do want. I don't want to leave you!
CHARLOTTE: She waits, hears hurried steps, then Wills sticks his head
WILLS: How long was I asleep?
CHARLOTTE: How long was I asleep?
WILLS: A couple of hours.
CHARLOTTE: Wow. And I'm still tired.
WILLS: That's all right. Relax.
CHARLOTTE: What're you doing in there?
WILLS: She laughs and starts to get up
CHARLOTTE: Don't! Don't move! Just one more
WILLS: Don't! Don't move! Just one more
CHARLOTTE'S VOICE: ( from the bedroom ) What're you doing?!
CHARLOTTE'S VOICE: Oh no! You didn't!
WILLS: You were just going to tire yourself
CHARLOTTE'S VOICE: This I've gotta see!
WILLS: Just hold on!
WILLS: Finishing touches!
WILLS: He runs back to the bedroom door and flings it open.
WILLS: He looks into the room and freezes in the doorway. He backs up a step, then, crying out, lunges into the room.
WILLS: Time cannot break the bird's wing from the bird. Bird and wing together Go down, one feather. No thing that ever flew, not the lark, not you, Can die as others do.
CHARLOTTE: What have I done to you?
WILLS: Ruined me for other women.
CHARLOTTE: No. I saved you for them. Is she type 'n' cross for six units?!
MALE VOICE: Is she type 'n' cross for six units?!
NURSE'S VOICE: Yes, Doctor.
GRANDY: What're we waiting for?
GRANDY: Then let's move!
WILLS: It happened so quickly. We'd just talked about the surgery. She agreed to it. But I thought there'd be time.
SIMON: I've had friends who weren't expected to last till morning who lived another seven years. Another ran a marathon and died the next weekend. It's all so terribly random the way life actually works. I take nothing for
WILLS: You know, it's funny, the first time I saw her, I
LISA: Actually, to be honest, Peter's more than a little freaked. I mean, how could he not be? He's twenty-six. His first child. A baby girl, no less. Nothing really prepares you for it.
WILLS: I guess not.
LISA: He said it's the first time since we got married that he's actually realized what marriage is. That it's forever. That he can't just pick up and run away to Nepal or something if we have a fight. That he's part of the cycle of things now. That he's gonna die some day. That it's the next generation's turn to take the stage.
LISA: So what about you, Mr. Keane? You ready to be a grandpa?
