WOODWARD: No, no trouble, Harry, be right down. Son of a bitch.
ROSENFELD: Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
WOODWARD: You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarterstell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
ROSENFELD: As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly. Except ( a ) it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters and ( b ) these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
WOODWARD: Preliminary hearing at Superior Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
ROSENFELD: ( nods ) Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
WOODWARD: ( to the COUNSEL'S
CLERK ): Could you give me the names of the lawyers for the men arrested in the These two were appointed only now it turns out the burglars got their own counsel.
CLERK: These two were appointed only now it turns out the burglars got their own counsel.
WOODWARD: Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case
CADDY: I'm not here.
WOODWARD: ( nods )
WOODWARD: Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
CADDY: ( impatiently ) Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of ( indicating unshaven man ) Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to
WOODWARD: ( moving in behind him ) Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
CADDY: Look, I told you inside
WOODWARD: you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
WOODWARD: What I don't understand is how you got here.
CADDY: I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
WOODWARD: Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
CADDY: Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counselthey never even made a phone call. So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
WOODWARD: Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counselthey never even made a phone call. So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
WOODWARD: Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
CADDY: ( turning ) There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
WOODWARD: Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
CADDY: ( turning back ) They are not my clients.
WOODWARD: You're a lawyer and you're here
CADDY: I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once I have nothing more to say.
WOODWARD: ( leaning forward as CADDY turns away again ) A Miami social occasion? ( explaining ) Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
CADDY: ( sighing ) Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
WOODWARD: It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
CADDY: Are you implying you don't believe I have nothing more to say.
WOODWARD: I have nothing more to say.
CADDY: You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
WOODWARD: And on that word
JUDGE: Will you please state your
BARKER: ( perplexed ) That, sir, is not your average
JUDGE: ( perplexed ) That, sir, is not your average
JUDGE: Your name, please.
MCCORD: James McCord.
JUDGE: Will you step forward, sir.
JUDGE: And what is your occupation, Mr. Security consultant.
MCCORD: ( softly ) Security consultant.
JUDGE: ( softer ) Government. Recently retired.
MCCORD: ( softer ) Government. Recently retired.
JUDGE: Where in government?
MCCORD: ( we can't really make this out ) .Central. Intelligence. ( he can't either ) ( clearing his throat ) The C.I.A.
JUDGE: ( he can't either ) ( clearing his throat ) The C.I.A.
MCCORD: ( clearing his throat ) The C.I.A.
WOODWARD: ( stunned ) Holy shit.
BACHINSKI: You said I could look at it
COP: I said look, not memorize
BACHINSKI: almost done, give it a rest, all
WOODWARD: ( reaches for a notebook ) What?hold it ( gets it open, starts to write ) OK, go on, go on.
ROSENFELD: .go on, go on.
WOODWARD: That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
ROSENFELD: Don't know; who the hell's Howard It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy
SIMONS: Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thingabsolute page one stuff
ROSENFELD: Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thingabsolute page one stuff
SIMONS: in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
ROSENFELD: ( shrugs ) Could develop.
SIMONS: Let me see what you get, but don't jumpThe New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
ROSENFELD: OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
WOODWARD: I did all right on McCord.
ROSENFELD: Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
WOODWARD: ( getting it straight ) The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
ROSENFELD: ( hasn't the foggiest ) Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing. ( reads ) ".This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
WOODWARD: ( getting up ) You can't believe that.
ROSENFELD: As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell.
ROSENFELD: What'd you get on W.House?
WOODWARD: ( massaging his neck ) Lotsa hints
ROSENFELD: ( not happy ) I can't sell hints to Simons ( stops, looks at piece of yellow paper ) you called everyone you know? ( WOODWARD makes a nod ) Call someone you don't know.
WOODWARD: ( casually ) Howard Hunt, please.
WOODWARD: Thanks, anyway
WOODWARD: ( a little more excited ) Howard Hunt, please.
WOODWARD: Thanks, anyway.
WOODWARD: Listen, forget it.
WOODWARD: Who's Charles Colson?
ROSENFELD: ( stops dead ) I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
WOODWARD: Who's Colson, Harry?
ROSENFELD: The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
ROSENFELD: The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special Thanks, Harry. Know anything about Colson?
WOODWARD: ( rising ) Thanks, Harry. ( looks at ROSENFELD ) Know anything about Colson?
ROSENFELD: Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."
WOODWARD: Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and. Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt? He is?
WOODWARD: Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and
WOODWARD: I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
WOODWARD: I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Bennett, but we're doing some investigating of one of your employees, Howard Well, if you've been doing some investigating then obviously it's no secret to you that Howard was with the C.I.A.
WOODWARD: ( he hadn't known ) No secret at all.
WOODWARD: ( tired, voice deeper ) Hello, C.I.A. This is R.W. Woodward, of the Washington Postget me
WOODWARD: Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Postandwhat's that?you've never heard of me?I can't help thatyou don't believe I'm with the Post? what do you want me to do, Madam, shout "extraextra"?
ROSENFELD: Whaddya got, whaddya got?
WOODWARD: Hunt is Colson's man that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel they both went to Brown University Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
SIMONS: What else have you got?
WOODWARD: According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me. "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National
SIMONS: Isn't that what you'd expect them to I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
WOODWARD: ( he's got something and he knows it ) I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
ROSENFELD: ( he's got something and he knows it ) I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
WOODWARD: ( he's got something and he knows it ) I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
ROSENFELD: ( to SIMONS ) I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
SIMONS: ( nods ) Just be careful how you write it.
WOODWARD: Here's the first take
WOODWARD: This is all of it, Harry.
WOODWARD: We have to talk.
WOODWARD: What the hell were you doing rewriting my story
BERNSTEIN: I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?
WOODWARD: it was fine the way it was
BERNSTEIN: it was bullshit the way it was
WOODWARD: I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?
BERNSTEIN: ( a sore subject ) what have you been here, nine months?I been in this business since I was sixteen
WOODWARD: and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sureby the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau
BERNSTEIN: you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale
WOODWARD: Bradlee went to Harvard
BERNSTEIN: they're all the same, all those Ivy League placesthey teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're I'm smart enough to know my story was solid
WOODWARD: I'm smart enough to know my story was solid
BERNSTEIN: mine's better
WOODWARD: no way
BERNSTEIN: ( handing them over ) read 'em both and you'll see
WOODWARD: And he sinks down in a chair.
BERNSTEIN: Is mine better?
WOODWARD: ( handing the stories back ) What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
BERNSTEIN: ( as he exits ) Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
BERNSTEIN: ( turns ) ( pushing his chair briefly into view ) Fuck you, Carl.
WOODWARD: ( pushing his chair briefly into view ) Fuck you, Carl.
BERNSTEIN: You heard? They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
WOODWARD: It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a Forget it, the main thing did you call me a failure?
BERNSTEIN: Forget it, the main thing did you call me a failure?
WOODWARD: I was sure trying.
WOODWARD: All right, what do we know?
BERNSTEIN: Let me lay a little theory on you
WOODWARD: ( cutting him off ) I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
BERNSTEIN: Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
WOODWARD: And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention. The Times has got to be full of it it can't be crazy Cubans.
BERNSTEIN: What, though? It can't be the Republicanshe'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
WOODWARD: Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb listen, that was a Watergate
NIXON: The White House has had no involvement whatever in this particular incident.
WOODWARD: What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
BERNSTEIN: What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
WOODWARD: What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
BERNSTEIN: ( sits, shakes his head ) I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
RINGLE: What do you need?
BERNSTEIN: Someone inside the White House would be nice.
RINGLE: ( writes down phone number ) Call her. She worked for Colson, if that's any help.
GIRL: Kenny's crazy, I never worked for Colson, I worked for an assistant. Colson was big on secrets anyway. Even if I had worked for him, I wouldn't have known anything.
BERNSTEIN: Nothing at all you can remember?
SECRETARY: ( headshake ) ( pause ) Now if it was Hunt you were interested Howard Hunt?
BERNSTEIN: Howard Hunt?
SECRETARY: Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
BERNSTEIN: Any idea what he did?
SECRETARY: Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy
BERNSTEIN: Teddy Kennedy?
SECRETARY: Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and
BERNSTEIN: White House Library, please.
BERNSTEIN: Hi. Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post. I was just wondering if you remember the names of any of the books that Howard Hunt checked out on Senator Kennedy.
BERNSTEIN: what do you think?
WOODWARD: Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary Maybe a political operative of some a spy, you mean?
BERNSTEIN: Maybe a political operative of some a spy, you mean?
WOODWARD: a spy, you mean?
BERNSTEIN: It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
BERNSTEIN: Yes, ma'am.
LIBRARIAN: You want all the material requested by the White House?
LIBRARIAN: All White House transactions are
WOODWARD: You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
BERNSTEIN: We need a sympathetic face.
YOUNG CLERK: You want every request since when?
BERNSTEIN: ( to WOODWARD ) When did Hunt start at the White July of '71.
WOODWARD: July of '71.
BERNSTEIN: About the past year.
CLERK: ( starts to smile ) I'm not sure you want 'em, but I got I can't believe you guys are actually doing this.
CLERK: I can't believe you guys are actually doing this.
WOODWARD: ( to the clerk ) You do a lot of things when you're on a story. ( to BERNSTEIN, quietly ) Can you believe we're actually doing ( BERNSTEIN can't )
BERNSTEIN: That was fun. What now?
WOODWARD: I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
BERNSTEIN: ( stunned ) And you haven't called him?
ROSENFELD: reading an article by BERNSTEIN's desk. WOODWARD sits on an adjacent desk.
ROSENFELD: ( to BERNSTEIN ) You got accurate notes on the White House librarian? ( BERNSTEIN nods ) OK, we'll leave space for the White House denial and we should be set.
ROSENFELD: Benjy, we got a present for you. Above the fold on page one for sure. It may not change our lives one way or the other. Just a good, solid piece of American Journalism that The New York Times doesn't
BRADLEE: You haven't got it. A librarian and a secretary say Hunt looked at a book. Not good enough.
WOODWARD: I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
BRADLEE: How senior?
WOODWARD: ( edgy ) You asking me to disclose my source? Just tell me his title.
BRADLEE: Just tell me his title.
WOODWARD: I don't know titles.
BRADLEE: Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
BRADLEE: Get some harder information next
DEEP THROAT: I saw the flag signalwhat's up?
WOODWARD: Nothing, that's the problemthe story's gone underground.
DEEP THROAT: You thought I'd help out on specifics? I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all. Are you guys really working? How much?
WOODWARD: I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a daywe've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
DEEP THROAT: Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
WOODWARD: If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
DEEP THROAT: Because the press stinks toohistory on the run, that's all you're interested in. You come up with anything?
WOODWARD: John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth. Howard Hunt's been foundthere was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
DEEP THROAT: Follow the money. Always follow the To where?
WOODWARD: To where?
DEEP THROAT: ( shakes his head "no" ) Go on.
WOODWARD: This man Gordon Liddyhe's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglarswe know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
DEEP THROAT: ( lights a new cigarette ) You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
WOODWARD: I did everything you said, but it all seemed
DEEP THROAT: ( headshakes ) Things are past thatremember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge What's the whole thing aboutdo you What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
WOODWARD: What's the whole thing aboutdo you What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
DEEP THROAT: What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
WOODWARD: Liddyyou think there's a chance he'll talk?
DEEP THROAT: Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, "What's the trick?" And he replied. "The trick is not minding."
BERNSTEIN: What's that?
WOODWARD: The fucking New York Times.
BERNSTEIN: I'm trying
WOODWARD: I'm trying
BERNSTEIN: I'm trying
WOODWARD: fifteen phone calls
BERNSTEIN: -fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP
WOODWARD: Why didn't we get that?
BERNSTEIN: Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company
WOODWARD: you do?with access to records?
BERNSTEIN: Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
IRWIN: 'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore I think the place is bugged.
BERNSTEIN: ( taking some peanuts ) So tell me about the Times article.
IRWIN: What do you want to know?
BERNSTEIN: No games, Irwin; give.
IRWIN: ( looks at BERNSTEIN ) My big civil rights buddy ( shakes his head ) boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be ( eats ) What're you onto?
BERNSTEIN: Something maybe big.
IRWIN: And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
BERNSTEIN: Just tell me about the goddamn It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for youall Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
IRWIN: ( shelling away ) It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for youall Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
BERNSTEIN: Who by?
IRWIN: A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.
BERNSTEIN: Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like thisyou know that, don't you?
IRWIN: Don't give me any more of your liberal shit, OK, Carl?
ROSENFELD: at the water fountain on the 5th floor. He chews up a few Maalox tablets, notices BERNSTEIN steaming up.
BERNSTEIN: Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker
ROSENFELD: I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
BERNSTEIN: I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
ROSENFELD: I'm the one sent you to Toronto, that was awhile ago
BERNSTEIN: ( trying to head him off ) that was awhile ago
ROSENFELD: "I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of I'm still waiting for it.
BERNSTEIN: Down to Miami and backhow much damage can I do?
ROSENFELD: You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the
ROSENFELD: I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein." I want to send a reporter to Miami.
SIMONS: Anyone but Bernstein.
ROSENFELD: remember Toronto, Harry.
SIMONS: remember Toronto, Harry.
ROSENFELD: That was awhile ago.
SIMONS: I don't get ityou were the one who wanted to fire him.
ROSENFELD: I know, I did, but damnit Howard For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping.
BERNSTEIN: ( answering ) ( pause ) Yes, this is Carl Bernstein. ( stunned ) You're repossessing my bicycle? ( softer ) Listen, I'm sure I paid this month's installment, so why don't you check your records before you go around hassling people? ( pause )
BERNSTEIN: Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
HANNAH: ( glancing around the chaos ) Where are your bills, Carl?
BERNSTEIN: Oh, they're here. I'm keeping much better records now,
HANNAH: ( looks inside ) Carl, it's a jungle. ( sits at his desk, takes out a mass of papersglancing at the top bill ) I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles. ( studies another bill ) You'd give a stranger the shirt off your backexcept it wouldn't be paid for.
BERNSTEIN: Hey. very tense.
HANNAH: ( nods ) Lot of pressure at the Star. ( looking at the bills ) Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this. ( sighs ) How much did the damn bike cost?
BERNSTEIN: Five hundred; six maybe.
HANNAH: ( looking at paper ) You're two months behindyou got enough to cover?
BERNSTEIN: I think.
HANNAH: Give me your checkbook then.
BERNSTEIN: It's right under that pile.
HANNAH: I thought you had to get to Miami.
BERNSTEIN: There's always a later plane.
HANNAH: You're a sex junkie, you know that, Nobody's perfect. I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
BERNSTEIN: Nobody's perfect. I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
HANNAH: Aw baby, you can get it up. I just wonder if you'll ever be able to get it together.
BERNSTEIN: seated perspiring on a hard bench in a stifling office. Outside: palm trees; we're in Miami. And judging from the number of cigarette butts strewn around the bench, BERNSTEIN's been there a while. Waiting. Nervous. And maybe he never will be able to get it together, who knows. At the front, a SECRETARY sits filing her nails. Behind her are a number of closed doors to offices. No one passes without her OK. The clock hits three in the afternoon as BERNSTEIN gets up from the bench, goes to the SECRETARY.
BERNSTEIN: Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
SECRETARY: ( couldn't be nicer ) I'm so glad.
BERNSTEIN: I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
SECRETARY: And you will. But not now.
BERNSTEIN: I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
SECRETARY: I told you, he had to go out on a
UNIFORMED COP: Is it OK to go on back?
BERNSTEIN: Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car He is not in the car.
SECRETARY: He is not in the car.
SECOND COP: Hey, babe.
THE SECRETARY: finishing her manicure. It is almost five o'clock now. BERNSTEIN, his bench a sea of cigarette butts, slowly gets up and goes to the SECRETARY.
BERNSTEIN: Mr. Dardis does call in every so Well of course.
SECRETARY: Well of course.
BERNSTEIN: ( quietly ) Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him
BERNSTEIN: Mr. Dardis' office, please.
SECRETARY: Mr. Dardis' office.
BERNSTEIN: This is Mr. Tomlinson in the clerk's office. Could you come across the hall for a moment? We've got some documents your boss probably should
BERNSTEIN: Carl Bernstein's here to see youI don't know why, but he seems angry
BERNSTEIN: ( to DARDIS ) Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to melike the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Timesjust say so.
DARDIS: Listen, I've got a dinnercan't we do this tomorrow?
BERNSTEIN: ( headshake ) I'm on deadline.
DARDIS: You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
BERNSTEIN: He hands BERNSTEIN some papers, glances at his watch.
DARDIS: I'll never get out of here in time.
BERNSTEIN: ( flying through what he's been handed ) The telephone calls. we know about The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks
DARDIS: The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks
BERNSTEIN: yeah, that was in The Times this
BERNSTEIN: ( continuing stops ) What's this Dahlberg check?
DARDIS' VOICE: That the twenty-five grand one? Don't know
DARDIS: I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was. Think it might be anything?
BERNSTEIN: ( casually ) ( shrugs )
BERNSTEIN: WoodwardWoodward, listen, I don't know what I got and I think the Times has it too but somewhere there's a Kenneth H. Dahlberg in this world and we've gotta find him
RESEARCHER: Were you after the Dahlberg articles from the files? There aren't any, sorry.
WOODWARD: ( shrugs ) Our Dahlberg file.
RESEARCHER: ( shrugs ) Our Dahlberg file.
ROSENFELD: Woodward's talking to him know.
WOODWARD: this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in and I was kind of curious about your check.
WOODWARD: The twenty-five thousand dollar one. The one with your name on it. In Bernard Barker's Florida account. Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar
WOODWARD: Yes, sir.
WOODWARD: I see. And how do you think it reached I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
WOODWARD: ( trying to keep his voice level ) That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
ROSENFELD: CREEP financed the Watergate break- in, Jesus Christ.
WOODWARD: One sec'
THE TRIANGLE: being rung like crazy. And as it SOUNDS
SIMONS: OK, last go-round. Foreign, anything
SIMONS: ( to another editor ) I'll stand with the Eagleton follow- ups and McGovern not being able to get a replacementthat's your page one stuff right there, Howard
NATIONAL EDITOR: I'll stand with the Eagleton follow- ups and McGovern not being able to get a replacementthat's your page one stuff right there, Howard
SIMONS: you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions
ROSENFELD: you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions
NATIONAL EDITOR: nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions
ROSENFELD: ( to NATIONAL EDITOR ) quit equivocating, say what you ( to SIMONS and BRADLEE ) our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances
BRADLEE: and we printed that, didn't we, Harry? And when the frigging audit's done, we'll print that too
NATIONAL EDITOR: let me tell what happened when I was having lunch today at the Sans correctionwhen you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
ROSENFELD: correctionwhen you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
NATIONAL EDITOR: this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
ROSENFELD: Ask him what he's really sayinghe means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk
NATIONAL EDITOR: well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?
ROSENFELD: absolutelyand that's all they do, sit sit sitevery once in a while, they call up a Senator, some well, what if your boys get it Then it's our asses, isn't it?
NATIONAL EDITOR: well, what if your boys get it Then it's our asses, isn't it?
BRADLEE: ( after a beat ) Then it's our asses, isn't it?
SIMONS: ( indicates the meeting is over ) And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
FOREIGN EDITOR: I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story. I don't think we should cover the story, period.
BRADLEE: Go on.
FOREIGN EDITOR: It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
SIMONS: What then?
FOREIGN EDITOR: I don't believe the goddamn story, Howard, it doesn't make sense.
BRADLEE: It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
FOREIGN EDITOR: Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
FOREIGN EDITOR: Lookwhy would the Republicans do it? my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyesjust like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em. Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCordthe only direct contact to the Republicans?
BRADLEE: You saying the Democrats bugged The FBI thinks it's possiblethe Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one. Get off the story, Benor put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.

UNION GUY: ( to another UNION GUY who's reading over his shoulder ) What'd'ya think?
UNION GUY: ( he's not so sure ) Big fuckin' cookie jar.
BERNSTEIN: ( sits across ) This is practically a high school reunion for us, JaneI would have sprung for a classier place.
JANE: Anyplace really public, they'd know about itthey know everything at the Committee, Carl
BERNSTEIN: you don't really think you're being This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
JANE: This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
BERNSTEIN: FBI too?
JANE: You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazyyou had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machineand when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
BERNSTEIN: If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
JANE: I don't know what they'd do to me.
BERNSTEIN: ( reaching over ) Hey, easy.
JANE: ( headshake ) We're a long way from high school, ( she looks at him ) .and I'm scared.
BERNSTEIN: riding home on his bicycle. He gets to his building, starts lugging it up when
BERNSTEIN: ( moving toward her voice ) I can help if you'll
CLERK: We have no one by the name of Mitchell My mistake, sorry.
WOODWARD: My mistake, sorry.
WOODWARD: Get me John Mitchell, it's urgent.
WOODWARD: Can I speak to Martha Mitchell, Who is this?
WOODWARD: I've met Mrs. Mitchell in Washington, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and tell her
FIRST MAID: We'll be back after lunch.
BLACK MAN: ( it's the voice from the phone ) We'll be here.
SECOND MAID: I think they went out.
WOODWARD: ( shrugs ) I don't mind waiting.
BERNSTEIN: ( as WOODWARD reaches him ) See her? ( WOODWARD nods ) Get anything?
WOODWARD: For the paper, no; for us, plenty. I waited a long time and finally this big guyI guess a bodyguard he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
BERNSTEIN: ( looks at BERNSTEIN ) she was panicked, Carlevery time I mentioned Watergate, you could Were you eyebrow reading?
WOODWARD: ( looks at BERNSTEIN ) she was panicked, Carlevery time I mentioned Watergate, you could Were you eyebrow reading?
BERNSTEIN: Were you eyebrow reading?
WOODWARD: ( shakes his head "no" ) It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of.?
BERNSTEIN: Left up ahead.
WOODWARD: Who's first?
BERNSTEIN: Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
BERNSTEIN: Now hang your second right this was my turf when I was a kid.
BERNSTEIN: I don't get it. this really was my You're not a kid anymore.
WOODWARD: ( concentrating on the map ) You're not a kid anymore.
BERNSTEIN: ( shaking his head ) My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suitit was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow." ( WOODWARD is getting interested in the story now ) And I said, "Am I supposed to do that?" and he said, "Absolutely, it's crucial." So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" And I said, "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon ( BERNSTEIN looks at
WOODWARD ): Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's
WOODWARD: Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
WOODWARD: No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- The what to what?
WOODWARD: You work there, Miss Abbott.
WOODWARD: Miss Abbott?
MISS ABBOTT: We're from the Washington Post and we wanted to ask you some questions about the Committee.
WOODWARD: We're from the Washington Post and we wanted to ask you some questions about the Committee.
MISS ABBOTT: I'm sorry
OLD MAN: goyou've got to go before they see youplease
OLD WOMAN: no. good.
BERNSTEIN: You had the Mighty Mo and the fries without gravy, right? This is terrific work, if you like I never scared anyone before.
WOODWARD: This is terrific work, if you like I never scared anyone before.
BERNSTEIN: I never scared anyone before.
WOODWARD: It's not us, they were scared before we got there. What do we know?
BERNSTEIN: Facts or theory?
WOODWARD: Anything you've got.
BERNSTEIN: We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
WOODWARD: And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglarsthose indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
BERNSTEIN: I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
WOODWARD: A friend at the Committee told us to contact you
WOMAN: who was it?
BERNSTEIN: We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
WOODWARD: It's safe, try it, you'll see. We understand your problem
BERNSTEIN: We understand your problem
WOODWARD: you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything We appreciate your positionreally.
BERNSTEIN: We appreciate your positionreally.
WOMAN: You peopleyou think that you can come into someone's life, squeeze what you want, then get out. You don't appreciate a goddamn thing, And you don't understand nothing. But the Committee's briefed us on youso get the hell out of here do you like scaring the life out of decent people?'cause if you don't, in the name of Godstop it!
WOODWARD: At Yale once, they held an auction. There was this woman and her name was Lulu Landis. Her postcards came up for sale. She had 1400 postcards written to her and I'd never heard of her before but I knew I had to have those cards, I had to know why anyone would get so many messages. I paid sixty-five dollars for them. I got all crazy trying to work it out and first it was just a maze but then I found that her husband killed himself in Dayton, and once I had that, it all began to open, an evangelist had come to Dayton and his horses hit Lulu Landis at the corner of 13th and Vermillion and she was paralyzed. Permanently, and her favorite thing til then had been traveling and all her friends, whenever they went anyplace, they wrote her. Those cards, they were her eyes.
WOODWARD: MIDDLE-AGED MAN
BERNSTEIN: I hate both parties.
WOODWARD: And I'm a Republican.
BERNSTEIN: ( surprised, turns to
WOODWARD ): Who'd you vote for?
WOODWARD: Who'd you vote for?
BERNSTEIN: Who'd you vote for?
WOODWARD: BERNSTEIN stares at him in silence as we
BERNSTEIN: BERNSTEIN stares at him in silence as we
WOODWARD: BERNSTEIN stares at him in silence as we
YOUNGER MAN: oh, don't worry, Gordon Liddy will be happy to take the fall for everyone because, well, it's not that Gordon's crazy, he's. .weird. I'll give you some Committee people who know about himonly don't tell it was me
YOUNGER WOMAN: of course we were briefed on what to sayand never to volunteer oh, we were never alone with the FBI, there was always someone from the Committee right there
OLD WOMAN: oh, we were never alone with the FBI, there was always someone from the Committee right there
NIXON: .No one in this administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident.
NIXON: .What really hurts in matters of this sort is not the fact that they occur, because overzealous people in campaigns do things that are wrong. What really hurts is if you try to cover it up.
WOODWARD: Did he just say what I think he said?
BERNSTEIN: You voted for him.
BERNSTEIN: Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post and
WOMAN: oh, you don't want me, you want my For you.
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER: This here is Carl Bernstein
BOOKKEEPER: omigod, you're from that place, you've got to go. Could I bum one of your cigarettes?
BERNSTEIN: Could I bum one of your cigarettes?
BERNSTEIN: don't bother, I'll get it.
BOOKKEEPER: You've really got to go.
BERNSTEIN: Just let me get a match.
BERNSTEIN: But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraida lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put All those articles you people write where do you find that stuff?
BOOKKEEPER: All those articles you people write where do you find that stuff?
BERNSTEIN: We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
BOOKKEEPER: ( tense ) I'm relaxedlight your cigarette.
BERNSTEIN: You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
BOOKKEEPER: I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER: ( out of the blue; to
BERNSTEIN ): Would you like some coffee or
BERNSTEIN: ( like a shot ) Please, yes, thank you. ( he looks at the
BOOKKEEPER ): Can I sit down for a minute?
BOOKKEEPER: One minute but then
BERNSTEIN: right, right, I've got to go. Why did you lie just then? I was just curiousyou don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
BERNSTEIN: I was just curiousyou don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
BOOKKEEPER: .No. never in so many words.
BERNSTEIN: ( gently ) It's obvious you want to talk to someonewell, I'm someone.
BERNSTEIN: I'm not even going to put your name down. It's just so I can keep things Start with the money, why don't you?
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER: ( returning with coffee ) How do you like it?
BERNSTEIN: Everything, please.
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER: ( going again ) I won't be a minute.
BERNSTEIN: ( to the BOOKKEEPER, quietly ) The General Accounting report said there was a 350 thousand cash slush fund in Stans' safe. Did you know about that from the beginning?
BOOKKEEPER: ( about to fold ) There are too many people watching methey know I know a lot
BERNSTEIN: it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
BOOKKEEPER: A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fundyou know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
BERNSTEIN: Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are Which people?
BOOKKEEPER: ( her words are coming faster ) I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are Which people?
BERNSTEIN: Which people?
BOOKKEEPER: The ones who could disburse the money.
BERNSTEIN: Who were they?
BOOKKEEPER: There were a group of themI think five, I don't know their names.
BERNSTEIN: Sloan knew which five, didn't he?
BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER: ( back with cream and sugar ) Here we are.
BOOKKEEPER: I don't want to say anymore.
BERNSTEIN: ( indicating coffee ) It's awfully hot ( smiles ) and you haven't finished telling me about the money
BOOKKEEPER: ( long pause; thenin a burst ) omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
BERNSTEIN: ( heart starting to pound ) Gordon Liddy, you mean?
BOOKKEEPER: ( nods ) It was all so crazythe day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of hisGordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everythingdon't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere. ( more and more moved now ) .It's all so rotten. and getting worse. and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
BERNSTEIN: Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
BOOKKEEPER: If you guys. if you guys could just get John Mitchell. that would be beautiful.
A TYPEWRITER: clicking away. The words "INTERVIEW WITH X. SEPT. 14" are visible. There is music in the background, really blasting away, Rachmaninoff or worse. We are in WOODWARD's apartment and BERNSTEIN is dictating notes from the BOOKKEEPER interview. It's very late, and BERNSTEIN has notes on everything, matchboxes, and it's hard for him to read. They're both really excited, BERNSTEIN from his coffee jag, WOODWARD by what BERNSTEIN's dictating.
BERNSTEIN: I couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
WOODWARD: Go on, go on
BERNSTEIN: we've got to find out who the five guys arethe five with access to the slush fundthey were aware of the break-in.
WOODWARD: Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
BERNSTEIN: It goes very highwe've got to find out where
WOODWARD: we will
BERNSTEIN: she was really paranoid, the That happens to people. OK, go on.
WOODWARD: That happens to people. OK, go on.
BERNSTEIN: How do you want to handle Sloan?
WOODWARD: You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one? He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understandingmight surprise him if you're not.
BERNSTEIN: He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understandingmight surprise him if you're not.
WOODWARD: You want me to be the bastard.
BERNSTEIN: ( nods ) And I'll just shitkick in my usual
WOODWARD: To see Mr. Sloan.
MRS. SLOAN: He's out. You're those two from the Post, aren't I'll tell him.
BERNSTEIN: ( as she's about to step back inside ) This must be a difficult time for the both of you.
MRS. SLOAN: This is an honest house.
WOODWARD: That's why we wanted to see your
MRS. SLOAN: That decision is up to him.
BERNSTEIN: ( conspiratorially ) Maybe you could put in a good word.
WOODWARD: We've got another appointment tonight in this areawe'll just stop back later, all right?
MRS. SLOAN: It's a free country in theory.
MRS. SLOAN: ( calling out ) Be careful
MRS. SLOAN: you can destroy lives.
WOODWARD: Think Sloan's back? What's wrong?
BERNSTEIN: NothingI just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am. I never like it when the other guy's
WOODWARD: Mr. Sloan?
SLOAN: ( nods ) My wife told me to expect you. ( softly ) As you know, I haven't talked to the We were hoping that maybe now you could. We know why you left the Committee. We know you're not guilty of anything. But we know you know who is
BERNSTEIN: We were hoping that maybe now you could. We know why you left the Committee. We know you're not guilty of anything. But we know you know who is
SLOAN: look, come in. We'll have to be quietmy wife's asleep.
PULL BACK: and we're in the living room. More coffee is being drunk; SLOAN endlessly stirs his.
SLOAN: I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
WOODWARD: You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done
BERNSTEIN: then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written
SLOAN: they're worse. That's why I quit.
SLOAN: Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four yearsso did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
BERNSTEIN: Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
SLOAN: That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
BERNSTEIN: Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
SLOAN: We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
BERNSTEIN: To cover up?
SLOAN: Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
WOODWARD: Does "they" mean the White House?
SLOAN: As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
WOODWARD: The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
SLOAN: No. It was closer to seven hundred And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
WOODWARD: And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
SLOAN: ( nods ) When so ordered.
WOODWARD: We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five.
BERNSTEIN: ( ticking them off ) Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, they're
WOODWARD: there had to be a White House Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
BERNSTEIN: Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
SLOAN: Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
WOODWARD: ( to BERNSTEIN ) ( to SLOAN ) I won't talk about the other two.
SLOAN: I won't talk about the other two.
BERNSTEIN: But they both worked at the White I will not talk about the other two.
SLOAN: ( softly ) I will not talk about the other two.
BERNSTEIN: ( out of the blue ) KalmbachNixon's personal lawyer.
SLOAN: I can't say anything, I'm sorry.
WOODWARD: One thing I'm not completely clear onwhen you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
SLOAN: ( and now for the first time, he almost smiles ) You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscoveredI gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
BERNSTEIN: Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
SLOAN: Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
WOODWARD: Go on.
SLOAN: Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave himout of this whole fortuneI happened to give him the same hundreds he gave mebanks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
BERNSTEIN: Ordinarily, though, what was the RoutineI'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the
SLOAN: RoutineI'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the
BERNSTEIN: What happens when the baby comes?
SLOAN: We're moving. I've been looking for a job but it's been. hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
SLOAN: I wish I could put down on paper what it's likeyou come to Washington because you believe in something, and then you get inside and you see how things actually work and you watch your ideals disintegrate. The people inside, the people in the White House, they start to believe they can suspend the rules because they're fulfilling a mission. That becomes the only important thing the mission. It's so easy to lose perspective. We want to get out before we lose ours altogether.
A NERFBALL: flying toward a basket cupped to a picture window. When we
PULL BACK: we're in BRADLEE's office, SIMONS and ROSENFELD are also there, along with WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN. BRADLEE plays nerfball mostly; he hasn't got the worlds's longest attention
BERNSTEIN: Lookfive men controlled that slush fund as CREEPthree of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
WOODWARD: We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
BRADLEE: This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow. You're certain on Mitchell?
WOODWARD: He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General
ROSENFELD: you got more than one source?
BERNSTEIN: has any of them got an ax?
SIMONS: has any of them got an ax?
ROSENFELD: political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?
WOODWARD: can we use their names?
SIMONS: can we use their names?
BERNSTEIN: goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story
BRADLEE: goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story
ROSENFELD: who you got?
WOODWARD: well, Sloan
BERNSTEIN: and we got a guy in Justice
BRADLEE: Deep Throat?
WOODWARD: I saw him. He verifies.
BRADLEE: ( now after the burst of talk, a pause ) You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General the man who represented law in America is a crook. ( throws the nerfball ) Just be right, huh?
BRADLEE: Leave plenty of room for his denial.
BERNSTEIN: John Mitchell, please.
BERNSTEIN: Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post, and I'm sorry to bother you but we're running a story in tomorrow's paper that we thought you should have a chance to comment What does it say?
BERNSTEIN: ( starting to read ) John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that
BERNSTEIN: fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats
BERNSTEIN: according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971
BERNSTEIN: almost a year before he left the Justice Department
BERNSTEIN: to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund
BERNSTEIN: Sir, I'd like to ask you a few
BERNSTEIN: MITCHELL ( V.O. )
BERNSTEIN: MITCHELL ( V.O. )
BRADLEE: He really made that remark about Mrs. Graham? This is a family newspapercut the words "her tit" and run it.
BRADLEE: Once when I was reporting, Lyndon Johnson's top guy gave me the word they were looking for a successor to J. Edgar Hoover. I wrote it and the day it appeared Johnson called a press conference and appointed Hoover head of the FBI for life. And when he was done, he turned to his top guy and the President said, "Call Ben Bradlee and tell him fuck you." I took a lot of static for that everyone said, "You did it, Bradlee, you screwed upyou stuck us with Hoover forever" I screwed up but I wasn't wrong.
BRADLEE: You guys haven't been wrong yet, is that why you're scared shitless? You should be.
SENATOR: Although I am a Republican, I would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that I feel only sadness that a once fine journal of record like the Post would have become merely the hysterical spokesman for the equally hysterical left wing of the Democratic Party
BRADLEE'S OFFICE: A lot of activity. BRADLEE is at his desk reading the teletype dispatches. SIMONS and ROSENFELD are there, WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, too. A kid comes in with more teletype stuff. The editors look at it.
SIMONS: ( reading ) Same kind of crap
BRADLEE: ( glancing through; nods ) all non-denial denialswe're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
BERNSTEIN: What's a real denial?
BRADLEE: If they ever start calling us goddamn it's time to start circling the
SIMONS: walking WOODWARD to the elevators.
WOODWARD: What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
SIMONS: Maybe to fire yousince you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent? And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
WOODWARD: You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
SIMONS: ( shrugs ) I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
MRS. GRAHAM: I'm so glad you could come, Mr.
WOODWARD: I'm Woodward.
MRS. GRAHAM: You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this I woke up again last night with that same question. Are we right on this story?
WOODWARD: I think so.
MRS. GRAHAM: Are you sure?
WOODWARD: MRS. GRAHAM
MRS. GRAHAM: When will you be, do you think? when are we going to know it all?
WOODWARD: It may never come out.
MRS. GRAHAM: Never? Please don't tell me never. Ben says you've found some wonderful Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
WOODWARD: Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
MRS. GRAHAM: And the underground garage one. Would I know him?
WOODWARD: I couldn't say.
MRS. GRAHAM: But it's possible.
WOODWARD: ( throat very dry ) It is.
MRS. GRAHAM: You've never told anyone who he is? But you'd have to tell me if I asked Tell me.
WOODWARD: ( he is dying ) I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
MRS. GRAHAM: I really want to know.
MRS. GRAHAM: I wasn't serious. I have plenty of burdens to carry around, I don't need another.
MRS. GRAHAM: We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
WOODWARD: Nobody ever had too much.
MRS. GRAHAM: Do better.
BRADLEE: in a state of anger, pacing around the tiny teletype room. WOODWARD hurries in.
WOODWARD: BRADLEE says nothing, just points to the AP teletype. WOODWARD looks at it, clearly is upset.
BRADLEE: I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story you think I like being aced out?
BERNSTEIN: The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin
WOODWARD: The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin
BERNSTEIN: the lookout in the Motor Inn? he say anything we don't know?
WOODWARD: ( headshake ) just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway
BRADLEE: it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this
BERNSTEIN: there's nothing new in it
BRADLEE: it makes the break-in realit's a major goddamn story I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it don't forget that I hate it
BERNSTEIN: we gotta top the Times
WOODWARD: we gotta top the Times
BERNSTEIN: we gotta top the Times
WOODWARD: I know, I know
BERNSTEIN: if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again
WOODWARD: shit, who do we know?
BERNSTEIN: I know a lawyer at Justice
WOODWARD: has he got an ax?
BERNSTEIN: almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
WOODWARD: Then he's got an ax. Call him anyway.
BERNSTEIN: I want you to shut up and listen to me
WOODWARD: I haven't said anything
BERNSTEIN: for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to himthey interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of travelinghe called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
WOODWARD: How high up, which Republicans?
BERNSTEIN: That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men
WOODWARD: Haldeman I know, who else?
BERNSTEIN: Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chiefhe knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
WOODWARD: The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
BERNSTEIN: Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergatemaybe that was just a piece
WOODWARD: So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergatemaybe that was just a piece
BERNSTEIN: because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- If he self-destructed.
WOODWARD: If he self-destructed.
PULL BACK: we see is BERNSTEIN playing. We are in his apartment, it's night, and the two of them, bleary, are studying the maze of
WOODWARD: Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six monthsand never stayed anyplace over a night or two. Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
BERNSTEIN: Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
WOODWARD: ( pointing to the thickest stacks ) California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshireall the major Democratic primary states. ( whirling ) Why does everything you play sound the same?
BERNSTEIN: 'cause I only know four chords
SEGRETTI: That's right.
BERNSTEIN: I'm Carl Bernstein. My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the You can't.
SEGRETTI: You can't.
BERNSTEIN: Mind if I try?
BERNSTEIN: According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
SEGRETTI: I've got a lot of energy.
BERNSTEIN: Listenwe know you're involved in thiswe're going to get the story, why not help?
SEGRETTI: They never told me anything except my own roleI had to find out the rest in the papers.
BERNSTEIN: By "they" you mean.?
BERNSTEIN: By "they" you mean the White House, don't you? Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin he works for the White House.
SEGRETTI: I know where Dwight works.
BERNSTEIN: When did he hire you?
BERNSTEIN: Do you feel much about the things you did?
SEGRETTI: I didn't do anything wrong.
BERNSTEIN: Tell that to Muskie.
SEGRETTI: Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
BERNSTEIN: During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
SEGRETTI: Sometimes it got up to a quarter off the record.
BERNSTEIN: You wrote the Canuck letterthe one where you claimed Muskie slurred the I didn't.
SEGRETTI: I didn't.
BERNSTEIN: But you know who did.
SEGRETTI: When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know. I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
SEGRETTI: None of it was my idea, CarlI didn't go looking for the job.
BERNSTEIN: Chapin did contact you then?
SEGRETTI: Sureoff the record.
BERNSTEIN: On the orders of Haldeman?
SEGRETTI: I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him everybody's frightened of himChrist, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with thisall I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
BERNSTEIN: It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
SEGRETTI: Can't help you.
BERNSTEIN: At USC, you had a word the this screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them
SEGRETTI: What would you have done if you were just getting out of the Army, if you'd been away from the real world for four years, if you weren't sure what kind of law you wanted to practice, and then one day you got a call from an old friend asking you to go to work for the President of the United States.?
BERNSTEIN: What would you have done?
WOODWARD: You asking would I have been one of the President's men? I would have been.
WOODWARD: alone in the underground garage. Tense, jumpy. He looks at his watch, paces around. It's all eerie as hell. Then, from the ramps, footsteps.
DEEP THROAT: My turn to keep you waiting. What's the topic for tonight?
WOODWARD: DEEP THROAT
DEEP THROAT: In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the I know what it meansSegretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
WOODWARD: I know what it meansSegretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
DEEP THROAT: ( nods ) Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
WOODWARD: Who?be specific. How high up?
DEEP THROAT: You'll have to find that out, won't The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so
WOODWARD: The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so
WOODWARD: DEEP THROAT ( as WOODWARD nods )
DEEP THROAT: Did you change cabs? It didn't work, something moved there
WOODWARD: Who are you?
WOODWARD: ( softly ) Forget your troubles and just be ( self-mocking ) I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
DEEP THROAT: ( self-mocking ) I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
WOODWARD: ( impatiently ) Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
DEEP THROAT: They know, but they focused on the burglaryif it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
WOODWARD: Why didn't they?who told them not Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you? Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
DEEP THROAT: Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you? Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
WOODWARD: Mitchell knew then.
DEEP THROAT: Of coursemy God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
WOODWARD: Haldeman too?
DEEP THROAT: You get nothing from me about
WOODWARD: Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?what were they after?
DEEP THROAT: Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
WOODWARD: Talk about Segretti
DEEP THROAT: don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
WOODWARD: There were more then.
DEEP THROAT: Follow every leadevery lead goes the Canuck letterwas that a White House operation
WOODWARD: the Canuck letterwas that a White House operation
DEEP THROAT: ( nods, bigger ) don't you miss the grand scheme How grand?
WOODWARD: How grand?
DEEP THROAT: Nationwidemy God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyedthey wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
WOODWARD: And Justice and FBI know all this?
DEEP THROAT: Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck some of what they did is beyond Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
WOODWARD: ( stunned ) Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
DEEP THROAT: DEEP THROAT ( inhales )
DEEP THROAT: I was being cautious. You can safely say more then fifty.
BERGER: Do you guys know about the Canuck I just wanted to be sure you knew who wrote it.
BERNSTEIN: ( nods, drinks ) ( stops, looks at her ) I just wanted to be sure you knew who wrote it.
BERGER: I just wanted to be sure you knew who wrote it.
BERNSTEIN: ( hysterical ) Tell him what you just told me.
BERGER: Just than Ken Clawsenhe used to be a reporter here before he went to work for NixonI had him over for a drink a few weeks ago and he told me he wrote the Canuck letter. You did want to know, didn't you?
BERNSTEIN: You think we're being set up?Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
WOODWARD: It makes a crazy kind of sense remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
BERNSTEIN: You think this was Clawsen's Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal. God knows it worked.
WOODWARD: Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal. God knows it worked.
WOODWARD: She's an awfully good reporterI can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
WOODWARD: Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger What do you mean, where?
WOODWARD: Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant
WOODWARD: Non denial-denial, Marilyn
BERGER: I already told them.
BERGER: I have a clear conscience.
BRADLEE: I got Clawsen on hold
WOODWARD: his dialing finger must be falling what do you think?
BRADLEE: what do you think?
WOODWARD: he went to her apartment and he told her
BERNSTEIN: if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.
BRADLEE: I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what
SECRETARY ): Put him on. Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid? Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled. A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken. Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night unless, of course, you force me to.
BRADLEE: It's like they taught us at Harvard: few things are as gratifying to the soul as having another man's nuts in a vise.
WESTERN SENATOR: although I am a Republican, I would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that I am happy that this latest onslaught against the intelligence of the American people will be wrapping fish tomorrow. I offer my condolences to the fish.
ROSENFELD: We've just been talking to Young
BERNSTEIN: We've just been talking to Young
SIMONS: which Young?
WOODWARD: Larry Young, a California lawyer
BERNSTEIN: he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
ROSENFELD: and he says Chapin hired Segretti
WOODWARD: and he says Chapin hired Segretti
SIMONS: well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
WOODWARD: He just did.
BERNSTEIN: He'll give us a sworn statement.
WOODWARD: We're inside the White House now.
BRADLEE: Look, I wanted to talk because things are getting really hairy and there's a couple of things we've got to be careful of because
BRADLEE: either of you want a drink or should I order?
BRADLEE: because our cocks are on the chopping block and you've got to be sure that you're not just dealing with people who hate Richard Nixon and want to get him through us. You see, I don't give a shit who's PresidentI really don't, it's an adversary situation between them and us and it's always gonna be. I never had a closer friend than Jack Kennedy and once I printed something that pissed him off and for seven months I didn't exist.
MAN: You none of you know who I am, do You screw me up good, you don't even know what I look like.
BRADLEE: OK, you've had your preamble; who the hell are you?
MAN: Glenn Sedamyou wrote about me last week, you said I was one of the guys at the Committee who was sent reports. You were wrong.
BERNSTEIN: Baldwin told the FBI it was you.
SEDAM: Baldwin told the FBI it was someone whose first name sounded like a last name. They showed him a list and he picked me but it wasn't me, it was Gordon Liddy. My phone hasn't stopped ringing, my wife's hysterical, my kids think I'm mixed up with the burglary, my friends don't like me around all of a sudden.
CLOSE UPSEDAM: You fucked around my life, you two. I just wanted to say thanks. That didn't sound to me like a non- denial denial; could you have been You had a good source? Did he have an ax?
SEDAM: You fucked around my life, you two. I just wanted to say thanks. That didn't sound to me like a non- denial denial; could you have been You had a good source? Did he have an ax?
BRADLEE: That didn't sound to me like a non- denial denial; could you have been You had a good source? Did he have an ax?
CLOSE UPBRADLEE: All right, you made a mistake maybe, we all have, just don't make another. And watch your personal lives, who you hang around with. Someone once said the price of democracy is a bloodletting every ten years. Make sure it isn't our blood.
BRADLEE: All right, you made a mistake maybe, we all have, just don't make another. And watch your personal lives, who you hang around with. Someone once said the price of democracy is a bloodletting every ten years. Make sure it isn't our blood.
HUGH SLOAN: holding a broom and dustpan at his front door.
SLOAN: I really can't talk now
BERNSTEIN: this'll only take one second
SLOAN: my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
WOODWARD: A boy or a girl?
SLOAN: A girl. Melissa.
WOODWARD: ( holding up a cup ) Where does this go?
WOODWARD: That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democratsfive guys had control
BERNSTEIN: ( ticking them off ) Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach
WOODWARD: we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the waythat fifth man was Haldeman.
SLOAN: I'm not your source on that
BERNSTEIN: it's gotta be Haldemansomeone from the White House had to be and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
WOODWARD: and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
SLOAN: No, none of those.
BERNSTEIN: that leaves Haldeman, period.
SLOAN: I'm not your source on that.
WOODWARD: ( taking the dust pan, helping out ) look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name Of courseeverything they asked
SLOAN: Of courseeverything they asked
BERNSTEIN: if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?
SLOAN: let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
WOODWARD: I think that's him.
BERNSTEIN: CUT TO:
WOODWARD: CUT TO:
BERNSTEIN: ( squints hard ) What if I went up and introduced myselfthink he'd slug me?
WOODWARD: What if I went up and introduced myselfthink he'd slug me?
BERNSTEIN: Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
WOODWARD: It's nothing personal, though.
BERNSTEIN: What's the matter?
WOODWARD: Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
BERNSTEIN: ( nods ) I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
WOODWARD: Maybe we are.
PUDGY MAN: Goddamnit, I'm not gonna say it againyou get nothing about Haldeman outta me
WOODWARD: we don't need it now, because tomorrow's story is about the FBI
BERNSTEIN: about how all you supposed experts really blew the whole investigation
FBI GUY: ( stung ) we didn't miss so much
WOODWARD: you never knew Haldeman had control of the slush fund
FBI GUY: it's all in our files
BERNSTEIN: not about Haldeman
FBI GUY: yeah, Haldeman, John Haldeman.
BERNSTEIN: he said John Haldeman, not Bob
WOODWARD: he said John Haldeman, not Bob
BRADLEE: ( staring at the typed story ) I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin
SIMONS: Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this
ROSENFELD: listen, we didn't make them do these thingsonce they did, it's our job to report it
SIMONS: ( to the reporters ) go over your sources again
WOODWARD: Sloan told the Grand Juryhe answered everything they asked him that means there's a record somewhere
BERNSTEIN: and the FBI confirmswhat more do you need?
ROSENFELD: ( whirling to BERNSTEIN ) listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk
SIMONS: Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?
ROSENFELD: maybe I'm tense
BRADLEE: well shit, we oughtta be tense we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House it would be nice if we were right
SIMONS: ( to the reporters ) you double-checked both sources?
BRADLEE: Bernstein, are you sure on this what about you?
BERNSTEIN: ( to WOODWARD ) what about you?
BRADLEE: ( to WOODWARD ) what about you?
WOODWARD: I'm sure
BRADLEE: I'm not sure, it still feels thin
SIMONS: ( to WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, after a puse ) get another source.
BERNSTEIN: How many fucking sources they think we got?
WOODWARD: Deep Throat won't confirmI never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
BERNSTEIN: I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury.
WOODWARD: We got twenty minutes to deadline
BERNSTEIN: Will you confirm that Haldeman was mentioned by Sloan to the Grand Jury?
BERNSTEIN: ( desperate ) All rightlistenit's against the law if you talk about the Grand Jury, right? But you don't have to say a thingI'll count to tenif the story's wrong, hang up before I get thereif it's OK stay on the line till after, got it?
BERNSTEIN: Right, rightOK, counting: one, two three, four, five, six seven, eight nine, ten, thank you.
OK?: ( on a note of triumph )
BERNSTEIN: ( on a note of triumph )
BRADLEE: roaring out of his office doorway.
BRADLEE: CUT TO:
SCHORR: Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment on your testimony before the Grand My lawyer says
SLOAN: My lawyer says
SLOAN'S LAWYER: the answer is an unequivocal no. Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr. Haldeman in that testimony at all.
FBI MAN: I'll deny everythingeverything I never talked to you about Haldeman I never talked to you about anything I'm not talking to you now
BERNSTEIN: what went wrong?
WOODWARD: for Chrissakes just tell that
BERNSTEIN: ( after a while ) What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
WOODWARD: What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
BERNSTEIN: What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
WOODWARD: ( nods ) Only everything.
SIMONS: ( indicating the papers ) More denunciations?
ROSENFELD: ( nods ) One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
SIMONS: What's this?
BRADLEE: My non-denial denial.
ROSENFELD: We're not printing a retraction?
BRADLEE: Fuck it, let's stand by the boys.
WOODWARD: BERNSTEIN'S VOICE ( O.S. )
WOODWARD: Jesus Christ, what time is it?
BERNSTEIN: You overslept?
WOODWARD: He fumbles for the lamp, as it falls with a CRASH
DEEP THROAT: you were doing so well and then you got stupid, you went too fast Christ, what a royal screw up
WOODWARD: I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post
DEEP THROAT: you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for himI didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
WOODWARD: We know thatand if we were wrong, we're resigningwere we wrong?
DEEP THROAT: You'll have to find that out, won't
WOODWARD: I'm tired of your chickenshit games I don't want hints, I want what you It was a Haldeman operationthe whole businesshe ran the money, but he was insulated, you'll have to find out how
DEEP THROAT: It was a Haldeman operationthe whole businesshe ran the money, but he was insulated, you'll have to find out how
DEEP THROAT: ( almost a smile ) there's more.
WOODWARD: walking up to his apartment house later that night. He sees, and then we see, BERNSTEIN, asleep at the front door. He comes awake as WOODWARD approaches.
WOODWARD: We gotta go see BradleeI'll fill you in in the car.
BRADLEE: You couldn't have told me over the
WOODWARD: We can't trust the phones, not anymore. Deep Throat says so.
BRADLEE: We can't talk inside either?
WOODWARD: ( headshake ) Electronic surveillance.
BERNSTEIN: I finally got through to Sloanit was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
WOODWARD: So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
BRADLEE: Anything else from Mr. Throat?
WOODWARD: Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible. And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
BRADLEE: He's wrong on that last, we're not in the least danger, because nobody gives a shitwhat was that Gallup Poll result? Half the country's never even heard the word Watergate.
BRADLEE: Look, you're both probably a little tired, right? You should be, you've been under a lot of pressure. So go home, have a nice hot bath, rest up fifteen minutes if you want before you get your asses back in gear because we're under a lot of pressure, too, and you put us there not that I want it to worry you nothing's riding on you except the First Amendment of the Constitution plus the freedom of the press plus the reputation of a hundred-year-old paper plus the jobs of the two thousand people who work there but none of that counts as much as this: you fuck up again, I'm gonna lose my temper. I promise you, you don't want me to lose my temper. Move-move-movewhat have you done for me tomorrow.?
WESTERN SENATOR: ( coming in, overlapping ) It is only our pathetic Post that deliberately tries to infuse the Watergate caper with a seriousness far beyond those shenanigans that have been the stock trade of political pranksters ever since.
WESTERN SENATOR: I have been given access to evidence in possession of the White House and that evidence
WESTERN SENATOR: Well, if I was wrong, I sure the hell wasn't alone
CREEP: the fact remains that except for Watergate, we ran one hell of a great
