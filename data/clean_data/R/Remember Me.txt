BLONDE: ( out of it )
TYLER: ( listens ) Of course. I'm on my way. I know.I know.I know.I know.
TYLER: ( sweetly ) Hello, your majesty. How are you?
DIANE: I'm fine. you look good.
TYLER: Thanks for organizing everybody.
CAROLINE: You smell like Listerine and beer.
CHARLES: ( aside, to Tyler ) You couldn't wear a tie?
TYLER: Could have.
DIANE: .This is nice. I think it's nice that we still do this.
CAROLINE: ( gently ) I forgot. I'm trying to purge "nice" from my vocabulary. Michael would like that we still do this.
DIANE: I forgot. I'm trying to purge "nice" from my vocabulary. Michael would like that we still do this.
DIANE: ( to Caroline ) Did you tell Tyler what your art teacher said about your portrait?
CAROLINE: Tyler, did I tell you what my art teacher said about my portrait?
TYLER: Why no, Caroline. What did your art teacher say about your portrait?
DIANE: ( smiling ) You two. I quit.
CAROLINE: .She was very impressed. She said I captured a moment like a young James Whistler.
TYLER: Young Whistler. good. 'cause Whistler really fell off late in his career. He's the Michael Jackson of European art history.
DIANE: She suggested your sister take Pratt's Summer Art Intensive and that's hugely prestigious.
CAROLINE: I would be the youngest one, ever, Tyler, would you please pass the Caroline was speaking.
CHARLES: Tyler, would you please pass the Caroline was speaking.
DIANE: Caroline was speaking.
TYLER: ( to Charles ) Are you really this clueless? Are you really dismissing her like Caroline is perfectly capable of speaking up if she is feeling dismissed. Caroline, are you feeling dismissed?
CHARLES: Caroline is perfectly capable of speaking up if she is feeling dismissed. Caroline, are you feeling dismissed?
CAROLINE: I'm okay.
CHARLES: ( solicitous, to Caroline ) I didn't mean to change the What was the subject?
TYLER: What was the subject?
CHARLES: Excuse me?
TYLER: The subject we were discussing. What was it?
CHARLES: Now's not the time for your heroics No. It's the perfect time.
TYLER: No. It's the perfect time.
TYLER: ( whispering, to Caroline ) Do you need me to take you
CAROLINE: I'll stay with mom.
TYLER: Then I'll see you after school.
CAROLINE: He exits as Caroline sips her lemonade, avoiding everybody's 6 INT. SUBWAY CAR JUST AFTER 6 Tyler standing although there are a few seats available. The car window strobes behind him. He takes off his jacket and button down and ties them both around his waist.
HOSTESS: Eat something.
TYLER: Yes, ma'am.
AIDAN: I sold your girlfriend a You sold my who? .What?
TYLER: You sold my who? .What?
AIDAN: That voluptuous, delightfully oblivious little blonde you left in your bed this morning. I sold her a toothbrush. Got three bucks.
TYLER: Are in order, yes. Because that sale inspired our newest business venture: "The S.L.U.T."
AIDAN: Are in order, yes. Because that sale inspired our newest business venture: "The S.L.U.T."
TYLER: I was unaware we had a previous business venture.
AIDAN: It's the one-night-stand travel pack for women. We throw in some make-up, toiletries, cell phone charger, cab numbers. Retail it at S19.95, maybe do an infomercial.
TYLER: With money?
AIDAN: a part of life. like stubbing your toe. Sometimes you misjudge a corner and bend back your pinky toe, other times you wake up in a freshman dorm wearing a field hockey tee shirt wondering why your balls smell like cinnamon.
TYLER: ( nodding sagely ) Of course. Yes.
AIDAN: gift market. Think about it. instead of giving that token slutty friend a ten-inch purple dildo for her birthday, you hook her up with "The SLUT." Everyone has a laugh and the implication that she'll probably use it someday remains. What do you say? Are you down?
TYLER: sort of medication.
AIDAN: remember at some point in history two people had a conversation just like this about the light bulb. One of them went on to fame and fortune and the other one probably went to work at Mickey D's or something.
TYLER: 19th century.
PROFESSOR: .in the wake of terrorist attacks these insurance company actuaries are provided a unique opportunity to raise premiums and profits to protect against events that will likely never occur again.
GIRL: Isn't that also an ethical
UPTIGHT MOMMY: Why don't we make this a non- smoking statue?
CAROLINE: ( emerging ) Yeah, Tyler . Why don't we make this a non-smoking statue?
CAROLINE: You promised you'd quit.
TYLER: I know.
CAROLINE: You're gonna get emphysema and then you're gonna have to drag an oxygen tank with you everywhere.
TYLER: You think that would be the worst part about having emphysema?
CAROLINE: Everywhere you go, Tyler. Even the Why do you think Dad doesn't wanna.like, listen to me?
CAROLINE: Why do you think Dad doesn't wanna.like, listen to me?
TYLER: Dad loves you.
CAROLINE: So? You can love someone and not want to spend any time with them.
TYLER: You've got that right.
CAROLINE: Mom loves Aunt Sara. But at Christmas, last year, she wouldn't let Les leave them in a room together 'cause she said there would be a "yule tide homicide."
TYLER: That's because Aunt Sara drinks. You don't drink, right?
CAROLINE: So why would anyone wanna avoid
TYLER: So why would anyone wanna avoid
CAROLINE: Michael used to drink.
TYLER: Yeah. He did. But Michael was 21. All 21 year olds drink because it's new and exciting. Aunt Sara drinks because she wishes she was 21.
CAROLINE: You're 21.
AIDAN: What about Atlantic City for your birthday this year? Get a suite. Couple of ladies. You could call Toothbrush Girl, what do you think?
TYLER: I think I'd rather be sodomized.
AIDAN: Hey, it's your day.
AIDAN: What's the point? How do you know where anything is in this place, anyway? There's like.
TYLER: I don't expect you to appreciate this, but the schematic for this particular shelf is authors who were sleeping together.
AIDAN: No shit?
TYLER: And ended up dead or in prison.
AIDAN: This is why chicks dig you.
AIDAN: Seriously. They like this freaky poetic crap. I ran into Megan yesterday. She's bartending at Don Hill's tonight. She wants us to stop by. She practically begged me.
TYLER: rolling ladder and pushes Tyler into the Romance novels.
TYLER: Hey nothing. You've been a ghost the past couple weeks. You never wanna go out. I'm feeling unappreciated here.
AIDAN: Hey nothing. You've been a ghost the past couple weeks. You never wanna go out. I'm feeling unappreciated here.
TYLER: You realize interventions typically discourage binge drinking?
AIDAN: One drink. Come out for one drink.
TYLER: When's the last time you had one
AIDAN: Hey, Megan!
AIDAN: You look great! Can I get two Do. Not. Speak.
MEGAN: Do. Not. Speak.
AIDAN: ( genuine ) Is she mad at me or something?
TYLER: No no. Girls are like that when they're way into you.
AIDAN: Two nubile young GIRLS approach Aidan. Tap his shoulder.
GIRL #1: Excuse me?
AIDAN: Well, hello.
GIRL #1: Could you take a picture for us?
AIDAN: My pleasure.
AIDAN: Thanks. You've met my roommate.
MEGAN: I hope you die.
TYLER: She's all over you. Cheers.

AIDAN: Miami. Miami, Barcelona, Rio. New York is it, man. God broke the mold when he made this city.
TYLER: You ever actually been to any of those places?
AIDAN: What's your point?
AIDAN'S GIRL: What are we doing? I'm freezing.

CRAIG: Cut those two loose.
LEO: ( quiet ) Take a walk.
CRAIG: Anything in here that's going to stab me, Einstein?
CRAIG: Nice. You like to get high and hit
NEANDERTHAL#1: I don't even know the bitch.
CRAIG: How about you two?
MUSICIAN#1: It wasn't us, man!
NEANDERTHAL#1: That cocksucker kicked my car!
CRAIG: Shut up, genius.
MUSICIAN#1: ( to Neanderthal ) Eat shit, pencil dick.
CRAIG: Alright. That's it. Everybody goes It wasn't them.
TYLER: It wasn't them.
AIDAN: ( sotto ) ( quietly, to the guys ) Take a walk, I said.

ALLY: Mrs. Lippman is going to drive me.
CRAIG: I'll drive you.
ALLY: Mrs. Lippman said she'd do it.

ALLY: This drive is too long.
THE RECEPTIONIST: You know you can't smoke in here.

THE RECEPTIONIST: It completes the room.

TYLER: I don't want to be bailed out of
TYLER: I'll get an invoice from Janine.
TYLER: ( to Caroline )
TYLER: Excuse us, we're due in surgery.
CAROLINE: What happened to your face?
TYLER: Horrible threshing accident.
CAROLINE: You're so retarded.
TYLER: Don't mock the afflicted. Here, I brought you something.
TYLER: This was my favorite book ever. Michael had it and he hit me over the head with it until I read it. Its about all these God and Goddesses who spend all of their time being jealous and petty and otherwise acting like human beings. The illustrations are amazing.
CAROLINE: Ooh. These are cool. Thanks! Where are we meeting mom?
TYLER: Guggenheim. What's up with those I just.they think I'm weird. Sometimes I sort of space out.
CAROLINE: I just.they think I'm weird. Sometimes I sort of space out.

AIDAN: ( distracted ) I mean. uh. life's only about what we put into it. It's about people. And what they put into it. And I'm ah, screw it.
AIDAN: He's got a daughter.
TYLER: The cop. The cop who busted your face all up. He's got a daughter. And she's hot! I smell revenge!
AIDAN: The cop. The cop who busted your face all up. He's got a daughter. And she's hot! I smell revenge!
TYLER: Revenge. What do you want me to do, kidnap her?
AIDAN: You introduce yourself.go on a few dates.be your charming, gentlemanly self. And then, flip the script.
TYLER: What does that mean?
AIDAN: Screw her brains out and make her call you daddy. Steal her underwear and sell it on ebay. Put her in Clown Shoes, take lewd photos and post them on her high school's home page. I don't know. Be creative.
TYLER: You should be incarcerated on general principle.
AIDAN: Hey. What happened to you was very emasculating. Tell me you don't want to get that asshole and I'll drop it.
TYLER: I don't want to get that asshole.
AIDAN: Just meet her.
TYLER: I don't want to meet her.
AIDAN: She's cute.
TYLER: I don't care.
AIDAN: You're meeting her.
TYLER: I'm not meeting her.
TYLER: This is one of those moments I'm already regretting.
AIDAN: She was here yesterday.
TYLER: What am I supposed to say to this girl? "Hey doll face, your dad trampled all over my civil liberties, wanna make out?"
AIDAN: Well don't call her doll face.
AIDAN: There. The brunette.
TYLER: I know her. I mean, I don't know her, but, I've seen her. She's in my global politics class.
AIDAN: There you go! Something to open with. Now get over there.
AIDAN: Excuse me?
TYLER: Excuse me?
TYLER: My name's Tyler Roth. I was wondering if I could bother you for a minute?
ALLY: You're already bothering me.
TYLER: Um, I'm doing kind of a sociological experiment.I was hoping you could help me out.
ALLY: What are you, kidding me?
TYLER: No, I. may I ask your name?
ALLY: Anonymous. It's Greek. It means "you don't have a shot".
TYLER: Okay, Anonymous, do you see the guy across the room, pretending to read a text book, looking in this general direction?
ALLY: I have this theory that an objective third-party, having no prior contact, would be able to determine how much of an asshole he is just by looking at him.
TYLER: I have this theory that an objective third-party, having no prior contact, would be able to determine how much of an asshole he is just by looking at him.
ALLY: He's my roommate. And I've witnessed so many glaring examples of assaholic behavior that I'm biased as a subject, but I'm convinced that he has an aura, that people can actually perceive. So, just take a good long look. And tell me what you think?
TYLER: He's my roommate. And I've witnessed so many glaring examples of assaholic behavior that I'm biased as a subject, but I'm convinced that he has an aura, that people can actually perceive. So, just take a good long look. And tell me what you think?
ALLY: Who else do you plan on asking?
TYLER: No one here. The parameters called only to sample attractive women in their early twenties.
ALLY: I'm nineteen.
TYLER: In their late teens. Well, look, you typically get something for participating in these things and I've run out of those big foam fingers, so I was thinking maybe I could take you out some night?
TYLER: Or you could just go out with me on the off chance we'd have an interesting conversation.
ALLY: I don't date sociology majors. they're a rowdy bunch.
TYLER: Indeed they are. Lucky for you, I'm About what?
ALLY: About what?
TYLER: Tyler smiles. Ally tries to hide a smile. She closes her book and extends her hand.
ALLY: I'm Ally.
CHUBBY GIRL: Kiss ass freak.
CRAIG: Don't be mad.
ALLY: Dad, we've seen freaking Erin Brockovich twice already. You always cry.
ALLY: It's embarrassing.
ALLY: 31 EXT. FIRE ESCAPE. RAILROAD FLAT. 31
TYLER: Hey. It's Tyler.
ALLY: You're going to stand me up. I can feel it in my bones. I'll be No. I.I was just.
TYLER: You're going to stand me up. I can feel it in my bones. I'll be No. I.I was just.
ALLY: No. I.I was just.
TYLER: You were just sitting around in your pajamas watching T.V.
ALLY: No. I'm not watching T.V. I'm just.getting dressed.
ALLY: And I'm going to meet you at the place at..what time again?
TYLER: Right.yes. Eight.okay.
ALLY: Right.yes. Eight.okay.
ALLY: She whips the Scrunchie out of her hair and heads for the 32 INT.CRAIG HOUSE. KITCHEN. 32 Ally comes down the stairs, putting on her earrings.
ALLY: I'm going out.
CRAIG: I can see that.
ALLY: Well, you're a trained
CRAIG: Who are you going with?
ALLY: A boy from school.
CRAIG: I wasn't asking for permission.
ALLY: I wasn't asking for permission.
CRAIG: ( sharply ) I know. ( more gently ) Have a good time. Here's cab fare.
ALLY: Should I wait up?
CRAIG: Should I wait up?
ALLY: Craig puts his hands in the air in surrender.
ALLY: ( to the waiter ) What desserts do you have?
WAITER: Dessert special fried bananas a la Great, I'll have that. A glass of skim milk. Then the mussels, Pad Thai and a Sapporo. Thanks.
ALLY: Great, I'll have that. A glass of skim milk. Then the mussels, Pad Thai and a Sapporo. Thanks.
TYLER: Pad Thai and a Sapporo. Thanks.
ALLY: I have my dessert first.
TYLER: Is this a political statement? A medical condition?
ALLY: I just don't see the point in waiting for something I know I want and am going to have. What if I die eating my mussels?
TYLER: Is that probable?
ALLY: It's possible. If an embolism burst or an asteroid hit the restaurant, I'd die without having eaten the thing I wanted most.
TYLER: But the odds are, I mean.
ALLY: Fine. I'll tell you what, you guarantee me. Swear to me on your eternal soul that I'll make it through my entrée. And I'll wait.
ALLY: Before you answer, keep in mind, if I die, you'll have to live the rest of your life knowing that you not only lied to me, but denied me my last indulgence. My last wish. Are you prepared to shoulder that kind of responsibility to prove a point?
ALLY: Don't worry. I'll share.
ALLY: Tyler takes the cue puts the packet and lighter away. A beat.
ALLY: I had a nice time.
TYLER: You had a nice time or you're having a nice time?
TYLER: Because if you're having one, why rush to end it?
AFTER: They approach a CARNIVAL GAME, one those ubiquitous basketball tosses. THE ATTENDANT badgers passersby to test their luck. GIANT STUFFED ANIMALS hang all around it.
TYLER: Did I tell you I'm Caucasian?
ALLY: Tyler pays again, wipes out again. Game over. Tyler pays again. Loses again. He's visibly frustrated now.
ALLY: Can't we just stroll while I feed you ice cream with fireworks in the No. If I stop, he wins.
TYLER: No. If I stop, he wins.
ALLY: Who, the attendant?
TYLER: No, the frigging Giant Panda.
ALLY: I don't know what you're smiling I won.
TYLER: I won.
ALLY: Paying off the attendant is not winning. It's cheating.
TYLER: I just paid a premium to cut out the middle man. That's innovation. That's free market enterprising. That's what made America great.
ALLY: Aha. By the way, what happened to your eye?
TYLER: Oh, it's nothing, just a bar fight.
ALLY: How butch.
TYLER: I know. I'm practically a pirate.
ALLY: Okay, Captain Morgan.
TYLER: ( laughing ) You've got some serious timing.
ALL: It's getting late.
TYLER: I'll walk you to the train.
ALLY: I'll take a cab.
ALLY: Tyler leans in to kiss her. Ally turns away.
ALLY: Not tonight. Not never. just. not tonight.
CAB DRIVER: We goin' or what?
ALLY: Hey! Turn on the meter.
TYLER: So dessert before dinner for fear of death by rogue asteroid. yes. Kissing guy you're obviously attracted to before driving off into the unknown New York night.
ALLY: You're really weird.
ALLY: ( to the driver ) I'm going to Queens and I don't wanna hear about it.
TYLER: Happy end of sixth grade!

TYLER: A thing?
CAROLINE: ( sheepish ) A show where you show what you've done and stuff. Will you come?
TYLER: Let me check my book. Abso-freaking- lutely. I'm camping out. I'm sleeping there the night before.
CAROLINE: You're so retarded. Mom's been hyperventilating with joy.
TYLER: Good. I'm sure Les was.
CAROLINE: Your school's over, right?
TYLER: Yes, it's over. Did Mom and Les get the beach house again?
CAROLINE: Yup. What are we going to do for your birthday?

ALLY: So what kind of grade did you end up with from Vogelstein?
TYLER: I don't actually get grades.
TYLER: I'm not technically enrolled. I worked out an auditing thing.
ALLY: Oh. And The Strand is not a significant career choice.
TYLER: I like the books.
TYLER: You don't have to help me, you At the rate you're going, dish washing is going to be your life's vocation. I can say I knew you This is the playful, you get me all wet part? Right?
ALLY: At the rate you're going, dish washing is going to be your life's vocation. I can say I knew you This is the playful, you get me all wet part? Right?
ALLY: This is the playful, you get me all wet part? Right?
TYLER: ( horsing around ) You make it sound so cheap.
ALLY: It is cheap. I've seen this scene a hundred times.
TYLER: I'm sorry. I didn't.
ALLY: You know what never happens in this scene, Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go- to-school? Tyler-who-doesn't-really

ALLY: I'm sorry. I didn't. I didn't
TYLER: He killed himself.
ALLY: When he was 21. He had just started working for my father.
TYLER: When he was 21. He had just started working for my father.
ALLY: I thought he was a musician.
TYLER: He was. But he wasn't making a living doing music and my father's a very compelling guy.
ALLY: Mine too.
AIDAN: Damn, you're not naked.
TYLER: You're not Irish.
AIDAN: T, What happened in the kitchen? It looks like somebody's water broke. Ally, Aidan. Aidan, Ally.

TYLER: You're up.
TYLER: Can I get you anything?
TYLER: I'll be out here if you need me.
TIME LAPSE: They lie, eyes closed, almost asleep, entwined with each other. Tyler gives a little sound of contentment. Ally, in her own haze, reaches for him, her hair all over the place. Eyes still closed they fumble for each other, starting, in this dream state, to make love all over again.
JANINE: I can't believe you still come down
TYLER: It's not so far. I can't believe you still get his coffee. three sugars, no milk?

ALLY: You don't need to say anything, I know you're sorry. Everyone's always sorry, you know?
ALLY: It's just, I need you to know that, my dad, he's not an evil guy.
ALLY: Wounded? Our house is like the recovery room, or the critical care unit or something.
ALLY: I don't feel like that, though. I feel like I'm getting stronger and like I'm leaving him behind to swim in it all by himself.
CRAIG: Tell me something, Matthews, do you like paperwork?
MATTHEWS: No, sir.
CRAIG: Me neither. Nobody likes paperwork. But paperwork keeps our ship afloat. Paperwork makes it possible for me to keep track of all the scumbags. But I can't do that if newbies like you are incapable of remembering standard filing.

DIANE: Tyler sits next to his mom and lights a cigarette.
DIANE: Well, first, your sister is all excited about your birthday at the house. I wish you'd told me.
TYLER: I wish she'd told me. It was a unilateral Caroline decision. Will you make sausage and peppers?
DIANE: Of course. Tyler, Your father is driving me crazy. I shouldn't even be discussing this with you. I can't get him to say he'll come to your sister's exhibit. Her art exhibit. He says he's in the middle of an IPO.
DIANE: Les says I shouldn't broker. I should let them be on whatever road they're on.
TYLER: I'll get him there.
DIANE: She cares about this, even though she's pretending she doesn't.
TYLER: I'll get him there, mom.
DIANE: You will?
TYLER: She looks relieved.
DIANE: Thank you. Thank you.
DIANE: Why don't you bring that lovely girl to your birthday?
TYLER: ( a warning ) Sorry. Sorry. I love you, darling, but this place reeks of marijuana.
DIANE: Sorry. Sorry. I love you, darling, but this place reeks of marijuana.
ALLY: That was weird. I assume most moms don't smoke weed in front of their Piece of ass?
AIDAN: Piece of ass?
ALLY: You know, you're a poet.
AIDAN: Hey. I know one thing. I know that in the time I've lived with Tyler, he has never introduced a girl . woman.female.to his mom before.
ALLY: It's not like he had a choice. She ambushed us.
AIDAN: Yeah, but he would've shoved you in a closet or something. Or literally pretended you were a hallucination.
ALLY: Ha ha.
AIDAN: I mean it. It's the first time. Did it ever occur to you that that's kind of weird?
ALLY: Did it ever occur to you that that's kind of weird?
AIDAN: Ally throws up her hands.
JANINE: Charles, it's your son.
CHARLES: On the phone.
JANINE: On the phone.
CHARLES: He punches a button.
CHARLES: Tyler, you're on speakerphone.
TYLER: It's about Caroline's show. Are you planning on attending?
TYLER: Caroline's show.
TYLER: ( ready to kill him ) You are coming, right?
TYLER: Dinner? That's not.
CHARLES: I'll make a reservation and have Janine call you.
CAROLINE: Make a wish.
CAROLINE: Retarded. Tyler?
ALLY: You're the second member of this family I've washed dishes with.
DIANE: He was doing it to impress you. He's never washed a dish in his
ALLY: Caroline's working on a PORTRAIT OF TYLER ON A PARK BENCH, cigarette dangling from his bottom lip. A perfect rendering of a fleeting moment.
ALLY: May I?
ALLY: That's exactly him. It's like the cigarette is the last Coca Cola in the desert.
ALLY: I can't believe he smokes in front of you.
CAROLINE: Don't worry, I'm not that
ALLY: You know when I was younger, we didn't have air conditioning in the house, so during the summer my mom and I would go to museums to cool down. she loved them all but The Met was always her favorite.
CAROLINE: Mine too. The Met is one of my favorite places in the world.
ALLY: So. I heard you've got an art exhibit coming up.
CAROLINE: ( skeptical ) You wanna come?
ALLY: Was it that obvious? But only if you're OK with it. I don't want to impose and I'll completely understand if you don't want some random girl there.
CAROLINE: You're not random. you're Tyler's
ALLY: You like?
TYLER: Let's just skip dinner and I'll tell you how great you look in like eighteen different languages.
ALLY: You just want to skip dinner. I got you a tie.
TYLER: I was going to make a joke about how I'm not prepared for the commitment of exchanging accessories and how neck wear especially is a slippery slope, but I should probably shut up and say thank you.
ALLY: You're learning.
TYLER: Have you ever been here?
ALLY: ( joking ) Yeah. Every Tuesday with my pop.
TYLER: He's allowed to stand me up. But he's not allowed to stand you up. Or my sister.
TYLER: I'll have a whiskey.
CHARLES: Get me one too.
WAITER: Yes. For the lady?
ALLY: I'm fine, thank you.
TYLER: This is Alicia Craig. Ally, my father, Charles Roth.
CHARLES: A pleasure.
CHARLES: You're going to be a social worker?
ALLY: Yes. But with an area of focused responsibility. It's easier to find a job that way.
CHARLES: What will your area be?
ALLY: Criminal Justice.
CHARLES: Tough area.
ALLY: When I was little I wanted to play first base for the Mets. I don't think it's any harder than that.
CHARLES: The Mets, huh.
ALLY: ( arching an eyebrow ) I'm from Rockaway.
TYLER: Dad's a Yankee fan. It has something to do with the payroll.
CHARLES: It has to do with significant ball playing. You were a Yankees fan when you were little. You were Lou Piniella for Halloween.
TYLER: Blind familial allegiance. I didn't know what overpriced, overfed, fat bastards they were.
CHARLES: ( serious as a heart attack ) Who's fat? What Yankee is fat? Tell It's a metaphor.
TYLER: ( right back at him ) It's a metaphor.
TYLER: Roger Clemens.
ALLY: Shane Spencer.
ALLY: Nick Johnson.
CHARLES: ( his mouth full of steak ) He's big boned!
TIME CUT: another whiskey.
CHARLES: How long has your dad been a cop?
ALLY: Twenty-two years.
CHARLES: Would you excuse me please. I'm so sorry.
ALLY: It's OK.
ALLY: It's just a call. He held out 'til
CHARLES: I'm sorry.And your mother?
ALLY: She passed away when I was eleven.
CHARLES: She was murdered. I was there.
ALLY: She was murdered. I was there.
ALLY: ( to Tyler ) I never told you that part.
TYLER: Why are you saying this now?
ALLY: I don't know.
CHARLES: And, here you are.
ALLY: Yup. Here I am.
ALLY: I think he's lovely.
TYLER: Charles returns. His face blank.
TYLER: Don't say it.
CHARLES: I have to go to the office.
TYLER: You have somewhere else to be, Dad.
CHARLES: The exhibit runs til nine. You guys take the car. I'll meet you.
TYLER: I don't believe you.
CHARLES: That's all there is, Tyler.
TYLER: It's not good enough.
CHARLES: I don't have to justify anything to you. Take the car. I'll get a cab. I'll meet you.
DIANE: I brought you every flavor.
CAROLINE: ( to Tyler ) I'm ready to go home now.
TYLER: Les, eating a cupcake, and Ally, stand under a portrait of Charles. Ally picks up her purse. Diane standing there with her cupcakes.
ALLY: Where are you going?
TYLER: I have something I've got to do.
ALLY: Ally reaches for his elbow. He yanks his arm away.
TYLER: Are you capable of taking care of yourself for an hour? Do you need me here every minute, or what?
JANINE: Tyler? Tyler? You can't just.
CHARLES: It's fine Janine.
TYLER: She drew you a picture.
CHARLES: Put it on the table.
TYLER: You have a daughter who sincerely believes you don't like her.
CHARLES: If I have any questions about what my daughter may believe, I'll let you know.
TYLER: Don't you at least want to know her? She's telling you something, Dad. She's communicating. Why aren't you riveted? Why isn't this the most important thing? At least for one night of your life?
CHARLES: I've heard this song before, Tyler.
SUBORDINATE#1: We can come back.
CHARLES: It's fine, Khaleel.
CHARLES: Who is this display for?
TYLER: You, Mr. Roth.
CHARLES: She knows I will take care of her.
TYLER: We really can come back another.
SUBORDINATE#1: We really can come back another.
CHARLES: Sit the fuck down.
CHARLES: And that I love her. I love her. Good God, you toss that word around like currency. You have no idea what it means.
TYLER: Maybe not. Maybe Caroline doesn't either. Where would she have learned it?
CHARLES: I have provided her world. And That does not mean you're allowed to shatter it whenever there's something better to do.
TYLER: That does not mean you're allowed to shatter it whenever there's something better to do.
CHARLES: Who the hell do you think you're talking to? You pedaled down here on your bike for Christ's sake. You have to take care of nothing. You are responsible for no one. You're a kid. You think you're the first one to lose anything? Do you think that there is anything you feel that I haven't already felt?
TYLER: You didn't find him. I found him. And you're so tragically blind, the rest of your children are going to hang themselves on your watch.
JANINE: Stop! Stop!
JANINE: Get out of here Tyler.
ALLY: Oh my God.
ALLY: She yanks his head up.
ALLY: It's okay.

CAROLINE: A child could do Berlin Alexanderplatz, you spaz.
LES: I want five minutes with my child before she ceases to be a child and decides I'm ruining her life.
DIANE: I want five minutes with my child before she ceases to be a child and decides I'm ruining her life.
DIANE: Aren't you a treasure.
AIDAN: I want a girlfriend.
TYLER: Dinners out, movies. Regular sex. That could be all right. For like, a summer.
AIDAN: Dinners out, movies. Regular sex. That could be all right. For like, a summer.
ALLY: You're such a romantic.
AIDAN: And I've had all the races.
ALLY: Excuse me?
AIDAN: I've had all the races. I've been with girls from every.race.
TYLER: That is the stupidest thing you've ever said, including that time with the bong in the emergency room.
ALLY: White girl.
AIDAN: Please. Like falling off a log. As a matter of fact.
ALLY: Shut up. Black girl.
AIDAN: But of course.

ALLY: I don't believe you.
AIDAN: Fine. Nice girl. While we were doing it, I couldn't get this little, like, song out of my "Inuit, bum buh bum, I'm banging an Inuit, bum buh bum buh bum."
AIDAN: "Inuit, bum buh bum, I'm banging an Inuit, bum buh bum buh bum."
ALLY: Prove it. Ten bucks.
AIDAN: You wanna go to the library?
ALLY: The minute we get off this train.
AIDAN: Tyler, are you coming?
ALLY: Tyler, are you coming?

CRAIG: That's true, Tyler Roth, son of Charles and Diane. Brother of Caroline and Michael, deceased, suicide by hanging. You're kinda lost, aren't you? Taking a little vacation in coach before finding your way back to first class?

TYLER: chick. Like her dad.
TYLER: Don't do that. What are you doing?
ALLY: Do you realize what you've done?
TYLER: He doesn't.
ALLY: Did you think I would never find out? I mean, think about it. I had to find out eventually. You set it up that way.
TYLER: But it doesn't mean anything. I didn't mean to hurt you,
