THE ROOMMATE: Written by Sonny Mallhi Revision by Frank Baldwin
SARA: Hi. Sara Matthews. She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple silver chain around her neck.
SARA: Told you we'd make it. She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off the cart. BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles off the other cart.
GIRL: Sorry! Bad driver. Sara kneels to help the other girl cute, frizzy hair clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And peeking out from under them. a bottle of vodka. The girl smiles sheepishly.
GIRL: In case of emergency.
SARA: Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands.
SARA: Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met this really cool biker? He's taking me to Mexico this weekend.
SARA: Everything's great.
TRACY: Psi U.'s throwing a bash. Let's go.
SARA: Psi U.?
TRACY: They're a frat. Beer. guys.
SARA: I don't know. I might just hang and wait for my roommate. Groans all around. "Come on". "Lame-O". Sara bites her lip, considering. She smiles.
SARA: Alright. Just let me change. The girls cheer.
BOUNCER: ( motions to a crowded keg ) If you want beer, I'll need ID's.
TRACY: For a frat party?! Seriously? He holds up a handful of ugly lime-green wristbands. Kim steps around him.
KIM: I don't drink anyway. Tracy looks at her, mouth agape.
BOUNCER: There's punch and non-alcoholic beer over there. He points to a table with a giant bowl and cups. No one is around it. Tracy tries to flirt with the bouncer.
TRACY: Come on, just us. We won't tell. The bouncer is tempted but not budging.
BOUNCER: Honestly, I'm just a pledge. They'll kick me out. She stomps by him.
TRACY: Defeated, Tracy walks over to the table. Turns back to Sara.
TRACY: You want something to drink?
SARA: What's the point? Tracy huffs as Sara walks into A SEA OF KIDS. We're talking extreme fire hazard. extreme moral hazard. Sara moves through the crowd. Her clothes are low-wattage, but stylish. She's drawn to the music coming from a large A HIGH-ENERGY COLLEGE BAND on stage. They're not very good, but they don't care. Sara finds a spot along the wall and watches them. In particular THE DRUMMER. A cute goof, spastically whaling away. He's mouthing the lyrics, eyes closed. Really into it. Sara chuckles at the sight, not taking her eyes off him. He definitely stands out. Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder. Tracy pulls herself in with Kim close behind and they start dancing to the band. Juice spilling over the brim of her cup. Sara stays by the wall, afraid of getting any spilled on her.
TRACY: ( yells over the music ) Why aren't you dancing?
SARA: To this?
TRACY: They're not that bad. Tracy pulls Sara deeper in the crowd. Now all three start jumping up and down to the music. Sara's getting into it as Tracy chugs her drink.
SARA: Kim still dances as Sara starts to look around.
SARA: Where's Tracy?
KIM: She was getting more punch. Sara then spots Tracy, with a full cup, precariously climbing onto the stage next to the DJ's table with a bunch of other girls already dancing. She starts dancing suggestively, egging on the crowd.
SARA: Uh oh. Guys yell out. "Show em." Several hands armed with camera phones stretch out above the crowd.
SARA: ( SHOUTS )
SARA: ( LOUDER )
STEPHEN: Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd. Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up.
STEPHEN: Oh. Woops.
SARA: ( ANNOYED )
STEPHEN: Looks like my plan backfired. Sara turns back towards him.
SARA: What plan?
STEPHEN: To spill beer on you so I can start a conversation.
SARA: You spilled beer on me purposely?
STEPHEN: ( NODS )
SARA: I'll get over it. He laughs, making her smile.
SARA: I'm not sure how she's so wasted. All she's had is punch. Stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand.
STEPHEN: Come on.
SARA: It's pretty good. She drinks some more.
SARA: It doesn't taste that strong.
STEPHEN: He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of Stephen. By the way.
STEPHEN: Stephen. By the way.
SARA: INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR: SOME TIME LATER Stephen and Sara are dancing. She's holding her cup. Drinking, bumping into a couple of people. Stephen laughs, grabs her hand, pulling her back towards him and TWIRLS her, bringing her close. She notices, for the first time, that he's not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her other hand.
SARA: Hey, why do you get to drink beer?
STEPHEN: Old man.
SARA: Old man.
STEPHEN: Tell me about it. My back is killing me. They don't move for a moment, Sara's resting her back against his chest.
STEPHEN: Besides, frat brothers don't have to wear those ugly wristbands.
SARA: Ugh. You're in this frat? He jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people behind her. Sara laughs as she notices Kim, dancing, Holding up a cup of punch.
KIM: ( SLURS )
SARA: What happened to Tracy? Kim shrugs.
KIM: I'm the worst roommate ever. Kim goes back to dancing Sara looks a little worried which Stephen notices.
STEPHEN: Do you want to look for your Sara looks at him sweetly. Nods.
SARA: ( BUTTS IN )
STEPHEN: Guess that would be me. But then he stumbles, nearly dropping them both.
SARA: Who's got you? Stephen looks at Tracy in one arm. The other arm around Sara's waist.
STEPHEN: ( SMIRKS )
KIM: Thanks Sara.
SARA: No problem. They linger, smiling, checking out Stephen. They step into the elevator. Holding it for Sara.
KIM: You want us to wait? Sara turns and glares at Kim. An obvious "NO!" Kim lets the doors close as Sara turns back to Stephen.
STEPHEN: You know, I'm going to be pulling kitchen duty all week for helping girls leave a frat party. It's like opposite everything we stand Sara leans in and gives him a long kiss. Then separates, but her lips still very close to his.
SAEA: ( low and romantic ) Does that make it worth it?
STEPHEN: Honestly, no. She laughs out loud.
SARA: Do you want to come up?
STEPHEN: ( DEEP BREATH )
STEPHEN: Keep it. till next time.
SARA: Thanks again. For everything.
SARA: She reaches her bed and plops down on her back. Breathing hard. Clenching her eyes shut. The room is spinning. She may puke at any second. She struggles to sit up. She fumbles for the lamp next to her bed, almost knocking it over. She hits the switch, revealing: The other bed. Sara screams.
GIRL: FLASH. The girl takes her picture, further blinding and disorienting Sara.
SARA: Who are you?!
GIRL: Rebecca. Your roommate. Sara calms, catching on.
SARA: What are you doing?
REBECCA: Taking your picture.
SARA: Rebecca shrugs. Sara grabs her stomach.
SARA: Oh shit. Her cheeks chipmunk as she rushes out the door. Rebecca INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT: LATER Sara gingerly walks out of the bathroom back to her room, holding her head. The door is slightly open.
SARA: ( WHISPERS )
REBECCA: Hey Sara. Sara stares at her blankly. Who is this girl? What happened last night? Rebecca smiles.
REBECCA: We met last night.
SARA: ( racking her brain ) Starts with a. "T"?
REBECCA: Close. Rebecca. She hands Sara a glass of water and two aspirin.
REBECCA: Come on. It'll help, trust me. Sara washes down the aspirin.
SARA: Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched.
SARA: ( SUDDENLY PANICKED )
REBECCA: ( LAUGHS )
SARA: Did you do those? Rebecca nods.
SARA: They're really cool.
REBECCA: I just like capturing my moods. A beat. Sara closes her eyes. Bits and pieces of the night before are coming back to her now.
SARA: Rebecca did you take my picture last night?
REBECCA: ( LAUGHING )
SARA: It's too damn early for me.
REBECCA: It's three in the afternoon. Sara's eyes bug out.
SARA: Holy shit!
GIRL: So what do we do? Sara looks her over. Checks out her outfit.
SARA: Nice bag. Dior?
GIRL: ( FLATTERED )
SARA: I'm on financial aid.
SARA: ( ANNOYED )
SARA: I told you not to do this.
SARA: You're just making it harder.
SARA: ( SNAPS )
REBECCA: That didn't sound good. Boyfriend?
SARA: Off Rebecca's confused look.
SARA: It's complicated. A beat. Rebecca's warm smile makes Sara want to open up. They walk along the stacks of books.
SARA: We dated since tenth grade and were supposed to go to college together.
REBECCA: No?! He took it? ( Sara nods glumly ) What an asshole.
SARA: Do you miss him?
REBECCA: Do you miss him?
SARA: Sometimes I think I do.
REBECCA: It's hard to let go.
SARA: Oh my God.
REBECCA: Sara walks to the closet. Her modest clothes hang on one side. But the other side is now taken up by Rebecca's KILLER
SARA: I am so jealous.
REBECCA: I know. I've got a lot of clothes. Mind if I put some on your side?
SARA: No problem.
REBECCA: Borrow anything you want. Really. I haven't worn half of them. Sara reverently fingers through them. Chloe. De La Renta. Alexander McQueen. Jimmy Choo shoes. A Miu Miu handbag. Some still carry their price tags.
SARA: Jesus, some of these I've only ever seen in Vogue.
REBECCA: My parents idea of bonding is to turn me loose in Beverly Hills with a Platinum card.
SARA: Oh, you here?
REBECCA: Off Sara's confused look.
SARA: That's cool. You can go home on weekends. Free laundry. Free meals.
REBECCA: Not gonna happen. Sara gives her a puzzled stare.
REBECCA: It's a long story.. .Let's just say nothing's free in my house. She wants to know more. but it's too soon to pry. She nods at Rebecca's drawing pad.
SARA: Can I take a look? She walks over. Rebecca clutches the pad to her chest.
REBECCA: Sara stops dead in her tracks. Rebecca realizes that came across pretty harsh.
REBECCA: Not till it's done. Nothing personal. It's just my. process.
SARA: ( SMILES BACK )
REBECCA: I thought you were a design major. Why are you taking Calc and The girls get up with their trays.
SARA: ( with a smirk ) I am. I want to be well-rounded. ( off her look ) And they're requirements.
SARA: Hey. Tracy. Kim. this is my roommate, Rebecca. She turns, but Rebecca is standing at a distance. Sara waves her over. Rebecca comes, reluctantly. She flashes a small wave.
REBECCA: RRRRRREBECCA. How formal. What can we call you?
TRACY: RRRRRREBECCA. How formal. What can we call you?
KIM: How 'bout Reba? Tracy sticks her finger down her throat. Gag me.
SARA: I like Becca. Tracy's grimace vetoes that one, too.
TRACY: How 'bout Becky?
SARA: Becky's good. The girls all turn to Rebecca for approval.
REBECCA: I like Rebecca. Rebecca walks out. Sara shrugs at Tracy and Kim.
TRACY: Rebecca walks out. Sara shrugs at Tracy and Kim.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: So. here we are. Design 101. And each one of you is asking yourself the same question. ( he taps his own chest ) Who is this guy? Why should I turn off my Blackberry and pay attention to him? Mild laughter from the class.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: I'll tell you why because I hold the keys to the kingdom. Think of your favorite designers. Marc Jacobs. Vera Wang. Rick Owens. Magicians, right? I've got news for you: All of their magic stems from the same source: the fundamental principles of design.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: The journey to the catwalks of New York. Paris. Tokyo. starts right here, in this room. And all you have to do is open your minds. Man, she wants in.
SARA: Professor Roberts? He flashes a disarming smile.
SARA: I'm sorry to bother you, it's I absolutely must take this class.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: I'm afraid we're full. But don't worry Intro Design has three other sections.
SARA: But you're not teaching them. I want to learn from the best. He smiles at her.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: What's your name?
SARA: Sara Matthews.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Tell me, Sara why should I sign your request form when I've turned down a dozen others? Would that be Sara's face falls. A long beat.
SARA: No, I guess it wouldn't. Thanks She walks toward the door. Roberts' eyes go to her ass.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: ( SHE TURNS )
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Style. And Desire. He smiles, signs the form and hands it to Sara. Sara clutches the form to her chest, smiling.
SARA: Rebecca removes her earbud.
SARA: What's your Facebook page? I'll add you as a friend.
REBECCA: I don't have a Facebook page.
SARA: Nope. I don't spend a lot of time
REBECCA: Nope. I don't spend a lot of time
SARA: Come here. Rebecca walks over and looks at the computer over Sara's ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Sara's Facebook Page. Her picture in the corner. Pictures and posts from a dozen friends. Among them: A STYLISH, ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in her 20s.
REBECCA: Who's she?
SARA: Irene. She graduated from the Art Institute out here last year.
REBECCA: ( INTRIGUED )
SARA: A design apprentice for Marc Jacobs. Hey, check out these Sara scrolls down Irene's recent posts: "Paris was amazing". "Milan in the Fall". "Off to Barcelona". etc.
SARA: I mean.. .who doesn't have a Facebook page?! Rebecca laughs.
REBECCA: Okay, okay. I'll get one. Tracy knocks on the partially open front door. and marches right in.
TRACY: Cancel those library plans. Guess who made the guest list at Rebar?
SARA: Of course.
REBECCA: I don't.
TRACY: Yes you do. Thanks to my badass Tracy pulls out a fake ID. She walks to Rebecca and holds it out to her. A peace offering. Rebecca stares at Tracy for a beat. then goes back to her I'll pass. Clubs really aren't my Tracy stands there, hung out to dry, the ID in her hand.
REBECCA: I'll pass. Clubs really aren't my Tracy stands there, hung out to dry, the ID in her hand.
TRACY: How great is this? No parents. No No shit! They clink their empty glasses in a toast.
SARA: No shit! They clink their empty glasses in a toast.
SARA: Can I? She puts her wallet and cell phone into Tracy's purse.
TRACY: Too bad Rebecca blew us off. Talk about the life of the party.
SARA: Don't be mean.
TRACY: I'm just saying.
SARA: She's just a little hard to get to Yeah right.
TRACY: Yeah right.
SARA: What do you think?
TRACY: I think. Tracy raises her shot glass. She and Sara clink and drink. Tracy waves at the suits again. Thanks guys.
TRACY: We can do better. She takes Sara's hand and pulls her out onto the dance floor.
SARA: EXT. CLUB - NIGHT A bummed Sara walks out of the club alone. She rubs her arms against the chill. She nervously tugs on her silver chain as she scans the STRAGGLERS loitering outside.
SARA: ( LOUD )
REBECCA: OPERATOR ( O.S. ) Would you accept a collect call from. Sara Matthews?
REBECCA: She smiles.
REBECCA: I'm fine. Just in a hurry. She keeps pumping. Speeding it up. Rick ambles up to her, treading beyond appropriate personal space. He points to the "Full Service" sign.
RICK: Just doing my job. She stands her ground as he places his hand over hers on the gas pump and squeezes. She looks down at his hand on top of hers. Then lets go of the pump, nudging his hand away.
REBECCA: All done. She pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it back at the pump. He stops her. Motions to her face.
RICK: You have a little something. No, she doesn't. He, ever so gently, rubs his index finger and thumb on her cheek to remove the imaginary smudge until he lurches back.
REBECCA: But she does it again, holding the lever down, dousing him head to toe. He scrambles backward out of range.
RICK: You spoiled c- He spots the lighter in her hand. Dead stop. She absentmindedly flicks it. It sparks but doesn't light.
REBECCA: She gets into her car and drives off. Leaving Rick soaked in INT./EXT. DINER - NIGHT Sara sits by herself in a booth by the window. Hugging a cup of hot, sobering coffee. Rebecca's car pulls up into a parking spot. The headlights shine right in Sara's eyes. and now turn off. Sara's tired eyes light up as she sees Rebecca get out of the car. She waves. Rebecca doesn't wave back as she heads for the door.
SARA: Nice car.
REBECCA: ( BEAT )
SARA: No idea, I couldn't find her. Rebecca sits down, dropping her purse and keys on the table.
REBECCA: As long as I'm here. you hungry?
SARA: Sara smiles gratefully. Rebecca opens the menu.
REBECCA: I can't believe she ran out on you.
SARA: I know. Thanks for coming. Rebecca looks up from the menu.
REBECCA: Tracy had her shot tonight. Tomorrow you're all mine. I'll show you the big city.. .the right way. And I promise I won't abandon you. Sara smiles.
SARA: INT. MOCA - DAY Rebecca leads Sara through the sculpture room.
REBECCA: These are the modern pieces. A little wilder than the old stuff. She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't just walk past pieces she studies them. Sara's impressed. Sara's cell phone buzzes. She checks the display: "Jason". She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes. She buries her cell phone in her purse. Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it.
SARA: Okay, I have no idea what this is supposed to be.
REBECCA: ( LAUGHING )
REBECCA: This is my favorite. Sara steps closer to examine it. Rebecca stays behind her.
REBECCA: I love how he captures her personality through her eyes. It's like she really wants to help you. Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants Sara to like this painting. Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is actually pretty sinister. Sara's a little freaked out. but she turns to see Rebecca's hopeful expression. Sara brightens.
SARA: Amazing. I love it.
SARA: That is so cool.
REBECCA: No graffiti in Des Moines?
SARA: Sure. "Bobby loves Jenny. Chrissy loves Rick." Nothing like this. Rebecca pulls out her camera.
REBECCA: Hey, smile. Sara poses. but now grabs Rebecca and pulls her in.
SARA: Both of us.
REBECCA: Now that's one "art form" I don't get. Needles into skin? No thanks.
SARA: I have a tattoo. Rebecca smiles. Yeah, right. But she can see in Sara's eyes that she's serious.
REBECCA: Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over her heart, a simple tattoo: "Emily".
SARA: My older sister. She died when I was nine.
REBECCA: Oh, I'm sorry.
SARA: ( pats her heart ) This keeps her with me.
REBECCA: I always wanted a sister. Sara smiles and interlocks her arm with Rebecca's as they walk down the street.
SARA: Guess who I'm listing as my favorite artist on my Facebook Richard Prince. Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched. She walks over to check out the rest of Sara's Facebook Favorites. Favorite book, favorite band, etc.
REBECCA: ( LAUGHING )
SARA: Don't laugh. It's about a small town girl making it in the big Isn't every movie?! They both laugh.
REBECCA: Isn't every movie?! They both laugh.
SARA: Hey there.
SARA: Look at you. She kneels and pets it. The kitten purrs.
SARA: No collar, baby? Sara glances around to see if anyone is watching.
SARA: ( TAKEN ABACK )
REBECCA: I thought you'd like it. Rebecca sees the moving bulge under Sara's jacket. She cuts Sara a look. Sara sighs. Apprehensively, she unzips her jacket and the kitten pops out. Rebecca sits up. The kitten jumps over to her bed. She pets it.
REBECCA: I know, I know. It's stupid, and I've just broken about forty different dorm rules, and I should just take it to a shelter.
SARA: I know, I know. It's stupid, and I've just broken about forty different dorm rules, and I should just take it to a shelter.
REBECCA: ( BEAT )
SARA: It'll be our secret. Just between Rebecca keeps petting the kitten. Getting more attached.
REBECCA: It'll be our secret. Just between Rebecca keeps petting the kitten. Getting more attached.
SARA: I named her in the elevator. She smiles and scoops her up. Suddenly, her smile vanishes.
SARA: Is that my necklace? Rebecca touches it. She'd forgotten she still had it on.
REBECCA: Sorry. I was just trying it on. Sara puts down the kitten and walks to Rebecca, who quickly takes it off. Sara takes it back, annoyed. She rubs it This was my sister's.
SARA: This was my sister's.
REBECCA: Sara looks at it a moment longer. She looks at Rebecca.
SARA: You can borrow anything of mine. Except for this. Okay? It's the only thing I kept of hers. Rebecca nods. Sara sits down on the bed next to her.
REBECCA: I'm really sorry.
SARA: It's okay. You didn't know.
REBECCA: Were you two close?
SARA: Yeah. You're the first roommate I've had since she died. So, it feels a little odd.
REBECCA: In a good way or a bad way? Sara smiles.
SARA: A good way.
SARA: ( TO CUSTOMER )
STEPHEN: This seems like a pattern. Sara smiles. She's psyched to see him, in spite of the havoc. She leans in and speaks quietly.
SARA: Just because I kissed you doesn't mean I'll let you cut in line.
STEPHEN: So what does it mean?
STEPHEN: Hey, the gentlemen of Psi Upsilon are reviving a sacred tradition Sara stares at him blankly. He smiles.
STEPHEN: We're having another keg party.
SARA: I.. dunno. I'm still having flashbacks from the last one. Sara laughs.
STEPHEN: You know what? How about if I use you as my excuse not to go. Sara smiles, bits of smoothie dripping from her apron.
TRACY: Sara thinks about ignoring her but stops. Her tone is cold.
SARA: Psi U. tonight?
TRACY: Psi U. tonight?
SARA: So you can ditch me again?
TRACY: Sara. the guy had a Porsche. And a hot tub.
SARA: That's your apology? Tracy jumps up and walks over.
TRACY: What I meant to say is I'm sorry I totally screwed up. Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out. She watches Tracy and Sara. Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes. Sara laughs.
SARA: I forgive you. Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug. Over Sara's shoulder, she spots Rebecca looking at them. Tracy flashes a big smile. Relief at making up with Sara. But that's not how Rebecca takes it.
SARA: But you're on your own at Psi U. Someone has a date. Rebecca hears this. She slips back into the room and closes the door. Sara turns and walks down the hallway.
SARA: You look. nice.
REBECCA: ( EXCITED )
SARA: Actually, I. sort of have a date?
REBECCA: ( DISAPPOINTED )
SARA: You know, I could reschedule.
REBECCA: ( being a martyr ) You don't have to.
SARA: I want to. On one condition. Sara pulls a cute jacket from her closet and puts it on Rebecca. They both look at Rebecca in the mirror. Wow. Rebecca smiles.
REBECCA: I love it, who's the designer?
SARA: What are you, a label whore?! Who cares .I got it at a flea market and it looks great with the dress. Rebecca nods in agreement.
SARA: It just needs one last touch. She grabs a pair of small, gold hoop earrings from her dresser. She places them in Rebecca's hand.
SARA: I'm gonna jump in the shower, then we'll head out. She grabs her stuff and hurries out the door. Rebecca eyes the earrings in her palm. She turns towards the full-length mirror behind the door. As she leans into the mirror, we see that her ears aren't pierced. She takes one of the earrings and touches the pin against the skin of her right lobe. After a moment of hesitation. SHE PUSHES THE PIN IN HARD. A small pop. She flinches. Blood trickles down her ear onto her neck. She wipes it off with her thumb and touches the other hoop to her left ear.
TRACY: Water. I need water. She stumbles to the mini-fridge and looks in: Empty. She groans. She grabs an empty cup. opens her door. And lets out a sharp little scream.
TRACY: Rebecca? What are you doing? Rebecca cocks her head at Tracy, as if she's trying to comprehend her. A beat. She stands. and walks to her. Tracy takes a step back, shaken by Rebecca's calm, morose demeanor. Rebecca stares right into her eyes. She makes a slight move towards Tracy, who flinches. Rebecca turns and walks down to her room. At her door, she turns and smiles. She disappears into her room. Tracy stands there, spooked.
SARA: Hey. How was the party? Are you still the beer bong queen? But Tracy's in no mood to joke. She pulls Sara to a stop.
TRACY: Listen. something is up with your What do you mean?
SARA: What do you mean?
TRACY: She was outside my room this Doing what?
SARA: Doing what?
TRACY: Waiting for me. I opened my door. and there she was. Just sitting there, staring. Like some psycho.
SARA: Are you sure?
TRACY: You don't believe me?
SARA: No, it's just. why would she do Why don't you ask her? I've gotta go.I'll see ya later. Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy turns to go the other way, but before she leaves her eyes catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building. Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway. Tracy leaves in a hurry.
TRACY: Why don't you ask her? I've gotta go.I'll see ya later. Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy turns to go the other way, but before she leaves her eyes catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building. Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway. Tracy leaves in a hurry.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Contrary to popular opinion, beauty is not in the eye of the beholder. It's in the hands of the designer. Sara listens intently, soaking it all in. Her cell buzzes with a text message. She discreetly takes a look.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Who can tell me the difference between fashion and style? FROM IRENE: "4th & ford. be there now." Sara smiles at the Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and calls on her.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Miss Matthews? Without missing a beat, Sara replies.
SARA: Fashion's something you can buy, but style you either have or you Exactly. All the money in the world can't buy you style.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Exactly. All the money in the world can't buy you style.
SARA: But it can buy you a good stylist. The class chuckles. Professor Roberts smiles.
SARA: Hey. How'd you know when my class got out? Rebecca shrugs, playing it off.
REBECCA: I'm your roommate. Sara smiles and grabs a cup.
SARA: CUT TO:
SARA: Listen. Tracy told me something kinda weird. She says you. scared her this morning. Rebecca stops and looks at Sara. She starts laughing.
REBECCA: It's more like she scared me. She was racing to the bathroom like she was gonna hurl. She almost knocked me over. A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles.
SARA: It's more like she scared me. She was racing to the bathroom like she was gonna hurl. She almost knocked me over. A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles.
REBECCA: It's more like she scared me. She was racing to the bathroom like she was gonna hurl. She almost knocked me over. A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles.
SARA: The girl does like to party. Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it. Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from Irene: "where r u?!?!?!"
SARA: I gotta go meet Irene. ( raises her cup ) Thanks for the coffee. Rebecca watches her walk off. She takes another sip.
IRENE: ( mouth full of pins ) She gets up to hug Sara. Nearly tearing the dress.
SARA: I so want to be you when I grow up.
IRENE: Hell, I wanna be me when I grow up.
IRENE: You know, your dad left me four messages last week. Making sure I'm looking out for his baby.
SARA: Oh god. I hope you told him I'm closing down the library every I told him I haven't seen you. And that for all I know you're a crack ho by now. Even the model laughs.
IRENE: I told him I haven't seen you. And that for all I know you're a crack ho by now. Even the model laughs.
SARA: INT. LIBRARY - DUSK Sara walks along, looking for a table. She spots Stephen sitting by himself. Drumming on his leg with a pencil. Ignoring the open textbook in front of him. She sits down across from him. They both smile.
STEPHEN: I haven't seen you around too much since you blew me off for dinner.
SARA: Sorry again. Actually, how about dinner tonight?
STEPHEN: Hellllo. I'm studying. She takes his book. He's on page two.
SARA: Page two? Busted!
STEPHEN: Yeah, but it's really dense. Off Sara's smile.
KIM: How's it goin?
TRACY: Tracy, wearing just a towel, and brushing her teeth as she walks, steps into the bathroom.
TRACY: You have to be kidding me. Hey! The only light is some distorted moonlight through the window. Tracy steps out of the shower, grabbing her towel. Just as she starts to feel her way along the wall. The lights come back on. She sighs happily. sheds her towel. and steps back under the steaming water. A beat. The lights go off again.
TRACY: Goddammit ! She turns off the shower. A beat of silence, but now. one of the other showers turns on. What the hell?
TRACY: Hey, how about turning on the No response. Yet another shower turns on.
TRACY: Who's out there? Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along the wall again. She turns on the lights. The curtains are drawn in front of both running showers. Tracy stares at them. A beat.
TRACY: I know it's you. She walks over to the shower. A beat. She rips away one curtain. Nothing behind it but the running shower. She turns it off. She stares at the other curtain.
TRACY: Sara thinks you're weird. She told She pulls back the other curtain. nothing. She turns off that shower, too. But she can still hear running water. She looks back. The curtain from her own shower is closed again. The sound of running water behind it. She walks over.
TRACY: Not funny, Rebecca. ( under her breath ) She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the curtain open to see. Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around no one. She slips her towel off and slips back under the water. Screw Rebecca she's going to finish this shower.
TRACY: Just as the warm water starts to relax her. THE SHOWER CURTAIN CRASHES OVER HER, pile-driven by Rebecca. The curtain comes right off the rings. Tracy is slammed against the shower wall. She hits the floor hard, with Rebecca on top of her. Water pelting them both.
REBECCA: So Sara thinks I'm weird? Let me tell you what I think. I think you're a little whore, and a bad influence on her. And I think that if you tell anyone about. what I'm about to do. you'll regret Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other hand beneath the shower curtain. Tracy's eyes widen further. Rebecca finds what she's looking for. gets the grip she needs. and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain. A muffled scream from Tracy. Tears stream down her face. Rebecca stands. As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor, Rebecca looks down at. The bloody ring in her hand.
REBECCA: Nice belly ring. She tosses it to Tracy. and walks away.
STEPHEN: I'm going to flunk my test tomorrow, thanks to you.
SARA: Then let's make sure it was worth She gives him a slow, lingering kiss.
STEPHEN: Duh, joke's on you. I was going to flunk anyway. She smiles.
STEPHEN: Thanks for helping me. not study.
SARA: He kisses her. Sweet and tender. Until. Sara sees Rebecca. Standing just five feet away. Staring at them.
REBECCA: Where were you?
SARA: Oh, hi.
REBECCA: I kept calling and calling.
SARA: Oh. I turned my cell off at the library and forgot to turn it back Rebecca. this is Stephen. He flashes a smile. Rebecca doesn't even look at him.
REBECCA: I'm going to bed now. I'm glad you're okay. She walks out of the lounge. A beat. That was awkward. Sara bites her lip, as if to say: "What can you do?"
STEPHEN: You got a curfew?
SARA: Well, she's right.I shoulda He smiles no big deal. He kisses her and steps into the elevator. They look at each other, waiting for the ancient doors to close. Stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more kiss. The doors close. Sara smiles; what a night. She glances down toward her door and sighs.
SARA: I guess I'll see you later.
REBECCA: ( SHE TURNS )
SARA: You don't need to worry about me. I can take care of myself. Okay? Rebecca slowly nods.
REBECCA: Sara. We're good, right? A beat. Sara nods and smiles.
SARA: I'm already her best friend?
STEPHEN: That's a little sad.
SARA: But the look on her face says she agrees.
STEPHEN: Maybe she REALLY likes you.if you know what I mean. She looks at him quizzically.
SARA: I don't. He just looks at her, raising his eyebrows suggestively.
REBECCA: Stephen stops dead. Did he hear something? Guess not. He keeps going, scanning the book numbers again.
STEPHEN: Shit, wrong aisle. He doubles back, and turns into Rebecca's aisle. But it's. EMPTY. We hear a door close in the distance.
STEPHEN: Should we head back home? They walk by a small playground comprised of the slide, jungle gym, etc.
SARA: The question is "whose home?"
STEPHEN: I'll make you a bet. I go back to your place or you take me home to my twin bed and roommate.
SARA: I'll make you a bet. I go back to your place or you take me home to my twin bed and roommate.
STEPHEN: What's the bet? She eyes the jungle gym.
STEPHEN: This is kind of a stupid bet.
SARA: Why'd you agree?
STEPHEN: Apparently, I'm kind of a stupid Making me laugh isn't going to help They stare each other down. She's stifling a laugh, much more in control as Stephen is straining.
SARA: Making me laugh isn't going to help They stare each other down. She's stifling a laugh, much more in control as Stephen is straining.
STEPHEN: She seductively walks back towards him. Takes his hand.
SARA: So.let's go back to your place. She gives him a seductive grin.
REBECCA: JASON ( O.S. ) Sara, you answered. Thank you. Can we talk. about us? Rebecca's eyes clear. She's in control again. She sits down on Sara's bed, tossing Cuddles roughly to the floor. And now she lies down.
REBECCA: ( WHISPERS )
REBECCA: I want you, Jason.
REBECCA: I miss touching you. Do you miss touching me?
REBECCA: Prove it.
STEPHEN: Just give me thirty seconds.
SARA: You're kidding.
STEPHEN: Almost there.
STEPHEN: Yeah, right. He's not quite buying it. but he's cleaning faster.
STEPHEN: You know I don't believe you.
STEPHEN: I'm just going to put your clothes back on and make you strip again.
SARA: Who do we have here? Hey guys! Let me ask you. Bra or panties? Bra? Okay, okay. Just calm down. The door swings open. Stephen stands in front of her, I knew you didn't have the guts. She flicks her bra at his face. He catches it, shocked. He tosses it aside and yanks her into the room. The door slams shut behind them.
STEPHEN: I knew you didn't have the guts. She flicks her bra at his face. He catches it, shocked. He tosses it aside and yanks her into the room. The door slams shut behind them.
REBECCA: Say my name, Jason. Until I tell you to stop. She puts the phone on speaker and lays it on the pillow beside her. Both her hands ease back under the covers.
STEPHEN: INT. DORM ROOM - SAME Rebecca writhes and moans.
REBECCA: Don't ever call me again. She kills the call. And now deletes it from the phone log.
REBECCA: Well, good morning.
SARA: Hey. Sorry I didn't call. I forgot my phone.
REBECCA: No problem. Sara opens her desk drawer and grabs her phone. She quickly checks. No calls. Rebecca looks Sara over and smiles.
REBECCA: Come on.don't I get any details??
SARA: ( SMILING )
SARA: You want to go get some breakfa Before she can finish, Cuddles bolts out the door and down the hallway.
SARA: Oh no. Sara chases after her as Rebecca gets up from her bed.
SARA: She's cute. She nods as she gingerly takes Cuddles from his arms. She turns to walk back to the room.
SARA: Sara walks back to her room. Rebecca stands in the doorway. They exchange despondent looks. Screwed.
IRENE: What took you so long?
SARA: I walked.
IRENE: You didn't!
SARA: It's ten bucks for a cab and I'm a Sara! You can't just walk around downtown L.A. at night. This is not Des Moines.
IRENE: Sara! You can't just walk around downtown L.A. at night. This is not Des Moines.
SARA: Seriously, listen to me. That's why I own a gun. Sara's shocked.
IRENE: Seriously, listen to me. That's why I own a gun. Sara's shocked.
SARA: Absolutely! Big cities are crawling with crazies. Sara moves into the apartment. Her phone rings. She Hey. Oh, Hi. Yeah, I'm over at Irene's. I meant to leave you a note. Uh huh, uh huh, oh! That's a good idea. Let me check, hold on. Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene.
IRENE: Absolutely! Big cities are crawling with crazies. Sara moves into the apartment. Her phone rings. She Hey. Oh, Hi. Yeah, I'm over at Irene's. I meant to leave you a note. Uh huh, uh huh, oh! That's a good idea. Let me check, hold on. Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene.

SARA: ( TO IRENE )
IRENE: Yeah, why?
SARA: We have to get rid of one.
IRENE: Can't. Travel too much. Poor thing would starve to death.
SARA: You're right. ( back into phone ) No, she can't. Huh? Oh I don't know. whenever I get there. Bye.
IRENE: Who was that?
SARA: My roommate. More than a little That's no fun.
IRENE: That's no fun.
SARA: So, where is it?
IRENE: You said you had a surprise for me?
SARA: You said you had a surprise for me?
IRENE: Oh yeah. I went through my closet. There's nothing here I've worn in the past six months. Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes.
SARA: You're kidding, all of these?! Oh What .what?
IRENE: What .what?
SARA: We have no closet space at the dorms. Rebecca's already using half of mine.
IRENE: Oh my God, I just had the best Why don't you move in here with me?
SARA: Why don't you move in here with me?
IRENE: Why don't you move in here with me?
SARA: Yeah, I'm never here. The place is huge. Ditch the roommate. And, the building allows pets.
IRENE: Yeah, I'm never here. The place is huge. Ditch the roommate. And, the building allows pets.
SARA: Huh. Let me talk to Rebecca about So, how's Jason? I really liked We broke up.

SARA: We broke up.
IRENE: Yeah .he sucked.
REBECCA: Hey. What're those?
SARA: Irene gave them to me. She had a lot more but we don't have the Too bad she couldn't take Cuddles, Well, maybe that's not a problem.
REBECCA: Too bad she couldn't take Cuddles, Well, maybe that's not a problem.
SARA: Well, maybe that's not a problem.
REBECCA: Yeah. She actually suggested that I move in with her.
SARA: Yeah. She actually suggested that I move in with her.
REBECCA: ( BEAT )
SARA: No, of course not. I love living here. with you. Sara smiles as she sits down next to Rebecca, trying to put a bright spin on things.
SARA: Look, I'd still technically be living here. So you wouldn't have to get a new roommate. Her place is huge and it's not like you couldn't use the extra closet space. I'd just move some of my stuff over, and spend a few nights a week there. We'd both have a lot more I don't want more space. I want. She checks herself. A beat of awkward silence.
REBECCA: I don't want more space. I want. She checks herself. A beat of awkward silence.
SARA: Nothing's set in stone. It's just something to think about. Plus we'd be able to keep Cuddles. As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares across the room at. EXT. QUADS - DAY As Sara crosses the quads, she spots Tracy up ahead, walking by herself.
SARA: Tracy slows for a split-second, then keeps walking. As if she didn't hear anything. Sara hurries to catch up with her.
SARA: Tracy. hey.
TRACY: Oh, hey. Tracy smiles, but weakly. The girl's lost all her sparkle. Her eyes dart around nervously, like a bird's.
SARA: I heard you changed dorms.
TRACY: Yeah, Conrad Hall. Seemed like a better vibe.
SARA: Well, we should get together. Like grab a bite or something. Right?
SARA: Rebecca starts to walk over to Tracy and Sara.
TRACY: ( TO SARA )
SARA: What was that about?
REBECCA: What was that about?
SARA: I don't know. She just walked Well, she's always been a flake.
REBECCA: Well, she's always been a flake.
SARA: ( INTO PHONE )
SARA: Well, actually, I was thinking I'd do Thanksgiving here and see you guys for Christmas. She listens, her face telling us that she doesn't like what she's hearing.
SARA: Ya know what, I'm at work, and I'm really getting slammed. There isn't another customer in sight.
SARA: I'll call you later, okay? Tell Dad I said hello. Bye. She hangs up the phone and sighs.
REBECCA: Looks like it's just you and me INT. DORM BASEMENT HALLWAY - DUSK Rebecca walks downstairs, down the hallway to the laundry INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER Rebecca waits for her clothes to finish drying. Cuddles plays with a sock on top of a nearby washer. Rebecca checks on her clothes. They're dry, with two minutes still left on the timer. She stuffs the clothes into her duffle bag. She walks to the washers and picks up Cuddles. She pets her gently. She walks back to the dryer and places Cuddles inside.
REBECCA: ( BABY TALK )
SARA: Hey, what's wrong? Rebecca looks up at her, eyes red. Ashamed.
REBECCA: Cuddles got out.
SARA: Oh no. In the dorm?
REBECCA: I was doing laundry. I took her with me. She jumped out of the bag and ran outside. I went after her, but.
SARA: I was doing laundry. I took her with me. She jumped out of the bag and ran outside. I went after her, but.
REBECCA: I was doing laundry. I took her with me. She jumped out of the bag and ran outside. I went after her, but.
SARA: Maybe she'll come back.
REBECCA: ( EMPHATIC )
SARA: I'm going to go find her.
REBECCA: Do you want me to help? But Sara's already gone, slamming the door behind her.
SARA: Maybe it's. just karma or something. We weren't allowed to keep her anyway.
REBECCA: You're not mad at me?
SARA: It was an accident.
REBECCA: Is something else wrong? A beat as Sara decides whether to confide.
SARA: My parents really want me to come home for Thanksgiving.
REBECCA: You don't want to go?
SARA: It's not exactly the most festive holiday in the Matthews household.
SARA: I know I should be there with them, but it's like there's a ghost at the table.
REBECCA: You can come with me.
SARA: ( THROWN )
REBECCA: Yeah, spend Thanksgiving at my Your folks wouldn't mind?
SARA: Your folks wouldn't mind?
REBECCA: ( LAUGHS )
SARA: Okay, we'll see. Thanks.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Your midterm designs are due Friday. Remember, class: Simplicity. Who founded our industry? Eve when she handed Adam that fig leaf. Students laugh on their way out the door. As Sara walks past Sara. Could I see you in my office, Sure. I've got a class right now. But I'll come right after it.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Sara. Could I see you in my office, Sure. I've got a class right now. But I'll come right after it.
SARA: ( SURPRISED )
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: I don't think I need to tell you how impressed I've been with your Every year I go to Fashion Week in Paris. It's dazzling. The photo shoots. the parties. that incredible runway. When the first model bursts through the curtain and hits that catwalk? Sara, a roar goes up from that crowd that's like. nothing you've ever heard.
SARA: I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying what I think you're saying?
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: I'm saying you have a shot. You'd have to earn it, Sara.
SARA: Of course. I'll do. anything. Roberts stands and walks to the window. He looks out at the quad. and now turns back to Sara.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: I'd like to see more danger in your work. Your designs are always crisp; they're always clear. But they're a little. safe. That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face. Roberts walks over to her.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Don't be afraid to go to some of He delicately taps her temple.
SARA: He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now. He looks into her eyes.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: The best designers push the boundaries of what's. acceptable. They take chances. Do you like to take chances, Sara?
SARA: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: So do I. He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her chair. She stands in front of him, shaking.
SARA: I can't believe you just did that.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: I took a chance, that's all. With a student that I trust.
SARA: I better go. Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Paris, Sara. Fashion Week. Don't blow the chance of a lifetime. She hurries out of the office.
REBECCA: What's wrong?
SARA: My design professor just kissed me. Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next to Sara.
REBECCA: Are you alright? Sara nods.
SARA: Yeah, it just really creeped me out. And I think the asshole's Rebecca puts her hand on Sara's.
REBECCA: Professor Roberts?
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: That's right.
REBECCA: I'm glad I caught you.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Actually, I was just. But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels snapping on the worn hardwood floor.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: You're not one of my students.
REBECCA: Not yet. That's why I'm here.
REBECCA: I'm failing Intro Pysch.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: And why is that?
REBECCA: Because I'm bored. I thought it would be all about Freud, and deep dark secrets. But it's brain chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay awake in class.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not sure what I can do to help.
REBECCA: Tomorrow's the last day to drop a course without penalty. Unless I can add another one in its place, I'll fall way behind in credits. Daddy won't take that very well. He might even pull the plug. Which I'm pretty much at your mercy, Roberts smiles. This girl is a trip. Is she for real? She's
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Look, I've always made it a policy not to accept any students this late in the term.
REBECCA: Do I look like just any student to She smiles. and eases up onto his desk. Facing him. Pretty feet dangling, ankles locked. Jesus. She eases her purse off her shoulder and onto the desk. She sees the framed picture of a WOMAN AND TWO KIDS. She picks it Your wife is very pretty.
REBECCA: Your wife is very pretty.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Ex-wife . until he's behind Rebecca. his wedding ring. He palms it.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: A few things I'd need to know.
REBECCA: Ask me anything. He's circling the desk now. Predator and prey.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Do you have any design experience?
REBECCA: PROFESSOR ROBERTS
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: What do you know about clothes?
REBECCA: Only one thing.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: And what's that?
REBECCA: I definitely look better out of them than in them. What an answer. Roberts stops in front of her. He moves in Still steady.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: I think we might be able to work something out.
REBECCA: Great. Just tell me and I'll do Kiss me.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Kiss me.
REBECCA: Ow! You're hurting me! Professor, Roberts stares at her in shock. He's not even touching her. What's going on? Rebecca smiles again. This girl is whacked. But damn, Roberts wants her. And her eyes are inviting him back. As he presses in to kiss her She rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the floor, gasping for air. He drops his wedding ring, which rolls away across the floor. Rebecca steps to the desk, where her purse sits open. We can see the Walkman inside. She takes it out. Smiles at him.
REBECCA: Birthday gift. You should get one, they're great. She slips on the earbuds. plays with the Walkman for a few seconds. and now hits the play button. We hear their prior conversation, played back.
WALKMAN: Great. Just tell me and I'll do Kiss me. I'll take it from there.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: You bitch tease!
REBECCA: Oh, I'm not teasing. She starts to circle him now, as he writhes in pain on the Do you see enough danger in me now, Professor? Did I go to a dark enough place for you? He recognizes his own words to Sara.
REBECCA: Do you see enough danger in me now, Professor? Did I go to a dark enough place for you? He recognizes his own words to Sara.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: What? How did?. Who are you? He lunges at her ankle. She steps out of his grasp. and slams the sharp spike of her heel down on his hand. He yells She trusted you. She walks toward the door.
REBECCA: She trusted you. She walks toward the door.
PROFESSOR ROBERTS: Please don't do this. Twenty years. Everything I worked for. I'll pay for that tape.
REBECCA: Yes you will. She walks out the door.
STEPHEN: Anything wrong? Sara is taken out of her own world
SARA: Are you ok?
STEPHEN: Are you ok?
SARA: Yeah, sure.
WOMAN: Welcome. I'm Professor Jacobs. I'll be taking over the class for the rest of the semester. Sara can't believe it. She takes a seat and turns to the STUDENT next to her.
SARA: ( WHISPERS )
SARA: Remember what I told you about Professor Roberts?
REBECCA: He's gone.
SARA: He's gone.
REBECCA: What do you mean?
SARA: Well, they're calling it a leave of absence. But what I heard. someone sent the dean an anonymous recording of him hitting on another Oh My God.
REBECCA: Oh My God.
SARA: I know.
REBECCA: That's called Karma.
STEPHEN: I've made a decision. You ready?
SARA: Lemme hear it.
STEPHEN: I'm gonna quit the band.
SARA: No. Really? Why?
STEPHEN: It's a waste of time-and we suck.
SARA: Why would you say that?
STEPHEN: Well, let me think about this. The only places we can get booked is at my own frat house and at my girlfriend's coffee shop.
SARA: ( SMIRKS )
SARA: Hold it. Did you just say You heard me.
STEPHEN: You heard me.
SARA: So you think it'll be fun to stay here during Thanksgiving?
STEPHEN: Dinner at the frat, the football games. Don't forget the always awkward, homoerotic humor.
SARA: Sounds like a blast.
STEPHEN: Oh. For sure.
SARA: Oh my God. What happened? She cradles Rebecca, who buries her head in between her knees. Sara checks the bruises on her head and arms.
SARA: Rebecca. It's okay. You're safe now. Talk to me.
REBECCA: I was looking for Cuddles. A man. pulled me into an alley. He Sara holds her. She can't finish.
SARA: It's okay. It's okay. Shhh.
REBECCA: I got away.
SARA: You're alright now. Sara notices a streak of blood against Rebecca's shirt. She pulls it up and sees a slash. Gasps.
SARA: It's not deep, thank God. But you should see a doctor.
REBECCA: Rebecca, you need to. And then the Rebecca pulls back on her bed, ruining the gauze job.
SARA: Rebecca, you need to. And then the Rebecca pulls back on her bed, ruining the gauze job.
REBECCA: I don't want to. I can't. Sara pulls out her cell phone.
SARA: You're calling them, or I am. There's a psycho walking around this campus.
REBECCA: ( CRYING AGAIN )
SARA: Okay, okay. I won't call. Just let me help you. Rebecca calms down. Let's Sara finish. Watching her intently as she works.
SARA: Sorry about not staying. But, I get it.
STEPHEN: I get it.
SARA: Just say you'll miss me.
STEPHEN: I'll miss you. Rebecca pulls up in her car. Sara gets in. Rebecca gives Stephen an "I win" look as Sara closes the door.
SARA: I haven't heard from Jason in weeks. It's weird how he just stopped calling.
REBECCA: It's what you wanted, right? Sara nods, reassuring herself.
SARA: Yeah. Yeah it is. Sara looks out the window. Rebecca shows a hint of a smile.
SARA: This is your home?
REBECCA: It's my parents house. It was never a home.
DAD: ( SURPRISED )
MOM: ( ALARMED )
REBECCA: Nothing? This isn't nothing.
DAD: Nothing? This isn't nothing.
REBECCA: ( SNAPS )
DAD: Hello. And you are?
SARA: I'm Sara. She puts out her hand, but cuts Rebecca a look. You didn't tell them?
REBECCA: Sara's my roommate.
DAD: ( PLEASED )
MOM: It's so great to meet you, Sara. I'm Alison. Rebecca grabs Sara by the arm.
REBECCA: Come on, let me show you my room.
SARA: You didn't tell them we were They didn't need to know. Rebecca plops down on the bed. Sara looks around. It's a typical teenage girl's bedroom. Except, no posters. Just drawings covering the walls. The drawings are of teenage girls more precisely, they're different drawings of one teenage girl. They're odd, but compelling.
REBECCA: They didn't need to know. Rebecca plops down on the bed. Sara looks around. It's a typical teenage girl's bedroom. Except, no posters. Just drawings covering the walls. The drawings are of teenage girls more precisely, they're different drawings of one teenage girl. They're odd, but compelling.
SARA: These are interesting.
REBECCA: Yeah, some of my high school work. I haven't gotten around to takin them down.
SARA: Rebecca's a pretty great artist.
JEFF: Yeah, we think Rebecca is so Rebecca shakes her head, uncomfortable with the flattery.
SARA: She's an awesome roommate, too.
JEFF: ( looks at his daughter,
POINTEDLY ): That's nice to hear and I'm sure she likes you because she never brings anyone home before. Rebecca stares at her father.
REBECCA: What? As a parent you worry. You protect your daughter all her life and then she goes off to college and she's on her own. I'm just relieved she got a good roommate. Sara cuts discreet looks around the table. Who are these Sara, I'll make up a room for you
JEFF: What? As a parent you worry. You protect your daughter all her life and then she goes off to college and she's on her own. I'm just relieved she got a good roommate. Sara cuts discreet looks around the table. Who are these Sara, I'll make up a room for you
ALISON: Sara, I'll make up a room for you
REBECCA: She'll stay in my room. Sara turns to Rebecca, confused but willing to go along.
REBECCA: We can share the bed if you want. Sara looks down at her own "bed" and takes a glance at the walls. On the floor, she's going to be surrounded by the drawings of Rebecca looking at her.
SARA: Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca. They lay back to back. Rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed.
REBECCA: Thanks for coming.
SARA: Next Thanksgiving, you can run interference with my family.
REBECCA: Sara closes her eyes. It's silent. Rebecca turns over. A beat. She opens her eyes just inches from Sara. She ever so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes Sara's hair.
KITCHEN: Jeff opens the fridge. The soft light barely illuminates Rebecca, sitting stoically at the table behind her father. Jeff jumps. He recovers, standing by the open fridge.
JEFF: Becs. You scared me. Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty look. We know how much she hates nicknames.
JEFF: How're you doing?
REBECCA: Fine. My grades are good.
JEFF: That's not what I meant. She looks down at the table.
REBECCA: I'm making friends. Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat.
JEFF: Rebecca, look at me for a second. Now she looks at him.
JEFF: Your mother and I are very fond of I know. He doesn't know what else to say. Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall. Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the beach. on the ski slopes. on a cruise ship. They smile happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture.
REBECCA: I know. He doesn't know what else to say. Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall. Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the beach. on the ski slopes. on a cruise ship. They smile happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture.
JEFF: I just wanted to make sure. Good night, I'm heading back to bed. He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs.
ALISON: Hi Sara.
SARA: Hi. Rebecca's going to show me some of her high school hangouts.
ALISON: Alison peers up the stairs.
ALISON: Rebecca seems to be doing well.
SARA: Uhhh, yeah. I think she is.
ALISON: Is she taking her medication?
SARA: Alison turns to see. her daughter at the top of the stairs. Did she hear them? She walks down.
ALISON: Hey sweetheart. She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed.
REBECCA: ( TO SARA )
ALISON: Have a great time, you two.
REBECCA: Is everything okay?
SARA: Yeah. It's just. She wants to ask her about that medication.
SARA: Nice to see where you come from.
REBECCA: ( EMBARRASSED )
SARA: The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out. What's she doing with Rebecca? The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep glancing over, whispering to each other. Rebecca shoots them a look. Like a warning. They quiet. Start doing busy work.
REBECCA: ( TO SARA )
SARA: You know them?
REBECCA: They went to my high school.
SARA: Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye contact with the Brunette. The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves. Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance. As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible. The other two girls walk to the counter. They sneak glances at Rebecca as they order their drinks. Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls. Rebecca doesn't waver. She keeps staring at the Brunette. Suddenly, Rebecca gets up.
REBECCA: Let's leave. Rebecca walks towards the door. Sara, confused, gathers her things and gets up. Rebecca stops at the Brunette's table. The Brunette sits there, like a deer caught in headlights.
REBECCA: Hello, Maria.
MARIA: ( WARY )
REBECCA: Oh, I wanted to introduce you to Sara. My roommate. Sara gives a small wave to Maria, who looks her over. Almost as if she feels sorry for her.
MARIA: Rebecca keeps eyeing Maria, a superior grin on her face. An awkward beat. Everyone's tense. Sara clears her throat.
SARA: Well, we better go. Rebecca snaps out of it. Nods. They start to walk out. But as they open the door.
MARIA: Everyone turns to Maria. She looks Rebecca in the eye.
MARIA: We were never friends. Rebecca stares at her, grinding her teeth. The tension building. Maria doesn't back down, though. She needed to say this. Sara grabs Rebecca's shoulder, gently.
SARA: Come on, let's go.
SARA: I guess college is a fresh start for both of us. Rebecca doesn't look at her. Just a hint of acknowledgement on her face. Sara's phone buzzes. This gets Rebecca's attention. Sara looks at the text message she just received from Irene: "back in LA. lemme know abt movin in."
SARA: Irene's back in town. Sara types and sends a text back. Rebecca watches her.
REBECCA: ( not looking up ) Good run?
SARA: ( between deep breaths ) Great. You wanna go get dinner?
REBECCA: I'm going to the art studio.
SARA: Oh. Okay. Catch you later then.
REBECCA: Don't wait up, Sara.
REBECCA: Forgot my pad. She snags it from her bed and leaves. Sara eyes Rebecca's dresser. But first. She walks to the door and opens it.
STEPHEN: Your door was open.
SARA: Oh my God.
STEPHEN: Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her tight and speaks, muffled by her neck.
STEPHEN: What are those? A beat. Should she bring him into this?
SARA: That's what I intend to find out.
SARA: ( READING )
STEPHEN: Jesus. I thought she was just It says lithium can control the ( nodding at the bottles ) Maybe these are refills. Maybe she's been taking it all along.
SARA: It says lithium can control the ( nodding at the bottles ) Maybe these are refills. Maybe she's been taking it all along.
STEPHEN: Certainly doesn't seem like she's been taking them. He's right and she knows it. A beat.
SARA: I think it's time I moved in with INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT A stylish, hip night club. A sophisticated crowd. Irene and three FRIENDS sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic martinis and watching the dance floor. And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around her. She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca. Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom. As she winds her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices Rebecca. She pauses to watch her. THEIR EYES MEET FOR MORE
IRENE: I'm sorry to stare, but you are so Thanks. So are you. Great lips. What kind is it?
REBECCA SMILES: Thanks. So are you. Great lips. What kind is it?
REBECCA: Thanks. So are you. Great lips. What kind is it?
IRENE: It's cinnamon. Caffeinated. A girl never knows how late she's gonna Rebecca smiles. A beat.
REBECCA: Can I try it? Irene hands her the lip gloss. Rebecca takes her hand and pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips.
REBECCA: You're right. cinnamon. Irene smiles. This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's.
REBECCA: Why don't we get out of here. I'd invite you to my place, but I have a roommate.
IRENE: As luck would have it, I'm only two blocks away and.no roommate.
REBECCA: What are we waiting for?
IRENE: She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table.
REBECCA: Hey yourself. Where were you all Oh, I got inspired. I just lost track of time. Sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper, grabbing a towel. She's wearing a sportsbra, revealing her tattoo. Sara grabs a robe. A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the "big talk." She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca.

Sara grabs a robe. A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the "big talk." She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca.
SARA: I want a tattoo.
REBECCA: I want a tattoo.
REBECCA: I want a tattoo.
SARA: Please. It would mean a lot to me. I won't be able to do it without Sara looks into her plaintive eyes. So much want in them.
REBECCA: Please. It would mean a lot to me. I won't be able to do it without Sara looks into her plaintive eyes. So much want in them.
SARA: Um. sure. Okay.
SARA: You can't rush this, Rebecca. We can always come back.
REBECCA: I know what I want.
SARA: Okay. I'm out here if you need me. Sara sits down as the TATTOO ARTIST escorts Rebecca upstairs. She looks giddy and nervous. Sara waves. When she's gone, Sara takes out her phone and texts Irene.
STAIRS: Rebecca walks slowly down the stairs. Wincing in pain. Sara puts the phone back in her pocket and stands up.
SARA: Let's see it. Rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal, just under her collarbone:
"EMILY": Sara, stunned speechless, starts backing away from her.
REBECCA: ( SWEETLY )
REBECCA: If you want. you can call me Sara clenches her fists. She's shaking with rage. She moves toward Rebecca, whose grin fades.
REBECCA: What's the matter? Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out of her. And Rebecca can't believe it. She's that far gone. Her eyes search Sara's for an answer. Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door. Rebecca watches her leave through the front window. Sara never looks back.
STEPHEN: This is all you're taking?
SARA: I'll get the rest of my things when Irene comes back to town. He takes the box. Then notices
STEPHEN: Where's your necklace? She instinctively rubs the base of her neck.
SARA: I can't find it. It's okay.
STEPHEN: I'm not going back up there. He hands her the box. Time to man up.
SARA: I'm not going back up there. He hands her the box. Time to man up.
STEPHEN: Wait here. I'll go look for it. She kisses him tenderly, unbelievably appreciative.
STEPHEN: Have you seen Sara's necklace? Rebecca solemnly shakes her head. He looks around the dresser. In the drawers. Flips over Sara's pillow. Rebecca watches him.
REBECCA: What did I do? He stops searching. Looks at her.
STEPHEN: She just needs to move on.
REBECCA: With you? He doesn't answer. He keeps searching. but he can feel Rebecca's eyes on him now. Creepy. He gives up.
STEPHEN: If you do find it, can you let me Instead of answering, Rebecca raises her camera and takes his picture. Stephen stares at her, unnerved. He finally snaps out of it and walks out the door. She watches him go.
STEPHEN: You should call someone. The dean's office. Or at least your R.A. She keeps cleaning.
SARA: And tell them what? What has she really done to me? No one can do It's the weirdest thing, Stephen. The girl's own parents are afraid of her.
STEPHEN: Well, she sure scared the shit out of me. Sara really wants to change the subject. She holds up two of his t-shirts.
SARA: Are these dirty or clean? Stephen sniffs the shirts.
STEPHEN: Somewhere in between. She throws the t-shirts at him.
SARA: Seriously. Is it a game to be as loud as you possibly can? She waves her arms like a crazy person.
SARA: Hey, I'm going to hit the library.
STEPHEN: ( GETTING UP )
SARA: No, it's okay.
STEPHEN: Party starts at ten. Really cool I hear the drummer's really hot.
SARA: I hear the drummer's really hot.
STEPHEN: He may be, but I'm sleeping with his girlfriend. She kisses him.
JASON: Sara. I'm actually. I'm in front of your dorm. I just flew in. I'm at the Roosevelt Hotel, room 210. Call me, okay? He hangs up. Some students leave the dorm and he grabs the door before it closes.
JASON: Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash.
GIRL: Help me find the keg?
STEPHEN: Sure, I have to go look for my girlfriend anyway. She walks away. "Jerk". He grins. and now checks his watch. Where's Sara?
JASON: She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts kissing the back of his neck.
WHA: She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts kissing the back of his neck.
REBECCA: She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts kissing the back of his neck.
JASON: ( BEAT )
REBECCA: Kissing his back now, moving lower.
JASON: Oh, man, Sara. Oh, that feels good. She works her way back up to his ear.
REBECCA: ( WHISPERING )
REBECCA: ( WHISPERING )
JASON: I love you, Sara. She lets him have one, two, three seconds of heaven. Her hands reach behind her and ease out the utility knife.
REBECCA: But she doesn't love you. Jason's eyes fly open. That wasn't Sara's voice. And those aren't Sara's eyes boring into his. Rebecca leans down, her face to his. Jason's eyes widen in shock, horror, and now pain as her unseen hands drive the knife deep into his gut. He gasps.
REBECCA: You hurt her. She kisses him the last thing he'll ever feel. He shudders, trembles, and lies still, eyes open.
LIBRARIAN: We're about to close. Sara can't believe it's so late. She puts her things away. Grabs her phone to check the time, distracted by the "1 new voicemail" message. She's about to press the voicemail But a text comes in from Irene:
FRAT BOY: All hands on deck the keg's still alive.
SARA: INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Sara steps into the foyer.
SARA: There's a bedroom dead ahead. Warm light pours out. She slowly walks to the open door. looks in. and freezes. CLOSE ON SARA'S EYES. Horror-stricken by what she sees. The bedroom is dark, except for the single lamp, above. Irene. She lies on the bed, each of her wrists cuffed to a bedpost. A red Hermes scarf is stuffed in her mouth. Sara can't move. She stares at Irene in shock.
SARA: ( WHISPERING )
SARA: Rebecca holds the gun steady on Sara.
REBECCA: Sit down and shut up. Sara lowers herself into a black chair, her eyes on Irene. Rebecca picks up Sara's cell phone.
REBECCA: Listen to me. All I ever wanted was to be your friend. A beat. Sara knows she has to play this just right.
SARA: Rebecca, you are my friend.
REBECCA: No. Shut up. We're not friends. We're here because you betrayed me.
SARA: Rebecca, I'm sorry
REBECCA: Stop it. Stop saying things you don't mean. I protected you. From that whore Tracy and that nasty little kitten. and That scumbag of a professor.
SARA: What're you talking about? What'd you do to them? What'd you do to I got rid of them all. And how do you repay me? By leaving me. Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment. She looks at Irene. Sara digs deep. lifts up her face. and looks Rebecca in the eye. She puts everything she has into this.
REBECCA: I got rid of them all. And how do you repay me? By leaving me. Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment. She looks at Irene. Sara digs deep. lifts up her face. and looks Rebecca in the eye. She puts everything she has into this.
SARA: Rebecca, please forgive me. A long beat. Rebecca's face lights up.
REBECCA: Now we can start all over again. Let's make things the way they were, Sara. That first day. Just the two of us. Sara sees Rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands.
SARA: After all. you can only have one best friend.
REBECCA: After all. you can only have one best friend.
SARA: No! Don't! Rebecca whips the bag around Irene's head. Irene starts to buck and thrash. But it doesn't help her.
REBECCA: Lay still bitch.
SARA: Please. Don't do this. Sara stands. She stares at Irene. She can't watch her die. She walks toward the bed, ignoring Rebecca's gun.
REBECCA: Stop! I mean it. Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming. Rebecca realizes she can't stop Sara. She cracks Sara across the temple with the gun-butt, knocking her to the floor. She kneels down beside Sara. Worried. clearing the hair from Sara's face.
REBECCA: ( GENTLE )
REBECCA: Don't make me hurt you, Sara. I just want to be your friend.
IRENE: My phone. My phone. She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table. She rushes for it. No good the wire is cut!
SARA: The window! There's a fire escape. You can reach it.
IRENE: The window! There's a fire escape. You can reach it.
BLAM!: INT. BEDROOM The door shatters, and the bullet continues straight ahead and tears a pillow open, just beside Irene's head. Feathers go flying. Irene screams. Rebecca kicks the door open and steps in, gun in hand.
REBECCA: I know you're scared, Sara. But I promise, everything is gonna be She stops short at the sight of.Sara on the ledge. Rebecca turns and stares at Irene. Fresh panic rising in Irene's eyes.
REBECCA: Sorry, Irene. But she's my friend, not yours. She raises the gun at the helpless Irene. But out of nowhere STEPHEN, RUSHING UP FROM BEHIND, knocks her arm. The gun fires wildly, one bullet.
SARA: ( CRYING )
IRENE: He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her.
STEPHEN: Okay I've got you. Everything is gonna be okay! He pulls her halfway in the window. But a shadow rises behind him.
IRENE: A loud unpleasant sound. THUD! Irene screams. Then Stephen stiffens, his body straightening in shock. Something's wrong. And now Sara stares in horror as. Blood runs down his face. He looks into Sara's eyes. and lets go of her.
STEPHEN!!!!: A loud unpleasant sound. THUD! Irene screams. Then Stephen stiffens, his body straightening in shock. Something's wrong. And now Sara stares in horror as. Blood runs down his face. He looks into Sara's eyes. and lets go of her.
SARA: Stephen is out. She sees the gun in his belt. She pulls it out, spins, and levels it at Rebecca. The gun shakes violently in her hand. Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara, who is still on the floor.
REBECCA: You won't do it. We're fr Sara pulls the trigger. Click. Rebecca stares in shock. Click. Click. Click. Click. Sara closes her eyes in frustration. She drops the gun. Tears stream down Rebecca's face. She can't believe Sara pulled that trigger. But as if flipping a switch. Rebecca's sadness turns to rage. She balls her fists, her knuckles white, and. CHARGES at Sara full force, slamming her against the wall. She tosses her like a ragdoll across the room, where. Sara's head slams the nightstand, knocking the contents of Rebecca's purse everywhere. Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes. It hurts her to hurt Friends help each other. They take care of each other. Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca.
REBECCA: Friends help each other. They take care of each other. Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca.
SARA: Rebecca. We were never friends. That's the last straw. Rebecca comes hard, murder in her eyes. She grabs Sara around the throat, pulls her up from the floor, and slams her against the wall. She starts choking the life out of her. Sara's face turns red. Redder. But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens. Her eyes stare in shock. Sara pulls Rebecca's hands off her neck with one hand. The utility knife is in her other hand. stuck between Rebecca's shoulder blades. Rebecca falls to the floor, bringing Sara down with her. She won't let go of Sara. As she gasps for air, she sees. Sara's tattoo, visible beneath her torn shirt. Sara self- consciously notices her looking at it. Rebecca reaches out and grabs Sara's hand. Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from around Rebecca's neck. Irene is trembling in the bed. Too shocked to say anything.
STEPHEN: ( GROANING )
SARA: Stephen. Hold on. She finds her phone on the floor. She steps back to Stephen and cradles his head in her lap as she dials 911. He looks into her eyes and smiles. She smiles through her tears, love in her eyes.
SARA: Hey. How are you feeling? Stephen enters the room.
STEPHEN: Better now. You being here's gonna Sara smiles.
SARA: Just got here.
STEPHEN: Well let me give you some time to get settled in.
SARA: Actually, I need you right here, right now. Stephen grins. He likes where this is headed.
STEPHEN: CUT TO:
STEPHEN: This isn't exactly what I had in Sara grins.
SARA: Now I can get settled in.
STEPHEN: I'll be back to pick you up for dinner. You gonna be ready?
SARA: Stephen takes off down the hall. Sara follows him with her eyes before she goes back into her room.
