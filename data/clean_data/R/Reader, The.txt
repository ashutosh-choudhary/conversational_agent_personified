MICHAEL: INT. CLASSROOM. SCHOOL. DAY A TEACHER, in his sixties, has scrawled the words `Odysseus', `Hamlet' and `Faust' on the blackboard. The class of BOYS is attentive. Next to him, his friend HOLGER SCHLUTER. Across the way, RUDOLF.
TEACHER: The notion of secrecy is central to Western literature. You may say the whole idea of character in fiction is defined by people holding specific information which for various reasons - sometimes perverse, sometimes noble - they are determined not to disclose.
HANNA: You never tell me what you've been At school. Do you learn languages?
MICHAEL: At school. Do you learn languages?
HANNA: At school. Do you learn languages?
MICHAEL: What languages?
HANNA: What languages?

HANNA: It's beautiful.
MICHAEL: How can you tell? How do you know when you've no idea what it means?
HANNA: What about in German?
MICHAEL: In German?
HANNA: Do you have anything?
MICHAEL: Well, I'm writing an essay. It's about a play. By a writer called Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Perhaps you've heard of him?
MICHAEL: The play's called Emilia Galotti.
HANNA: Have you got it?
MICHAEL: Here. You can read it.
HANNA: I'd rather listen to you.
MICHAEL: All right. I'm not very good.
MICHAEL: Act One. Scene One. The setting : one of the prince's chambers. Prince - "Complaints, nothing but complaints, petitions, nothing but petitions. For goodness' sake, just imagine that people actually envy
HANNA: You're good at it, aren't you?
MICHAEL: Good at what?
HANNA: He smiles.
HANNA: Why are you smiling?
MICHAEL: Because I didn't think I was good at anything.
MICHAEL: What was all that about?
MICHAEL: I got up - at 4.30 - specially - it's the first day of the holidays, I'd been planning to surprise you -
HANNA: Poor little baby. Got up at four thirty - and on your holidays too.
MICHAEL: What is this? I was on your tram! You totally ignored me! What do you think I was doing? Why the hell do you think I was there?
HANNA: I haven't the slightest idea. And what you do is your business not
HANNA: And if you wanted to speak to me, I was in the first carriage. So why did you sit in the second?
HANNA: And now, thanks very much, I've been working, I need a bath. Get out, I'd like to be by myself.
MICHAEL: I didn't mean to upset you.
HANNA: You don't have the power to upset me. You don't matter enough to upset me.
MICHAEL: I don't know what to say. I've never been with a woman. We've been together four weeks and I can't live without you. I can't. Even the thought of it kills me.
MICHAEL: I sat in the second carriage because I thought you might kiss Kid, you thought we could make love in a tram?
HANNA: Kid, you thought we could make love in a tram?
MICHAEL: Is it true what you said? That I don't matter to you?
MICHAEL: Do you forgive me?
MICHAEL: Do you love me?
HANNA: Do you have a book?
MICHAEL: Oh. Well I do. I took something with me this morning.
HANNA: What is it?
MICHAEL: It's another play.
HANNA: We're changing the order we do things. Read to me first, kid. Then we make love.
MICHAEL: Intrigue and Love, a play by Friedrich Schiller.
MICHAEL: The Odyssey by Homer.
HANNA: What's an odyssey?
MICHAEL: It's a journey. He sets out on a
MICHAEL: "Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the man of twists and turns Driven time and again off course, once he had plundered The hallowed heights of Troy. Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds, Many pains he suffered, heartsick at the open sea, Fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.
MICHAEL: "And we will some new pleasures prove of golden sands and crystal brooks, with silken lights and silver hooks."
HANNA: Come here.
MICHAEL: I poked into the place aways and encountered a little open patch as big as a bedroom, all hung around with vines and found a man lying there asleep, and by Jinks it was my old Jim.
MICHAEL: "Lady Chatterley felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside her.

MICHAEL: I was wondering, do you think you could get some time off? Maybe we could go for a trip.
HANNA: What sort of trip?
MICHAEL: I'd love to go bicycling. Just for two days.
MICHAEL: I've got a guide-book. I've worked out the route. Look, what do you
HANNA: I think you like planning, don't
MICHAEL'S VOICE: "I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened of anything. Why should I be? I welcome obstacles, because they'll be like mountains I can fly over to be in your arms. The more I suffer, the more I'll love.
MICHAEL'S VOICE: "Danger will only increase my love, it will sharpen it, it will give it spice. I'll be the only angel you need. On this arm, Luise, you will go dancing through life. You will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. Heaven will take you back and look at you and say `Only one thing can make a soul complete, and that thing is love.'
WAITRESS: So what would you like to have?
MICHAEL: What are you having?
HANNA: You order. I'll have what you have.
BOYS: There's sausages, sausages or sausages. Give it to me, come on, give it here. Let me have a look. You always have the same thing.
WAITRESS: I hope your mother was happy.
MICHAEL: Thank you. She enjoyed her meal very much.

GERHARD: You'd better hurry. You know what she's like.

GIRL: You just wait. You wait and see.
TEACHER: Good morning, ladies. Gentlemen, please welcome your new fellow- students, treat them with courtesy,
SOPHIE: Hello. My name's Sophie.
MICHAEL: I'm Michael.
TEACHER: Everyone believes that Homer's subject is homecoming. In fact, The Odyssey is a book about a journey. Home is a place you dream of, it's not a place you ever attain.
TEACHER: Berg, I don't mean to distract you, but we're meant to studying Homer, not studying Sophia.
HOLGER: Michael the water's fantastic.

HOLGER: Now the Americans have allowed us back in our own lake.
SOPHIE: Why are they so loud?
HOLGER: You should see their stores. They have everything.
MICHAEL: Oh sure. Everything mankind could ever dream of.
SOPHIE: You don't like Americans?
MICHAEL: Just it's more fun without them.
SOPHIE: Why do you leave early?
HOLGER: He always leaves early.
MICHAEL: I'm sorry I'm late. I was held up at school.
MICHAEL: The Lady with the Little Dog. By Anton Chekhov.
MICHAEL: "The talk was that a new face had appeared on the promenade, a lady with a little dog."
SUPERVISER: Schmitz, one moment. We've got good news for you. Your work is good, we're going to promote you. To work with me in the office. It's more money. Congratulations.
HOLGER: Get a move on, we're leaving early Why? What for?
MICHAEL: Why? What for?
HOLGER: We're going back to Sophie's. It's your birthday. We're giving you a
SOPHIE: Come on, it's a surprise. We thought you'd like it. We've been planning it for weeks.
MICHAEL: I'm sorry. Really. I promised someone I'd do something else.
HANNA: Oh kid, kid. Stop.
MICHAEL: What's wrong?
HANNA: Nothing's wrong. It's nothing.
MICHAEL: You never ask, you never bother to ask how I am.
HANNA: You never say.
MICHAEL: It just happens to be my birthday. It's my birthday, that's all. In fact, you've never even asked when it is.
HANNA: Look if you want a fight, kid.
MICHAEL: No, I don't want a fight. What's wrong with you?
HANNA: What business is it of yours?
MICHAEL: It's always on your terms. Everything. We do what you want. It's always what you want. My friends were giving me a party!

PETER: Get the boy something to eat. I think we all knew you'd come back to us eventually.
ASSISTANT: Mr Berg. It is eight o'clock. Your Thank you.
MICHAEL: Thank you.
JULIA: I was early.
MICHAEL: They're uneasy. She looks a moment, then they sit down.
MICHAEL: Welcome back.
MICHAEL: So how will you decide?
JULIA: I don't know. I'm happy back in Berlin, I suppose.
MICHAEL: You've seen your mother?
JULIA: I wanted to get away. There was nothing more to it. It was Paris, but it could have been anywhere.
MICHAEL: Away from your parents?
MICHAEL: I'm aware I was difficult. I wasn't always open with you. I'm not open with anyone.
JULIA: I knew you were distant. I'd always assumed it was my fault.
MICHAEL: Julia. How wrong can you be?
MICHAEL: I admit it now, I was nervous.
JULIA: I was nervous too. It's silly isn't It is silly.
MICHAEL: It is silly.
JULIA: Thank you for dinner.
MICHAEL: I'll see you very soon.
JULIA: Good night, Dad.

MICHAEL: Then good.
LECTURER: Those of you for the special seminar group on The Legal System in the Third Reich, please stay on in this room. Professor Rohl will be here in a moment.
ROHL: Well, we seem to be quite a small group. A small group and a select one. Clearly, this is going to be a unique seminar. Let me start by thanking those of you who've chosen to take part. Good for you. A reading list, gentlemen.
MARTHE: And ladies.
MARTHE: So this is where you are.
MICHAEL: Yes. Come in.
MARTHE: You take work seriously.
MICHAEL: Oh I don't know.
MARTHE: You're rather a serious boy.

MARTHE: You're sure you want to work Well I do. But I won't work every See you tomorrow.
MICHAEL: Well I do. But I won't work every See you tomorrow.
MARTHE: See you tomorrow.

MICHAEL: For or against?
ROHL: INT. TOWN HALL. DAY A courtroom has been improvised inside the town hall. There are large windows, with milky glass, down the left-hand side. As ROHL and the STUDENTS arrive, the court is a melee of PHOTOGRAPHERS, LAWYERS and PUBLIC. The three JUDGES are already in place, next to six selected CITIZENS. MICHAEL and the others take places in the gallery
CLERK: All photographers are now asked to
JUDGE: The defendants, please.
JUDGE: The first thing I'm going to do is hear motions from each of the defendants' lawyers.
JUDGE: I am going to take these cases one by one.
MICHAEL: Do you want a pen?
MARTHE: I've got a pen.
JUDGE: Hanna Schmitz.
JUDGE: Your name is Hanna Schmitz?
HANNA: It is only when the JUDGE repeats the name that MICHAEL looks up, hearing it for the first time.
JUDGE: Can you speak louder please?
HANNA: My name is Hanna Schmitz.
JUDGE: Thank you. You were born on October 21st, 1922?
HANNA: At Hermannstadt. And you're now 43 years old?
JUDGE: At Hermannstadt. And you're now 43 years old?
HANNA: You joined the SS in 1943?
JUDGE: You joined the SS in 1943?
HANNA: What was your reason? What was your reason for joining?
JUDGE: What was your reason? What was your reason for joining?
JUDGE: You were working at the Siemens factory at the time?
HANNA: You'd recently been offered a promotion. Why did you prefer to join the SS?
JUDGE: You'd recently been offered a promotion. Why did you prefer to join the SS?
JUDGE: I'll re-phrase my question. I'm trying to ascertain if she joined the SS freely. Of her own free
JUDGE: I heard there were jobs.
HANNA: I heard there were jobs.
JUDGE: Go on.
HANNA: I was working at Siemens when I heard the SS was recruiting.
JUDGE: Did you know the kind of work you'd be expected to do?
HANNA: They were looking for guards. I applied for a job.
JUDGE: And you worked first at Auschwitz?
HANNA: Until 1944. Then you were moved to a smaller camp near Cracow?
JUDGE: Until 1944. Then you were moved to a smaller camp near Cracow?
HANNA: ROHL leans into MICHAEL.
ROHL: Are you OK?
MICHAEL: I'm fine.
JUDGE: You then helped move the prisoners west in the winter of 1944 in the so-called death marches?
ROHL: So what did you think?
MICHAEL: I don't know. It wasn't quite what I expecting.
ROHL: Wasn't it? In what way? What were you expecting?
DIETER: I thought it was exciting.
ROHL: Why? Why did you think it exciting?
DIETER: Why? Why did you think it exciting?
ROHL: Why? Why did you think it exciting?
DIETER: Because it's justice.
ROHL: I need to correct an impression. Dieter said yesterday this was about justice. But is it?
DIETER: I'd have thought it was obvious.
ROHL: Cowardice. It's cowardice, isn't it? It's bad conscience. It's the big cover-up.
DIETER: Cowardice. It's cowardice, isn't it? It's bad conscience. It's the big cover-up.
ROHL: Go on.
DIETER: After the war. The German people didn't want to look at what they'd Is that right?
ROHL: Is that right?
DIETER: Because they had too much to hide. All our parents are liars. All right, mine are. So it's left to us, isn't it?
ROHL: How so?
DIETER: Because we're not implicated.
ROHL: Aren't you? Good. So that's all right then.
MARTHE: No, but seriously, Dieter's right. My parents, I can't even talk to them. I don't love them. How could I? How could anyone love them? Because they've told themselves so many lies, they can't remember the truth, let alone admit it. Isn't that why we signed up for this I don't know. You tell me.
ROHL: I don't know. You tell me.
MARTHE: Speaking for myself.
ROHL: I'm not sure any more.
MICHAEL: I'm not sure any more.
ROHL: What did your father do, Dieter?
DIETER: If you want to know, he was in the Waffen SS.
DIETER: That's what I mean, that's what I'm saying. So were a million other That's exactly my point. That's why it's better not to pretend this is about justice. Forgive me, nor is it about getting into an emotional state. It has no purpose if it's just the young giving their parents a bad time.
ROHL: That's exactly my point. That's why it's better not to pretend this is about justice. Forgive me, nor is it about getting into an emotional state. It has no purpose if it's just the young giving their parents a bad time.
MARTHE: So what is it about? What do you Societies think they operate by something called morality. But they don't. They operate by something called law. You're not guilty of anything merely by working at Auschwitz. 8,000 people worked at Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 for murder. To prove murder you have to prove intent. That's the law. Remember, the question is never `Was it wrong?' but `Was it legal?' And not by our laws, no, by the laws at the

DIETER: But isn't that.
ROHL: Yes. The law is narrow.
DIETER: Yes. The law is narrow.
ROHL: Yes. The law is narrow.
ROHL: On the other hand, I suspect people who kill other people tend to be aware that it's wrong.
JUDGE: Miss Schmitz, you're familiar with this book.
HANNA: Parts of it have already been read out in court.
JUDGE: Parts of it have already been read out in court.
HANNA: Yes I know. I know Ilana Mather.
JUDGE: She was in the camp, wasn't she, when she was a child? She was with her mother.
JUDGE: In the book, she describes a selection process. At the end of the month's labour, every month, sixty inmates were selected. They were picked out to be sent from the satellite camp back to Auschwitz. That's right, isn't it?
HANNA: Yes, it's right.
JUDGE: And so far, each of your fellow defendants has specifically denied being part of that process. Now I'm going to ask you. Were you part of
HANNA: There is a stir among the other DEFENDANTS and in the court. They start talking to their LAWYERS.
JUDGE: So you helped make the selection?
HANNA: You admit that? Then tell me, how did that selection happen?
JUDGE: You admit that? Then tell me, how did that selection happen?
HANNA: There were six guards, so we decided we'd choose ten people each. That's how we did it - every month. We'd all choose ten.
JUDGE: Are you saying your fellow defendants took part in the We all did.
HANNA: We all did.
JUDGE: Even though they've denied it? But you admit it. You're saying you took part in the process.
JUDGE: Did you not realise you were sending these women to their
HANNA: Yes but there were new arrivals, new women were arriving all the time, so of course we had to move some of the old ones on.
JUDGE: I'm not sure you understand.
HANNA: We couldn't keep everyone. There wasn't room.
JUDGE: No, but what I'm saying : let me rephrase : to make room, you were picking women out and saying `You you and you have to be sent back to be killed.'
HANNA: Well, what would you have done?
HANNA: So should I never have signed up at
CLERK: Ms. Mather, they're ready for you
PROSECUTOR: In your book you describe the process of selection.
ILANA: Yes. You were made to work and then, when you were no longer any use to them, then they sent you back to Auschwitz to be killed.
PROSECUTOR: Are there people here today who made that selection?
ILANA: I need you to identify them. Can you please point them out?
PROSECUTOR: I need you to identify them. Can you please point them out?
ILANA: Her. And her. And her. And her. And her. And her.
ILANA: Each of the guards would choose a certain number of women. Hanna Schmitz chose differently.
JUDGE: In what way differently?
ILANA: She had favourites. Girls, mostly young. We all remarked on it, she gave them food and places to sleep. In the evening, she asked them to join her. We all thought - well, you can imagine what we thought.
ILANA: Then we found out - she was making these women read aloud to her. They were reading to her. At first we thought this guard, this guard is more sensitive, she's more human, she's kinder. Often she chose the weak, the sick, she picked them out, she seemed to be protecting them almost. But then she dispatched them. Is that kinder?
JUDGE: I want to move on now to the march. As I understand it, you and your daughter were marched for many Yes. It was the winter of 1944. Our camp was closed down, we were told we had to move on. But the plan kept changing every day. Women were dying all around us in the snow. Half of us died on the march. My daughter says in the book, less a death march, more a death gallop.
ROSE: Yes. It was the winter of 1944. Our camp was closed down, we were told we had to move on. But the plan kept changing every day. Women were dying all around us in the snow. Half of us died on the march. My daughter says in the book, less a death march, more a death gallop.
JUDGE: Please tell us about the night in the church.
ROSE: That night we actually thought we were lucky because we had a roof over our heads. We'd arrived in a village, as always, the guards took the best quarters, they took the priest's house. But they let us sleep in a church. There was a bombing raid. In the middle of the night. At first we could only hear the fire, it was in the steeple. Then we could see burning beams, and they began to crash to the floor. Everyone rushed, rushed to the doors. But the doors had been locked on the outside.
JUDGE: The church burned down? Nobody came to open the doors? Is that right?
ROSE: Even though you were all burning to
JUDGE: Even though you were all burning to
JUDGE: How many people were killed?
ROSE: Everyone was killed.
JUDGE: How did you survive?
ROSE: I needed to get away from the other women. Because they were panicking, they were screaming. I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand their screaming. I was more frightened of the other women than I was of the fire. So I too my daughter and led her to the upper floor. I can't defend what I did. It's impossible to defend. I took Ilana in my arms and I led her towards the fire. There was a small gallery at the side of the church on the upper level. It saved our lives. The gallery didn't burn.
JUDGE: Thank you. I want to thank you for coming to this country today to
DIETER: I don't know. I don't know what we're doing any more.
ROHL: Don't you?
DIETER: You keep telling us to think like lawyers, but there's something disgusting about this.
ROHL: How so?
DIETER: This didn't happen to the Germans. It happened to the Jews.
DIETER: What are we trying to do?
MICHAEL: We're trying to understand.
DIETER: Six women locked three hundred Jews in a church, and let them burn. What is there to understand? Tell me, I'm asking : what is there to
DIETER: I started out believing in this trial, I thought it was great, now I think it's just a diversion.
ROHL: Yes? Diversion from what?
DIETER: You choose six women, you put them on trial, you say `They were the evil ones, they were the guilty ones'. Brilliant!
DIETER: People go on about how much did everyone know? `Who knew?' `What did they know?' That isn't the question. The question is `How could you let it happen?' And - better - `Why didn't you kill yourself when you found out?'
DIETER: Thousands! That's how many. There were thousands of camps. Everyone
DIETER: Look at that woman.
MICHAEL: Which woman?
DIETER: The woman you're always staring at. I'm sorry but you are.
MICHAEL: I don't know which woman you mean.
DIETER: You know what I'd do? Put the gun in my hand, I'd shoot her myself.
JUDGE: Why did you not unlock the doors?
JUDGE: Why did you not unlock the doors?
JUDGE: I've asked all of you and I'm getting no answer. Two of the victims are in this court. They deserve an answer.
JUDGE: Here, this is the SS report. You all have copies.
JUDGE: This is the report which was written, approved and signed by all of you immediately after the event. In the written report, you all claim you didn't even know about the fire until after it happened. But that isn't true, is it?
JUDGE: Well? It isn't true.
HANNA: I don't know what you're asking.
JUDGE: The first thing I'm asking is, why didn't you unlock the doors?
HANNA: Obviously. For the obvious reason. We couldn't.
JUDGE: Why? Why couldn't you?
HANNA: We were guards. Our job was to guard the prisoners. We couldn't just let them escape.
JUDGE: I see. And if they escaped, then you'd be blamed, you'd be charged, you might even be executed?
HANNA: Well then?
JUDGE: Well then?
HANNA: If we opened the doors, then there would have been chaos. How could we have restored order?
JUDGE: So you did know what was happening? You did know? You made a choice. You let them die rather than risk letting them escape.
JUDGE: The other defendants have made an allegation against you. Have you heard this allegation?
JUDGE: They say you were in charge.
HANNA: It isn't true. I was just one of the guards.

BECKHART: She wrote it! She wrote the report. She was in charge.
JUDGE: Is that true?
HANNA: No. And I didn't write the report. Does it matter who did?
JUDGE: I need to see a sample of your My handwriting?
HANNA: My handwriting?
JUDGE: Yes. I need to establish who wrote the report.

ROHL: Why of course not?
MICHAEL: I can't. I can't do that. I can't talk to her.

MICHAEL: The Odyssey by Homer. "Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the man of twists and turns Driven time and again off course, once he had plundered The hallowed heights of Troy. Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds, Many pains he suffered, heartsick at the open sea, Fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.
MICHAEL: "Ah, how shameless - the way these mortals blame the gods. From us alone, they say, come all their miseries.
MICHAEL: "Who are you? Where are you from? Your city? Your parents? I'm wonderstruck - you drank my drugs, you're not bewitched."

MS BRENNER: Hanna has been in prison for over twenty years. She has no family. She has no friends. You're her only contact. And I'm told you don't visit her.
MICHAEL: No. I don't.
MS BRENNER: When she gets out, she's going to need a job. She's going to need somewhere to live. You can't imagine how frightening the modern world will seem to her.
MICHAEL: Yes. I'm still here.
MS BRENNER: I have no-one else to ask. If you don't take responsibility for her, then Hanna has no future at all.
MICHAEL: It's kind of you. Thank you for letting me know.
MS BRENNER: You're Michael Berg?
MICHAEL: MS BRENNER
MS BRENNER: Louisa Brenner. We were expecting you earlier.
MS BRENNER: I should warn you: for a long time Hanna held herself together. She was very purposeful. In the last few years she's different. She's let herself go.
MS BRENNER: They're in the canteen. They're just finishing lunch.
HANNA: You've grown up, kid.
MICHAEL: I've got a friend who's a tailor, he makes my suits. He'll give you a job. And I've found you somewhere to live. It's a nice place. Quite small but nice. I think you'll like Thank you.
HANNA: Thank you.
MICHAEL: There are various social programmes, cultural stuff I can sign you up for. And there's a public library very close.
MICHAEL: You read a lot?
HANNA: I prefer being read to.
HANNA: That's over now, isn't it?
HANNA: Did you get married?
MICHAEL: I did. Yes I did. We have a daughter. I'm not seeing as much of her as I would like. I'd like to see a great deal more of her.
MICHAEL: The marriage didn't last.
MICHAEL: Have you spent a lot of time thinking about the past?
HANNA: You mean, with you?
MICHAEL: No. No, I didn't mean with me.
HANNA: Before the trial I never thought about the past. I never had to.
MICHAEL: And now? What do you feel now?
HANNA: It doesn't matter what I think. It doesn't matter what I feel. The dead are still dead.
MICHAEL: I wasn't sure what you'd learnt.
HANNA: I have learnt, kid. I've learnt to
MICHAEL: I'll pick you up next week, OK?
HANNA: That sounds a good plan.
MICHAEL: Good. Quietly, or shall we make a big fuss?
HANNA: OK. Quietly.
MICHAEL: OK. Quietly.
HANNA: Take care, kid.
MICHAEL: You too.
MICHAEL: See you next week.
MICHAEL: She didn't pack. She never intended to leave.
MS BRENNER: She left me a message, a sort of will. I'll read out the bit that concerns you.
MS BRENNER: "There is money in the old tea tin. Give it to Michael Berg. He should send it, alongside the 7,000 marks in the bank, to the daughter who wrote the book. It's for her. She should decide what to do with it. And tell Michael I said hello. Tell him to get on with his life."
MS BRENNER: Do you want to see her?
MICHAEL: Ms Mather?
ILANA: Yes. You're Michael Berg. I was expecting you.
ILANA: So you must tell me: what exactly brings you to the United States?
MICHAEL: I was already here. I was at a conference in Boston.
ILANA: You're a lawyer?
MICHAEL: I was intrigued by your letter but I can't say I wholly understood it. You attended the trial?
ILANA: I was intrigued by your letter but I can't say I wholly understood it. You attended the trial?
MICHAEL: Yes. Almost twenty years ago. I was a law student. I remember you, I remember your mother very clearly.
ILANA: My mother died in Israel - a good many years ago.
MICHAEL: I'm sorry.
ILANA: Go on, please.
MICHAEL: Perhaps you heard. Hanna Schmitz recently died. She killed herself.
ILANA: She was a friend of yours?
MICHAEL: A kind of friend. It's as simple as this. Hanna was illiterate for the greater part of her life.
ILANA: Is that an explanation of her Or an excuse?
MICHAEL: Or an excuse?
ILANA: Or an excuse?
MICHAEL: No. No. She taught herself to read when she was in prison. I sent her tapes. She'd always liked being read to.
ILANA: Why don't you start by being honest with me? At least start that way. What was the nature of your When I was young I had an affair with Hanna.
MICHAEL: When I was young I had an affair with Hanna.
ILANA: I'm not sure I can help you, Mr. Berg. Or rather, even if I could I'm not willing to.
MICHAEL: I was almost sixteen when I took up with her. The affair only lasted a summer. But.
ILANA: But what?
ILANA: I see. And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge the effect she'd had on your life?
MICHAEL: She'd done much worse to other people. I've never told anyone.
ILANA: People ask all the time what I learned in the camps. But the camps weren't therapy. What do you think these places were? Universities? We didn't go there to learn. One becomes very clear about these
ILANA: What are you asking for? Forgiveness for her? Or do you just want to feel better yourself? My advice, go to the theatre, if you want catharsis. Please. Go to literature. Don't go to the camps. Nothing comes out of the camps.
MICHAEL: What she wanted.what she wanted was to leave you her money. I have with me.
ILANA: To do what?
MICHAEL: As you think fit.
MICHAEL: ILANA lifts the tin.
ILANA: When I was a little girl, I had a tea-tin for my treasures. Not quite like this. It had Cyrillic lettering. I took it with me to the camp, but it got stolen.
MICHAEL: What was in it?
ILANA: Oh. Sentimental things. A piece of hair from our dog. Some tickets to operas my father had taken me to. It wasn't stolen for its contents. It was the tin itself which was valuable, what you could do with
ILANA: There's nothing I can do with this money. If I give it to anything associated with the extermination of the Jews, then to me it will seem like absolution and that is something I'm neither willing nor in a position to grant.
MICHAEL: I was thinking maybe an organization to encourage literacy.
ILANA: There's a silence.
ILANA: Do you know if there's a Jewish I'll be surprised if there isn't. There's a Jewish organisation for everything. Not that illiteracy is a very Jewish problem.
MICHAEL: Do you know if there's a Jewish I'll be surprised if there isn't. There's a Jewish organisation for everything. Not that illiteracy is a very Jewish problem.
ILANA: I'll be surprised if there isn't. There's a Jewish organisation for everything. Not that illiteracy is a very Jewish problem.
ILANA: Why don't you find out? Send them the money.
MICHAEL: Shall I do it in Hanna's name?
ILANA: As you think fit.
ILANA: I'll keep the tin.
JULIA: Where are we going?
MICHAEL: I thought you liked surprises.
JULIA: I do. I do like surprises.
JULIA: Hanna Schmitz.
JULIA: Who was she?
MICHAEL: That's what I wanted to tell you. That's why we're here.
JULIA: So tell me.
MICHAEL: I was 15, I was coming home from school, I was ill.
