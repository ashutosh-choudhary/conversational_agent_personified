ROCKNROLLA: Written by Guy Ritchie
SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.): Two years ago this property cost one million pounds. (we SEE building) Today, it costs five million.
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.): How did this happen? (CUT TO relevant pictures as he speaks) Attractive tax opportunities for foreign investment, restrictive building consent and massive hedge fund bonuses,... (beat) London, my good man, is fast becoming the financial and cultural capital of the world.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT: And of course the Russians have come to town.
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT: Makes it hard to compete with an ex- Soviet oligarch that has six billion dollars in his back pocket. They don't haggle the price, they double the price.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT: Russians come, prices rise, and it doesn't stop. It only goes one way.
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT: Up.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT: I can't teach you how to skin a cat, but I can tell you a lot about the money in bricks and mortar.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT (CONT'D): Like he said, it's going one way. You need to see a lawyer.
ONE TWO: We need to see a Lawyer.
LAWYER TYPE: They say it's only going one way.
LAWYER TYPE: It looks like a great deal.
LAWYER TYPE: These are the plans,...it costs ten and it'll be worth twenty with planning. But first you gotta give the councilor a drink.
COUNCILOR: (off the envelope) Tell them they'll get the planning,...
LAWYER TYPE: You'll get the planning. Take care of the councilor and it will move like shit through a goose.
ONE TWO: We need help.
MUMBLES: Lenny Cole?
ONE TWO: Dog number one,...
MUMBLES: But he moves fast and he loves bricks and mortar.
LENNY COLE: I do move fast and I love bricks and mortar, properties are always the safe bet, but you better know what you're doing 'cos this ain't soft money. You trip up,... (beat) And it's not me that's gonna get hurt. You got security?
MUMBLES: We got property.
LENNY COLE: Don't let me down boys. (beat) Come on then, give us your hand.
COUNCILOR: (into phone) Can't talk now, but there has been a problem. I can't get you the planning.
LAWYER TYPE: (into phone) I'm sorry boys, can't get the planning.
ONE TWO: He can't get the planing.
MUMBLES: He can't get the planing?
LENNY COLE: What do you mean you can't get the fuckin planning? (pointing) There is seven million of my cash in there, without planning it's worth five,...you owe me. I take the building, you lose your share, but I am still outta pocket two large ones. Find it.
LENNY COLE: Is that you Councilor? (Lenny smiles) I hear you got that car you was after,....now, sort the planning out.
COUNCILOR (V.O.): Sorted Lenny.
LENNY COLE: What's wrong with you Arch?
ARCHY: That's a bit strong isn't it Len? They come from the same place as you, you'll clean 'em out.
LENNY COLE: Same place as me? Do I look like an immigrant Archy? (beat) No one gave me a leg up, did they? They need a bit of fear, 'cos otherwise they're gonna come up against me,...need a little lesson don't they?
ONE TWO: We gotta sell.
MUMBLES: And be left with what?
ONE TWO: Just gotta start again,....
URI: Glad you could join us here Lenny.
LENNY COLE: It's nice to see you Uri.
URI: Good. (there is a pause) I can see we are very much alike you and I Lenny. We like to get things done. (beat) What's it going to cost me?
LENNY COLE: First, let me make clear how much we can help you benefit from this deal. With out me, it will take you five to ten years to get the permission to erect your arena. (beat) Second, with Government policy as it so stands we both know it's unlikely that you'd ever get that consent. (beat) Thirdly, in legal fees, transactions and building consent, you'd be paying 6 to 12 million without any real guarantee of that result.
URI: So Lenny,..... how much?
LENNY COLE: Seven million Euros.
URI: I expect a guarantee that I have consent within six months and no red tape.
LENNY COLE: That's right Uri, you can consider that done.
URI: Drink!     Follow me.
LENNY COLE: Oh, that's a nice picture Uri, hasn't it got, errrh depth?
URI: That picture has brought me nothing but luck Lenny,..it's my lucky picture. (he has a good idea) You like? Take it for a while, maybe it will give you luck.
LENNY COLE: Oh I couldn't Uri,...
URI: Now we're partners, I insist. I will get it sent around to your house and you can give it back to me when our deal is finalized.
LENNY COLE: I thought you lot drunk Vodka.
URI: Whiskey is the new Vodka.
LENNY COLE: You not joining me Uri?
URI: I don't drink.
LENNY COLE: Oh,...cheers then,...
URI: To success.
ARCHY: You all right there Len?      You look a little pink.
LENNY COLE: (Flustered) Turbo, get us a perrier and a wet wipe live-o.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): Tried to poison me the dirty Cossack...
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): Stop messing about and give us the bottle Turbo.
ARCHY: So, how's the billionaires club?
LENNY COLE: That Communism didn't seem to slow 'em down did it? We've hit the big time here Archy boy! (beat) What's wrong? Where's the old Archy smile?
ARCHY: You wanna watch out there. Times are changing, they don't have too much respect for the old school.
LENNY COLE: Shut up Archy,... (under his breath) No school like the old school,...I still run this town see? That's why he came to me right? Got that?
ARCHY: Yeah, got that.
VICTOR: You think you should have leant him your lucky picture?
URI: It makes the peasant feel royal,... don't spoil it, we need him at the moment. I want that consent. (beat) Call the accountant and get her to clear the money.
STELLA: Look, can we shut the door?
TAX MAN: Shut the door.
STELLA: Let's put our cards on the table. We both know you aren't going to get the full forty out of my clients.
TAX MAN: This is the tax office and in the end we get what we want.
STELLA: Save that speech for the tourists Charlie and let's strike a deal - take the twenty now and let it go. Otherwise, they'll move the company off shore tomorrow and you'll spend the next twenty years chasing an imaginary forty million around every republic that grows bananas.
TAX MAN: I see why you married her now Bertie.
BERTIE: I told you we'd make a great team,.. You know why you get those deals?
BERTIE (CONT'D): Because those fat, sad, old men like it when you swear at them. They shake like cocktails and sweat like semtex when you raise that posh little voice. You my love are a rare commodity. (beat) Now come on, give your Bertie a smile.
STELLA: I don't feel like smiling. I am a thirty two year old accountant married to a homosexual lawyer. (beat) I'm a beard without kids Bertie! I'm in a marriage of convenience that can be quite inconvenient at times.
BERTIE: Yes, she's right here.
BERTIE (CONT'D): (he puts his hand over the receiver) It's Omovich. (mincey) Are you sure he isn't gay?
FRED THE HEAD: You won't do a five, they've got nothing on you Handsome Bob.
HANDSOME BOB: What are you talking about Fred? They got an informer, a grass, and a rat with a roach-smoking-a canary,..they've got more information than the fuckin Internet.
DOLLY: Language,...
FRED THE HEAD: Well, like I said, nothing.
MUMBLES: Leave him alone Fred, you're stressing him out. Dolly get him a cuppa tea. (beat) Come on deal the cards Fred.
COOKIE: All right chaps?
FRED THE HEAD: All right Cookie.
MUMBLES: Want to be dealt in?
COOKIE: Can't stay for long, but throw us in for a quick spin.
ONE TWO: Mumbles, can I have a word?
MUMBLES: What's happening?
ONE TWO: You know the lady, the posh one who likes abitta the rough life?
MUMBLES: The accountant, what about her? You haven't heard from her in a while, too dangerous that one.
ONE TWO: Says she's got some work, you know,... proper work. (he makes gun impression) I would normally turn her down, but considering,...
MUMBLES: Let's have a meet.
ONE TWO: I got one like that at home with a little boy fishing.
STELLA: Is that what they call humor where you come from?
ONE TWO: Well, don't they call that art where you come from?
STELLA: You're quite the entertainer aren't you Mr. One Two? And you are late, please don't be late, I have a very busy schedule.
STELLA: I have some work and thought you'd be interested, its your kind of work.
ONE TWO: Go on.
STELLA: There are two accountants taking out seven million Euros from a bank I know and it won't be protected. (beat) Twenty percent for me, as normal. The details are in here.
ONE TWO: Anything else?
STELLA: Yes,..I don't want this coming back to me so, if you could give them a black eye,..that might help.
STELLA (CONT'D): A black eye, nothing more.
ONE TWO: Ok, very good Mrs. Dexter, a black eye it is then.
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Nice shoes.
STELLA: (she smiles) Why thank you, you'll be able to afford your own pair in a couple of days. Good bye.
ROCKER: I need the dry ice Mickey, I need the dry ice. My show just doesn't work without it.
MICKEY: (hand over the receiver) If you told me yesterday you needed dry ice, I would have gotten you the driest ice the world could offer, but you didn't ask for no dry ice. You asked for two cases of Johnny Walker black label and four ladies of the pole and I got them for you didn't I?
MICKEY (CONT'D): Didn't I?
ROCKER: Yes you did I do confess, but Mickey, you're the manager and I am the rocker. You've got on the managers hat, now pluck something out of it.
MICKEY: My hat is deep and full of magic. I got rabbits, handkerchiefs, and ladies of the pole drinking Black Label. I got smoke machines, bubble machines, I even got love marines and still the hat goes deeper, but....there ain't no mother fuckin dry ice.
ROCK N ROLLER: Ok, ok, come home, you've made your point. (he turns on his way out) But tomorrow, I need dry ice.
ROMAN: Have you read this?
MICKEY: What?
ROMAN: Johnny Story singer extraordinaire, fell off a boat, they say. Missing, assumed dead, they say.
MICKEY: What,..our Johnny?
ROMAN: How many rock stars by the name of Johnny Story do you think there are in this universe Mickey?
MICKEY: The only thing he's fallen off is his junkies spoon, he's no deader than the suit you're wearing now. He'll be gearing himself up somewhere happy as clam in a fisherman's net. Rockers like that never die, they just wither and give me pain.
LENNY COLE: Johnny Story singer extraordinare, fell off a boat, missing, assumed dead.
ARCHY: I don't know what to say Lenny.
LENNY COLE: I bet he took a lot of people with him in his hot little crack pipe. (beat) We will never mention this again, all right Arch?
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): Now, tell the Councilor to stop fuckin about with sticks and balls and send him inside.
ARCHY: Very good councilor, you must of had lessons as a boy. (beat) Fancy a cool down and a chat with Lenny?
ARCHY (CONT'D): Do you know Jackie?
COUNCILOR: No, no, no, Archy, don't say anything.
ARCHY: Don't worry, she's a friend,..and a member. (raises his voice) Jackie,..fancy a run'a'round with the Councilor?
JACKIE: Only if he's wicked.
COUNCILOR: (excited and shy) What does she mean by that?
ARCHY: I think she likes you boy-o.
LENNY COLE: They say that times are changing Councilor, that this country isn't what it used to be, it's the new New York, they say. You being a political man must know all about that.
COUNCILOR: Errh, I think they are probably right, times have changed, but that shouldn't affect you Lenny.
LENNY COLE: They say it's all gone "international" now, out with the old guard in with the new, but I think they're wrong. (beat) Anyway, where are my manners? Look at you sweaty as a native and pink as a pelican,...and I haven't even offered you a wet one.
COUNCILOR: A lemonade and orange please.
LENNY COLE: Oh that's nice,..refreshing, that'll put you back on top boy.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): Here you go, plans and papers. (beat) Would you like a cigar?
COUNCILOR: I don't mind if I do,...that's a nice lighter.
LENNY COLE: Eight grand they wanted for it cheeky toads and I paid, you know why?
COUNCILOR: Tell me Lenny.
LENNY COLE: 'Cos it's all about the details.
COUNCILOR: (awkwardly) Is our little deal in there too Lenny?
LENNY COLE: Oh I wouldn't forget that, the most important things first.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): I'll leave you with them. (beat) I gotta run, can't stay here chewing the fat all day, a mans got to make a living. Call me in the 'morrow.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): Look after him Jackie.
COUNCILOR: Oh Lenny, you forgot your lighter.
LENNY COLE: Can't be mine, it's got your name on it.
MUMBLES: Don't you get bored of that? I mean, your not really going anywhere. If you wanna run, why don't you run to the shops or do something useful?
ONE TWO: You could do with some of this yourself Mumbles, you're letting yourself go. (beat) Anyway, I'm busy, have you come to talk about anything important?
MUMBLES: It's all about the zone isn't it?
MUMBLES (CONT'D): You boys and girls like to find funny places in your head where nothing can get you, don't you? You're scared, you're running away from yourself One Two.
ONE TWO: No Mumbles, I am trying to run away from you. Bob, you sorted out the car?
HANDSOME BOB: Yeah, it looks like a heap of shit, but it can't half go. (beat) A bit like you One Two.
MUMBLES: I reckon he's trying to get fit for the lady. Nothing gets under his skin like a lady he can't have, does it? (pause) A straight going, cocky, educated, arrogant posh bird trips him right up. I reckon we should set Handsome Bob on her. That'll liven you up One Two.
ONE TWO: Bob wouldn't know where to begin.
HANDSOME BOB: I'm good with the posh ones, don't you worry about that.
ONE TWO: I've had enough of this, can you two piss off cos I am trying to find my "zone"
MUMBLES: He can't half run for a white fella.
LENNY COLE: Archy? You awake? (beat) Never mind, you are now. I had a horrible dream that the Councilor didn't come through, I don't want anything going wrong on this one, that Russian's the key to the big time. (pause) You think he's all right?
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): (beat) You sure? (beat) What did Jackie say?
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): She did? I knew he'd like the lighter, nice touch eh? She's a good girl that Jackie. (laughing) Give her another drink. (beat) You're right, he wouldn't have leant me his lucky painting if he didn't mean business. Yeah, I had it taken off it's easel and stuck it above my desk, it's looks magnifi....
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): (from the floor) Arch! Arch! I have been robbed.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): I said I have been robbed. (beat) I don't know when. The painting,.. it's gone.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): The one Uri gave me! (beat) All right LOANED for fucks sake!
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): This isn't good Arch, it's his favorite painting, his lucky painting! Get round here and bring the troops.
BANDY: Where was it Len?
LENNY COLE: Let's take a wild stab in the dark shall we Bandy? Archy slap him and then send him to school 'cos I can't take any more of this. You sort it out, get that picture back and bring me a body, I am going to back to bed.
ARCHY: Bandy if you ever ask a stupid question like that again, you see Danny there? He's gonna slap you.
BANDY: Sorry Arch, it's just,...I was trying to use initiative.
ARCHY: Danny slap him.
ARCHY (CONT'D): With the right Danny,..properly.
ARCHY (CONT'D): I said properly, with the back of your right hand Danny.
DANNY: What is this a tennis match Arch?
ARCHY: Slap him!
ARCHY (CONT'D): Like that!
ARCHY (CONT'D): (beat) Now, if you men can master a slap like that, there's no need for your clients to hold back. They'll open up like a fountain full of words after one of those.
ARCHY (CONT'D): No need for strong violence, no no, they're straight back to their childhood. Putty in your hands, ask Bandy,... (motioning) Look, thinks he's back at school.
DANNY: But he never went to school.
ARCHY: Daniel, do you want a slap as well? Now, if the slap doesn't work,..Cut 'em...or pay 'em, but keep the receipts 'cos this ain't the Mafia. (beat) Now, get to work and find that painting.
MUMBLES: You ready?
ONE TWO: Yup, load up boys and pay attention.
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Hello lads.
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Put the bags in the car and walk away.
MUMBLES: Don't be silly boys, do as you are told. Put the bags in the car, give him the keys and walk away smiling.
ONE TWO: (to the accountants) Oi, come back here.
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Where's reverse?
ACCOUNTANT: You have to lift up the nob under the gear stick.
ONE TWO: Right, now fuck off.
MUMBLES: (to accountants) Slowly and keep smiling.
ONE TWO: Shit,...
MUMBLES: What?
ONE TWO: I have got to hurt him. (to the Accountants) Oi come back here.
MUMBLES: Why? What did he ever do to you? Come on we've got the money now let's piss off!
ACCOUNTANT: Yes?
ONE TWO: Shit, I can't do it.
MUMBLES: (looking) You're an embarrassment to crime you are.
ONE TWO: She asked me to give him a black eye.
MUMBLES: She's sick that bird of yours, sick.
ONE TWO: Is Handsome Bob behind?
MUMBLES: He's there.
URI: The developement has been underway for four years and will be completed within another two. The area covers twelve acres and it will become one of Londons premiere residences.
URI (CONT'D): Thirty two floors and six acres,....excuse me gentlemen,..
URI (CONT'D): What is it?
URI (CONT'D): (in Russian) Do they know who we are?
VICTOR: (in Russian) It's not like the old country, it's cowboys and Indians out here.
URI: (in Russian) We don't have time to play games,..people and business are waiting. Speak to the accountant and get some more money. (beat) And Victor, this time no problems.
ONE TWO: I know a man that'll copy that for you. Might take him a couple of minutes mind.
STELLA: You don't need to copy anything any more, welcome to the nouveau riche Mr. One Two.
ONE TWO: Here's one for you too Mrs Dexter.
STELLA: Why thank you Mr. One Two. I see you didn't think much of the black eye though.
ONE TWO: Would have liked to obliged, but from a professional point of view, it just wasn't natural,... (pause) Until next time then.
STELLA: Until next time.
HANDSOME BOB: She's a looker ain't she One Two?
ONE TWO: She's not for you Bob, that is class.
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Archy, I got Lenny's bitta scratch.
ARCHY: What, you got it all?
ONE TWO (V.O.): Yeah and it's burning a hole in the floor, so you better come and get it before it melts my boots.
ARCHY: I'll come round the speeler.
ARCHY (CONT'D): Got another call, gotta go.
LENNY COLE: Archy, the Russian didn't come through with the money.
ARCHY: Calm down Len, the Councilor can wait.
ARCHY (CONT'D): (beat) Some good news for you, One Two and Co came through with the scratch.
LENNY COLE: What, all of it?
ARCHY (V.O.): Yeah, all of it.
LENNY COLE: (surprised) Where did they get that from then?
ARCHY: Ask no questions hear no lies. (beat) Just gotta do is find your painting now Len.
LENNY COLE: Just make sure you find it. (beat) I gotta another call.
COUNCILOR: I have all my people waiting Lenny. You can't let me down!
LENNY COLE: It's just a delay, that's all Councilor. Just a delay.
ARCHY: Stop here Turbo.
ARCHY: Gary.
GARY: Hello Arch. What brings you down here? Want some tickets?
ARCHY: I want the Tank.
GARY: You won't see him on the cobbles at this time of night, you know how much he likes the cold. He's at the end of the street tucked up watching a Zulu movie.
TANK: Hello Arch, what you doing here?
ARCHY: I need a word.
TANK: Well don't stand out there on the cobbles it's freezing, step into my world. (too the girl) Shavawn get us a couple of vanilla chai lattes, there's a good girl.
TANK: Great movie this Arch. They've had it digitally re-mastered, glorious picture and the sounds exquisite.
TANK (CONT'D): Oh I like this bit, thousands and thousands of 'em, but them red coats just don't move. That's courage that is Arch. (beat) They did have guns mind.
ARCHY: Turn it down a tad, I need to have a word.
TANK: Where are my manners? Sorry Arch, what do you want, tickets? I got just the show for you, a Chinese orphan with a learning disability that don't stop singing and dancing all the way through the first half. Then, up pops a Geisha girl and it all goes magical in the second; the wife will love it and you can't get tickets for love nor,...
ARCHY: I don't want tickets, I need you to find me a painting, a classic, been nicked outta of Lenny's house. And since you got more feet on the street than coppers on the beat,... (starting to make his way out) I'd like you to assist. I'll leave you a little livener. There's a large twenty to get some tongues wagging.
FRED THE HEAD: Yeah,...? (beat) Come on up, but don't be wasting my time.
ONE TWO: Is that Archy?
FRED THE HEAD: No, couple of oysters who got a little something to be viewed.
FRED THE HEAD (CONT'D): How's your Mum taking it Handsome? (beat) She must be very unhappy, I mean a five stretch?
HANDSOME BOB: Not again, please Fred.
FRED THE HEAD: Sorry Bob, I didn't mean to offend.
DOLLY: Who wants another cuppa?
ONE TWO: (raising his cup) Thank you.
MUMBLES: Glass of milk for me, my love.
MALCOLM: Good afternoon gentlemen.
MALCOLM (CONT'D): Excuse me my love, any chance of a wee dram of water to oil the larynx?
FRED THE HEAD: Get on with it.
MALCOLM: (cough) Ok gentlemen here we go. First, my colleague Paul will be modeling the grey wolf.
MALCOLM (CONT'D): I must apologize for my assistants handicaps. He has unusually long arms and an alarmingly small neck. (beat, the crowd is unimpressed) Now, I do agree it doesn't seem like the right time to acquire a coat of such thermal efficiency. However, I have been informed that we are looking at a very white winter. PLUS gentlemen and fine lady,.. (He winks at Dolly who has got him a very large glass of water) Christmas is always round the corner.
MUMBLES: Where did you find these two junkies?
FRED THE HEAD: What is this, a fuckin double act?
ONE TWO: Shut up and tell us the price.
MALCOLM: All in good time gentlemen, all in good time. (beat) Paul, why don't you sit down for a while.
MALCOLM (V.O.) (CONT'D): (from under the table) Next, we have a very much sought after affair seen in very, very glossy magazines,..
MALCOLM (CONT'D): The famous, but rare black bear from the dark mountains of Siberian Calcutta.
MALCOLM (CONT'D): Get an eye full of that stripe gentlemen.
MUMBLES: Have a look at that, it's a six foot skunk.
MALCOLM: And all of this could be yours for a staggeringly low,...
FRED THE HEAD: All right Arch.
FRED THE HEAD (CONT'D): Yeah, come on up.
FRED THE HEAD (CONT'D): You two out, live-o. (gesturing) The back door.
MALCOLM: Come on Paul, we'll be going now.
FRED THE HEAD: All right Arch?
ARCHY: Fred,... (pause) The speelers very quiet today, everything all right?
FRED THE HEAD: Good as gold thanks.
ARCHY: All right Mumbles?       One Two?
MUMBLES/ONE TWO: Arch!
ARCHY: So where is it then?
ONE TWO: What, can't you smell it?
ONE TWO (CONT'D): And buy yourself a new pair of shoes.
ARCHY: Silly bastards.
URI: They say there are only two days you enjoy a boat, the day you buy it and the day you sell it.
STELLA: Well, according to my figures that sounds about right, but what can you do? (beat) Beauty is a cruel mistress.
URI: I must remember that line.        Can I pour you a glass?
STELLA: Not for me thank you.
URI: You know, I like you. I like the way you...are. Always thinking about business, very professional.
STELLA: That's what you pay me to be, isn't it?
URI: Tell me about your husband.
STELLA: My husband is a lawyer.
URI: I hear he is very good at what he does, maybe we can have some work for him.
URI (CONT'D): Tell me, what do you do for fun?
URI (CONT'D): Have I offended you in some way?
STELLA: I don't quite know where this is going and if you don't mind, I would like to keep our relationship professional.
URI: You see Victor, this is what I am talking about. (in Russian) This is what I like about this country. They understand hierarchy - you do your job, I do mine and everyone gets along.
URI (CONT'D): (back into English) Now, back to business. We have had security problems and to cut a long story short, I need another seven million Euros lost in the books.
STELLA: (not happy, she's playing a good little actress) Forgive me for being immodest Mr Omovich. I am a very good accountant, but I can only cover so much of your money, it does have to be accounted for after all. It is not easy to lose seven million to the tax man.
URI: But, if you are so good,....
STELLA: Let me think about it, there are some options I have tried to leave open.
URI: Thank you.
TANK: You know why they call me Tank don't you Archy?
ARCHY: I should imagine it has something to do with you being a dirty great blac,...
TANK: Think Tank. Nothing gets past the old think Tank Arch, nothing. (pause) You got me thinking, so I fired a few questions into the right direction. Thought I'd better come see you 'cos I got some news 'bout your painting.
LENNY COLE: Right, I am going to tell you how this works. You're going in the drink and I am going to make a cup of tea.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): Underneath the floor boards is the famous river Thames. I hope for your sakes you can hold your breath for as long as it takes to boil that kettle. After that, I am going to ask you a question, one question. You are going to give me a name and if it's the right name, I send you home warm and dry in a fresh set of clothes. If it's the wrong name, you'll be fed to the cray fish,....see ya.
ONE TWO: Come on Bob, cheer up.
HANDSOME BOB: What have I got to cheer up about, I am going to be locked up in an eight by ten tomorrow night.
ONE TWO: But that's tomorrow night, tonight its take off time, we've prepared a little going away party. (beat) I got "the Harris twins" the most expensive escort girls to have ever escorted.
ONE TWO (CONT'D): They've got a night off from the Russians and they've all been greased down just for the Bobski! It's going to take you two and a half years just to recover from this little party.
ONE TWO (CONT'D): That cheered you up then?
HANDSOME BOB: (still not looking happy) It's not that I am ungrateful One Two, it's just,....
ONE TWO: It's just what?
HANDSOME BOB: Don't worry,..you wouldn't understand.
ONE TWO: I understand anything coming from you Bobby boy.
HANDSOME BOB: Would you?
ONE TWO: You're me best mate.
HANDSOME BOB: I don't want the strippers One Two,.... (beat) I want you,....
ONE TWO: You dirty bastard! I know all your girlfriends all of 'em!
HANDSOME BOB: (horrified) See, I told you you wouldn't understand!
ONE TWO: Understand what?
ONE TWO (CONT'D): That you're a homa? You're Handsome Bob for Gods sake, Handsome Bob the lady killer! That is you Bob, do you hear me? God, I have had showers with you, you've seen my cock!
HANDSOME BOB: I only told you cos I'm going away, but I should have kept my mouth shut.
ONE TWO: Fuckin right you should have kept your mouth shut, should have drowned the cat instead of letting it out the bag.
ONE TWO: All right Bob, I am sorry.        I went over the top, it was just a       surprise that's all. (Bob's still crying) Bit of a broad side Bob, do       you hear me, I am sorry,.. (beat) Well what is it you want to       do with me?
LENNY COLE: Hose 'em down Danny. Get those cray fish off 'em. Now, who has that painting? (beat) One name.
DROWNED SLOANE: Johnny, Johnny Story. You know the singer in that group Story Time.
LENNY COLE: That didn't work did it? How can a dead man sell you a painting?
DROWNED SLOANE: He's not dead, I know he's not dead because he just tried to sell us that picture and changed his mind at the last minute. He's got like an obsession with it.
LENNY COLE: Put 'em back Arch, before I shoot 'em.
DROWNED SLOANE: Jesus! I know him, I know who he is,...we went to school with him. We're telling the truth, we're telling the,...
ARCHY: Len, could I have a word?    Private,.. it's worth it.
ARCHY: Your boy's not dead, is he?
LENNY COLE: (snapping) Don't you dare call him my boy.
ARCHY: Sorry, I mean your boy, the Ex's boy,...your step son. He had a set of keys to the house didn't he?
LENNY COLE: He won't die that cockroach.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): That junkie's seen more funerals than a fuckin undertaker,.. that boy is poison.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): The next world war will have his name written all over it. (beat) Get me those two flash idiots that used to manage him, what are they called, Greek and Mini?
ARCHY: Roman and Mickey.
LENNY COLE: If anyone can find that smoking crack pipe, it's them.
LENNY COLE: Listen to me boy, listen. I never did like you and neither did your real father. You're a reject, a wrong-un, a fuckin fairy in the mirror that I inherited from your mother, but she ain't with us no more, so now it's just you and me. In one week you go back to school, the best fuckin school in the country I might add, then you'll be gone for another term. (beat) In the mean time, show me some gratitude and keep the fuckin music down.
JOHNNY STORY: Just couldn't, it's got me,...that's what art does Pete, it gets you.
PETE: You'd get a good few notes for that. Go on John, jog it on.
JOHNNY STORY: You wouldn't understand.
PETE: Why not?
JOHNNY STORY: Because,.....You,.... Are street scum Pete.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): You're in need of an education, that's what you need, but your Dad never gave a shit about you did he? And that is why you are on the gear. Your gear is your surrogate father.
PETE: Leave off John, what is this shrink time?
JOHNNY STORY: Come on Pedro, share. I'm your sponsor, Doctor,...your dad if you're feeling a bit of regression coming on. (beat) But first we should have a drink in our hands.
PETE: My Dad made me watch Bonanza every Sunday after church.
JOHNNY STORY: That's got to have done some damage, all those guns and cowboys.
PETE: You think? It wasn't all bad, he sometimes made me laugh too.
JOHNNY STORY: Now we're getting somewhere. Did he interfere with you? You know, touch you inappropriate like?
PETE: He tickled me if that's what you mean.
JOHNNY STORY: Now that's it! That's what I was looking for, you see your Dad is a monster Pedro, a tickling monster. (singing) Pedro's dad's a tickling monster!
WASTER: That's my drink.
PETE: Fuck you singalong, you're no help and stop calling me Pedro.
JOHNNY STORY: Come on boy, I'll have you and ya girlfriends! I'll do the lot of yazz.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): (Leaning over his shoulder, mock serious) Was I good or what Pete? It's all in the eyes.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): (he raises his ridiculous eye brows) Junkies, I'll shit 'em!
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): Did your Dad do anything else to you Pete?
PETE: He hit me bad as well the slag.        Hit with a chain.
JOHNNY STORY: (Johnny stands) What are you doing? I'm not going to tickle you Pete, I'm not your Dad.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): (soft) I find that profoundly offensive Pedro. Two's up on a snout to show I care.
PETE: I used to think it had something to do with Bonanza.
JOHNNY STORY: Your dad was jealous. Cos you dad isn't sure he's your dad, cos you don't look like him.
PETE: Really?     What do I look like then?
JOHNNY STORY: You have all the facial characteristics of North American native, Livapuddlian Indian.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): See your Dad thought you were a red Indian and Bonanza triggered your fathers unconscious feelings.
PETE: Really?
PETE (CONT'D): You slag Story! I'm not telling you fuck all,...piss taker.
SECRETARY: Mickey,..Roman, there are four gentlemen who,...
ARCHY: Who wanna see you two.
SECRETARY: I'm sorry Mickey.
MICKEY: Don't worry about it June, go and have another lunch.
LENNY COLE: Sorry to intrude. (seeing some fruit on the table) They call this a lichee don't they?
ROMAN: I believe so.
LENNY COLE: Tasty exotic, bit like your suit.
ROMAN: How can we help?
LENNY COLE: Don't you have an act called Story Time?
ROMAN: We did.
LENNY COLE: And isn't there a lead singer called Johnny Story?
ROMAN: There was.
LENNY COLE: Well, I would like to see Mr Johnny Story.
ROMAN: I would like to see him too, but that might be tricky 'cos according to the newspapers the only songs Mr Story is going to be singing is hymns.
LENNY COLE: And I shed a tear. I shed it for all those bone tops that read the papers and believe that shit. (beat) Have you seen his body? Have you seen him smacked up and cracked up with his tongue on his chin and his cock in his hand, swinging from the rafters, like a real rock 'n' rolla? (pause) No, you didn't did you? And nobody else fuckin did either, did they 'cos he ain't dead. He's alive-alive- o somewhere selling cockles and mussels,...and a very important painting that doesn't belong to him.
ROMAN: Sorry, but what has this got to do with us?
LENNY COLE: You have twelve licenses within a jurisdiction which I control. You wanna play on, do what I tell you. (pause) Now, I can tell what you're thinking.
ROMAN: That there's not much you can't do?
ARCHY: Slow down tinker bell, you'll never sing the same if ya teeth aren't your own.
MICKEY: You gonna take care of him?
LENNY COLE: (smiling) What do you think we are, gangsters? That's not my style and especially not with genetics and all,...
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): Bloods thicker than poison moon beam, now do us all a favor, before you catch a cold.
COOKIE: Where have you been? You were missed in court today. That's not very compassionate is it, didn't turn up for your amigos funeral.
FRED THE HEAD: Everybody else was there but you and I got the feeling you were the only person Handsome wanted to see.
ONE TWO: What are you trying to say Fred?
FRED THE HEAD: Eh?
ONE TWO: You wanna have it out now?
HANDSOME BOB: Guess whoooo?
HANDSOME BOB (CONT'D): The prosecution lost the paper work. I am offski, the case is closed.
ONE TWO: (in shock) Five years, you were supposed to get five fucking years!
DOLLY: One Two there's a woman on the phone for you, she sounds very educated.
ONE TWO: How did you get this number?
STELLA (V.O.): I can get any number, I work with numbers don't I?
ONE TWO: One point for initiative, two to tell me what's on your mind.
STELLA: I need a favor. My husbands having a party tonight and they need some "smarties" but they have nowhere to go. Look, I know it's a liberty, but I thought you might know people. Plus, I have another bit of work for you. (beat) You can bring your friends. There will be interesting people - the rich and famous, the great and good.
ONE TWO: Let me see what I can do.
ONE TWO: So Bob got off, big fucking deal. (everyone looks a little lost) I have a little bit of work for you Cookie we have a party to go to.
URI: You're looking well Lenny.
LENNY COLE: Well thank you Uri, that's a real compliment from a man that obviously takes good care of himself.
URI: I suppose you're wondering why you are here?
LENNY COLE: I assume you want to check that everything is still "kosher" at my end. (pause) I was a little surprised you didn't come through at the appropriate time, but I reckon you have your reasons.
URI: I assume everything is still as you say,...Kosher?
LENNY COLE: Don't you worry Uri, that one's on me,...partners and all that, but I wouldn't like it to go south again, makes things difficult, if you know what I mean?
URI: I understand Lenny and I wouldn't like things to go wrong either. Which brings me conveniently to my next point. Ever since the painting, my lucky painting, hasn't been hanging on my wall, things have not been,....so lucky. I know this is a rude request because we have not concluded our business, but I feel as though I need it.
ARCHY: Fuckin hell Len, he's given you that bar tan again. You wanna leave that vodka alone.
LENNY COLE: Shut up Arch!
ARCHY: Everything all right?
LENNY COLE: No it's fuckin not all right, he want's his painting, his lucky painting.
ARCHY: Oh, I see. That's a bit of a problem then isn't it?
LENNY COLE: You should have seen his eyes I swore they changed color, went fuckin red they did.
ARCHY: They don't care who's soil they are on that lot. They can buy half the country without breaking a sweat, you're small time to them. They could click their fingers and we'd be ether.
LENNY COLE: You speak to me like that again and I'll cut your fuckin tongue out. I run this town, got that, me! Anybody who thinks he's rude enough, let 'em raise a finger, 'cos I'll take off his whole fuckin arm. Do you understand that Archy? (beat) I said do YOU?
ARCHY: Yes, I do Len.
MICKEY: How about that then, Johnny Story's father? How did that get under the radar? Why doesn't anybody know?
ROMAN: Would you want anyone to know that he was your Dad? Would we have taken him on if we had known?
MICKEY: We're going to have to give him something, anything, a bed that's been slept in, a bone for his dog, some token of effort.
ROMAN: We need to see Cookie.
TOM: (A bit rude) Who are you?
COOKIE: My name is Cookie.
TOM: You must be with Stella?
COOKIE: No, we're with the Grand Old Duke of York.
TOM: Well you can't come in here, not without shaking my hand.
TOM (CONT'D): So you're supposed to be a hard case eh?
COOKIE: (to One Two) This is gonna be a scream, Fred get 'em in.
FRED THE HEAD: Why me?
MUMBLES: 'Cos you look like one of them.
FRED THE HEAD: They're mad this lot.
COOKIE: And take that chewing gum off your feet before you start dancing.
STELLA: Good evening gentlemen.
STELLA (CONT'D): Help yourselves to drinks.
TOM: (searching for street cred) So! Who the man?
ONE TWO: I think that's your cue Cookie.
COOKIE: Come on then kids, get in a nice orderly line and we'll get the party started.
ONE TWO: What the fuck are you doing here?
HANDSOME BOB: Well all the chaps were coming and I didn't have any plans tonight did I? Thought I might celebrate a little, do you mind?
ONE TWO: Yes I do fuckin mind. Now listen Bob, what happened last night is our little secret all right and it was only cos you were supposed to be doing your time, right? You tell anybody and I swear to God,.... I swear to God. Well fuck it Bob, I think you understand.
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Let me tell you something hard case, if you start any trouble around her,...
MUMBLES: And that's why they call him One Two.
BERTIE: So you're part of the wild bunch? Stella says you're dangerous.
MUMBLES: Does she now?
BERTIE: So is your friend part of the wild bunch?
MUMBLES: That young man is the greatest gun slinger in town.
BERTIE: (Bertie smiles) Then how come I don't know him? (beat) I know all about your type.
MUMBLES: How is that then?
BERTIE: I'm a criminal lawyer,..and I know a secret about your part of town.
MUMBLES: What secrets that then?
BERTIE: You have an informer in your neck of the woods.
MUMBLES: Oh yeah, so what's his name?
BERTIE: You have to pay for secrets.
MUMBLES: That's not nice, but while your at it, what's the price?
BERTIE: (he looks to Handsome) I want to meet the gun slinger.
STELLA: Drink?
ONE TWO: Large one,...Dance?
STELLA: So, you're a dancer?
ONE TWO: Am I a dancer? Shall we put the record straight?
ONE TWO (CONT'D): You see it's all in the genes. (he slowly turns) My Dad was a dancer and his Dad before that so gradually it's percolated the old DNA. You not joining me?
STELLA: Sure, I like to dance.
ONE TWO: Hello, I can sense a little competition. So what you got for me?
STELLA: The same job's back on again.
ONE TWO: Oh yea? (beat) Don't throw my rhythm.
STELLA: Same time, same place, same money.
ONE TWO: What about security?
STELLA: Same as before, but they're not my accountants. A couple of their's,..other than that, should be just the same.
MUMBLES: Handsome, I got a job for you.    See that man on the couch.
HANDSOME BOB: The one that's staring at us?    How can I miss him.
MUMBLES: Do me a favor, chat him up.
HANDSOME BOB: Fuck off what do think I am?
MUMBLES: He's some big wig lawyer who knows about an informer in our part of town and since you were just looking at a five stretch, I thought you might be interested.
ONE TWO: We got another job on, same as before.
MUMBLES: It's all go around here isn't it? Den of iniquity this place is. You know your old lady, well her big time lawyer husband he's a beard got a crush on the Handsome.
ONE TWO: What are you talking about?
MUMBLES: Put it this way, I don't think they married for love.
ONE TWO: I gotta get a breath of fresh air.
HANDSOME BOB: So, I hear you have a secret, but you look like you might have more than one. Why don't you confess?
BERTIE: I don't want to talk about work.
HANDSOME BOB: If you tell me who the informer is, we will talk about whatever you want to, anyway, you don't have to tell me anything. If he's an informer you'll have his depositions and poems.
BERTIE: My, my not just a pretty face. How do you know about those sort of things?
HANDSOME BOB: Let's have a drink during the week, and I'll tell you all about it, all I need is a little bit of paper work.
COOKIE: Oi One Two, I am going to make a killing out of this lot, they've definitely got more money than brains. (to One Two) I owe you one boyo.
JOHNNY STORY: Pedro?   Come back here.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): Where do you think you are going with that painting?
PETE: (he's flapping) You never said it was your Dad's or whatever you wanna call him. You gotta give it back John people are looking for it, bad people. The streets are alive with the sound of pain.
JOHNNY STORY: You may have a point Pete, but I can't give it up. You know why?
PETE: No, why?
JOHNNY STORY: Meet me in the pub in two minutes.
BARMAN: What do you want?
JOHNNY STORY: Now, now no need for that tone bar steward. I am merely on mission to acquire a shot of your finest Scotch and a packet of your,... (pointing to paper's) Cheapest rolling paper.
BARMAN: Green or red?
JOHNNY STORY: King size of course - along with a packet of your shiniest coffin nails.
BARMAN: Don't make a scene in here boy.
JOHNNY STORY: Put the change in the blind box my good man and remember,...
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): "In the kingdom of the blind, the one eyed man is king"
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): You see that pack of Virginia killing sticks at the end of the piano?
PETE: Yeah.
JOHNNY STORY: All you need to know about life is retained within those four walls.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): You will notice that one of your personalities is seduced by the illusions of grandeur. A "gold" packet of "king" size and with a "regal" insignia. An attractive implication toward glamour and wealth, a subtle suggestion that cigarettes are indeed your "royal" and loyal friends. And that Pete,...is a lie. (beat) Your other personality is trying to draw your attention to the flip side of the discussion. Written in boring, bold, black and white is the statement, that these neat little soldiers of death, are in fact, trying to "kill you." And that Pete,...is the truth. (beat) Beauty is a beguiling call to death and I am addicted to the sweet siren of its pitch. And that,..is why,..you and I love the crack, and that is also why I can not,.. give that painting back.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): Now, please pass me a light.
PETE: (in mock awe) Oh you are something special Johnny Story.
MUMBLES: We'll use rock salt in the shot gun cartridges. Slip 'em into the revolver, if it starts getting large, we'll bang a couple in to 'em and that'll slow 'em down. They won't know the difference between lead or salt and of course Bob's driving.
ONE TWO: I don't want to use Bob.
MUMBLES: What? He's our driver, the A-teams not complete without the driver. (beat) What's happened between you and Bob?
ONE TWO: I think there might be something about Bob you don't know Mumbles.
MUMBLES: What's that then?       That he's a poof?
ONE TWO: What?   Eh?   How did you know?
MUMBLES: Everybody knows he's a flamer, you're the only one who doesn't. He loves the boys.
ONE TWO: (stunned) What are you talking about, I am losing orientation here Mumbles.
MUMBLES: Did he make a pass at you, is this what this is all about?
ONE TWO: Yes, he fuckin did.
MUMBLES: Ok so what's the problem? It was supposed to be his last night so you "took care" of him, that's what friends do for one another, well done, I won't tell the chaps.
ONE TWO: Hold on a minute, you won't tell the chaps what?
MUMBLES: What did you do?        Suck his,...
ONE TWO: Stop right fuckin there! What is going on here? Does that mean you've sucked his,...
MUMBLES: Well, you must have touched him.
ONE TWO: Hold on! I am not fucking gay!           He wanted a dance that's all!
MUMBLES: Did you give him one?
ONE TWO: A DANCE, yes, I did.
MUMBLES: Was it a slow dance?
ONE TWO: What has he done to me?
MUMBLES: I think there's something else you should know about our Bob.
ONE TWO: What, there's more?
MUMBLES: Who do you think looked after your Mum before she died, whilst you were doing a two stretch?
MUMBLES (CONT'D): (beat) 'Cos it wasn't fuckin me and I am your best pal!
MUMBLES (CONT'D): No, it was Bob around there six times a week without fail making sure she was looked after. You tore your mums heart out when you went away and Bob did his best to put it back. (pause) I tell you something One Two, if I could be half the human that Bob is and the price was being a poof, I'd think about it. (beat) Not for too long, but I'd have to think about it.
ONE TWO: He looked after my Mum, how come he never told me?
MUMBLES: 'Cos that's Handsome Bob and he's class.
BOUNCER: Oi you, what do you think you're doing?
JOHNNY STORY: What do you think we're doing?   We're trying to get in.
BOUNCER: Go home wasters, costs money to get in here.
JOHNNY STORY: Yes my good man, I am aware of that.
MICKEY: What's wrong with you?
ROMAN: Get that Archy on the phone, I think we've got a problem.
BOUNCER: Run along junkies.
JOHNNY STORY: Oi looky, but no touchy.
PETE: Get off him you slag, he's class.
ROMAN: Mr. Archy,.... (beat) I hear you, but you can't just shut us down! I've got an act on.
PETE: (calm, but worried) Leave it John, I'm happy, I'm all right down here mate. Let's call it a night eh?
JOHNNY STORY: I'll show em' fuckin happy.
ROMAN: I understand, we'll find him,.. (still pleading) But I have to keep the club open!   I have four hundred people in here! (beat) Don't you dare shut us down!
BOUNCER: Fancy some more talent boy?
JOHNNY STORY: I am going to report you, what's your name?
BOUNCER: Jog on boy, before I grind your bones to make my bread.
JOHNNY STORY: Oh I'm sorry did that hurt?   Here let me help you up.
MICKEY: (to Roman) They're trying to shut us down!
JOHNNY STORY: What was that about grinding bones?
ROMAN: If we want to keep the licence and the lights on, we need to find Johnny Story.
MICKEY: There is a revolution taking place outside.
COOKIE: Joke to be inserted by Cookie.
COOKIE (CONT'D): Hello, it's Roman and Mickey, what are you doing here boys?
ROMAN: Can we have a word Cookie?
ROMAN: We need to find Johnny Story.
COOKIE: Well, you should be the first to know this, but isn't he,...
ROMAN: You know and I know nothing kills Johnny. (beat) Come on Cookie, you've helped him fuck up his life for the last five years, now do him a good turn.
COOKIE: Have you ever bought a ticket to the junkies bone yard Roman? (beat) It's an unpleasant place called "curl up and die." Might sound like a hair salon, but it don't fuckin look like one I can tell ya. It's a horrible sight and a terrible sound listening to a man sucking his soul through the hole in "the pipe" and even worse when he tries to tear it back. (beat) I've been there, I've done that,... then I nailed that demon in a smoke proof coffin and I did it all with Johnny. I love that man, he's what you call class..and if you would use your heads, you would love him too. You know his music sales have gone up a thousand percent in two weeks.
COOKIE (CONT'D): (beat) You see, Johnny "the crack head" Story knows that a "Rocka" is worth more dead than alive, silly world ain't it? (beat) Mr Story doesn't get his gear from me, he has to travel far and wide. Leave me your number and if the dead feels like calling, you'll be the first to know.
CHECHNYAN 1: Victor is Uri's right hand man, we served together for four years in Chechnya. We used to have a good time together, he's a real soldier, strong, hard, we made much trouble. I saved his life and he saved mine many times,...
CHECHNYAN 1 (CONT'D): Caught in tank tracks!      He pulled me out and this one,...
CHECHNYAN 1 (CONT'D): Stem grenade.
CHECHNYAN 2: I have one of those,...
CHECHNYAN 2 (CONT'D): How many of these have you got?
CHECHNYAN 1: Six thirty calibe,....
MUMBLES: There's another case, grab it.
ONE TWO: The bastard's still kicking.     Mace him, mace him!
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, not me you idiot, the Guerrilla!
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Shoot him, shoot him, the bastards going to eat me!
ONE TWO (CONT'D): In his arms!
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Arhhhhhhhhhhh.     That's my fuckin arm!
MUMBLES: Let's go, we've got it.
ONE TWO: Give me a hand, you've blinded me!
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Go, go, go, go!!!!!!
ONE TWO: Give me the gun.
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Shit, what are these two made out of?
MUMBLES: Let's get going.
ONE TWO: I can hardly see, where are we?
MUMBLES: Grab my hand, we're getting out of here.
ONE TWO: Who's got the cases?
MUMBLES: I've got 'em.
ONE TWO: Shoot him Mumbles or we won't get out of this!
MUMBLES: I can't fuckin shoot him, you do it.
ONE TWO: Stop or I'll shoot!
ONE TWO (CONT'D): I mean it, get down,...get down!
MUMBLES: (who has come back to life) I got the cases, now let go.
MUMBLES (CONT'D): Now One Two, now!
ONE TWO: Where's Bob?
HANDSOME BOB: Down.
HANDSOME BOB (CONT'D): Abandon ship!
ONE TWO: Run!     Run for your lives.
MUMBLES: Get on!
LENNY COLE: I will have that painting   with you in a couple of days Uri.    It got locked up with some other   goods of mine, I wanted to keep it   safe, but Archy lost the key to the   lock. Didn't you Arch?
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): Now, I'm not being funny Uri, but I have a payment to make. So if there is any chance that I could get the money.
VICTOR: (in Russian) I need to speak to you Uri.
LENNY COLE: Something wrong with these immigrants Arch, I don't fuckin trust 'em. We're being set up, don't know how, but something's wrong, I can smell it with my sniffer. I thought he was made of fuckin money, not too happy about flashing it around here though is he?
VICTOR: He is the only one that knows.
URI: He doesn't have the balls or the brains.
VICTOR: He's a crook, a small time back handing crook. Once could be a coincidence, but twice and the painting - your "lucky painting" I think he is trying to make a fool out of you.
STELLA: Oh my God, are you all right?
ONE TWO: That is a rhetorical question I hope. (to waiter) A glass of water thank you. (beat) With a straw. (To Stella) Don't you want to know what happened?
STELLA: I know what happened, it's been all over the news, but I didn't realize,...
ONE TWO: You didn't say anything about guns,.. machine guns with war criminals stuck to the trigger.
STELLA: I am sorry I didn't know, but shouldn't you have taken precautions?
ONE TWO: I'll leave your bag under the table all right? (pause) But this isn't about the money is it? I saw you there on that last job. At first I thought it was curiosity,..
ONE TWO (CONT'D): But then I realized what was going on. You don't need the money, you liked the rush. Your old man, can't give you the action can he? (beat) Good-bye sweetheart you're too dangerous for me.
HANDSOME BOB: Is that you Bertie?
BERTIE (V.O.): What's happening about that drink?
HANDSOME BOB: What's happening about that paper work?
BERTIE (V.O.): I am busy tonight, but Monday looks good. I'll leave the papers at my reception under your name and text you the address.
HANDSOME BOB: I'll be round in a jiffy and I'll see you Monday.
ONE TWO: You are scary good at that.
HANDSOME BOB: Do you miss it?
ONE TWO: Shut up Bob or I'll slap you. Go and pick up your paper work from your boy friend and drop me off on the way, I am going back to bed.
LENNY COLE: Arch I don't care if he's fuckin busy, if we call, he answers, that's the deal. There he is,.. (shouting) Councilor,..Councilor!
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): Something wrong with your telephone?
COUNCILOR: What are you doing here Lenny?    You can't come here.
LENNY COLE: Steady, Councilor steady,...I go wherever I fuckin want. This is my town, not yours no matter what you and your pen pushing immigrant boy scouts might think. (pause) Now, what's going on?
COUNCILOR: (hurriedly) Step in here.
COUNCILOR: I can't do it, you've left it too long Lenny. You want something that the city has a ruling against, something they said they wouldn't give permission to build.
LENNY COLE: Don't give me that shit. I can look out my window and there's twenty kinds of buildings this city said they'd never build, how did that happen eh? Fuckin termites got together and had a house building party did they? No sunshine, back handers put them up, back handers just like mine.
COUNCILOR: This isn't fuckin Zaire Lenny, I can't do it this time.
COUNCILOR (CONT'D): Get off my bollocks Lenny.
LENNY COLE: Don't you swear at me you yellow puddle of immigrants piss or I'll fuckin drown you in it.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): (squeeze) Feel that do you Councilor? You think I don't have a paper trail for all the gifts, the cars, holidays, tennis courts and swimming pools? I own these bollocks and they're more fragile than a pair of quails eggs. Now get it done! (squeeze) And next time blue bollocks, remember who the Daddy is!
JOHNNY STORY: Moron,...what do you think your doing?
PETE: What John?
JOHNNY STORY: Letting creatures in my yard without my consent.
PETE: They're good stuff John, Scotch and Scouse.
MALCOLM: Like the drink and the Beatles. I am Malcolm and this is my friend and colleague Paul, you know like the saint.
MALCOLM (CONT'D): Paul doesn't say much, he's too busy thinking. (beat) Come on, we know you John, we're big fans, you're what they call a real rocknrolla.
JOHNNY: Out!! Good-bye, on your way, bon voyage and fuck off.
JOHNNY (CONT'D): What is this a laydown?     A fuckin demo?
MALCOLM: Leave us be Johnny, we're nice people. Peaceful people. This is a demonstration of peace.
JOHNNY: Where the fuck did you find these two junkies? Conference, now Pete.
JOHNNY STORY: Pedro I swear this is the last time I'm having you take the piss, next time you're on your own.
PETE: Sorry, I thought you might like some company.
JOHNNY STORY: I am dead Pete, what does that tell you? It tells you, that dead people don't like company! Now jog 'em on.
PETE: All right, I'll tell 'em to leave.
JOHNNY STORY: Yes you fucking well will, smelly junkies. Meeting adjourned.
PETE: You've scared 'em off sing-a-long, but with a welcome like that it's not all that shocking.
JOHNNY STORY: Lucky you're not following them.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): Where's the picture Pete?
FRED THE HEAD: Hi ho it's the werewolf brothers, what you got for us today?
MALCOLM: Paul, please exhibit to the audience the fine artifact.
MALCOLM (CONT'D): Now, now young Paul rest your weary legs. (beat. here comes the pitch) Gentlemen,...we are entering the realm of the ancient art form of paint on canvas,...
COOKIE: I'll have it, how much?
MALCOLM: (stunned) One moment sir, there's a pitch that comes with this painting,....
COOKIE: I don't want the pitch, I said I'll have it.
MALCOLM: It's a very rare and expensive painting sir.
COOKIE: Here ya go, have a week in snow.
MALCOLM: Good afternoon gentlemen, it's been a pleasure. I can hardly wait till the next time.
LENNY COLE: I'll have that painting in a couple of days Uri, trust me on that.
URI: You like it out here Lenny?
LENNY COLE: Can't beat the great outdoors can you Uri? I can't understand it, not a soul out here.
URI: That's because I have had the course cleared for us Lenny, we are not going to be disturbed.
LENNY COLE: Oh that's good, I love a clear fair way, that's a bitta me that Uri. Nothing worse than being jogged on by blind tourists swinging a stick on a Sunday.
URI: What are we going to do Lenny? Every time I am about to make my payment something dishonest happens. (pause) You, wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
LENNY COLE: Excuse me? Are you trying to say something Uri?
URI: I am not trying Lenny, I am saying something.
LENNY COLE: I think you forget who you are speaking to you insolent bastard. You forget where you are you fuckin immigrant. This is my land, my fuckin show, I run this tow,....
URI: I have to go now Lenny, I am having lunch with the Councilor, your Councilor. This, as you know, is the ninth hole and it is a long crawl back to your car. You should make it by sunrise, just in time to bring me my "lucky picture." I want it back do you hear me?
LENNY COLE: Yes,..yes.
URI: After that, I don't want to hear from you again, disappear do you understand me Lenny? (Victor stands on his broken legs arrrrgh) Lenny?
LENNY COLE: Yes, yes, I understand.
URI: Times just change. (Uri gets in the buggy) Good bye Lenny.
ONE TWO: Yeah?
MUMBLES: We've found out about that informer. Your lady "the beard," her old man came through.
ONE TWO (V.O.): What?
HANDSOME BOB: It's here in my hands, THE informer, the one responsible for all the sentences we have been seeing - all of 'em, including me.
ONE TWO (V.O.): Well, who is it then?
MUMBLES: Who's Sidney Shaw?
ONE TWO: Sidney Shaw is a pseudonym you idiot, they never use the real name. Get around here and let me have a look.
NURSE: Don't try and move it'll be too painful before tonight.
LENNY COLE: Give me the water, Aaaaaahhhhh,..
NURSE: I told you not to move.
LENNY COLE: Broke my legs in four places Archy, did you hear that? The bastard's made me limp for the rest of my days.
ARCHY: What do you want me to do?
LENNY COLE: I need that picture Archy, I need it bad.
ARCHY: I'll get it, don't you worry and I think I can do better than that.
LENNY COLE: What?
ARCHY: Someone has been at the Russian's money, a couple of silly gun slingers,..he wasn't making up stories.
LENNY COLE: What?
ARCHY: You know 'em and you don't like 'em either.
LENNY COLE: I ain't playing fuckin games here Arch look at me, who?
ARCHY: Mumbles, Bob and One Two.
ONE TWO: Look at you, good as new.
STELLA: I have to go now.
ONE TWO: Fancy sharing some dancing lessons with me later in the week, a bitta the 'ol salsa?
STELLA: (she smiles) I'll take you up on that.
ONE TWO: I got something for you. Thought you might like it, seeing as you like paintings and all. (he motions) There, it's on floor.
ONE TWO (CONT'D): Like it?
STELLA: You have very good taste,...Mr One Two.
STELLA (CONT'D): Good bye.
ROMAN: So why did you call Johnny?
JOHNNY STORY: Sorry, Johnny's not home right now, but the pipe is and the pipe says that Johnny heard you were getting in trouble boys.
ROMAN: Look, whoever I am talking to please relay the message to Johnny. His Dad, his jack in the box surprise gangster Daddy, paid us a visit. Shut down a few of our venues and he intends to shut down a few more unless Mr Story puts in an appearance.
JOHNNY STORY: Why are you talking to a pipe Roman? You're madder than I am.
MICKEY: Come back Johnny, come back home.
JOHNNY STORY: But home is where your head is and I don't feel at home in my head. (beat) Come back Johnny!
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): I bet our Lenny gave you the "I'm his old man" speech didn't he? (impersonating Lenny) I've seen jelly fish with closer DNA than that slag. Now Johnny will come quietly, but you might have a couple of problems with the pipe. (he sighs) Come on boys, buy us both a cup of tea. No need for any noise, let Pete sleep on.
VICTOR: Uri is a man born with nothing, carved his way up the hard way, he's smart, young and only one thing will stop him from reaching his goals,...women. And this woman has become a problem. (pause) My job is to protect Uri and in this department he needs protecting, I don't like her or trust her and I want you to follow that snake.
CHECHNYAN 1: Leave it with me Victor.
ARCHY: Is this a bad time One Two?
ONE TWO: (unable to say anything) Emmm, emmmmmmmmmmmm.
ARCHY: Shall we come back later?
ONE TWO: (still unable to say anything) Emmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
MUMBLES (V.O.): One Two, it's us.
LENNY COLE (V.O.): Bring 'em to the warehouse and don't hurt 'em until I've spoken to 'em, all right?
ARCHY: All right Lenny, I got a call waiting here, I'll see ya at the show.
ARCHY (CONT'D): Hello?
ROMAN: Archy?
JOHNNY STORY: Hello Archy.
ARCHY: Johnny, you do look the part.
JOHNNY STORY: Show us your guns Uncle Arch, I told the boys all about it.
ARCHY: Shut up and get in the car.
JOHNNY STORY: Give us your money boys.
ARCHY: You little swine,... now get in the car.
ARCHY (CONT'D): Be good boys, you never know who's watching.
BANDY: You wanna take the stairs or the elevator Mr Cole?
LENNY COLE: Come here Bandy.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): You been drinking again?
BANDY: No,....Mr Cole.
LENNY COLE: Think before you drink and before you drive me mad Bandy.
JOHNNY STORY: Don't worry boys, nothing to be nervous about, some of my Dad's best friends ended up here.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): Hello Arch, wrapped up in a carpet just like the old days? (beat) What is it today? The rack? The garotte? Or is it the old cray fish trap?
ARCHY: Still full of hot air Johnny.
JOHNNY STORY: You're looking a bit down, has that old clown been working you long hours? (beat) You always were loyal - no dog like a loyal dog.
ARCHY: Watch your mouth John.
JOHNNY STORY: (feigning fear) Don't hit me Archy, I'm a singer not a fighter. (back to normal) I've just the remedy for you, a story, a Johnny Story and it's all about you.
ARCHY: I don't want to hear it.
JOHNNY STORY: Sorry, that's right get into character. (beat) Look at him boys, scary ain't he?
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): That's what four years inside does to a man, eats his soul and when it's all gone it makes a man quite scary. Ever wondered how you got there? Ever wondered what grass informed on you?
JOHNNY STORY: So who we got in there? Anyone I know? Anyone famous? That's right it's only a job, isn't it? Just being loyal, just following orders.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): (Johnny salutes) I bet you can operate a nice gas shower,..I can see you with a couple of S's on your collar and a stiff goose in your step.
ARCHY: Shut it, otherwise you will get hurt.
JOHNNY STORY: That, Roman and Mickey, is the famous Archy slap. I have been magically transported straight back to my childhood.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): Don't turn Archy in, he's your friend, he's loyal, just like the dog.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): Shut up boy, don't stick your nose where it don't belong otherwise I'll chop it off. (little boy voice) But you can't do it to Uncle Arch, I love him. (deep) Needs a little lesson though don't he? Left his station hasn't he? A little time inside to remember who the boss is.
ARCHY: (shouting) Shut it, you hear me or I'll do ya myself, you poisonous little fucker!
JOHNNY STORY: (feigning fear) Don't hurt me Arch, I'm only little.
DANNY: Put him down Arch, he's only little.
DANNY (CONT'D): You all right?     You look a little green.
ARCHY: (back to business) Fine, roll out the carpets.
JOHNNY STORY: Sidney!   Nice wheels.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): Sorry about the painting, needed the cash for a little bit of the old "dusty show bizzzzzzzz." (beat) So, it's gone now, lost in the world of degenerate and stoned no hopers, never to be seen again by the eye of a clean soul.
LENNY COLE: Tell me, what are you boy if you are not poison? Look what you've left behind you. Your Dad couldn't even bear the sight ya, no wonder he fucked off and left me to pick up the pieces, but that wasn't enough for you was it? No, had to drive your mum into a bottle of pills and house full of nutters. All she got then was a hot bath a ice cold razor, why? (beat) Cos your poison Johnny, that's why.
JOHNNY STORY: What can I say,... (pause) I'm a junkie, crack head, no gooder, should never have wasted your money on that school.
LENNY COLE: Archy get him out of here.
ARCHY: I've had enough of him, I don't trust myself. (beat) Use someone else.
JOHNNY STORY: It's a gathering, I love a gathering look, Mumbles, One Two, Handsome Bob all the old faces today. (beat) It's all going so well apart from Archy who's ruining the day. I tried to cheer him up with that story about how you grassed him u,...
ROMAN: Whooooa,...
ARCHY: All right calm down, give me that, I'll take care of him.
JOHNNY STORY: That wasn't one of your better shots was it now Daddy. If you want to shut me up it should have been a bit higher.
LENNY COLE: (quietly) Danny come here, I want him taken care of, you hear? Now get him out.
LENNY COLE (CONT'D): You don't know how much trouble you have caused me so please understand that I will kill you very slowly if you do not tell me where my money is.
HANDSOME BOB: The address is in my top pocket. Here, Archy,...you know I wouldn't mess you around.
HANDSOME BOB (CONT'D): Take it Arch.
LENNY COLE: Let me have a look first.
ARCHY: Here you can't read it without your glasses, let me have a look.
LENNY COLE: What does it say?      Hurry,...
JOHNNY STORY: Don't worry just yet fellas, nothing's going to happen while we're standing in the elevator because they don't
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): want to have to drag the three corpses across to the cars that would be hard work.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): In about two minutes from now, when we're all driving along happily,...
JOHNNY STORY (V.O.): Danny boy is going to turn around and "pop me" two in the head and one in throat just to make sure. (beat) And then, since Danny is obviously going to kill you two as well,...
ARCHY: You wanna know what this says Len? (beat) Funny thing with the law, it can be quite flexible. Every time an informer finds himself in front of a judge,...
JUDGE: A secret letter stands witness as to the cooperation and efficiency of that informer.
LAWYER: An accurate record of his treachery will be brought in to protect the informer,...
ARCHY: If the informer has provided adequate information, that dog of dogs will be magically released,...
JUDGE: A sort of, "get out of jail free" card, but this comes along with the trail of a good alibi.
LAWYER: The only evidence that will ever remain of this deal is that form of a very exclusive and hard to come by legal document called a "secret debt"...
ARCHY: As in deputation,... (beat) The likes of which I hold for the very first time in my hand. (beat) Of course they use a false name and I have seen that name many times in the last twenty years, always did wonder who Sidney Shaw was,...
ARCHY: Who's this Sidney Shaw Len?
LENNY COLE: (bothered) Give us that here.
LENNY COLE: No, I am being set up.
ARCHY: You're a dirty bastard Sidney, a very dirty bastard.
ARCHY (CONT'D): (to One Two, Handsome Bob and Mumbles) You three, cut yourself free and get out of here,...
ARCHY (CONT'D): Michael Finny, ten years. Frazier Nash, fifteen years. Cousin Ronnie, six years,..you dirty bastard. (beat) Michael Dexter, eight years.
ARCHY (CONT'D): The Jew twins, fourteen years and of course ME, Archy, four years.
ONE TWO: See ya Arch,....
JOHNNY: Shouldn't have brought me here fellas, you're just going to end up as witnesses.
JOHNNY: After they have "dealt" with us, they're gonna put all three of us in the trunk of a stolen car,...
JOHNNY: And pour six gallons of petrol on top, I can let your imagination fill in the rest.
JOHNNY: But now Danny's rattled, he won't be able to wait because you now know what's coming, so he's gonna fire.
JOHNNY STORY: Mickey, pass me the gun.
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D): MICKEY quickly, pass me that gun in Dannys hand. Don't worry he can't defend himself he doesn't have a head, quickly now. Does this answer the question that you two so frequently asked as to why I sought refuge in the depths and perverse beauty of the crack pipe?
BANDY: Get fucking down!
ONE TWO: I think we should get out of here now, don't you John?
VICTOR: I don't like it Uri, I don't trust her. I put two of my people on her and they haven't come back.
URI: You what? I did not tell you to do this. If I had wanted her spied on I would have asked for it, wouldn't
VICTOR: Yes Uri, you would have, but I still don't like it.
URI: I don't care what you like Victor, I am in charge, now wait here.
URI: Can I come in?
URI: Sorry to surprise you, but I have something for you, a token of my appreciation.
STELLA: What is this for?
URI: Please do not be insulted, you have come to mean a lot to me and I value you much more than just your services. (pause) This is simply a reflection of my appreciation. (vulnerable he likes her) I would like to ask you something personal.
URI (CONT'D): Not now Victor, I am busy.
URI (CONT'D): A very nice painting. How long have you had it?
STELLA: Years, it's my lucky painting,... it's very special isn't it?
URI: Beauty is a cruel mistress, is it not?
URI (CONT'D): Victor please, come to join us.
