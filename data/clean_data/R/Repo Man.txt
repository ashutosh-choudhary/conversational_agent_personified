REVEREND LARRY: Occasionally we get a letter from a viewer that says now the only reason Reverend Larry comes on your television set is because he wants your money. And do you know what? They're right! I do want your money. Because god wants your money. So I want you to go out and mortgage that home and sell that car and send me your money. You don't need that car. ( continues in background )

OTTO MOM: You father gave all our extra money to the Reverend's telethon, Otto.
OTTO: Well what about me?
OTTO DAD: You're on the honor roll of the chariots of fire. Same as us, Otto. It was a gift. From all of us jointly.
OTTO MOM: We're sending bibles to El Salvador.
OTTO: So how much do I get paid, twenty-five buck a car.
BUD: Paid? You don't get paid. Are you kidding, you work on commission, that's better than getting paid.
BUD: Most cars you rip are worth two or three hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar Porsche ( german pronounciation ) might make ya five grand.
BUD: It helps if you dress like a detective, too. Detectives dress kind of square. People think this guy is a cop. They're going to think you're packing something. They don't fuck ( mess ) with you so much.
OTTO: Are you?
BUD: Am I what?
OTTO: Packin' something.
BUD: Ha. Only an asshole ( a jackass ) gets killed for a car. Guys who make it are the guys who get into their cars at anytime. Get in at three A.M. get up at four. That's why there ain't a repo man I know that don't take speed.
OTTO: Speed huh?
BUD: I'll call you back! ( hangs up ) Flippin general telephone.
BUD: Otto and Bud in car in alley ( In the television version, this entire scene takes place while watching Bud's car drive down a road, but you can still hear the snorting in the background. )
BUD: Never broke into a car. Never hot-wired a car. Kid. I never broke into a trunk. I shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof. Nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm. That's what I call the repo code kid. Don't forget it etch it in your brain. Not many people got a code to live by anymore.
BUD: Hey! Hey look at that. Look at those assholes ( that ) over there.
BUD: Ordinary people I hate 'em.
OTTO: Me too.
BUD: What do you know? See an ordinary person spend his life avoiding tense situations. Repoman spends his life getting into tense situations. ! Lets go get a drink.
BUD: Tense situations kid. Get into five or six of them a day and it don't mean shit ( zilch ) anymore. I mean I seen men stabbed and it didn't mean shit ( zilch ). I've seen guns. Guns too they don't mean shit ( zilch ) but that's when you got to watch your self. Here I'll handle it pal. Uh settle down.
BUD: Have a nice day. Or night. Night, day, it doesn't mean shit ( zilch ).
DUKE: Wasn't that Otto?
DEBBI: Otto who?
DUKE: You gotta watch yourself. ( takes off mask ) Have a nice day . . . night.
BUD: This is what I call phase 2 ace. If the dealer don't have the keys, you call the truck. And it is a heartbreak to be sitting waiting for the truck and the giblet comes out and drives it away. Once you've got this baby on the hooks, she's all ours.
PAKMAN: Oh no you don't. I'm nipping this in the bud right now. You are not going to take this car. I know my rights. There is absolutely no way you're going to take it.
BUD: Uh, are you miss Luann Pakman?
PAKMAN: Obviously not. I'm Arthur Pakman. Luann is my daughter. Now you're going to have to take this matter up with her.
BUD: Well don't think I haven't tried, sir, but she hasn't had the decency to call us in months. I mean, I've skipped trace this car all over town.
PAKMAN: Well, uh, Luann is sick. Now the damn car isn't working anyway, and I know, I know that's why she hasn't paid you.
BUD: Well, she could have called us? Look, all you've go to do is call my branch manager, I will abide with whatever he says.
BUD: What, and lose my job? The law requires that I stay right here until you call my branch manager.
PAKMAN: That's the law?
BUD: That's the law.
PAKMAN: I'll be right back.
BUD: There's going to be some bad shit ( stuff ) coming down one of these days kid.

MARLENE: Why? We out of beer?
OLY: Somebody has to work around here. Keep making me money kid.
OTTO: Fuck ( flip ) you.
LITE: Man we've been looking for this little red devil for a long time. Just act natural. Nobody knows if its your car or somebody elses car.

LITE: I walk into someone's place of work. They shit ( plum ) scared. They know I'm not a cop. They think I've come to kill 'em and I would. I'd kill anybody who crosses me. You know what I mean?
LITE: Do you like music?
OTTO: In that case you're going love this.
LITE: In that case you're going love this.
LITE: I was into these dudes before anybody. Partied with them all the time. Asked me to be their manager. I called bullshit ( no way ) on that. Managing a pop group hey that ain't no job for no man.
LITE: You read that book I gave you?
OTTO: What book?
LITE: Dioretix. Science of matter over mind.
OTTO: Unh uhg
LITE: You'd better read it and quick. That book will change your life. Found it in a Maseratti in Beverly hills.
MILLER: A lot of people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and things. They don't realize that there's this like lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything. I'll Give you an example, show you what I mean. Suppose you thinking about a plate of shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out of the blue no explanation. No point in looking for one either. It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness.
OTTO: You eat a lot of acid Miller, back in the hippie days?
MILLER: I'll give you another instance. You know the way everybody's into weirdness right now. Books in all the supermarkets about Bermuda triangles, UFO's, how the Mayans invented television. That kind of thing.
OTTO: I don't read them books.
MILLER: Well the way I see it it's exactly the same. There ain't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine. People get so hung up on specifics. They miss out on seeing the whole thing. Take South America for example. In South America thousands of people go missing every year. Nobody knows where they go. They just like disappear. But if you think about it for a minute, you realize something. There had to be a time when there was no people. Right?
OTTO: Yeah. I guess.
MILLER: Well where did all these people come from? hmmm? I'll tell you where. The future. Where did all these people disappear to? hmmm?
OTTO: The past?
MILLER: That's right and how did they get there?
OTTO: How the fuck ( hell ) do I know?
MILLER: Flying saucers. Which are really? Yeah you got it. Time machines. I think a lot about this kind of stuff. I do my best thinking on the bus. That how come I don't drive, see?
OTTO: You don't even know how to drive.
MILLER: I don't want to know how. I don't want to learn. See? The more you drive, the less intelligent you are.
BUD: You know I think I saw one of those things once. One of those UFOs. I mean it was really it was kind of kind of scary. I saw all these colored lights and, uh, sounds. I mean sounds and lights like I never heard before. I mean it was really weird.
OTTO: Do you think all repo men follow the Of course. Well I mean you see a lot of fucked ( messed ) up cars come in but.99 time out of 100 it was the customer who fucked ( mucked ) them up. Assholes ( Damn fools ).
BUD: Do you think all repo men follow the Of course. Well I mean you see a lot of fucked ( messed ) up cars come in but.99 time out of 100 it was the customer who fucked ( mucked ) them up. Assholes ( Damn fools ).

BUD: We could buy ten of them for that, Marlene.
NAPOLEON: We could buy ten of them for that, Marlene.
MARLENE: Think you can find it now?
NAPOLEON: Now how come this junk is worth so much? What's in it? Drugs?
LAGARTO: Los Hermanos Rodriguez don't approve of drugs.
MARLENE: Neither do I, but it's my birthday.

BUD: Don't care how long it takes, dildos ( jerks ). Repo man's got all night every

OTTO: Oh yeah? Me too.
LEILA: Your work is different than mine.

LITE: No way you can do that on twenty grand The hell I can as long as you have good credit and my credit is spotless.
BUD: The hell I can as long as you have good credit and my credit is spotless.
LITE: If I find the Malibu, you won't see me for dust, I'm going to move to Mendecino County, raise me a bumper crop of tomato
BUD: Credit is a sacred trust. It's what our free society is founded on. You think they give a damn about their bills in Russia? I said do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia?
OTTO: They don't pay bills in Russia. It's all free.
BUD: All free? Free my ass, what are you a fucking ( flippin ) commie? Huh?
OTTO: No I ain't no commie.
