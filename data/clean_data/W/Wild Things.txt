SANDRA: What? Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat.
SAM: Swamp's where it's at, Sandy. Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of. You ought to try it some time.

KELLY: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - VAN RYAN ESTATE - NEXT DAY Sunlight streams through open windows, mingling with loud sighs of pleasure. Sandra Van Ryan on top of FRANKIE CONDO, a big, buffed-out Cuban. They're making love on the bed. She throws her head back an explosion of hair gasps an orgasm is near, as. A cordless PHONE RINGS on the night table. They try to ignore it. No dice. Sandra groans, finally pulling away.

SANDRA: Listen, Kelly skipped school. Have you talked to her?
SAM: Shit. Here we go again.
SANDRA: Shit. Here we go again.
SAM: Didn't you see her this morning?
SANDRA: To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
SAM: So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
SANDRA: ( beat ) You really think you're gonna get one of these Blue Bay women to marry you?
SAM: Goodbye, Sandra.
SANDRA: The nerve of some people.
SANDRA: You seem to find guns therapeutic. Maybe I oughta try it.
KELLY: Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
SANDRA: Whichever one I want.
SANDRA: Okay, what's the matter?
KELLY: You notice my new jumper?
SANDRA: I would hardly say you look like trash.
KELLY: No thanks to you.
SANDRA: Come off of it. You run with all these little trust fund brats. They think money grows on trees. It doesn't. Believe me. And a lot of your little friends are gonna learn that one the hard way. I'm trying to spare you that.
KELLY: I miss Dad.
SANDRA: ( a long beat ) Well, I do too, sometimes.
KELLY: No you don't.
SANDRA: He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman. He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
SANDRA: What, honey? I can't hear you.
KELLY: I said. I was raped.
SANDRA: I was raped. By Sam Lombardo.
KELLY: I was raped. By Sam Lombardo.
SANDRA: He. Sam Lombardo?
KELLY: Yes. God, Mom.
RAY: ( in a quiet voice ) You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
SANDRA: That's right.
GLORIA: The guidance counselor at Blue Bay?
SANDRA: ( sarcastically ) The guidance counselor at Blue Bay.
GLORIA: We understand your feelings, Ms. Van Ryan. But please, we'd like some time with Kelly. We'd like to take her statement alone.
SANDRA: Are you okay for this?
GLORIA: How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
KELLY: ( shaking her head ) I just want to get it over with. My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
GLORIA: I know you do.
KELLY: He started rubbing my shoulders. Said must be sore after washing cars. I. let him I mean he's a nice guy. I don't know. It was so fast. I closed my eyes. I remember his hands moved to my breasts. I mean just for a second it was nice. I forgot whore I was. I mean he's so gorgeous.
KELLY: The next thing. his hand was in my shorts. you know, from behind. His fingers. his fingers.
KELLY: They were in me. Both places. you I understand.
KELLY: He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something. I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
KELLY: Yes. I said stop. I screamed. I mean that's how it sounded in my head. He hurt me.
KELLY: No. I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated. But this hurt. like, he was built. you He was large?
KELLY: I. he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
KELLY: He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen." Then he just stopped.
KELLY: Not at first. He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything. He said we had this secret. And that now he'd be able to help me. because we were close. Something like that. I don't know. It's hard to remember, exactly.
KELLY: I know one thing he said. It was when. when he took himself out and was standing up. He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that. He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
HUNTER: "No little girl can ever make me come." Jesus. Too bad. We might have some physical evidence.
GLORIA: I don't know. It feels wrong.
HUNTER: I think she's acting. I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her. I think maybe she's upset that he Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for.
GLORIA: I think she's acting. I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her. I think maybe she's upset that he Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for.
RAY: Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for.
HUNTER: The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
GLORIA: That doesn't make him a child rapist. There's something else. This girl's had some problems. Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars. Ran away.
HUNTER: Where's this coming from?
GLORIA: I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years. We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks. Maybe a year ago. The family kept it out of the papers.
RAY: That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide. You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
GLORIA: All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
HUNTER: I want a full-scale investigation.
GLORIA: You know what that will mean for I don't care. You heard that girl's statement. I think he's dirty. Get me a case.
HUNTER: I don't care. You heard that girl's statement. I think he's dirty. Get me a case.
GLORIA: Well you were a big help. You know what's going to happen if we go full-bore on this.
RAY: It's our job, Gloria.
GLORIA: Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do. We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really
SAM: That's good, Jimbo. I'll see you on
ART: Kelly Van Ryan.
SAM: . is accusing me of rape. Jimmy told me. Apparently I'm the last to know.
ART: Sam. I. Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long. She's pushing for suspension.
SAM: This is insane.
ART: All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there. They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay.
SAM: That's great. I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist. No problem. Shit. I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
ART: The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school. Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle. You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam. You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
SECRETARY: Mr. Bowden will see you now.
KEN: Sam, hey, it's been a while. Looked for you at the ten year reunion. You missed out. Three days at the Disneyworld Hotel. Partied ourselves
SAM: ( interrupting ) Ken. I'm in some trouble. I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
KEN: Well, I'm glad you did. And I'm sorry. Why don't you tell me about it.
SAM: What did you do to your neck?
KEN: Oh this. chiropractor did a number on
SAM: Georgie, hey. I'm meeting Barbara. She here yet?
GEORGE: Mr. Lombardo.
BAXTER: This is not appropriate Lombardo.
SAM: You're finished in Blue Bay, Lombardo. You've been scratching at the door long I ever see you around my daughter, you're going to be finished, period.
BAZTER: You're finished in Blue Bay, Lombardo. You've been scratching at the door long I ever see you around my daughter, you're going to be finished, period.
BARMAID: Sam, honey. Haven't seen you in a while. How's life treatin' you? That bad, huh? Well, you came to the right place.
MAN'S VOICE: Are you all right?
SAM: Yeah, I'm okay.
FRANKIE: That's too bad.
KEN: I figured, you know, it would be darker in here.
SAM: Good thinking.
KEN: You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Forget it.
SAM: Forget it.
KEN: Lady has some deep pockets. That's all I'm saying.
SAM: I know how deep her pockets are, Ken. I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
KEN: Not in here. Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
SAM: What's that supposed to mean?
KEN: For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you. It doesn't add up. Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared. And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
SAM: Nellie Gail Ranch.
KEN: Sound nice? It's a fucking drug rehab farm. It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury. Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet. Reason? They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty. Now tell me I'm right.
SAM: There's nothing for them to get.
KEN: Good. So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep. We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back. They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious I just want my life back.
SAM: I just want my life back.
KEN: Fair enough. Let's go make a statement.
RAY: Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your Story's the same, Detective.
SAM: ( with growing impatience ) Story's the same, Detective.
RAY: The one you bought at school.
SAM: ( nodding ) Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it. ( beat ) Anyway, I'm going through a drawer. I hear a car. I look out the window. I see Nicole driving away. I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
RAY: In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
SAM: And she wanted to talk.
RAY: And she wanted to talk.
SAM: But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
RAY: But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
SAM: I could, but it's confidential. Look, the point is, we didn't talk. I told her this was not an appropriate time or And she began to cry. And you put an arm around her.
RAY: And she began to cry. And you put an arm around her.
SAM: Yes. Mainly to turn her toward the door. I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
GLORIA: And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
SAM: Again. I think we covered this. I told her I was going to call a cab.
RAY: But she ran away.
SAM: That's right.
GLORIA: Did you call anyone? Did you call her house to see if she got home? Did you call the Masons?
SAM: Weren't you a little worried about There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house. There's phones there. I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found. I don't know. Maybe I should have called. But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself. I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the

RAY: But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her. Isn't that against the rules?
SAM: It is and I don't. Ordinarily. But, I mean. there's this kid standing in front of you crying.
RAY: With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra.
SAM: Fuck you. This is bullshit. I'm outta Sit down, Lombardo.
RAY: Sit down, Lombardo.
KEN: All right, all right. Enough.
KEN: I didn't think so. Let's go.
SAM: I've spent the last ten years of my life working with kids. I love what I do, and I think I'm good at it. These kids trust me, and there is no way. No way in hell I would ever betray that trust.
HUNTER: Nice speech. Either of you buying?

HUNTER: What about witnesses?

GLORIA: Same as him. They saw her come. They saw her go. They saw him follow.
RAY: Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her. I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
COP: Phone, Bryce. It's Sandra Van Ryan.
HUNTER: Christ Almighty. That woman's calling me six times a day.
GLORIA: We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there. Same with the kids. They saw her running down the street, but that's With no physical evidence, what do we have? Her word against his.
RAY: You're telling me you believe the guy?
GLORIA: All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
RAY: I'd better return this.
RAY: ( off Gloria's look ) Seen any good gator wrestling lately?
GLORIA: They say it was old man Van Ryan planted the melalucas to dry up the swamp.
RAY: Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his. I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
CAMP.": The Taurus bounces along the washboard road.
GLORIA: You're sure we're not lost?

RAY: So Suzie, you called us, remember?
SUZIE: Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?
RAY: Will they?
SUZIE: Will they?
RAY: It doesn't look like it.
SUZIE: Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
GLORIA: That bothers you?
SUZIE: ( a long beat ) Yeah, maybe, a little.
GLORIA: Why is that?
GLORIA: Okay, Suzie. We want you to tell us about the day Mr. Lombardo gave you and Jimmy a ride.
SUZIE: You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
GLORIA: We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us. Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?

SUZIE: Kelly's pissed at Mr. Lombardo, too. She's in love with him. I mean her whole fantasy is him since her old man died. Then she found out that Mr. Lombardo was doing her mom. I mean that was it.
KELLY: You stupid little bitch.
SAM: I've found that adolescents make the best liars. They're old enough to be good at it, but you want like hell to believe them, because they're still
KEN: ( hyped ) Come on, let loose!
SAM: I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay. I lost the house. It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
KEN: You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
SAM: Just like that?
KEN: Just like that? These people ruined your life, bro.
SAM: You don't think you're overdoing it?
SANDRA: I hope you're going to nail his scrotum to the nearest wall.
BAXTER: That might have been a possibility, if little miss not-so-bright here hadn't started throwing things.
KELLY: Fuck off.
BAXTER: See what I mean.
SANDRA: You're going to let them get away with this. this shit? On the word of one little white trash bitch.
BAXTER: You like seeing your name in the papers?
SANDRA: You've got to be kidding.
HAXTER: The man's life has been destroyed. There will always be doubters, no matter what happened in court.
SANDRA: I'm not paying any idiot twenty million I said that's what they'd ask for.
BAXTER: I said that's what they'd ask for.
SANDRA: I hope you're happy.
KELLY: EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY Sam cruises slowly across the water in his junked-out air boat. He kills the engine, allowing the craft to glide to a stop. He's close to where he found the big gator the same shabby collection of whitewashed buildings we now RECOGNIZE as the Glades Motel, shimmers in the distance. Sam leans back, enjoying the silence. He reaches into a cooler, takes out a beer, opens it, takes a drink, then pulls something else from the cooler a bundle of white butcher's paper. Sam opens the paper, takes out raw meat something disgusting to look at big red turkey necks, maybe, which he tosses into the water.
KEN: Tom Baxter. Good to see you again.

KELLY: Why don't you start fucking her again. You can spend it together.
SAM: You see. I couldn't stay, even if I wanted to.
FRANKIE: I'll be seeing you. So long, Tom. Come by sometime. We'll have lunch at the Beef Bowl.
KEN: So long, Tom. Come by sometime. We'll have lunch at the Beef Bowl.
BAXTER: I don't think you're gonna be eating at the Beef Bowl anymore, kid.
SAM: Thanks Ken, you did okay.
KEN: ( no clowning now ) Look, I know there's a part of you wishes none of this had happened. But it did. Now take the money and get out of here. Find a happy place.
SAM: Damn maid.
SAM: The neon green face flashes again in the mirror DISAPPEARS. Now the bathroom door slowly opens all the way. Sam backs up, hits the wall. Kelly Van Ryan steps out of the bathroom, a long object held at her side, wrapped in a towel.
SAM: Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
KELLY: So you got my mom's money.
SAM: About six and a half million dollars.
KELLY: Your turn to pay.
SAM: God, you scared the shit out of me. You must be crazy coming here.
KELLY: Of course I'm crazy. Ask my mom.
SUZIE: How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
SAM: Jesus. Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
KELLY: Hey, come on. We've got to have at least one victory party. Kelly, for christ's sake.
SAM: Kelly, for christ's sake.
KELLY: ( her hand in his crotch ) Do it to ourselves?
SAM: ( weakening ) We have to stick with the plan.
KELLY: Sam gives up, lays back as Kelly undoes his pants, then moves to get him inside her. Suzie watches. She takes another drink, then tosses the bottle, pulling off her top, REVEALING her small, white breasts, a couple of tattoos, a pierced nipple. She slips behind Kelly, fondling Kelly's breasts as Sam arches beneath them both all of them totally into it now, losing themselves in the sex.
RAY: You saw the news today?
GLORIA: Lombardo's settlement?
RAY: Hey, don't back away from it, you were right. We did look stupid. What you were wrong about, is who made us look that way.
GLORIA: Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
RAY: I thought of that. Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo. Your reputation is getting trashed. You want to stop the bleeding. You don't want to sit in jail for three months. Unless.
GLORIA: Unless what?
RAY: Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
GLORIA: Why? You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life. He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're The job looks okay to us. But look at it from his point of view. The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege. But for him. it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
RAY: ( interrupting ) The job looks okay to us. But look at it from his point of view. The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege. But for him. it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
GLORIA: So what about the girls? Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother? Surely her father.
RAY: ( interrupting ) Her father didn't leave her squat. The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
GLORIA: This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
RAY: I flat don't like the guy, Glory. He's dirty. And I'll tell you something else. You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money? He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal. It was after the war. Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him. The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
GLORIA: Eliminate the competition.
RAY: You got it. The rich got richer. While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
GLORIA: Where'd you come up with this stuff, I net a guy in a bar.
RAY: ( a long beat; then I net a guy in a bar.
KELLY: Is there some reason why you're here?
RAY: Curiosity, I guess.
KELLY: About what? How to improve your breast
RAY: Actually, I was curious about how you see things working out, for you, Sam and
KELLY: Excuse me?
RAY: You all gonna go down to the Caribbean
KELLY: You're out of your mind.
RAY: I've been a cop for a while, Kelly. It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three. And then there's the love angle. I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the
KELLY: Police God get a life.
RAY: ( loud enough to make You're good. But you don't think that little ditz Suzie's gonna hold together, do you?
SUZIE: You don't know Duquette. I'm the one he busted. He's a fucker, man. He'll fuck us both over.
KELLY: Will you calm down. Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
SUZIE: Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me. You've got family and they've got clout. With we it's different. with me.
KELLY: ( circling her with her Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me. Right? And Sam. Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere. He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it. Stay strong and he can't do ( a long beat ) Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
SUZIE: ( a long beat ) Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
RAY: You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie. You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
SUZIE: You got something against cigarettes?
RAY: Yeah, they're bad for your health. I'm tryin' to look out for you.
SUZIE: That's cop bullshit.
RAY: Well, you're half right. Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
SUZIE: About what?
RAY: Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go.
SUZIE: Is this supposed to mean something to me? What triangle?
RAY: You, Kelly, Sam.
SUZIE: I don't have to listen to this. And you can't shove me around. I have friends
RAY: Is that what you think? You have friends? Is that what they told you?
SUZIE: I don't mean who you're thinking. I have other friends.
RAY: Suzie, Suzie. This is me, Ray, you're talking to. We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit.
SUZIE: Get away from me.
RAY: Don't you see what this means? You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money? You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
SUZIE: Shut up.
RAY: You know, I don't think I ever told you I was sorry about your little friend. What was his name?
SUZIE: ( nodding, a scary smile ) That's right. That was his name.
RAY: ( nodding, a scary smile ) That's right. That was his name.
HEADLIGHTS: Suzie's VW bouncing along the dirt road, turning onto the RAY'S TRUCK - RAY watching, then starting his truck and pulling out onto the highway, following the tiny red lights of Suzie's bug.
KELLY: I can't believe you called Sam. What's the matter with you?
SUZIE: I'm scared, that's what. I'm scared there's no one to trust.
KELLY: You can trust me.
SAM: Kelly. Is Suzie there?
SAM: Shit. I was afraid of that. She left this garbled message on my machine. Can you calm her down?
SAM: No! Christ. Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you. You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes.
SAM: Then do it. I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight. We'll figure something out. Okay?
KELLY: Yeah, right. Can you at least talk to her, on the phone?
SAM: Put Kelly on too.
KELLY: I'm here.
SAM: Okay. I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool. All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake. I'm doing what rich guys do. I'm spending my money. It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing. Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
SUZIE: But I..
KELLY: Suzie says nothing. Kelly nudges her.
SUZIE: Yeah, right.
SUZIE: You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
KELLY: Oh, for Christ's sake.
SUZIE: You are.
KELLY: Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the
SUZIE: That's what I am to you, isn't it? Swamp trash. It's what I am to everybody, just like my mom.
ON RAY: focusing the camera. Suzie tries to kick Kelly. Something changes in Kelly, a scary, calm rage.
KELLY: Stupid bitch.
KELLY: Why do you make me hurt you? It's like you want it or something.
ON RAY: still at it with the video, his face impassive, watching. As Kelly pulls Suzie back into the jacuzzi, as the girls' hands slide round the curves of each other's hips, pulling themselves to each other, as the layers of steam rise to envelope them.
VIDEOTAPE: Kelly and Suzie making love in the jacuzzi. PULL BACK to REVEAL
HUNTER: Are you crazy, Ray?
RAY: You heard Kelly say "Sam." That was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the Ray. The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible. What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick.
HUNTER: Ray. The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible. What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick.
RAY: I don't believe I'm hearing this. A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse. They were acting. They were all acting, from the beginning. And we bought it, hook, line and sinker. And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
GLORIA: Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's What? You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter? Cone on. She bought the same story we
RAY: ( turning now on Gloria ) What? You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter? ( beat ) Cone on. She bought the same story we
HUNTER: Listen, both of you. You're not on a case. There is no fucking case. I've had it up to here with Sandra Van Ryan. Ray, you keep mucking around like this and you are going to have her suing us for invasion of privacy. Get out of these people's lives. Am I getting through on this?
HUNTER: Oh, Ray. no.
RAY: You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish? Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath. And those girls are going to wind up dead.
HUNTER: Mr. Lombardo, please. I'm sorry about Give this idiot something to do. Let him look into the Kennedy assassination.
SAM: Give this idiot something to do. Let him look into the Kennedy assassination.
RAY: Guess I kind of lost it there.
GLORIA: You could say that.
RAY: Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
GLORIA: We all have.
RAY: I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened. I did that once. I don't want to do it
SAM: You look pretty.
BARBARA: Sam smiles. She points to the stuff beneath his arm.
SAM: Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right? I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
BARBARA: And where might that be?
SAM: I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
BARBARA: I love Antigua. Maybe I'll come visit you.
SAM: I'd like that.
KELLY: Jesus. What are you drinking?
SUZIE: What brain?
SUZIE: What are you looking at?
KELLY: ( starting the car )
SUZIE: I thought we were goin' to a movie.
KELLY: I think we just need to get wasted.
SUZIE: I wanna live at the beach someday.
KELLY: She stops walking. Suzie takes a few more steps then turns to look at her.
SUZIE: She stands wobbly peers down the beach. A shape EMERGES in the blackness, moving toward her.
SAM: Suzie, it's okay. It's me.
SUZIE: Are you mad at me?
SAM: No, no. Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play. We'll go through it all again tonight.
SAM: I'm sorry, Kelly. I'm sorry it had to happen like this. She was losing it.
KELLY: ( breathless ) There was no way. That cop would've gotten her to tell him. everything. She was weak and dumb.
SUZIE'S FACE: A mask of blood. Kelly turns away in disgust. She goes to the passenger side door, gets in. Sam gets in behind the wheel. For a moment the two of them just sit there, in the darkness, with the SOUND of the SEA, and their own BREATHING. Sam looks at Kelly. She is focused on the dark Atlantic.
SAM: Are you okay?
KELLY: ( a long beat ) My mom would kill me if she knew I took the Rover.
RAY: Been four-wheelin'?
KELLY: Get off my property.
RAY: I'm not on your property!
RAY: You say she didn't come back last night.
RUBY: She's been sayin' she was going to go to L.A. But I don't know. I mean all her clothes are still here. An' she's missin' her graduation. She should graduate. She's a smart
RAY: May have been she just partied too much. But we'll look into it. We find something, you'll be the first to know.
RAY: It's starting, Gloria. This is how it Ray. We don't know anything yet. She could be anywhere.
GLORIA: Ray. We don't know anything yet. She could be anywhere.
RAY: I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
GLORIA: You have someplace to be?
RAY: Just check out the car.
BAXTER: Kelly and Sandra force miserable smiles. CLICK.
KELLY: You didn't have to fly back from wherever, for me.
SANDRA: I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children. I'm leaving again Don't bother. I'm taking a trip.
KELLY: Don't bother. I'm taking a trip.
SANDRA: Where, the mall?
KELLY: A friend of mine bought a boat.
JIMMY: It's those rocks, up there.
RAY: You and Suzie used to come out here Yeah, sometimes. Lots of the kids hang out here. You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
JIMMY: Yeah, sometimes. Lots of the kids hang out here. You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
RAY: ( ignoring the question ) Lombardo ever come out here?
JIMMY: No. But I mean. just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would.
RAY: Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys.
JIMMY: Yeah, but.
RAY: I'm going to be staying here, Jimmy. You can catch a bus up there at the lot,
RAY: People aren't always what they appear to be, kid. Remember it.
RAY: Lonbardo and Kelly killed her here.
GLORIA: Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
RAY: Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
GLORIA: Where's the body?
RAY: The swamp, most likely. Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there. But he's made a mistake.
GLORIA: Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away. And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
RAY: You don't think Sam could've put it Dust it for prints. My guess is, if anybody murdered Suzie it was probably that little sociopath Kelly Van Ryan.
HUNTER: Dust it for prints. My guess is, if anybody murdered Suzie it was probably that little sociopath Kelly Van Ryan.
RAY: How soon can we get something?
DAVE: We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer. You want DNA, that can take weeks.
GLORIA: We don't know that, Ray.
RAY: Kelly's next, Gloria.
HUNTER: ( ice cold ) Get off this Ray, now. ( beat ) If there is any evidence here, it's for ( turning to Dave ) You get an ID, you call me. Will you do me one favor?
RAY: Will you do me one favor?
GLORIA: Ray, you heard him.
RAY: What if I'm right, Gloria? What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong? What do you do if you see a bad thing
GLORIA: And if the teeth aren't Suzie's? You'll give this up?
RAY: If I'm wrong about those teeth it's a
RAY: The teeth doin' any talkin'?
RAY: What about the blood?
RAY: ( cutting him off ) Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
SAM: KELLY ( V.O. )
KELLY: I'm really serious. That cop, he keeps watching me.
SAM: Duquette. Forget him.
KELLY: I can't help it. He gives me the creeps. I mean why was Suzie so scared of him? She's not that way. I think he did something.
SAM: Yeah, he got her busted for I don't know. I think it was something else. Suzie says the bust was And you believe her?
KELLY: I don't know. I think it was something else. Suzie says the bust was And you believe her?
SAM: And you believe her?
KELLY: ( a long beat a sigh ) I don't know. ( beat ) I want to see you.
SAM: Kelly. Relax. Take one of your mom's valium or something. In another week you get on the plane. It's over. We're But what if they find out. God, they'd put you in the gas chamber.
KELLY: But what if they find out. God, they'd put you in the gas chamber.
SAM: So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead. Stay in the guest house. Skip the graduation parties. You'll never see Duquette. Okay? I love you.
KELLY: ( beat ) Okay. I love you too.
SAM: Isn't that against the law, peeking into Suzie Toller is missing.
GLORIA: ( a long beat ) Suzie Toller is missing.
SAM: How long?
GLORIA: She didn't cone home last night. We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
SAM: Maybe she used another name.
GLORIA: Ray thinks she was murdered.
SAM: I don't know what to say.
GLORIA: You could tell me where you were last
SAM: Goddannit. I don't have to.
SAM: Come here. I want you to see something.
GLORIA: Looks like goodbye.
SAM: Kelly's file. Read it. You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
GLORIA: Sam shrugs.
SAM: You're telling me Ray thinks Suzie was killed. I don't have to ask you who he thinks did it, do I? All I'm saying is, read that, you'll have a new perspective on things.
GLORIA: Why didn't you tell us about this before the trial?
SAM: Then I still had ethical standards to protect. They meant a lot to me. Now, I don't care. And no amount of money can buy that back.
RAY: Ray. What's happening?
GLORIA: I'm tired, Ray. I'm going home.
RAY: Where's Lombardo?
GLORIA: He's leaving the country. And I don't give a shit.
RAY: The blood type on the rocks matches It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it. I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray. If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track.
GLORIA: It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it. I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray. If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track.
RAY: ( into intercom ) Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan. Let me in. Now.
RAY: Where is she?
SANDRA: Where she lives. In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
RAY: I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
SANDRA: You can't.
RAY: ( turning, cutting her Suzie Toller is dead. You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
RAY: I fucked up. I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for. God, what did I do?
RAY: I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder. I did her rights.
INTERCUT: EXT. CARIBBEAN BEACH RESORT - LONG SHOT - DAY Perfect crescent of sand. A man in white shorts reclines in a beach chair, beneath a gaily-colored umbrella, sipping a drink.
RAY: Kelly went crazy, started screaming. I grabbed her, put her on the floor.
RAY: Bit, scratched. But I had her pinned. She calmed down. I was going to cuff her. She said she thought she was going to be sick. She asked to use the
RAY: I told her I was coming with her. She nodded, like she understood. We stood up together.
RAY: She looked shaky, but lucid. I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the I think I looked away. A split second. Then, bingo. Just like that. She puts a knee into my groin. There was this coffee table between us and the wall. She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case. Thing had a glass door. I could hear it breaking. I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough. Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun. I yelled at her to put it down. She got off a shot. I took it in the shoulder. I. I had no choice. I returned fire. Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
RAY: I went there to protect her.
CHIEF: Detective Duquette; our investigation concludes that this was a good shooting. But that's irrelevant. You were not assigned to this case whatever you imagined this case to be. And now two young women are dead. You are terminated with forfeiture of pension and benefits.
HUNTER: Suzie Toller's teeth and blood were found near the area known as Stoner Rocks. Suzie's blood was found in the Van Ryan Range Rover. This, in conjunction with evidence obtained by Detectives Duquette and Perez has led this office to the conclusion that Susan Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.
RAY: Buy you a drink?
SAM: Jesus. I wasn't expecting you 'til
RAY: Nice girlfriend you had there.
SAM: Yeah, well, you fixed that. What the hell happened, anyway?
RAY: The bitch shot me, is what happened.
SAM: Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something? You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
RAY: Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it. We should be celebrating. This thing worked out just like you said, only Kelly was supposed to be framed, not What I'm telling you is, I don't like
SAM: Kelly was supposed to be framed, not What I'm telling you is, I don't like
RAY: Every cloud has a silver lining, partner. Here's to no loose ends. Here's to no more surprises.
SAM: Here's to no more surprises.
RUBY: Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit. They see out the sides. That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
GLORIA: What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
RUBY: Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye. He don't use it for no good deeds
GLORIA: I was wondering if I could ask you a few About Suzie?
RUBY: About Suzie?
GLORIA: Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
RUBY: ( a long beat ) He used to come around here. He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
GLORIA: She still work there?
RUBY: No. Not after that night. I don't know what happened. Maybe he caught her with some john. All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy. Indian kid named Davy. Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away. That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
GLORIA: Was there ever any kind of
RUBY: Duquette always claimed the kid was dusted, came after him with a knife. But it was Jack's Fish Camp. This could be the moon for all most people Wasn't supposed to be like that though. This place was supposed to be something once. There were going to be roads and houses. There was going to be a town. They were going to call it Salt Creek.
SAM: Ray. you see that winch by your head? Take a couple of turns on it for me, she's luffing.
RAY: You mean this thing?
SAM: Yes, we call it a winch. And these are shrouds, and these are I thought this was supposed to be a vacation. Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
RAY: I thought this was supposed to be a vacation. Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
SAM: Come on, man. I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
RAY: Yeah, or get me drowned.
SAM: Jesus, man. You okay?
RAY: That how you planned it? You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean.
SAM: Come off it, man. It was an accident.
RAY: You. You're.
SUZIE: Rumors of my demise have been greatly Nice move. Good thing I was here to save your incompetent ass.
RAY: You. I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him.
SUZIE: Shoulda, coulda, woulda. Get him in the water.
RAY: Sam, for Christ's sake.
SAM: I can't.
RAY: Sam, for godsake.
SUZIE: Hey, Ray. Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and
SUZIE: Feeling better?
SAM: That was about as grim as it gets.
SUZIE: The guy was history when he killed Kelly. You knew that.
SAM: But then you knew what he was like all along. Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on.
SUZIE: But then it is better this way, don't you think? No loose ends.
SAM: That was the same thing Ray said.
SUZIE: Poor Ray. Come on Sam, we did it. We put the screws to the Van Ryans. We won.
SAM: Okay. Grab that winch there.
SUZIE: Fuck the winch. I wanna drive.
SAM: Okay. Come here and take the helm. I'll get the winch.
RUBY: You asked if Suzie knew about the Salt Creek land deal? Girl read every book she could find on it, the Van Ryans too.
RUBY: Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here. He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes. One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp. That came with her.
GLORIA: And the child.
RUBY: She had it, before she drank herself to death. Wasn't exactly a love child.
GLORIA: ( beat ) Then you're not her grandmother.
RUBY: Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child. He was a good boy, till the army took
GLORIA: So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- And the other girl, Kelly. Suzie's
RUBY: And the other girl, Kelly. Suzie's
GLORIA: Thank you for talking to me, Ruby. I am sorry about Suzie, she.
RUBY: You okay?
GLORIA: I'm fine. Nice TV.
RUBY: There's an old saying from the Everglades virtue may be missed but sin can't hide. Folks pay in the end.
SAM: You know the place I'm talking about the big rocks?
SUZIE: You've got the pressure too tight. You'll crush the fucking evidence.
SAM: We gotta stop. I'm gonna come.
KELLY: That never seemed to worry you at the That's not your line.
SAM: That's not your line.
KELLY: Say you love me.
SAM: ( a beat ) I love you. Now give me the line.
KELLY: ( a whiny voice ) No little girl can ever make me come.
SUZIE: Seems to like some of the same places you do. Funny you never met.
SAM: Yeah, real funny. You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
SUZIE: Trust me, the guy's dirty. He'll like it. Especially the part about offing Now get out of here. Go make yourself a new friend.
SAM: Buy you a drink?
SUZIE: You like bein' a caddy for rich kids'
SAM: Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
SUZIE: Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
SAM: ( white-faced ) Walter. He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years. I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold. ( beat ) I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass. What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
SUZIE: Walter. He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years. I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold. I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass. What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
SAM: ( a long beat ) I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
KELLY: I'm running away.
SAM: ( a beat ) You think that's wise?
KELLY: ( sitting next to him ) Um-huh. And guess what else? ( reaching into her bag ) I have toys.
SAM: ( a long beat ) Well, Z guess one taste wouldn't hurt.
GLORIA: Selling your boat?
WALTER: This was Suzie's boat. Guess she won't be needin' it.
GLORIA: I wouldn't have guessed Suzie was a
WALTER: Old lady had her tested once. They said her IQ was way up there, round two hundred or some such shit. That girl could do just about anything, she put her mind to it.
