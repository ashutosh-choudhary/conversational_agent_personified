ROBBIE: Come on. ( tugs at his shirt sleeve which Ray has a hold of ) I gotta go!
RAY: Not so fast, not so fast, all right? Now, there are two things we have to watch out for, and the second is people who might want our car.

RACHEL: ROBBIE!!! WHERE ARE YOU TRYING TO GO?!?! WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?!?!
RACHEL: WHOE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME IF YOU
GO!!!: Rachel's last line almost brings Robbie to tears as he picks her up and starts walking over to the van. Ray stands next to the still rolling army vehicles and begins to realize how this brother and sister have come to rely on each other during the divorce of their parents.
RAY: If I close my eyes, why don't you drive for a bit.
ROBBIE: I don't have a license.

The man backs up the car just as the camera pans down to see a man who sees the gun on the street. The man picks up Ray's gun and looks at the man in the van.
RACHEL: Looks like the power's still on here.
RAY: Yeah, power's still on because nothing bad has come up from under the ground.

RAY: Two more trucks come over the hill ablaze. Suddenly. BOOM!!! A ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill. The explosion blast is almost big enough to knock Ray off of his feet.
RAY: By now, Robbie has run over the hill and is long out of site. A robot that appears to be on fire comes slowly rising over the hill. Ray makes a run for it down the hill. We can see three robots now rising over the hill. Missiles and bullets are being fired at them as their shields block all the fired artillery.

HARLAND: Over here! OVER HERE!!!
HARLAND: The three of them scurry into the basement. Ray and Rachel run into the main room while Harland proceeds to close the cellar doors. Gunfire can be heard alongside the screams from people. Lights flash through the cracks in the walls and door.
HARLAND: ( to Rachel ) You all right?
HARLAND: ( to Ray ) And what about you?
RAY: ( while Harland moves the wheel barrel ) ( to Rachel ) There you go. Is that comfortable? I need you to close your eyes now, okay? You need some sleep.
RACHEL: Ray already knows what she is going to ask.
RAY: He's gonna meet us. Hey, Robbie's gonna meet us, Rach, In Boston, at your grandma's.
RACHEL: ( about ready to cry ) What do you think mom's doing right this minute?
RAY: Mom? She's in Boston. Waiting. And I know she's not sleeping 'cause she is so worried about you. ( trying to comfort her ) . And she's in grandma's kitchen, and she's making that awful tea that she makes. And they're all just. . .there all just counting the minutes until they see you again.

HARLAND: I got water. Food.. Enough for weeks. You're welcome to stay, both of yous.

HARLAND: ( speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause ) Those machines, those tripods they got. They buried them. right under our feet. Since before there were even people here. They've been planning this for a million years. We're beat to shit.
RAY: Please, my daughter.
HARLAND: Think about it. . They defeated the greatest power in the world in a couple days. Walked right over us. they'll keep coming. This is not a war any more than there's a war between men and maggots. This is an extermination.
HARLAND: ( feeling he's not grasping the reality ) Are you afraid?
RAY: Of course I am.
HARLAND: ( going on ) I been around death plenty. Drive an ambulance in the city. Well, drove and ambulance in the city. That's all over now, huh? .. You know the people who make it Ray? The ones that don't flatline before the hospital? It's the ones who keep their eyes open, keep looking at you, keep thinking. Ray. .. Running, that's what'll kill you. .. I'm dead set on livin'.
HARLAND: Hah. Dead set on Living. Thank you for taking us in.
RAY: Thank you for taking us in.
HARLAND: We're not going to be exterminated.
HARLAND: ( with shotgun at side ) It's okay! Come on, I wanna show you something!
HARLAND: We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta have a weakness. Come on, take a look.
HARLAND: Somehow they killed a few of these things in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling me the Japanese can figure it out but we can't?
HARLAND: We can do it. We can get 'em. We can figure it out.
RAY: Stay right there!
RAY: I have a daughter! Why did you bring us here?
HARLAND: To fight 'em together, Ray. .. underground. When the time is right, we'll take 'em by supries, the way they took us. We'll take 'em by surprise.
HARLAND: We're right under their feet, Ray. Right here, under their feet.
HARLAND: You miss your mommy? I had a little girl nearly your age. You know, if anything happens to your daddy, I'll take care of you.
RAY: Rachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside him. They both stare at Harland, on the stairs, in dismay.
RAY: ( distinctly angry, but not yelling ) You don't have anything to say to her, do you understand? If you want to talk to somebody, or ask somebody a question, you ask me!
HARLAND: ( also angry at Ray ) What exactly is your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna do. How about you? You gonna sit here, wait for them to come get you? Is that your plan?
HARLAND: Maybe you want to get caught. Couple of days hiding in a basement too much for you, I bet. You'll probably turn yourself right in!
RAY: Listen. It stopped.
HARLAND: ( paying no attention ) Maybe you'll be okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll train you as their pet. You know, train you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks.
RAY: ( yells ) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!
RAY: ( dead silent ) Give me that!

HARLAND: Then they spray us, like a fertilizer!
RAY: You gotta be quiet!
HARLAND: Drink US and..
RAY: They're gonna come back down here!
HARLAND: Then they spit us out all over their goddamn red weeds!
RAY: ( no longer whispering ) Do you understand what I'm gonna have to do? I can't let my daughter die because of you.
HARLAND: This tunnel will get us to the city. We'll have our own tunnels there. Ready Made! Subway, see what I'm saying!
RAY: Stop it!
HARLAND: You can hide a whole army down there!
RAY: Stop it!!
HARLAND: . We'll go underground!
RAY: STOP IT!!! Sneak attacks at night!

HARLAND: We're the resistance Ray! They can't occupy this country! Occupations always fail! History's taught us that a thousand times. This is our land.
HARLAND: ( continues ) . We eat it, we breathe it, only we can live on it! They can't survive here Ray. They weren't built for it.

RACHEL!!!! RACHEL!!!: A robot's lights turn on to him as a food lands close enough to him to blow him back. One of the robot's grabbing claws comes after Ray. He hides in a truck. The claw breaks through the glass, grabs the car, and flips it, causing it to roll about 3 times.
RAY: ( screams ) AHH!
RACHEL: ( screams ) AHHHHH!!!!
RAY: NO NO NO!!!
RAY: It hit's the robot's shields and the robot turns right around. It eyeballs Ray for a moment and picks him up by a grabbing claw.

RAY: ( reaching Rachel ) Rachel. ( no response )
RAY: Ray goes to speak just as BOOM! The grate shifts, tossing all the people around and the door opens to take another person up. Ray ducks down with Rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing claw. He is swept up by it. Rachel holds on to his neck to go with him. But then, Ray sees his belt of grenades. He prigs Rachel's hands off of him and grabs the grenades. A soldier sees this and latches onto Ray's arm.

The robot releases it's cages and they fall into a tree. Splitting open. People promptly climb Once the robot falls to the ground, Rachel looks at Ray in a way that meant how did you do that.

Boston - Walking Down Street near Mary Ann's Mother's house - Mary Ann walks up to the front door and sees Ray walking down the street with Rachel in his arms. She flutters open the doors and she and Rachel run towards each other on the street. Mary Ann begins crying.

NARRATOR: From the moment the invaders arrived, breathed our air, ate and drank, they were doomed.
