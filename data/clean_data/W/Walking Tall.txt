JIMMY: His parents hadn't left him the mill more than 2 minutes before he shut it
CHRIS: a voice shouts 'HEADS UP' Chris catches a fast ball thrown from behind. Jay steps out of his vehicle.
JAY: Cause I opened my Casino.
CHRIS: Still got a gut huh Jay?
JAY: Still got your reflexes. What, you get tired of being all that you can be?

RAY: It's the subtle attention to aesthetics that I find most impressive, blends in with the mountains SO nicely.
FRIEND: Not bad huh?
CHRIS: Not bad.
RAY: Isn't it wonderful? All your gambling needs under one great big roof. You got your ATM machine, tellers to cash your paycheck, and when you're here you don't gotta worry about those lil things like child support, rent, the laws of mathematical probability.
WORKER: Gentlemen, Mr Hamilton would like to invite you to the VIP lounge.
RAY: Oh, 'Mister' Hamilton.

CROUPIER: It's not your roll sir.
COMMISSIONER: No folks, no payout.
CHRIS: ( To croupier ) Why don't you just take care of that bet and we're even.
CROUPIER: Well I would but it wasn't a legitimate bet, you're not the shooter. It's not your ( Chris shoves him ) ROLL sir.
SECURITY GUY: Is there a problem?
CHRIS: Yea, the problem is your dice are loaded. Does your boss know about this? Just gimme my money.
JIMMY: Come on, let's go! let's go!
DOCHRIS: ( To Chris' family ) Folks, he's pretty banged up, inside and out. Whoever did this left him for dead. A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
SHERIFF WATKINS: I'm gonna need a statement from him He's in no condition to give you one.
DOCHRIS: He's in no condition to give you one.
SHERIFF WATKINS: I'll also need a copy of your write-up along with toxicoloy, blood alcohol level and so on.
MICHELLE: What are you talkin about Stan?
SHERIFF WATKINS: I'm just tryin to get some facts here.
MICHELLE: Oh come on you need to be out arresting whoever tried to kill my brother not testing his BLOOD.
SHERIFF WATKINS: I'm just doing my job Michelle. Ok? I understand how you feel. But we still don't know yet who started all of this.
CONNIE: Well it wasn't Chris.
DAD: Just find out who did this to him Stan.
SHERIFF WATKINS: I'll do my best Mr Vaughn. I really will. In the meantime I have to file a full report. You lemme know when I can talk to him.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Thank you.
DOCHRIS: He's gonna be fine Michelle.
MICHELLE: INT. HOSPITAL WARD Ray goes into a room and takes a big bunch of flowers from there.
NURSE: BEAUTIFUL flowers!
RAY: Thank you, they're for my best friend.
RAY: Hey sarge, so much for our VIP. status. Don't they teach you any fighting skills in the army.
CHRIS: How did you do?
RAY: Not good. But I tell you, that guy was feelin me this morning.
RAY: You okay?
CHRIS: Some homecoming hey.
RAY: I don't know if you've noticed but this aint exactly home any more.
PETE: There's some old crutches in the garage.
DAD: Changed the plugs a while back.
CHRIS: Appreciate that Dad.
DAD: I might've had serious issues with your career choice but just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck. Where you headin?
CHRIS: I was goin into town to get some supplies. Wanna come?
DAD: Let's go.
DAD: Ya whole life, all you wanted to do was get outta here. What made you come You gonna think I'm crazy. I been thinking about the mill. When I was a kid goin to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar. You remember that smell.
CHRIS: You gonna think I'm crazy. I been thinking about the mill. When I was a kid goin to visit you at work, the smell of that fresh-cut cedar. You remember that smell.
DAD: Mmm I remember a lotta nice things before the mill closed.
CHRIS: When did they go outta business? ( Nods to a closed supply store ).
DAD: Closed about six months ago. There's a home depot about fifteen minutes up the road.
CHRIS: And that? ( Nods to an adult XXX shop )
DAD: Don't ask.
JAY: Hey. First of all I wanna say thanks.
CHRIS: For what?
JAY: He's been fired, and his gaming permit's been pulled. I don't know how my security cameras didn't catch that.
CHRIS: They miss a lot at your place don't they Jay.
JAY: Look Chris I hate seein ya like this.
CHRIS: Your boys did it.
JAY: Wait wait. so they got a little rough, they were a bit edgy. Understandably. You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis. Look, they've been reprimanded. They say you went nuts man. I'm sorry. I know the proper term vets use is post traumatic stress.
CHRIS: What the fuck are you talking about?
JAY: Whatever it was, you tore my place apart and it wasn't easy for me to get my guys agree not to press charges. Look Chris, if you had a problem. shouldn't you have come to me? Look, I wanna bring you inside. Chris I wanna make you head of security. Whaddya say?
CHRIS: Ah well. I guess you probably need time to think about it. This is for you. It's a little something to help you get. Y'know..
JAY: Ah well. I guess you probably need time to think about it. This is for you. It's a little something to help you get. Y'know..
JAY: Come on man, don't be like that. I came all the way out here to your house just to see you get back on your feet.

CHRIS: Excuse me.
CHRIS: Excuse me.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Well hey Chris. Good to see you up and about, you're lookin spiffy.
CHRIS: I'm here to press charges.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Well this isn't about that incident at the casino a while back is it?
CHRIS: Yea, it is.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Cause that matter's closed.
CHRIS: Did you look into it?
SHERIFF WATKINS: They did an internal investigation. That's good enough for me.
CHRIS: An internal investigation.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Chris, I know you're familiar with the term 'no fly zone'. Hmm? Cause that's what the casino is. Since the mill closed down that casino is the main source of revenue in this town. So, case closed basically. I'll see ya.
CHRIS: I'm not gonna let this stand.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Excuse me? What did you say to me?
CHRIS: I said I'm not gonna let this stand.
SHERIFF WATKINS: You're lucky to be alive right now, that's all you need to be concentrating on. This is my town ok, I'm the sheriff here. I'll tell you what will stand, not the other way around. Now please get out of my building.
DENI: This belongs to you.
CHRIS: This belongs to you.
DENI: This belongs to you.

CHRIS: Can I talk to you outside for a second. Mom I'll be right back.
DENI: How you been?
CHRIS: Been better.
DENI: Talked to the sheriff yet?
CHRIS: Well I went down to the police station and I talked to somebody with a badge. Sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
DENI: He's up for re-election you know. Maybe you could take his job.
CHRIS: Somebody ought to. How about you?
DENI: Sunshine and pine trees. Been readin these books, teach you how to cultivate happiness. Books on the future, go with the flow, that sorta thing.
CHRIS: Is it workin?
DENI: I have my moments.
CHRIS: So the casino huh?
DENI: Yep. Been there almost a year.

DENI: Lot better than it treated you.
CHRIS: I like that. Jay Hamilton's done well for himself hasn't he.
DENI: Yea, he's a real go-getter that one.
CHRIS: Must be. I heard he got you.
DENI: Lasted about 8 minutes, a long long time ago.
CHRIS: You still work for him though.
DENI: Rent's gotta be paid Chris.
CHRIS: Suppose so.
DENI: Hope to see you around.
CHRIS: Do you?
CHRIS: Thanks for the jacket.
CONNIE: And where is he?
MICHELLE: It's ok mom he's stabilised. ( To Chris ) It was close. Crystal Meth.
PETE: I'm sorry. I never did it before.
KID: It's true. We mighta kinda pushed him into it.
CHRIS: Where'd you get the drugs?
KID: I'm not really sure.
CHRIS: Stop. Where?
KID: From the security guys workin at the
CONNIE: Chris, wait. Call the police.
CHRIS: No, that won't do any good.
DAD: Is Pete ok?
CHRIS: He'll be fine.
DAD: What are you doin?
DAD: Aw Chris not like this. Chris listen to me. If you go outta here with that gun, they're gonna.. ne. Chris!
JAY: Guess that changes our relationship a bit huh?
SHERIFF WATKINS: You should NOT have come looking for trouble. Keep your hands up, get out of the vehicle now Chris! NOW!
LAWYER: I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought. If you go to trial you stand to do 18 years. This is a sweet plea, normally they wouldn't even put it on the table but your military record can't be ignored. Three months home arrest, some community service. Pretty generous offer Chris.
CHRIS: But I'd have to plead guilty.
LAWYER: Look at it from the other side. There's over a dozen witnesses, none of em are gonna paint a very flattering picture.
WORKER: He started bustin up the machines.
GIRL: There was a gunshot..
WORKER: Went crazy.
GIRL: Complete psychopath.
CHRIS: They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
LAWYER: Well I still say you should take it.
CHRIS: I wasn't wrong. And I won't say I was.
CASINO GUARD: Our job is to keep order. But there was no chance of that. Me and my men we were just tryin to control him. He was highly trained, violent, very dangerous So dangerous, so violent, so highly trained that he despatched six of the casino staff single handedly. His weapon of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which in his hand became a devastating force with one aim, to hurt people, destroy He went directly for everything. He just came in and took over the place.
PROSECUTOR: So dangerous, so violent, so highly trained that he despatched six of the casino staff single handedly. His weapon of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which in his hand became a devastating force with one aim, to hurt people, destroy He went directly for everything. He just came in and took over the place.
WORKER: He went directly for everything. He just came in and took over the place.
PROSECUTOR: You said he broke your arm.
WORKER: Yea that's correct, my right forearm. Both bones with a single shot. It was You know, toss out a coupla drunks now and then. Guys try to grope the girls, but ah nothing with this sort of violence.
PROSECUTOR: Did he give you any kind of advanced warning? A chance to defend yourself.
PROSECUTOR: So from what you saw, it seemed like he had some kinda purpose?
WORKER: I was emptyin machines when Mr Vaugh came in and started swingin.
GIRL: I was tryin to get outta there.
JUDGE: Mr Crow, you may present your client's ( To his lawyer ) You're fired.
CHRIS: ( To his lawyer ) You're fired.

CHRIS: I don't deny anything that was said here today.
JUDGE: Does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
CHRIS: I'm not guilty of anything. Except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't.
OPPOSITION: Objection. He's trying to introduce prior events your honor.
JUDGE: Sustained. Mr Vaughn stay on point.
CHRIS: I grew up in this town. People used to walk tall in this town, they wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino.
JUDGE: Mr Vaughn we're not here to listen to civic speeches.
CHRIS: And they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were being sold to kids.
OPPOSITION: Sustained. Mr Vaughn you're close to being held in contempt.
JUDGE: Sustained. Mr Vaughn you're close to being held in contempt.
CHRIS: I was justified in what I did, and if you acquit me of these charges I'm gonna run for sheriff. And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.
JUDGE: Order, order. Mr Vaughn you are now charged with contempt.
CHRIS: And I will make sure that THIS ( He opens his shirt revealing huge scarring ) never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it.
JUDGE: I order the jury to ignore what they have just seen. Mr Vaughn take your seat. Order! Order!
JUDGE: Mr Forman, has the jury reached a verdict?
FORMAN: We have your honor.
JUDGE: Will the defendant please rise.

JAY: Oh. Only thing that's going on in my casino right now is reconstruction. You took care of that.
CHRIS: Yea that's right and I plan on taking care of everything else too.
JAY: If you can, try to think this through. A casino is a license to print money. Why would I jeopardise that by selling Cause you owned the town Jay. It's changed Really? See the only thing that I think has changed around here is that every morning you get to wake up and put on that nifty lil badge. But underneath that badge is the same guy that couldn't make it playing college football, apparently couldn't make it in the army and not gonna make it as a cop.
