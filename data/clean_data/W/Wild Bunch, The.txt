NARRATOR: To most of America in 1913, the Age of Innocence had arrived and the stories of the Indian Wars and the Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters had become either barroom ballyhoo or front-porch remiraiscences. .But on both sides of the $io Grande men and 1 80's unchanged. men in a changing land. THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY.. The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain. Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes in himself and those around him. Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero his values are not ours he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man' according to the righteous. To them he is totally bad, and he wouldn't have it any other way. Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant. Dutch is bigâ good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm, but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one. Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH, dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and
