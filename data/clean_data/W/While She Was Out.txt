KENNETH (CONT'D): Damn! DELLA!
DELLA: SHOOT, KENNETH! That's Tammi's favorite doll.
KENNETH: You should just swear properly and get it over with. Do you think the kids don't know what you mean?
KENNETH (CONT'D): Going out again? What is it tonight? Auto Mechanics for Dummies? The bored housewives' reading group?
KENNETH (CONT'D): I got a new one for you.
KENNETH (CONT'D): Group therapy for women who always have the curse. There's a Tuesday night class at the Pleasant Valley Episcopalian.
DELLA: I'm going to the mall for wrapping paper.
KENNETH: What do you do all day, Della honey? Cause it sure isn't keeping house. This place is an eyesore. I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs for this?
KENNETH (CONT'D): I mean it's not like you're at some salon fancying up your hair or nails like the other men's wives.
KENNETH (CONT'D): The last time I saw you wearing something sexy was our engagement party. God, Della, you used to be hot!
DELLA: Put the twins to bed by eight. Give them a chocolate cookie with their milk.
KENNETH: Jesus, Della. Della honey, I'm sorry.
TAMMI: Mommy can I get an American Girl for Christmas?
TERRI: I want a raptor dinosaur, Mommy.
DELLA: You better leave Santa a note. It's only three days until Christmas.
TAMMI: Where are you going, Mommy?
DELLA: The Mall. One chocolate cookie each and then Daddy will read you a bedtime story.
TAMMI: Daddy's stories are lame. I want you to read us a story.
TERRI: Yeah Mommy, the one about the pirates.
TAMMI: No, the cowgirls. Diamond Lil and Slingshot Kitty.
DELLA: Tomorrow night I'll read you the best bedtime story in the whole world. I promise.
DELLA (CONT'D): I'll check in on you both when I get back. (beat) To make sure you're sleeping.
DELLA (CONT'D): Thank you, Tammi, it's wonderful.

MARY (V.O.): Oh Della. Kenneth is always charming. At least to me.
DELLA: Well, with the way you flaunt your double D boob job at the free fun PTA events that's hardly a surprise.
MARY (V.O.): What was that?
DELLA: Oh nothing, Mary.
MARY (V.O.): You got lucky with that one. Patricia Ellis says he's the best looking guy in Pleasant Valley.
DELLA: Well that wouldn't be hard. Mary, do you need something? Cause I gotta go.
MARY (V.O.): Yes, are you going to Tool School tomorrow?
DELLA: TOOL SCHOOL?, Ouch, Mary. Do It Yourself Mechanics is without a doubt the most interesting thing in my life right now. (Smiles) I carry my beloved toolbox in the trunk at all times.
MARY (V.O.): I'm just joking, Della. You know me. I pre-paid ten classes and only made it to two. If you are going I could use a ride. I'd hate to miss another class.
DELLA: Sorry, Mary, I'm skipping this week. Kenneth's parents are coming to stay for Christmas. You know how it is.
MARY (V.O.): Oh that's too bad. Maybe Patricia Ellis will be going.
DELLA: You check with her, Mary.
MARY (V.O.): Merry Christmas. God bless you and your family.

CASSIE (V.O.): Your phone's breaking up Della. I'm not joking when I say it's packed over here.
DELLA: It can't be that bad?
DELLA (CONT'D): Why don't we meet somewhere for a drink?
CASSIE (V.O.): Sure, but a latte's about the best they can do in this mall.
DELLA: A latte's fine. Let's meet at the fountain opposite Victoria's Secret.

LYNN: David and I just bought this divine house in Pleasant Valley. Do you know it? Great for the kids.
LYNN (CONT'D): It's the first time I've left the doors unlocked since I was a child growing up in the Midwest. David's been promoted to VP of United Motors so it's all happening for us. But enough of me. How are you?

CHUCKIE: Soon as we taken care o' Mrs. Podunk you and the Spanish dancer can hit the next mall. But first you fakers best haul this rider out of the filth.
VINH: Stupid ass car got nowhere else to go. There's nothing but trees up ahead.
TOMAS: Screw the car, Chuckie. Case you forgot we got a witness on the loose! I ain't want to end up in the clink as some chimp's prison pillow.
CHUCKIE: Trust me dog, hoe's going down execution style before we see the other side o' them bars.
TOMAS: Yo talk a real mob threat, Chuckie. But what if she gone already?
CHUCKIE: She ain't gone.
CHUCKIE: Won't be long before we find her now. This baby could spot a needle in a haystack!
HUEY: We caught up in this bitch's life like a soap opera. We could just bail, blast out of town like we was never here.
CHUCKIE: This boy loves weed so much he tried to marry Juana.
HUEY: Ain't no one cares about the Rent-a- Pig. He just collateral damage to the peeps at the mall.
CHUCKIE: Listen up skippy: SHE THE ONLY
HUEY: But if we hit the road now we'll be five hundred miles away before they find him....we could be drinking cold beer and swimmin' in the Atlantic....just like you promised.

HUEY: We ain't   gonna make it, are we Chuckie?   I ain't never gonna see it. It's   over for that, isn't it Chuckie?   Just say it.
HUEY (CONT'D): She was just some stupid housewife mouthin' off.
CHUCKIE: GET REAL Huey! And shut the fuck up about the stupid ocean.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): I ever break a promise to you? I ever let you down?
HUEY: No Chuckie, you ain't.
VINH (O.S.): There's her Ford.
VINH (CONT'D): There's broken glass everywhere.
HUEY: Someone call her mama tell her to lay out her black dress.
TOMAS: Is she dead already?
VINH: Musta gone been thrown through the windshield.
CHUCKIE: She ain't dead. Look! Her footprints are all around.
DELLA: (under her breath)
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Della!
TOMAS: Where'd little red riding hood git to?
VINH: She ain't leaving any bread crumbs that's for sure.
HUEY: When a nigga hungry, Imma wolf.

HUEY: Yo left without yo goodbye kiss.

CHUCKIE (CONT'D): So what's in the box?
HUEY: Yo think she carrying the big notes, maybe some ice?
CHUCKIE: Nah, it ain't about to rain diamonds, Huey. But maybe she cashed in her life savings. Planned to take off, start a new life.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): That right Della?
TOMAS: You got enough scratch in there to grease us up with?
CHUCKIE: Open it.
VINH: Open the box else we put you in trauma.

VINH: He loved that track.
CHUCKIE: Get a grip, skippy.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Huey's DEAD. And ain't no requiem gonna resurrect his ass. He down under the ground now with the real men of respect.

CHUCKIE (O.S.): Curb the squealing. You a gangsta or a boy scout?
VINH (O.S.): Tomas's gone, Chuckie. I can feel it.
CHUCKIE: Tomas is one hard son of a bitch. He got her strung up from a tree by now and you know it.
VINH: There's something over here.
VINH (CONT'D): It looks like a body.
CHUCKIE: It's a big old tree trunk, you paranoid gook.
VINH: Tomas.....IYAH!
VINH (CONT'D): She gonna kill you and me next. We're all gonna die here. God knows what other tools she got in that box.
CHUCKIE: It was a stupid ass accident killed Huey. You know that. And Tomas....

DELLA (CONT'D): Where are you, God?
DELLA (CONT'D): Please, I just want to see my babies again.
VINH: Aaaarrhh.
VINH: I don't feel good, Chuckie. You think I got the hypothermia?
CHUCKIE: Nah, yo got the yellow fever.
VINH: I'm telling you, it ain't natural how she gets away every time.
CHUCKIE: She got to be hiding up on the slope? You head up first and I'll follow with the flashlight.
VINH: I ain't going up there without the gun. End of story.
CHUCKIE: Never would've pegged you as a pussy, Vinh. Even when Huey and Tomas called it, I always defended your ass.
VINH: Ain't no one never said I was a pussy.
CHUCKIE: She a skinny ass bitch, too. Can't be weighing in at more than one twenty.
VINH: Tomas an Huey never called me a pussy.
CHUCKIE: I ain't speaking ill o' the dead.
VINH: You already did.
CHUCKIE: Anyways, when you ever shot a gun? Probably miss and shoot yourself in the foot.
CHUCKIE: That's the spirit gangsta. Holler if you see her and I'll shoot.
VINH: Faito!
CHUCKIE (O.S.): Vinh?
CHUCKIE (O.S.) (CONT'D): Della?
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Delllaaa?
CHUCKIE: There's only you and me, now.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): I saw a little trail of your blood back there. You must be hurt.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): I'm hurting too. I think you busted up my collarbone.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): I know you can hear me, Della.
CHUCKIE?: I can smell your blood, your sweat. I know you're close.
CHUCKIE: After what went down tonight, we got a special bond.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): May as well come out now, Della.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): I'll save one for you, for when you decide to come out.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): You're one tough bitch.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): And that's hot, hell yeah.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): And they're really cute.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Twins huh?     Terri and Tammi.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): I bet you could use that cigarette now Della honey? (he chuckles) A woman's purse can tell her whole life story!
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Now I know where they are living, I'm thinking I may stop by after and say hello.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): They wouldn't know a damn thing about what happened to Mommy while she was out, would they, Della?
CHUCKIE: I figured that would help you find your voice!
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Don't worry. I would never touch them. It's wrong to hurt kids! Right, Della?
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): The game's over.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): You won!
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): You took him from me...He was only seventeen years old. And all he ever wanted to do was see the ocean. And he never saw it. No, he never got to go.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): They're all gone now.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): You know the movie "Clockwork Orange"?
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Well, they were my droogies, Della.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Chances are they would of turned on me anyway, just like in the movie.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): None of them was real ass outlaw. No, not in the way you are. You're the real deal, lady.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): I was already thinking about cutting some of em loose, getting a new style posse together.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): How's about it, you and me?
DELLA: Give me a break.
CHUCKIE: Monday night mechanics. Tuesday Pilates. Wednesday Spanish. Thursday, I wish....
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Face it, Della. You ain't no suburban housewife.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): So you bought into the big lie, even tried to live it. Who could blame you? Husband, kids, security, every woman's dream, but not yours, Della. You know there ain't no such thing as security.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): But I'm betting you didn't really know who you were until tonight. I reckon I know what you've been dreaming about though, what you've been aching for, through all these lonely, wasted years. Blasting out of Podunk without never looking back. Feeling the wind in your hair and the dirt of life between your fingers. Doing all the things they told you you ain't supposed to do. Taking what YOU want from life. And wasting anyone who stands in your way. Right, Della?
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Don't say you ain't thought about it. If it's in your blood, it's in your blood for all time.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): You had yourself fooled, Della.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Shit, lady, you took my whole crew out with nothing but a bunch of them tools.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): You can't go back to your old life. No way. It's all over for that. Kaboom.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): Hooking up with me's about the best chance you got.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): I bet you're on the outs with your old man.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): When we pick up your kids, we can waste him if you like.
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): I can do it. Or you can if you're ready.
DELLA: I want...
CHUCKIE: Leave the tools.
DELLA: I already did.
CHUCKIE: Hell of a night, huh?
DELLA: I was only going to the mall for some Christmas wrapping paper.
CHUCKIE: Shit happens.
DELLA: What now?
CHUCKIE: I wanted to look you in the eye before I kill you.
DELLA: That's what I figured.
DELLA (CONT'D): Huey there, going to help?
CHUCKIE: Huey?   Huey's ....
CHUCKIE (CONT'D): You're even better than I thought.
DELLA: Oh my.
KENNETH: Where the hell have you been?
KENNETH (CONT'D): I said....
KENNETH (CONT'D): Della?
KENNETH (CONT'D): Della honey are you all right?
DELLA: Please don't call me that. Don't ever call me that again.
KENNETH: What?
DELLA: I just wanted to get home to my babies.
KENNETH: What happened to you?
KENNETH (CONT'D): Was there an accident?
KENNETH (CONT'D): Are you hurt?
DELLA: Are they okay?
KENNETH: Sound asleep, huh?
KENNETH (CONT'D): So. What'd you bring me from the mall?
DELLA: Nothing.
