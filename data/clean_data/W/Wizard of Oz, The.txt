You're confusing courage with wisdom. Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes. Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city. And they have no more courage than you have. But! They have one thing that you haven't got!

GLINDA: Because she wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it for herself.
TIN MAN: What have you learned, Dorothy?
DOROTHY: Well, I I think that it that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em and it's that if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own backyard. Because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with! Is that right? That's all it is!
