REVISED DRAFT: February 24, 1995
A WINDOWPANE: Assaulted from without by SNOWFLAKES. Wind tossed. INSIDE, a bed, dappled with moon shadow. A LITTLE GIRL, fast asleep. The wind whistles and sighs outside. She DREAMS. Eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath. then suddenly they SNAP open. A stifled cry. She thrashes for her STUFFED BEAR, as a soft voice says:
VOICE: And there's MOM, kneeling beside her. Vague shape in the dimness. The full moon throws light across one sparkling
LITTLE GIRL: Mommy, the men on the mountain.!
MOM: Shhhh. Gone, all gone now. I'm here. Mommy's always here and no one can ever hurt you. Safe now. safe and warm. snug as a bug in a I'll sit with you, think you can Turn on the nightlight. Close your eyes now. I love you.
LITTLE GIRL: Turn on the nightlight. Close your eyes now. I love you.
MOM: Close your eyes now. I love you.
SAMANTHA: How you holdin' up?
EARL: Freezing my nuts off.
SAMANTHA: Put that away.
BURNOUT: Ow! Mrs. Claus is HOT!
SAMANTHA: I can't take it, Earl, this dumb costume is giving me a wedgie. Driving me crazy, but there's these kids Right, you don't wanna be rootin'
EARL: Right, you don't wanna be rootin'
SAMANTHA: In front of little Billy, age four, yeah. "Look, Mommy, Mrs. Claus chooses to go butt-mining."
EARL: This is little Billy talking?
SAMANTHA: Age four, kid's unbelievable. I'm too old for this, Earl.
EARL: Yeah, yeah. Spare me, I got a prostate the size of a melon.
EARL: Seriously, half my life's a doctor's hand up my ass, I should marry the Say that a little louder, there's a kid in back didn't catch it.
SAMANTHA: Say that a little louder, there's a kid in back didn't catch it.
EARL: It's not that fucking little Billy again, is it?
SAMANTHA: Hal, I gotta tell you, of all the Christmas pageants I've seen, this was by far the most recent.
HAL: Aw, honey, I had teenage girls playing the wise men, what'd you expect?
SAMANTHA: Teenage boys?
HAL: Well, I thought they did fine.
SAMANTHA: Just fine? Come on, it was ground breaking stuff. The first Nativity where Joseph stares at the wise men's tits all night.
SAMANTHA: Hey, you!
CAITLIN: His name is Mr. Perkins, my Mom named him for me.
GIRL #1: That's her?
GIRL #2: That's who?
GIRL #1: ( excitedly ) Her Mom, she's got amnesia.
GIRL #2: GIRL #2
CAITLIN: GIRL #2
GIRL #2: Too weird.
SAMANTHA: Excuse me.
SAMANTHA: Hello, girls. Caitlin, I'm going to help Dad with the refreshments. Which one's Dad? I forget.
SAMANTHA: CUT TO:
YOUNG MAN: POLICE. DON'T MOVE. What the hell is this.?!!
YOUNG MAN: Don't give me an attitude, sir. You're assuming I won't shoot your sorry ass, and everyone knows when you make an assumption, you make an ass out of u and mption. I'm Sergeant Madigan, Vice, and if you cop a 'tude, jerkoff, I will see to it you spend the next ten years in prison getting ass-fucked, and if the case is thrown out because my arrest is too violent, then I will personally HIRE men to ass-fuck you for ten years. So if you're an ass-fucking fan, go ahead and mouth off, but meanwhile you're under arrest for the crime of prostitution, now shut the fuck up before I cut out your kneecaps and use 'em as ashtrays. Officer Donleavy, read him his rights.
YOUNG MAN: Sir, listen to me. I understand you're not a wealthy man, but in light of the damage this arrest will cause you, we might be able to make an
GIRL: We gotta stop using bums.
MITCH: ( lights a smoke ) Forget it. They looked like cops. We pulled it off, didn't we?
GIRL: It was embarrassing.
MITCH: You want I should hire actors, for Chrissake? These guys are cheap, they work for food.
GIRL: Uh-huh. So, when they puke all over you is that, like, a refund?
MITCH: Trin, I'm pissin' myself over here, you're so funny. What's this?
TRIN: New case, honest to God chick with amnesia. You want the job?
HENESSEY: Yep. Yep, yep, yep.
TRIN: Wasn't there a lady on TV named Samantha? Had a magic nose or 'Bewitched', yeah. Good show. Chick lived with a faggy guy, then in the last season it was a different faggy guy. Okay. Here's what we do; get on the horn to amnesia chick, tell her yes. Then tell her in 1967 she promised to give me a blow job. Worth a try, right?
HENESSEY: 'Bewitched', yeah. Good show. Chick lived with a faggy guy, then in the last season it was a different faggy guy. Okay. Here's what we do; get on the horn to amnesia chick, tell her yes. Then tell her in 1967 she promised to give me a blow job. Worth a try, right?
HAL: Christ, guy's all over you like a cheap suit.
SAMANTHA: That's funny, there's a cheap suit all over him like a cheap suit.
HAL: Oh, boy. Someone's gotta take my father home. I'm plowed.
SAMANTHA: This is all I ever wanted.
CAITLIN: How would you know?
EARL: You're married what now, five
EARL: You and Hal, how often you two.?
SAMANTHA: Stick our fingers in out hands and pull them out again? Every chance we get. Shut your piehole.
EARL: Don't get all snippy.
SAMANTHA: Earl, do me a favor. Every few words say "hic" and have bubbles come out your mouth, okay?
EARL: Goddamnit, I'm not drunk. Would a drunk man have this much raw talent?
ANOTHER ANGLE: Sam goes airborne. Explodes through the windshield, outward bound. Shower of glass, spritz of blood. And then she's flying. Slow motion, end over end. We lose all SOUND. Silence as she tumbles. Below and behind her, the Sunbird noiselessly ERUPTS. Fireball, sky high Sam floating. Describes a lazy arc in mid-air. Whoomph-! Disappears into the snow. Swallows her, leaves a silhouette. Around her, trees catch fire. Burn. She lies in her impromptu sarcophagus. Out of sight. THE FLAMING DEER totters from the wreck, thrashing. Scene from a nightmare. Nightmare part two: from the snow, from the human-shaped divot arises a woman of blood. She stumbles from the drift. Toward the wreck. And though it's clearly Sam Caine under all that crimson, there's something wrong about her eyes. En route to the car, she kneels beside the suffering deer, its flesh scorched and torn and KILLS it. Puts it away with a sharp CRACK-!ing blow to the head. Stands, eyes squirming with madness. The car's an inferno. Earl is dead. She turns away, wiping blood from her eyes Comes face to face with a SNOWMAN. A jolly white fellow. Charcoal briquettes for eyes. She watches, fascinated, as he MELTS in the blast furnace heat With warning, she screams. Crumples to the ground. The snowman's eyes fall out. He melts away and away.
HENESSEY: .and here's the jail here, see.? Escape chute for the Borian, he's a dinosaur guy, Moves quick, don't take no shit neither. See, you can make him shoot the guard ah, hell, look, I played with it a little myself, I'm sorry.
HENESSEY: Hey, you go ahead, um. hope you like the present.
TODD: It's awesome, Dad. Mom, though, she. She gets weird. On my birthday, when you gave me the Schwinn. she called bicycle stores to see if there'd been any robberies.
HENESSEY: Tell her I don't steal them locally.
HENESSEY: Me. What's up?
HENESSEY: Hell, no! Use your head, girl. Let the fucker squeeze the Charmin.
TRIN: You kidding? Guy's hideous. I'll do it, but we're talking time and a half. Plus a night on the town when I get back, and no cockfights this
SAMANTHA: I want a cigarette, why do I want a
SAMANTHA: What. what do you want.?
REFLECTION: I want a cigarette.
SAMANTHA: I don't smoke.
REFLECTION: ( chuckles ) You used to.
REFLECTION: Relax, you can drop the act. Nice and smooth, take another hit. There you go. See how easy it comes back?
REFLECTION: I'm coming back. You know that, don't you? Name's Charly, by the way. You're gonna love me.
HAL: Honey, you can't cook, I'm not wrong about this.
SAMANTHA: I'm remembering, Hal. Things are coming back. Trust me, I'm a chef, I know it.
CAITLIN: Daddy, make her stop!
SAMANTHA: Hush. Go to the garage and get me something, anything. A veggie, go, man, go! I'm hot to trot.
HAL: Caitlin turns, tosses it to Sam
CAITLIN: Who catches it, plops it on the cutting board and proceeds to DICE it to SIMTHEREENS. Razor-thin slices. Knife a blur. Missing her fingers by millimeters, never faltering, like a mad mumblety-pegger
HAL: Onion, flying in.
SAMANTHA: More. Faster.
CAITLIN: Tomato. Tomato. Tomato.
SAMANTHA: Uh. chefs do that.
MAN: Please, man. I don't know why you gotta kill me. But use the gun, not the knife. Please. As a fucking favor, I'm begging you.
TIMOTHY: It'll be over soon.
MAN: Jesus, man. I. I'm scared of the knife. Shit, I can't handle getting shots at the doctors, man, PLEASE.!
TIMOTHY: Last chance. What do you know about a town called Santa Claus?
MAN: What is this, what the fuck is this?? I'm FBI, for Chrissake, you can't do this to me. I don't know
TIMOTHY: No. You don't. I can always tell, you know. If someone's lying to me. A little skill of mine, something to trot out at
TIMOTHY: VOICE ( O.S. )
TIMOTHY: I'm listening.
TIMOTHY: Nix. I'm just finishing up here. Then I'm going bunjee jumping.
TIMOTHY: All right, what's so fucking Your old colleague, One-Eyed Jack.? Recently escaped from a high-security prison, as you're aware. But listen to this: prior to his escape, seems he saw something on TV that disturbed him. So much he had to be sedated.
TIMOTHY: I saw it, too. It's called "Empty Nest." How the fuck is it my business?
SUIT: I know it's incredible, sir, but. if she were alive, I'm thinking she might be in contact with the old man in Pennsylvania. Should I
TIMOTHY: Tap his phone, yes. And tell Daedalus I'm on my way. Timothy out.
SAMANTHA: They were on sale.
CANADIAN #1: Ooh, j'aimerais la baiser. ( Subtitle: I'd like to fuck her. )
CHECKER: Don't you love hearing people speak Oui, j'veux etirer celle-la autour d'une chaise. Comme je le vois, une femme c'est comme Gumby avec des seins. ( Subtitle: I'll stretch her over a chair, women are merely Gumbys with tits. )
CANADIAN #2: Oui, j'veux etirer celle-la autour d'une chaise. Comme je le vois, une femme c'est comme Gumby avec des seins. ( Subtitle: I'll stretch her over a chair, women are merely Gumbys with tits. )
HAL: Beautiful language.
SAMANTHA: Allez, Gumby etiriait le cou, fils de pute.
SAMANTHA: I speak French.
PSYCHIATRIST: You do.
SAMANTHA: You bet your life, fluent French, whatever the fuck that means. Quand j'étais a l'ecole, Jai eu un professeur qui s'est fabriqué du You just said when you were in school, your teacher was made of toothpaste.
PSYCHIATRIST: You just said when you were in school, your teacher was made of toothpaste.
SAMANTHA: Right, he was, you got a problem with that? Pasty Joe, we called him. Look, the accent's perfect, so piss off. I'M A FRENCH CHEF, YA-HOO.
CAITLIN: Put Perkins in the basket. He's luck.
SAMANTHA: Mr. Perkins, going in the basket.
CAITLIN: Are the training wheels off?
SAMANTHA: Just pretend they're still there. Piece of cake. You can do it.
CAITLIN: Wait.! I'm scared.
SAMANTHA: Shhh. Nothing to be scared of. Pretend you're one of the X-men, you're tough. Let's go, now. Three, two, one.
CAITLIN: Mom, I can't do it, swear
CAITLIN: Ouch! I can't do it, it HURTS-!
SAMANTHA: Nonsense. You can do it. You don't want to, but you can.
CAITLIN: My arm hurts, please take me home.!
SAMANTHA: You can go home, Caitlin. You can ride there.
CAITLIN: Mom, no.!
SAMANTHA: Look, I know you're afraid, that's the whole point, can you see that? Now stop being a little baby and get on the damn bike.
SAMANTHA: You gonna be afraid of things all your life? Huh? That what you want?
CAITLIN: My wrist hurts.! Life is pain. Get used to it. See, you will ride this bike home, princess. You will ride it and you will not fall again, is that
SAMANTHA: Life is pain. Get used to it. See, you will ride this bike home, princess. You will ride it and you will not fall again, is that
SAMANTHA: Yes, I'm three blocks past the gas station. Right. Thank you Mr. Henessey, I'll see you shortly.
HAL: She rode all the way home. She didn't fall, not once. She didn't cry. You're good. You should work with kids, you know that?
SAMANTHA: She said her wrist hurt. I didn't know it was broken, God. I can't even remember what I said to her.!
HAL: We can still make six o'clock mass, you coming?
SAMANTHA: A private detective's coming by, he. he's found something. I may have to go away. For a bit. Now please leave me alone.
HAL: Go away. With a detective. Jesus, it's the holidays, Sam
SAMANTHA: Are you deaf? I said leave me alone. Go to church. Drink blood. Drink some for me.
CAITLIN: GET OUUTTTTT!!!!
SAMANTHA: GET OUUTTTTT!!!!
GET OUUTTTTT!!!!: Sam's cry is a veritable shriek. HAL LAUNCHES himself from the kitchen doorway. Pounces on Jack, snarling brave, useless. For his trouble, gets three broken ribs and a trip to the fireplace, airborne. Comes down. Catches fire. ROLLS, over and over on broken ribs JACK kicks Samantha in the gut. She collapses onto the stairs. Splinters the banister. That's when he sees CAITLIN. Top of the stairs, paralyzed.
SAMANTHA: Jack is already moving forward. SPIN-COCKS the shotgun, draws a bead Promptly slips on festive M&M's. Goes down. Gun goes off, WHAM-! A flat concussion. The banister EXPLODES. A storm of wood chips, as SAMANTHA surges up the stairs, toward her daughter JACK. On the ground. Fires, wham! The wall DISAPPEARS three inches from Caitlin's head. Blown to shreds, you can see outdoors. Samantha doesn't miss a beat. Grabs her daughter flings her OUTSIDE. Through the hole in the wall. Takes her by the belt and fucking HURLS her out into space.!
NO!!!!: Jack is already moving forward. SPIN-COCKS the shotgun, draws a bead Promptly slips on festive M&M's. Goes down. Gun goes off, WHAM-! A flat concussion. The banister EXPLODES. A storm of wood chips, as SAMANTHA surges up the stairs, toward her daughter JACK. On the ground. Fires, wham! The wall DISAPPEARS three inches from Caitlin's head.

SAMANTHA: It took me three seconds. That's. that's good, huh.?
SAMANTHA: Caitlin. We gotta find Caitlin.
HENESSEY: Hey! Slow down. The kid's okay, she's in my car, what the hell is going on?
SAMANTHA: That man who tried to hurt us.? If I stay here. other people will come. I have to leave. Just for a little while.
SAMANTHA: I want you to light a candle and keep it in the kitchen window. And never, ever let it go out, because as long as it burns.? It means you're thinking of me. And if I'm alone. if it's dark and I'm lost. It's how I'll find my way home.
SAMANTHA: That's for a portable phone. I keep it with me, you call me anytime, you don't worry about the bill. And last but not least
SAMANTHA: For luck.
HAL: No matter what you find, I'm not scared. Not of you. Not ever.
SAMANTHA: "Movin' in."
HENESSEY: It's not linen. The song's not about Whatever. You cold?
SAMANTHA: It's not linen. The song's not about Whatever. You cold?
HENESSEY: Whatever. You cold?
SAMANTHA: ( shivers ) I'm freezing.
HENESSEY: Turn on the heater. It doesn't work, but it makes a very annoying noise which distracts from the cold.
SAMANTHA: I'll pass. So, you're a former cop. Atlanta, was it.? Stop me if I'm out of line, but I'm curious. How did you. well, succeed? I mean, where six other detectives failed?
HENESSEY: You kidding? Pure luck. Plus my secretary used her feminine wiles. She's got two, one wile per side. Huge. No kidding, you can see 'em coming around a corner, you got time to comb your hair. Nice kid, you'd dig her. Ah. Here we are.
HENESSEY: Putting my glasses in my cooooat."
HENESSEY: I sing what I do so I'll remember it. "Turning off the downstairs liiiight." You know?
WALRUS MAN: The elder Trelawney rented to her in '87, aye. Ne'er could bring himself to dispose of her things. I'faith, she's welcome to whatsoe'er she wishes, for ne'er has trod these walls a lass so easy on the eye, divil take me if I'm lyin'.
HENESSEY: Do me a favor. Say, "Always after me Lucky Charms."
ANGUS: "Always after me Lucky Charms."
HENESSEY: Thanks. Just needed to hear that.
HENESSEY: See anything you recognize?
SAMANTHA: Yeah, this dirt used to be outside my window, shut up and let me look. I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little on edge.
SAMANTHA: I can feel her. Like a ghost. We could walk away, you know. There's still time, we could just. leave her dead.
SAMANTHA: Clothes to kill for. Smooth velvet. Creamy silk. The finest, the best. The sexiest. Sam peeks at the tags:

HENESSEY: Yeah, well take a look at this.
NATHAN: Alice, please.?
NATHAN: Your dog, Alice. It and my appetite are mutually exclusive.
ALICE: What's wrong with the dog?
NATHAN: It's simple. He's been licking his asshole for three straight hours. I submit to you that there's nothing there worth more than an hour's attention, and I should think whatever he's attempting to dislodge is either gone for good or there to stay. Wouldn't you agree?
NATHAN: The voice is soft. Controlled:
NATHAN: Who. who is this?
SAMANTHA: You tell me, Mr. Windeman.

HENESSEY: Ms. Caine, last week at a party I ran into a girl I knew from college and we chatted for a few minutes. And it wasn't til I was driving home on the freeway that I remembered that I'd screwed her in the back of a car once. Everyone forgets.
SAMANTHA: That's it? That's your helpful story? Jesus Christ!
HENESSEY: No, see, all's I'm saying is you're not alone.
SAMANTHA: Oh, shut up.
HENESSEY: Fine. I gotta use the head.

SAMANTHA: So you shot a guy in the head yesterday. We wait outside.
HENESSEY: So you shot a guy in the head yesterday. We wait outside.
SAMANTHA: It's freezing.
HENESSEY: Too bad. People shouldn't shoot other people in the head. Just themselves. During that show with the little girl who's a robot.
SAMANTHA: Bingo. That's an old guy's car.
HENESSEY: How do you know?
SAMANTHA: Because there's an old guy in it. Come on.
SAMANTHA: Gun bulge.
HENESSEY: You think I'm gonna shove it down my pants? Shoot my damn dick off.
SAMANTHA: So now you're a sharpshooter?
HENESSEY: Ho, ho.
SAMANTHA: Mr. Windeman.?
SAMANTHA: Oh, SHIT!
HENESSEY: Jesus wept.!
NATHAN: Get in! Both of you, NOW!
TIMOTHY: East, they're going east. Head them
NATHAN: Charly. Jesus Christ, I don't believe what I'm seeing, you're so fat.
SAMANTHA: I'm. um, I mean. what?
NATHAN: What in God's hell have you been eating, you look positively bovine! Hang on.
SAMANTHA: Oh, God, no more!
NATHAN: Bulletproof. Put it in myself.
NATHAN: Charlene, darling
SAMANTHA: My name is Caine. Samantha Caine.
NATHAN: ( exasperated ) Yes, yes, you said that on the phone. Must I point out to you that the letters in the name SAM CAINE, when rearranged, spell out AMNESIAC? Your mind was missing a name, so it simple invented one that was an anagram of your current condition.
NATHAN: Dammit, Charly. The schoolteacher, that was your cover! Your memory was gone, you got confused and you BOUGHT YOUR OWN COVER. This ridiculous Ohio housewife business, it's a fantasy, you wrote the bloody thing!
SAMANTHA: It's not a fantasy, I'm in the fucking PTA.
NATHAN: Then quit. You're an assassin for the United States government. I ought to know, I trained you.
HENESSEY: Beautiful. Fuckin' beautiful.
HENESSEY: What happened to bulletproof?
NATHAN: The side windows were next, I swear.
NATHAN: Here, you might as well have one My God. How many do you carry?
SAMANTHA: My God. How many do you carry?
NATHAN: Three. One shoulder, one hip, and one right next to Mr. Wally Where most patdowns never reveal it, as an agent is often reluctant to feel up another man's groin.
HENESSEY: Got a tail.
NATHAN: Lucky bastard found the only cool car in the fucking midwest.
NATHAN: Your father was in the British SIS, assigned to the Irish situation. After he was murdered in 1971, his friend Perkins recruited you for Chapter, a black bag operation working out of the U.S. State Department.
NATHAN: Fall, 1987: Presidential orders come down. You're to flush out a terrorist by the name of Daedalus. You never complete the mission, electing instead to die, of all things, despite clear orders to the contrary. And dead you remain until, without preamble, you re-emerge, eight years later and fifteen pounds heavier.
SAMANTHA: Would you lay off the weight?
NATHAN: I think we can safely assume Daedalus is aware of your resurrection and is attempting to reverse it. Damn, I can't drive around in this thing. Any idea where we can go to stash this car?
SAMANTHA: This address.? I. I recognize it now. I think it belongs to a friend.
NATHAN: Perhaps you'd best drive.
SAMANTHA: Don't be afraid, we don't want to hurt you. I just want to know who you are.
MAN: CHARLY, BABY!!
CHARLY, BABY!!: Picks her up, SPINS HER around, laughing. Henessey and Nathan stare. Befuddled.
LUKE: ( sighs ) Look, is this America's Funniest Practical Videos or something?
NATHAN: Let me do it.
LUKE: I can't believe you don't remember dating me. Charly, please, you pursued me for months.
SAMANTHA: Yeah, well. I caught you and forgot you. Sorry.
LUKE: It's December, you'll remember.
SAMANTHA: ( sotto ) This is ridiculous. What do we do with this guy?
HENESSEY: Don't ask me, I just work here. Did you bump pelvises with him or not?
SAMANTHA: It's possible.
HENESSEY: And you kid, Cathead
SAMANTHA: Yeah, whatever. Um, could he be I don't know. It's coming back, though. All these. little details about him.
HENESSEY: Yeah, whatever. Um, could he be I don't know. It's coming back, though. All these. little details about him.
SAMANTHA: I don't know. It's coming back, though. All these. little details about him.
SAMANTHA: I know he's got a pin in his leg, car accident. I know he cuts his own hair. thinks Rush Limbaugh's an ass. I know he sits down when he pees. I know
HENESSEY: Enough. You're giving me a stiffy.
LUKE: Goddammit, he's dying. Let me call the poor bastard an ambulance!
NATHAN: No ambulance. The car I ordered will be here soon.
SAMANTHA: Mr. Windeman, please let him help you. I know this man, I. I'm pretty sure I slept with him.
NATHAN: I'm about to faint. And if you call an ambulance, I will fucking kill you.
NATHAN: Where's Charly.?
HENESSEY: Relax. She's with Luke. That's his name, Luke.
NATHAN: Goddammit, I told you
HENESSEY: Yeah, yeah, we weren't real big on what you told us. I had him call you an ambulance, so shoot me. Should be here within fifteen minutes.
HENESSEY: The guy's story checks out. Sam knows things about him. Stuff only a lover would know.
NATHAN: Sod that. just watch them.
HENESSEY: Don't worry about it. Chick signs my checks, I'm gonna watch her get aced? Lie back down.
NATHAN: Checks. You're not fooling anyone, dear boy. You'd wash her feet and drink the water. wouldn't you?
HENESSEY: Cut me a break, nimrod. She's married with a kid.
NATHAN: My star pupil. That man in Pennsylvania yesterday. The one at the diner, that was hers, wasn't it.?
HENESSEY: How'd you know?
NATHAN: ( nods ) I saw the news report, they found a shell casing a thousand yards away, helluva shot.
HENESSEY: Tell me about Daedalus, what's his Arms broker, man without a face. Veteran of Baader-Meinhoff and the Red Brigades. He's rumored to be based in the U.S. Doesn't travel much, they say. Too afraid of metal detectors, the poor sod's got a foot- long piece of steel in his leg.

HENESSEY: Come again?
NATHAN: A pin, Mr. Henessey. A surgical pin.
HENESSEY: Where the hell.? I know I just heard that somewhere, something about
HENESSEY: Oh, fuck.
HENESSEY: Nathan, that son of a bitch has one in his leg.
NATHAN: You blithering idiot, the son of a bitch wasn't her lover, he was her target, he's Daedalus!
HENESSEY: Oh, Jesus.! That's how she knew all that shit, not from dating him she studied the fucker to take him
LUKE: Sure don't look like an ambulance, does it?
BRIGADIER: .the bombing has been linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force, which, as you know, is the counterpart of the provisional IRA and the most violent of the Protestant Paramilitary
ANNOUNCER: Despite threats of reprisals, Brigadier Baltimore repeats that he will seek to cut UVF supply lines, especially from Tripoli, Lybia. U.S. President Nixon concurs that.
GREGORY: You've never made it with a boy, There's nothing odd about it. I'm only sixteen.
GIRL: There's nothing odd about it. I'm only sixteen.
GREGORY: You're fourteen and not a day more. Here now, I'm right, you're blushing.
GIRL: You're fourteen and not a day more. Here now, I'm right, you're blushing.
GREGORY: You're fourteen and not a day more. Here now, I'm right, you're blushing.
GIRL: Look, what if I'm ignorant? It's my father, we never stay in one place, I never meet bloody anyone.
GREGORY: Saw him on the telly. Think he'd kill me? I'm a nasty one, I am.
GREGORY: You know what, I'll bet you've never even kissed a boy. now, have you? Aye, but you want to.
GREGORY: Thanks for shutting off the alarm, you bloody Papist bitch.
GREGORY: Tell the press the Ulster Force claims full credit.
GIRL: Propped against the wall. By the bed. He's still alive. Incredibly. The man has DRAGGED himself in here. He refused to die, simply couldn't, you see. Not until he reached his ANGLE ON BED Two pillows, jammed beneath a blanket. The Brigadier just stares at them. His face slack. White and gastly. Shifts his gaze to his daughter. Tears running from his dulled eyes.
DA!: Propped against the wall. By the bed. He's still alive. Incredibly. The man has DRAGGED himself in here. He refused to die, simply couldn't, you see. Not until he reached his ANGLE ON BED Two pillows, jammed beneath a blanket. The Brigadier just stares at them. His face slack. White and gastly. Shifts his gaze to his daughter. Tears running from his dulled eyes.
BRIGADIER: How much.
BRIGADIER: .did they pay you.?
ANOTHER ANGLE: The basement of the old converted mill. A drafty, windswept place full of old, broken timbers. A river runs through it. A stream, at any rate. The waters are still and frozen now. Above the stream A GREAT WOODEN WHEEL. Smaller corollary of the wheel outside. Mounted on the same axis. SAMANTHA is tied to that wheel. Lashed to its SIDE, affixed to it like a goddess to a Greek sailing ship. Now the bad news, the ice has been chopped away so the wheel can TURN. And it will plunge Samantha UNDER THE FREEZING WATER. Beneath the ice. Bound hand and foot. Strapped to the wheel, wearing only a nightgown, she is utterly helpless. THE MAN KNOWN AS DAEDALUS ( AKA Luke ) stands before her, giving instructions to the ubiquitous TIMOTHY. He looks up at Samantha. Seeing her eyelids flutter, he tosses her a cherry wave. Gone is the gee-whiz country boy schtick; in its place, a frightening arrogance. He tosses her his cheeriest wave:
DAEDALUS: Well, good afternoon. If it isn't the forgetful spy. How you feeling?
SAMANTHA: Not-so fresh.
SAMANTHA: You. you're. the man from the Look at her. She's not faking it, she doesn't know me from Adam.
TIMOTHY: Look at her. She's not faking it, she doesn't know me from Adam.
DAEDALUS: It's not that I don't trust my compatriot, Colonel Baltimore. In fact, I had every confidence that your amnesia was genuine until you showed up here. You follow? Meanwhile, I just got around to reading the papers, there's the small matter of an incident upstate. Long range rifle shot, blew a man out of his socks. You can see where I'm coming from. I'm trying to pull of the biggest job of my career. I have to know. How much you really remember. and who you've told.
SAMANTHA: I didn't tell a soul, I swear.
DAEDALUS: We'll soon know.
SAMANTHA: Is. is this a torture thing.?
DAEDALUS: Torture, yes. The torturing of beautiful women, albeit politically incorrect, is an addiction with me. A woman never looks quite so beautiful as when her face is distended in pain. Witness the beauty of Please, I'm getting all misty. Look, untie me, I'll make any face you Let's not, and say we did. Do you Smoke.? Um, no. Not. not really.
SAMANTHA: Please, I'm getting all misty. Look, untie me, I'll make any face you Let's not, and say we did. Do you Smoke.? Um, no. Not. not really.
DAEDALUS: Let's not, and say we did. Do you Smoke.? Um, no. Not. not really.
SAMANTHA: Smoke.? Um, no. Not. not really.
DAEDALUS: Good. You'll last longer. Now hush yourself, and take a deep breath. We're gonna do the torture thing.
TIMOTHY: We're running on schedule, I just secured the tanker. We're borrowing it from Carbide in South Carolina. Cargo listed as fire retardant.
DAEDALUS: ( nods ) Juice up the bird, we head out soon as I'm done here.
DAEDALUS: Take all the air you can, that's right. If you need to vomit, do it
TIMOTHY: You don't remember at all.? The greatest night of your life, shit, drown this ungrateful wench.
DAEDALUS: Talk to me Colonel. Is my identity safe.? The truth, and I'll shoot you in the head. Nice and quick. Otherwise, you're in for a long night. Who did you talk to?
SAMANTHA: .Nobody. fuck you.
DAEDALUS: Hate to see you like this, Charly. I heard you were a helluva spy once.
SAMANTHA: Watch your back. I'm not done yet.
DAEDALUS: That's a very funny joke. You're an entertaining woman. Good night.
TIMOTHY: Okay, I'll signal Daedalus. Your money will be waiting, and Jack.? Do yourself a favor, do her and dump her, I'm serious. Don't get cute, try to play doctor first. I made that mistake.
CHARLY: Daedalus. Make you a deal. Let me go now.? I'll leave you the use of your legs. Bargain, trust me.
DAEDALUS: How did you find me? Who knows about this place, WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?
CHARLY: I let you touch me, cowboy. I think I need a bath.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Daedalus looks up from his prone position. In agony. A vision from Hell approaches: A fiendish blue-skinned woman in a sodden nightgown. Blood leaking from one wrist. She has risen, REBORN, from the icy waters.
DAEDALUS: Samantha. Please.!
CHARLY: Who's Samantha?
CHARLY: You see in the movies, badguy says, "Talk to me and I'll let you live." We're gonna run a variation, it goes like this: Talk to me.? I'll let you die.
CHARLY: Where's Henessey.?
PERKINS: This can't happen, Harry. The President's already up at night, prowling his sock drawer for double agents, and now we've got a fucking rogue on our hands.
HARRY: Sir, there's someone in the conference room to see you.
PERKINS: Oh, for the love of Christ, who can be so fucking important?
TIMOTHY: It's me, your poor black cousin. The one you can't be seen with.
PERKINS: You.! Are you crazy, coming here??
TIMOTHY: ( Lights a cigarette ) My boss is dead.
PERKINS: Your rogue bitch just took him out. Probably went shopping in his weapons storage too.
TIMOTHY: Your rogue bitch just took him out. Probably went shopping in his weapons storage too.
TIMOTHY: We're still on, Perkins. I've got the tanker, the chemist, all ready to go. but you gotta contain her, man. We gotta step on her hard and
SWITCHBOARD: You have a call on line three, sir.
PERKINS: Who is it?
SWITCHBOARD: Charly Baltimore, sir.
PERKINS: INTERCUT - OUR HEROINE AT PAY PHONE We only see her mouth. Set in hard, grim lines. She says:
CHARLY: It's cold, I want to come in.
PERKINS: Charly.? Oh, my God, what the hell are you doing? Listen to me, I'm going to direct you to a safe house, get you on a plane
CHARLY: Can the bullshit, I'm not telling you where I am. I'll come in for a full debriefing, but we do it my Charly, you're being paranoid. It's not like it used to be, you're eight years out of date.
PERKINS: Charly, you're being paranoid. It's not like it used to be, you're eight years out of date.
CHARLY: Do tell.
PERKINS: Congress won't authorize a dime, Charly. Chapter's on the way out, we've been reduced to a records- keeping agency, we don't have enough money to kill you, understand.?
CHARLY: Fuck you, Perkins. If you want me dead, you'll pass a hat in the typing pool to buy bullets. We do things my Your way, I see. And if I say go to From where I stand, it ain't much of a commute. You'll hear from me.
PERKINS: Your way, I see. And if I say go to From where I stand, it ain't much of a commute. You'll hear from me.
CHARLY: From where I stand, it ain't much of a commute. You'll hear from me.
PERKINS: She mustn't threaten our success. Contain her, whatever it takes. But be careful. If it gets out you're working for me. we'll both be grabbing our ankles on the White House lawn.
CHARLY: Hey, Mitch. Glad you're awake. Uh- oh, you're seeping.
CHARLY: Here, look at this.
HENESSEY: Ah, that hurt like shit!!
CHARLY: That's why I distracted you first. Same principle as breaking in virgins.
HENESSEY: Same as virgins, what.?
CHARLY: Saw it in a Harold Robbins book. Guy bites her on the ear as he goes in. Distracts from the pain. You ever try that?
HENESSEY: No, I slug 'em in the jaw and yell "pop goes the weasel," what the fuck are you talking about? Who are you??
CHARLY: Name's Charly. The spy. Nice to meet'cha. Drink?
CHARLY: See? Sit next to the dance floor, every drink's free. People finish dancing, they think the waiter lifted
HENESSEY: I'm confused. Gimme a minute.
CHARLY: Take two, they're small.
HENESSEY: Okay. Let's say I buy it. You're actually a trained killer, Jesus, I can't even say it with a straight So then. Samantha, she.
CHARLY: Never really existed. Like Nathan said, she was a total fabrication, I made her up.
HENESSEY: Fabrication. And now she's just. gone? Forever and ever?
CHARLY: Thank God. Look at my inordinately large ass, look what she did to me.
HENESSEY: Pretty convincing act.
CHARLY: Guess so.
HENESSEY: I mean, her personality, it had to come from somewhere
CHARLY: Change the subject. Better yet, steal me another drink.
HENESSEY: Drink up. What's next?
CHARLY: I called Chapter. I'm trying to bring us in from the field alive.
HENESSEY: Chapter. Can you trust them?
CHARLY: Not sure. Until I know, you might wanna stay away from curbs.
CHARLY: They like to push people in front of
SANTA CLAUS: ( bad Caribbean accent ) Hey, lady, Santa want to dance the lambada wit'choo. Come this way,
CHARLY: If I could come that way I wouldn't need to dance the lambada. Follow me, I need you to do something.
HENESSEY: .The lady's whacked, Trin, she's lost it and I want fucking out, now call the Feds. She's moving us tonight, I'll sneak out to this phone, call you back at midnight with the
HENESSEY: All right, Charly. What did that I'm testing our boy Perkins. I figure he's gotta be tapping your office. Got a light.?
CHARLY: I'm testing our boy Perkins. I figure he's gotta be tapping your office. Got a light.?
HENESSEY: ( pause, then: ) Oh, no. He just traced that call?
CHARLY: Come midnight, you hang by the phone. Nobody shows, we think about trusting him. He tries to kidnap and torture you, well, there it is.
HENESSEY: Whoa, time out.
CHARLY: Oh, don't be such a baby. Ten o'clock, we got two hours to kill. I'm a woman, feed me.
CHARLY: Ugh. God I'm full, I'm gonna have a food baby.
HENESSEY: "Charly." fucking unbelievable. Shame about the fat ass. I bet you were really attractive once.
CHARLY: Oh, I was. Check this out. One time? A guy said he'd fuck me.
HENESSEY: Swear to God.
CHARLY: Swear to God.
HENESSEY: Did he make good?
CHARLY: Absolutely. Oh, and afterwards? Oh my God, afterwards I said the most funny thing, you know what I said.? I said, "Go back to your room. Dad."
CHARLY: It's why he thought I had him killed.
HENESSEY: Your father was murdered.
CHARLY: When Da died, I went to his funeral. 12 years old, today I wouldn't. And I overheard a woman, she was praying. She was thanking God sounded so happy thanking Him it hadn't been her father who was killed. See. she didn't really care that God had let someone die. just so long as it missed her. .and she bought her cross at the same store as mine, see, that's what we do, we all pray to the same cross on a hundred different walls, and sit back and wait to see who gets hit and who gets missed.
CHARLY: Fuck the waiting. Fuck being afraid. I determine who gets hit, and how hard. And I thank no one. It's pathetic to thank someone who spares you when they're just taking someone else. Walk me upstairs?
CHARLY: This is my first date in eight years, Mitch. Is this a fun date.?
HENESSEY: Okay, what's going on?
CHARLY: True love, shut the fuck up.
HENESSEY: You kidding me? I'm an ex-con, lady. I wear a shiny suit, my tie's crooked, and the last time I got blown candy bars cost a nickel. Plus I'm ugly, so what's up?
CHARLY: Chemistry. Be quiet.
HENESSEY: Chemistry my ass. Know what I think? I think this is why you'd fuck me. To kill a schoolteacher. Bury any trace of her.
HENESSEY: Sorry, I liked the schoolteacher. When she comes back, give me a call.
HENESSEY: Oh, and call your fuckin' kid, will ya'? It's two days to Christmas, and she's under the mistaken impression that Mommy gives a shit.
CHARLY: I didn't ask for the kid, Mitch. Samantha had the kid, not me, NOBODY
CHARLY: Easy, baby. She ain't coming back, no way. Bitch is dead.
BEARDED MAN: Good evening.
CHARLY: Fuck off.
BEARDED MAN: I see me a good-looking lady, all upset, I wonder if she doesn't need some male company.
CHARLY: Forget it. I'm saving myself 'til I get raped.
BEARDED MAN: Step into the alley, honey. I ain't asking, I'm telling.
CHARLY: Oh, don't tell me. You're early, Goddammit, you're supposed to be at the pay phone. Go away and come back at midnight. I'm not ready yet. Got a light?
BEARDED MAN: Lady, I have a gun!
CHARLY: What the hell are you doing here?
HENESSEY: Saving your life. Woulda got here sooner but I was thinking up the sandwich line.
CHARLY: You think I couldn't take him? Idiot, you probably scared the other guy away
HENESSEY: What other guy ?
CHARLY: Headhunters, nimrod, they go in pairs, were you always this stupid or did you take lessons?
HENESSEY: I TOOK LESSONS.
BEARDED MAN: Charly snaps her head toward him:
CHARLY: BEARDED MAN
BEARDED MAN: I still got this fucking gun!
CHARLY: No, you don't.
BEARDED MAN: Charly flips the gun into the air. Launches a SPIN KICK. Shatters his jaw. Catapults him backwards. Completes her spin, catlike Catches the .38 on its way down. DOESN'T STOP THERE. Arm out, gun cocked FIRES. Straight at Henessey, what.? He dives aside BEHIND HIM, a second HITMAN. Blown to tatters. The KNIFE meant for Henessey arcs through the air. Imbeds itself in the ground an inch from the prone detective. He stares at it with shocked eyes. The killer hits, dead. Twitches. CHARLY. Lowers her arm slowly. Gun barrel smoking.

CHARLY: Fuck you. Just fuck all of you.
CHARLY: Dammit. I knew I couldn't trust that
CHARLY: Easy, Spike. I got myself out of Beirut once, I think I can get us out of New Jersey.
HENESSEY: Don't be so sure, others have tried. The entire population, in fact. Look, about me.? I mean, what's up, you're this hot survival chick, I'm getting the feeling you don't need me anymore.
CHARLY: Good point.
CHARLY: Get in.
HENESSEY: Found a use for me.
CHARLY: ( beat ) I gotta vanish, Mitch. I need money, a whole bunch.
HENESSEY: Why didn't you say so? Gimme a second while I pull it out of my ass.
CHARLY: The key, Mitch. The one I keep around my neck.
HENESSEY: What about it?
CHARLY: What if I told you it's the key to Box 406 at Pittsburgh International How would you know? Someone filed off the numbers.
HENESSEY: How would you know? Someone filed off the numbers.
CHARLY: Not someone. Me. I filed them off. There's a briefcase in Box 406, Mitch.
HENESSEY: What's in it?
CHARLY: Henessey does a spit-take, sprays whiskey.
CHARLY: Payment for my last assignment. I need you to retrieve it for me.
HENESSEY: Why me?
CHARLY: Don't be stupid, they might have the place covered. I don't want to get shot to pieces.
HENESSEY: Shoulda known. Gimme the key.
CHARLY: I'd love to. I left it with Caitlin back in Ohio.
HENESSEY: Humor me: you're a paid assassin, then you fall off a cliff. Sink under the ocean, and when you come out you're a fucking schoolmarm, wanna tell me what happened?
CHARLY: I fell into a school of fish, they elected me principal. Shut the fuck Mmmm. Personally.? I'm thinking maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act. Maybe you forgot to hate yourself for eight years, ever think of Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Hmmm. Nope, seems clear enough to me. Hate myself, Christ almighty. What are you, my No, just some loser thought he could maybe understand, fuck it. I been there, you know. I'd kill for fucking amnesia.

CHARLY: This is gross, this is gonna be so Goddamn gross.
ANOTHER ANGLE: The incredible part. In slow motion, she does a DOUBLE AXEL PIRHOUETTE. Above the hood. Mid-spin, she blows THREE SHOTS through the windshield. Kills everyone. Keeps going. The car spins twice around. PLOWS to a halt Charly hits a picture perfect landing. On the shore, HENESSEY watches, thunderstruck. Charly skates by the icebound sedan. Flashes a grin at the dying driver:
DRIVER: Shit. it really. is you.
CHARLY: Phil.? Phil Krauss? I don't believe it, they moved you from cyphers. Long time, man, I figured you were dead by now.
CHARLY: So, Mitch. Still think I'm warm and Sure. It's not your fault the gun accidentally went off in mid-air as you tripped and flew over the car.
HENESSEY: Sure. It's not your fault the gun accidentally went off in mid-air as you tripped and flew over the car.
CHARLY: Exactly. What's in the glove box?
HENESSEY: Phone bill, Christmas card. Five buck, swell. You didn't have to kill him, you know.
CHARLY: Back off, man. Do I tell you how to snap photos of extramarital blowjobs?
CHARLY: A voice, then. Clipped tones, TIMOTHY'S voice:

HENESSEY: Which phone? Where?
HENESSEY: Shit. Service centers.! They list 'em on the back of phone bills, right?
CHARLY: Excuse me?
HENESSEY: Shut up and find me a gun. HK, MP-5.
CHARLY: Verify you have her.
CHARLY: You're dead, motherfucker. We don't involve families. It's not the way it's done, we don't take families.
TIMOTHY: I'll be in touch.
CHARLY: Give me an ANI trace. Do it.
TIMOTHY: It's done, she hooked. All I gotta do is set the ransom meet.
PERKINS: She mustn't suspect a trap.
TIMOTHY: No way. She thinks I'm acting alone, remember? Say the word, I'll hand her to you on a plate.
PERKINS: God. We're monsters, aren't we.? Forget Charly. Talk to me about The tanker's on its way from Charleston, ETA 1:00 a.m. One terrorist on ice, waiting to play What's in the sack?
TIMOTHY: The tanker's on its way from Charleston, ETA 1:00 a.m. One terrorist on ice, waiting to play What's in the sack?

CHARLY: Fine, you asked. I bumped pelvises with this guy. In Paris, back in
CHARLY: I'd been assigned to kill his boss, remember.? Needed him out of the way. So I let him seduce me. Had a steel needle under the pillow, figured to stick him en flagrante, that means while we were screwing. But he was too slick. Bashed me in the head, finished, then threw me in the trunk of a car. Still think I'm a girl scout, Mitch.?
CHARLY: It's almost dark. Let's get it done.
HENESSEY: What's the matter?
CHARLY: They're here.
HENESSEY: Fucking Chapter, that's who. Timothy acting alone, Caitlin had a chance. Now.? She's dead meat.
CHARLY: Fucking Chapter, that's who. Timothy acting alone, Caitlin had a chance. Now.? She's dead meat.
TIMOTHY: ( scowls annoyance ) Fuck the cleaning, just drain it and reload. Chop-chop, I'm going bunjee jumping after this.
HENESSEY: Let me go in.
CHARLY: Negative. You stomp around like a forties drunk and you're a lousy I get by.
HENESSEY: I get by.
CHARLY: You couldn't hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom, now shut the fuck up.
CHARLY: I saw a little girl.
HENESSEY: ( frowns ) Come again?
CHARLY: That's what happened under the water. That night, eight years ago.
CHARLY: At the end. there she was, this pretty little girl at the bottom of the ocean, smiling at me. Three years old, didn't know Daddies hid in closets, not yet. Stared up at me in the strangest way. saying how'd it come to this, we were so pretty and perfect, now look at us, sinking with our head all open. Said when she grew up she was gonna teach school. She couldn't wait.
CHARLY: Guards are on 27-1 megahertz, meet me at 26-9, you need to talk. As soon as you spot me with the kid, start blowing the charges.
CHARLY: They're gonna blow my head off, you This is the last time I'll ever be
CHARLY: Time now. What I do next, they tell me it. looks like a machine or something. You don't like it, don't
CHARLY: Don't say it.
HENESSEY: I was gonna say enjoy life, eat out more often.
CHARLY: Gotta go. If she's alive, she's coming out of there, Mitch. If she's not. they'll know we stopped by.
SENTRY: All clear.
HENESSEY: Christ, lady, what are you doing in there, playing fucking mah-jongg?
TIMOTHY: POP-! go the Kleig lights. BRILLIANCE, blinding CATCHES CHARLY coming out of 17. Pins her dead to rights. Unconscious DAUGHTER cradled in her arms. Tiny DOLL cradled in the kid's. Charly runs, as the ground around her erupts like a
TIMOTHY: Take her alive, Perkins wants her!
TIMOTHY: Good to have you back again, Chuck.
PERKINS: You know, Colonel, you ought really to have stayed dead. You don't know the rules of the game anymore.
CHARLY: No shit. Eight years ago, you send me to kill Daedalus and this clown. Now you're working with him.
PERKINS: Budget cuts, remember? Congress blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central America. Across the board, an intelligence blackout. We had to recruit any eyes and ears we could find, even if it meant going to former
CHARLY: Budget cuts. oh, God. Is that what this is about.? The foot soldiers, the tanker truck. Fuck me, you're running a fundraiser!!
CHARLY: You'll get all the money you want at the next budget hearing, won't you.? All you need is a major terrorist Interesting theory.
PERKINS: Interesting theory.
CHARLY: Theory, my ass. I think some terrorists were planning a strike. Bought supplies from Daedalus, that's how you knew they were coming. No way. Don't tell me you're gonna sit there and let them go through with it, just to get a budget
PERKINS: It's not without precedent. 1993, remember the World Trade Center bombing.? The CIA had advance knowledge, don't think they didn't. Worse, the diplomat who issued the terrorist's visa was CIA, they facilitated the bombing. Purely to justify a budget increase. Of course, they'd no way of knowing the terrorists would botch the job.
CHARLY: That's not gonna happen this time.?
PERKINS: No. This time, the terrorist event will come off precisely as planned. This time the terrorists can't muck it up. because we've killed them and taken over.
POCK: Found these buried around the
TIMOTHY: Make sure you get all of them.
TIMOTHY: Chuck, you give me the fuck of my life then try to stick me, come back from the dead, whack my boss. No sense lyin', I'm miffed.
CHARLY: So what's the plan? What's going out in the tanker?
CHARLY: What's the plan? I'm gonna die, I wanna know.
TIMOTHY: You wanna know the plan?
TIMOTHY: Santa Claus small town U.S.A. personified. We drive the chemical tanker in tonight, park it. Add a catalyst, chain reaction, it goes hot. We evacuate. The mix heats overnight, goes critical at 312 degrees Celsius. 8:00 Christmas morning. Main Street looks like a meteor strike.
HENESSEY: Are you fucking insane? You're talking about 10,000 people!!
CHARLY: Easy, Mitch. How you gonna blame it on terrorists?
TIMOTHY: Those roads are treacherous this time of year. When we dump a car to the bottom of a ravine, with the corpse of Imn Al Rahman in it. get the picture?
CHARLY: Listen to me, Timothy. Please. Let my kid go.
TIMOTHY: Why? For old times' sake.?
CHARLY: Goddamn you, look at her eyes.
TIMOTHY: And why exactly should I do that.?
CHARLY: ( spits blood ) Because they're yours, motherfucker.
CHARLY: That night in Paris, I got pregnant. The little girl's your daughter.
TIMOTHY: Priceless. Can't believe it.
TIMOTHY: Kid's down there. What it is, Charly, they're gonna find you both frozen to death in the woods. Suicide pact.
CHARLY: She's no risk, Timothy, let her The freezer's downstairs, Charly. Let's get it done.
TIMOTHY: The freezer's downstairs, Charly. Let's get it done.
HENESSEY: I'll wait for you to rescue me.
CHARLY: Be just a minute.
TIMOTHY: Shit, this place is loaded with fumes, nobody light a fucking match. You check her for flammables?
GUN GUARD: ( shrugs ) Checked her for colon cancer.
CAITLIN: Charly composes herself.
CHARLY: Shhhhh. Mommy's here, it's okay. Safe and snug. what comes next, huh.? What's the next part?
CAITLIN: .bug in a rug. man with white hair. says the same thing you say.
CHARLY: We're going to take a nap together, Cate. You can have your dolly, and Mommy will be next to you, how's that? It'll be like bears in winter. When they get cold, see, they fall deep, deep asleep.
TIMOTHY: Bears, yeah, yeah. Enough. You're murdering us both, cocksucker, let the kid have her fucking dolly.
CHARLY: You're murdering us both, cocksucker, let the kid have her fucking dolly.
TIMOTHY: Chuck, I'm not a total creep. I'll make you a deal, okay? There's a knife in that box. Now, you and the kid, you're going to freeze, but if you kill the kid by your own hand.? I won't kill your husband. Serious. We're gonna open that door and you'll both be frozen solid, but I wanna know that you've cut your own child's throat.
CHARLY: It ain't over, motherfucker. You're gonna die screaming and I'm gonna watch. Am I telling the truth.?
CAITLIN: Mom, it's cold in here-!
CHARLY: Shhh. Just for a little bit. Polar bear, remember?
TIMOTHY: Tell me where Charly keeps her money. She must have mentioned it.
HENESSEY: Get fucked, you dumb bastard. Charly called Washington, by morning this whole place'll be crawling with Feds.
TIMOTHY: We'll be gone by then, Mitch.
HENESSEY: Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying, there's a couple Feds, they couldn't sleep, said they might come early. Fuck you, someone'll screw up. Just Already did, Mitch, someone already did. Perkins got stuck with a double agent, someone trusted, highly placed.
TIMOTHY: Already did, Mitch, someone already did. Perkins got stuck with a double agent, someone trusted, highly placed.
HENESSEY: ( chuckles ) Chinks are paying me to bring down
TIMOTHY: ( chuckles ) Chinks are paying me to bring down
TIMOTHY: Truck goes, hundreds dead rescue teams within minutes, guess what they find.?
HENESSEY: The patsy.
TIMOTHY: Uh-uh. They find Chapter, caught with their pants down. See, Mitch, I dumped in a much faster chemical The tanker's gonna blow tonight. In the center of town, thirty-five minutes from now.
CHARLY: Reaches in her mouth. Takes out her RETAINER. Must be the temperature. Crosses to the door again. Kneels down. Calmly, with infinite care, takes the retainer. Inverts it, now it's trough-shaped. Holds it flush against the tiny NOTCH she carved. BABY DOLL, now. Holds it directly above the retainer. Depresses the KNOB in its back: It pees gasoline. Gas, trickling down the retainer, through the brick into the other ROOM. Not much. Enough. She stands. DRAWS A TRAIL with the doll. Crosses, dribbling, over to Caitlin. Hands the doll back to her. What next..? She grabs the hunting knife, that's what. RAISES IT HIGH One terrifying moment, is she gonna put it in the kid.? Hardly. Brings it down on the floor. Slams it down.
CHARLY: Gimme a spark. show me, show me.
CHARLY: Come on, come on. do it.!
CHARLY: All this, just one fucking match,
CAITLIN: Charly looks up, face haggard and depleted. Caitlin's eyes, alive again. No longer dulled. Kid reaches inside her CAST and brings out a pack of matches.
CAITLIN: Don't cry. I keep these here. For lighting your candle.
CHARLY: I love you, Caitlin, oh God, do you know how much I love you.?
CAITLIN: Am I gonna die.?
CHARLY: No, baby, you're not gonna die. They

HENESSEY: You foxy bitch.
TIMOTHY: Move it out of here, now!
CHARLY: Run, Catey.
CHARLY: Where'd you go, baby. show Mommy.
WITH CHARLY: She lowers the rifle. Nods grimly:
CHARLY: Smart girl, honey. Stay still. Don't make a sound. Snug as a bug in a
CHARLY: Mitch! I don't believe it. Listen, if you say, "Are we having fun yet" I'll rip your nuts off. Where are Behind the big garage. Is Caitlin with you?
HENESSEY: Behind the big garage. Is Caitlin with you?
CHARLY: No, but she's safe for the moment, she stowed away on the tanker truck.
HENESSEY: Charly, Timothy rigged the tanker to go off early. We got fifteen minutes. No more.
HENESSEY: Hello.! Charly.?
CHARLY: Tires won't pop, Mitch. Bastard just locked her in, she's stuck in there and they're leaving, Goddammit!
HENESSEY: All right, I'll go in and get her, you watch my back.
CHARLY: No chance. I make it twelve, Mitch, automatic weapons.
HENESSEY: So kill 'em for me, bitch, Christ, what are you good for?
HENESSEY: ( to himself ) C'mon, buddy. Do one thing right, just this once. please.
HENESSEY: Piece of cake.
HENESSEY: CHARLY ( V.O. )
CHARLY: The truck. How long til it blows?
TIMOTHY: ( incredulous ) Sweet Loretta, you're another animal entirely. Let's see, 312 degrees. Make it ten minutes, give or take.
CHARLY: Then I better hurry.
TIMOTHY: Oh, spare me. You made a big noise and bought five more minutes on the planet. Give up. Die. I'll spit in what's left of your face.

CHARLY: Cover your ears.
CAITLIN: She springs to her feet. Comes running and flings both arms around her mother. HUGS HER That one puts Charly out for a few seconds. PAIN, excruciating. Comes to her senses, swaying like a clothesline in a high wind.

CAITLIN: It's okay. I'm sorry I left, please wake up, come on please.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Government vehicles, pulling up now. At the edge of the parking lot. 100 yards away, give or take. Numerous SEDANS. The Little Debbie panel truck. AGENTS crouch behind cars. Weapons trained on the wounded behemoth.

CHARLY: He's not in the greatest shape either.
PRESIDENT: I owe you an astounding debt of thanks, Colonel. Would it be impertinent to ask if you'd consider working for State again? The moneys involved would be substantial.
CHARLY: Out of the question. I've got a stack of papers to grade. Listen, before I go, I need a small favor.
HAL: Just talked to Dr. Sullivan, she's gonna need the full braces. Even with your teaching, insurance won't cover it. I don't know what to do.
