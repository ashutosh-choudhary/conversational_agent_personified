GANDALF: You cannot pass!
FRODO: I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor!
GANDALF: I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor!
GANDALF: Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udûn! [Camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Balrog strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming sword. Gandalf parries the blow with Glamdring, shattering the Balrogs sword.]
GANDALF: [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains No! No!
BOROMIR: No! No!
FRODO: Fly, you fools! [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm]
GANDALF: Fly, you fools! [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm]
FRODO: [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm]
FRODO: [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
FRODO: What is it, Mr. Frodo?
SAM: What is it, Mr. Frodo?
FRODO: Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
SAM: Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we dont want to see any closer, and the one place were trying to get to. Its just where we cant get. Lets face it, Mr. Frodo, were lost. I dont think Gandalf meant for us to come this He didnt mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam. but they did.
FRODO: He didnt mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam. but they did.
SAM: Mr. Frodo? Its the Ring, isnt it?
FRODO: Its getting heavier. [Clutches the Ring by his chest and sits down, still panting. He then fumbles for his water bottle and takes a sip.]
FRODO: What food have we got left?
SAM: Well, let me see. [He takes out a package of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, lovely  Lembas bread. And look! [He digs deeper into his pack] More lembas [Sam shows another package. He then breaks off a piece and tosses it to Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]
SAM: I don't usually hold with foreign food, but this Elvish stuff, its not bad.
FRODO: [smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?
SAM: Those rain clouds might. [They continue trekking through difficult terrain, often huddling underneath their [Looks around] This looks strangely [Exasperated] Its because weve been here before! Were going in circles.
SAM: [Looks around] This looks strangely [Exasperated] Its because weve been here before! Were going in circles.
FRODO: [Exasperated] Its because weve been here before! Were going in circles.
SAM: Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?
FRODO: Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] Were not alone.
[NIGHTTIME: Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape appears on top of the cliff. The creature Gollum has appeared and is making his way down to the hobbits.]
GOLLUM: The thieves! The thieves! The filthy little thieves! Where is it? Where isss it? They stole it from us. My preciousss. [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse them! We hates them! Its ours, it is. and we wantssss it!
FRODO: [menacingly] This is Sting. Youve seen it before, havent you. Gollum! Release him or Ill cut your throat!
GOLLUM: It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it. Take it off us!
SAM: Quiet you! [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum cries some more and collapses onto his back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
SAM: Its hopeless! Every Orc in Mordors going to hear this racket! Lets just tie him up and leave him.
GOLLUM: No! That would kill us! Kill us!
SAM: Its no more than you deserve!
FRODO: Maybe he does deserve to die, but now that I see him, I do pity him.
GOLLUM: [Begging] We be nice to them if they be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants. We swears.
FRODO: Theres no promise you can make that I can trust.
GOLLUM: We swears to serve the master of the preciousss. We swears on. on the precious. Gollum. Gollum.
FRODO: The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.
GOLLUM: Yes. on the preciousss. On the preciousss.
SAM: I dont believe you! [Gollum backs away, frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] Get down! I said, down!
FRODO: Hes trying to trick us! We let him go hell throttle us in our sleep!
SAM: Hes trying to trick us! We let him go hell throttle us in our sleep!
FRODO: You know the way to Mordor?
GOLLUM: [nods warily] Yes.
FRODO: Youve been there before?
GOLLUM: [nods again] Yes. [Frodo reaches out and takes the rope noose off Gollums neck. Gollum seems surprised and relieved.]
FRODO: You will lead us to the Black Gate.
PIPPIN: Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.]
UGLÚK: What is it? What do you smell?
PIPPIN: [quietly to himself] Aragorn!
UGLÚK: They've picked up our trail! Let's move!
ARAGORN: Their pace has quickened. [He looks up.] They must have caught our scent. Hurry! [He runs off.]
LEGOLAS: Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimli and then runs after Aragorn]
GIMLI: [pauses in his steps and huffs] Three days and nights pursuit. No food. No rest. And no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell. [Runs after his companions.]
ARAGORN: Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
LEGOLAS: [stops and turns to Aragorn.] They may yet be alive.
ARAGORN: Less than a day ahead of us. Come! [Runs off again]
LEGOLAS: Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!
GIMLI: [Panting] I am wasted on cross-country! We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very dangerous over short distances!
ARAGORN: Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There is something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures, sets its will against us.
ARAGORN: Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?
LEGOLAS: The Uruks turn northeast. Theyre taking the hobbits to Isengard!
ARAGORN: [The tower of Orthanc stands amidst the smoking caverns of Isengard. Saruman stands in his chamber, communicating with the Dark Lord through the Palantír.]
SARUMAN: The horsemen took your land. They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
DUNLAND MAN: Take back the lands they stole from you! Burn every village!
SARUMAN: Take back the lands they stole from you! Burn every village!
CROWD: [Roars with approval] Argh!! [They stomp off to destroy the villages of Rohan as Saruman stands coldly still among the stampede. A Rohan village is in pandemonium as people try to escape the on-coming pillage.]
MORWEN: Éothain! Éothain! You take your sister. Youll go faster with just two.
FREDA: [As Morwen puts her onto the horse in front of her brother] Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf, he is too big for him!
MORWEN: Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm. Do you understand Yes, Ma!
ÉOTHAIN: Yes, Ma!
FREDA: [starts to cry] I dont wanna leave! I don't wanna go, Mama!
MORWEN: Freda, I will find you there. [A woman screams]
MORWEN: [The children ride off.]
MORWEN: [Looks after them] Go child! [Dunlanders and Uruk-hai enter the village, burning everything in sights as the Rohirrim scream and run in all directions. Éothain and Freda weep as they look back from a distance.]
ÉOWYN: [Théodred seems to hear her call but is unable to respond. He has a bloody gash on the side of his head. Éomer nods to Éowyn in the direction of Théodreds torso. Éowyn draws back the covers and upon seeing Théodreds fatal wound, her lips tighten and eyes close. She looks up to catch Éomers eye.]
ÉOWYN: Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
ÉOMER: He was ambushed by Orcs. If we dont defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
GRÍMA: That is a lie! [Appears from the shadows.] Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
THÉODEN: [mumbles feebly] Gríma Gríma [Gríma leans down close to the King.]My son.? Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman. [He drops a helmet onto the ground, which topples over to reveal the white hand of Saruman.]
ÉOMER: Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman. [He drops a helmet onto the ground, which topples over to reveal the white hand of Saruman.]
GRÍMA: Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind. Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent, your war-mongering.
ÉOMER: [Éomer grabs Gríma and pins him against a pillar.]
ÉOMER: How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Gríma? When all the men are dead you will take your share of the treasure?
ÉOMER: Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps.
GRÍMA: You see much Éomer, Son of Éomund. Too much. [The thugs punch Éomer n the stomach] You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!
ÉOMER: [Being dragged away] Argh!! [Uruk-hai and Orcs continue to march across the plains with their hobbit captives, with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli hot on their pursuits.]
GIMLI: Keep breathing! Thats the key! Breathe! Theyve run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
LEGOLAS: Theyve run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
MORDOR ORC: Were not going no further till weve had a breather!
UGLÚK: Get a fire going! [As the Orcs and Uruk-hai take their rest, Pippin crawls over towards Merry.]
PIPPIN: Merry! Merry!
MERRY: [opens his eyes] I think. we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, [A group of Orcs chops down the trees nearby for firewood. Low groans and rumbles start to emerge from the forest.]
PIPPIN: Whats making that noise?
MERRY: [looks towards the forest] Its the Do you remember the Old Forest? On the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall. and come alive.
PIPPIN: Do you remember the Old Forest? On the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall. and come alive.
MERRY: Do you remember the Old Forest? On the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall. and come alive.
PIPPIN: Trees that could whisper. Talk to each other. Even move.
MERRY: Trees that could whisper. Talk to each other. Even move.
MAÚHUR: I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!
SNAGA: Yeah. Why cant we have some meat? [His eyes rest on the hobbits.] What about them? Theyre fresh.
UGLÚK: They are not for eating!
GRISHNÁKH: What about their legs? They don't need those. Ooh They look tasty!
UGLÚK: [Shoves at the Orcs] Get back, scum!
MORDOR ORC: Carve them up!
SNAGA: [Moves towards the hobbits with his blade drawn] Just a mouth full.
UGLÚK: [Pippin and Merry recoil in fright. Uglúk jumps on the Orc and cuts off his head, which bounces off the hobbit's Looks like meats back on the menu, [The Uruk-hai and Orcs cheer and started tearing into the fresh meat, intestines flying, taking their eyes off the hobbits for a while.]
UGLÚK: Looks like meats back on the menu, [The Uruk-hai and Orcs cheer and started tearing into the fresh meat, intestines flying, taking their eyes off the hobbits for a while.]
MERRY: Pippin, lets go. [Their hands still bound, the hobbits try to crawl away. Suddenly a foot comes down on Merry and Pippin is turned onto his back.]
GRISHNÁKH: [Brandishing a blade in front of Pippins face] Go on, call for help. Squeal! No ones gonna save you now!
MERRY: Pippin! [Gestures for them to make their [The hobbits try to escape from the pandemonium to the forest, dodging bodies and stomping feet. Suddenly Pippin turns onto his face and looks up to a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on [The Three Hunters are still chasing after the Uruk-hai. It is dawn.]
PIPPIN: [The Three Hunters are still chasing after the Uruk-hai. It is dawn.]
ARGH!!!: [The Three Hunters are still chasing after the Uruk-hai. It is dawn.]
LEGOLAS: [Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night.
ARAGORN: Riders of Rohan, what news from the [At a signal from Éomer at the lead, the riders make a quick turn and head towards them, surrounding them in ever-tightening circles. As they stop, they point their long spears menacingly at them.]
ÉOMER: What business does an Elf, a man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak Give me your name, Horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
GIMLI: Give me your name, Horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
ÉOMER: I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the [Legolas, in a lightning fast move, points an arrow at Éomer.]
LEGOLAS: You would die before your stroke fell!
ARAGORN: I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Glóin and Legolas of the Woodland realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
ÉOMER: Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even his own kin.
ÉOMER: Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.
ARAGORN: We are not spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. Theyve taken two of our friends captive.
ÉOMER: The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night.
GIMLI: But there were two hobbits. Did you see two hobbits with them?
ARAGORN: They would be small  only children to your eyes.
ÉOMER: We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them. [Points to a smoking pile in the distance.]
GIMLI: [nods] I am sorry. [Legolas puts a hand on Gimlis shoulder in grief. Éomer turns and whistles.]
ÉOMER: [nods] I am sorry. [Legolas puts a hand on Gimlis shoulder in grief. Éomer turns and whistles.]
ÉOMER: Hasufel! Arod! [Two horses move up.] May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters. Farewell.
ÉOMER: Look for your friends. But do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands. [To the riders] We ride north!
GIMLI: Its one of their wee belts.
LEGOLAS: [with his head bowed and eyes closed] Hiro îth ab 'wanath. ( May they find peace in death )
ARAGORN: [Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!! [He falls to his knees.]
GIMLI: We failed them. [Aragorn looks to the side as some tracks catch his attention.]
ARAGORN: A hobbit lay here, and the other. [Flashback: Pippin yells as he looks up at a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.] They crawled.
ARAGORN: Their hands were bound. [Flashback: Merry rubs his bonds furiously against the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds were cut. [Aragorn holds up a broken length of thick rope.]
ARAGORN: They ran over here. They were followed.
[FLASHBACK: Their hands freed, the hobbits run away from the battle scene, dodging under a horse and trying to stay out of harms way. As they flee, Grishnákh grabs Pippin by his belt and clings on.]
MERRY: The belt! [Pippin undoes his belt and Grishnákh is left holding it.]
MERRY: The tracks lead away from the battle. [They break into a run and then stop] into Fangorn Forest.
ARAGORN: The tracks lead away from the battle. [They break into a run and then stop] into Fangorn Forest.
GIMLI: Fangorn. What madness drove them in [Scene moves from the trackers into the nighttime chase of Merry and Pippin. The hobbits run into the Fangorn, seeking to lose the pursuing Orc. They collapse onto the ground, out of breath.]
PIPPIN: Did we lose him? [Looks around] I think we lost him.
GRISHNÁKH: Im gonna rip out your filthy little innards! Come here!
MERRY: Trees! Climb a tree! [Pippin and Merry quickly scramble up a tree each.]
MERRY: [Looks around and then sighs in relief.] He's gone.
PIPPIN: [Pippin looks down in horror but as he turns his head, he spots a pair of gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the tree hes clinging to. The tree starts to move and groan.]
TREEBEARD: [Pippin loses his grip in fright and grabs at the air futilely as he falls. The tree catches him before he hits the ground.]
PIPPIN: [Pippin loses his grip in fright and grabs at the air futilely as he falls. The tree catches him before he hits the ground.]
GRISHNÁKH: Lets put a maggot-hole in your belly. [Suddenly he senses something behind him and as he looks up, the tree stomps and squashes him onto the forest floor.]
PIPPIN: Run, Merry! [Merry tries to run away but is scooped by the tree.]
TREEBEARD: [Looks at the creatures in his hands] Little Orcs! Burárum.
PIPPIN: Its talking, Merry. The tree is talking!
TREEBEARD: Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent. [Stomps slowly through the forest.]
MERRY: A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.
PIPPIN: Dont talk to it, Merry. Dont encourage Treebeard, some call me.
TREEBEARD: Treebeard, some call me.
PIPPIN: And whose side are you on?
TREEBEARD: Side? I am on nobodys side because nobodys on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
MERRY: Were not Orcs. Were Hobbits!
TREEBEARD: Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens his hold on the hobbits and squeezes them. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain] They come with fire, they come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse No, you dont understand. Were Hobbits. Halflings! Shirefolk!
MERRY: No, you dont understand. Were Hobbits. Halflings! Shirefolk!
TREEBEARD: Maybe you are and maybe you arent. The White Wizard will know.
PIPPIN: The White Wizard?
MERRY: [Treebeard drops them on the ground and the hobbits look up at the White [Following Gollum, Frodo and Sam reach the end of Emyn Muil and see that Mordor is now closer.]
GOLLUM: See, see, we have led you out! Hurry hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find [Gollum jumps on a rock. Frodo walks past, Gollum shrinks as Sam draws near.]
GOLLUM: Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting a wide berth between him and Sam.]
SAM: Whoa, its a bog! Hes led us into a A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go [Gollum looks back and gestures for the hobbits to follow.]
GOLLUM: A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go [Gollum looks back and gestures for the hobbits to follow.]
GOLLUM: I found it, I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go round for miles and miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick as shadows we must be.
SAM: There are dead things! Dead faces in the water!
GOLLUM: All dead. All rotten. Elves and men and orcses. A great battle long ago. [Turns to face the hobbits.] The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name. This way. Dont follow the lights.
SAM: Careful now, or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
GOLLUM: Careful now, or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
SAM: [Frodo is in the water and sees many faces of the dead, no longer still but screaming and grasping, their rotten robes and hair flowing about their gruesome faces. Their hands are reaching for him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind. Frodo sputters and gasps for air as Gollum pulls him out of the water.]
FRODO: [Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude and disbelief.] Gollum.
GOLLUM: Dont follow the lights! [Crawls away]
SAM: [Runs to Frodos side.] Mr. Frodo! Are you alright?
[NIGHTFALL: Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake. He is holding the Ring in the palm of his hand and stroking it, mesmerized. Suddenly he hears Gollum.]
GOLLUM: Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. [Frodo quickly puts the Ring back inside his shirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouching away from him, stroking the centre of his palm] our preciousss.
FRODO: What did you say?
GOLLUM: Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength.
FRODO: [Moves over and crouches in front of Gollum] Who are you?
GOLLUM: Mustnt ask us. Not its business. Gollum, Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
FRODO: Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
GOLLUM: Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold be travellers far from home.
FRODO: He said your life was a sad story.
GOLLUM: They do not see what lies ahead, when sun has failed and moon is dead.
FRODO: You were not so very different from a hobbit once, were you. Sméagol?
GOLLUM: [Looks up slowly.] What did you call That was your name once, wasnt it? A long time ago.
FRODO: That was your name once, wasnt it? A long time ago.
GOLLUM: My name. My name. S. S.Sméagol
GOLLUM: Black Riders!
SAM: Black Riders!
GOLLUM: Hide! Hide!
FRODO: [Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of the Nazgûl's sword piercing him and the call of the Ring. Images of the Ringwraiths come to him in flashes.]
FRODO: Cmon Frodo! C'mon! [Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring on his chest, immobilized. Sam drags Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble bushes. The Nazgûl appears, tightening his hold on the reins. Camera then shows him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down across the marsh lands. Chilling screams of the Nazgûl fill the air.]
SAM: Cmon Frodo! C'mon! [Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring on his chest, immobilized. Sam drags Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble bushes. The Nazgûl appears, tightening his hold on the reins. Camera then shows him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down across the marsh lands. Chilling screams of the Nazgûl fill the air.]
GOLLUM: Quick! They will see us! They will see I thought they were dead!
SAM: I thought they were dead!
GOLLUM: Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.
GOLLUM: [cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the preciousss.
SAM: Mr. Frodo! Its alright. Im here.
GOLLUM: Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very [Scene returns to Fangorn forest. Gimli fingers a dark stain on a leaf and brings it to his mouth.]
GIMLI: [Spits] Ptui! Orc blood.
ARAGORN: These are strange tracks.
GIMLI: The air is so close in here.
LEGOLAS: This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory. and anger.
LEGOLAS: The trees are speaking to each other.
ARAGORN: [Whispers] Gimli!
GIMLI: [Gestures] Lower your axe.
ARAGORN: [Gestures] Lower your axe.
GIMLI: [Lowering his axe slowly] Oh.
LEGOLAS: Aragorn, nad nâ ennas! ( Something is out there. )
ARAGORN: Man cenich? ( What do you see? ) [Close-up of Legolas eyes]
LEGOLAS: The White Wizard approaches.
ARAGORN: Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.
ARAGORN: We must be quick. [With a yell, the three swing round to attack. Gimlis axe and Legolas arrow are deflected. Aragorn drops his sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp. They shield their eyes with their hands from the bright light emanating from the White Wizard.]
WHITE WIZARD: You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.
ARAGORN: Where are they?
WHITE WIZARD: They passed this way the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you?
ARAGORN: Who are you? Show yourself! [The bright light dims, revealing Gandalf, all dressed in white. The three are astounded. Legolas and Gimli bow.]
ARAGORN: It cannot be. You fell.
GANDALF: Through fire and water. [Flashback: Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop Dúrins Tower.] From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
GANDALF: Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
GANDALF: Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time. [Camera zooms in Gandalfs eye and enters an amorphous realm of stars and galaxies, ending in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again.
GANDALF: I've been sent back until my task is Gandalf? Yes. That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. [He smiles]
ARAGORN: Gandalf? Yes. That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. [He smiles]
GANDALF: Gandalf? Yes. That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. [He smiles]
GIMLI: [With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
GANDALF: [With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
GANDALF: One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
LEGOLAS: That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
GANDALF: Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.] He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.
TREEBEARD: My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where Ill keep you. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
GOLLUM: The Black Gate of Mordor. [The enormous Black Gate comes into view with Orcs patrolling and standing guard on the towers and atop the walls. From the right, an army of Easterling soldiers is marching to the Black Gate.]
SAM: Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
GOLLUM: Master says to show him the way into Mordor, so good Sméagol does. Master says so.
FRODO: I did. [Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.]
SAM: Thats it then. We cannot get past that.
SAM: Look! The gate, it's opening! I can see a way down.
FRODO: Sam, no!
SAM: [Frodo goes after Sam.]
GOLLUM: [Two Easterling soldiers see streams of dust coming down the cliff made by Sam and Frodo. They move away from the troop to investigate. Frodo reaches Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the Easterlings move closer and closer, Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself and Sam. The soldiers are now directly in front of Sam, but their eyes see nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer from underneath the cloak. The soldiers soon leave and after a moment, Frodo throws back the cloak and pulls Sam I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
FRODO: I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
SAM: I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
FRODO: [Gollum pulls them back.]
GOLLUM: No! No, no master! They catch you! They catch you! Dont take it to him! He wants the preciousss. Always hes looking for it! And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him. But we mustnt let him have it.
GOLLUM: No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] Theres another way. More secret. A dark way.
SAM: Why havent you spoken of this before?!
GOLLUM: Because Master did not ask!
SAM: Hes up to something.
FRODO: Are you saying theres another way into Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, and then a tunnel. closes. Gollum is stroking Frodos arm and burying his face in his cloak.]
GOLLUM: Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, and then a tunnel. closes. Gollum is stroking Frodos arm and burying his face in his cloak.]
FRODO: Hes led us this far, Sam.
SAM: Mr. Frodo, no.
FRODO: Hes been true to his word.
SAM: [Whispers] No!
FRODO: Lead the way, Sméagol.
GOLLUM: Good Sméagol always helps. [Frodo follows Gollum as Sam stares after him in disbelief.]
GANDALF: Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown. Sarumans hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
ÉOWYN: My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord? [Théoden just sits and stares ahead, his eyes clouded and unseeing.]
ÉOWYN: Will you not go to him? [She weeps.] Will you do nothing?
GANDALF: Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here.
GRÍMA: Oh, he he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
GRÍMA: I understand his passing is hard to accept, especially now that your brother has deserted you.
ÉOWYN: [jumps back and throws off Grímas hand] Leave me alone, snake!
GRÍMA: [Rises from the bed and moves ever closer to Éowyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness. In bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, like a hutch to trammel some wild thing [He puts a hand on her cheek and moves down to her throat.]
GRÍMA: So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's [Éowyn and Gríma stare at each other Your words are poison! [Éowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, she looks away into the distance. A flag comes off its pole and is carried by the breeze. Éowyn sees riders coming towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the entrance to Edoras, the flag floats down to land near him. Edoras is silent and somber. Everyone is dressed in black and staring at the newcomers in wary silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall and sees a lady in white standing on the steps. He looks around at more somber Youll find more cheer in a graveyard.
ÉOWYN: Your words are poison! [Éowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, she looks away into the distance. A flag comes off its pole and is carried by the breeze. Éowyn sees riders coming towards Edoras.

GIMLI: Youll find more cheer in a graveyard.
GANDALF: [sees Háma] Ah.
HÁMA: I cannot allow you before Théoden-King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
HÁMA: [gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.
GANDALF: Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You would not part an old man from his walking stick? [Looks at Háma innocently.]
GRÍMA: [Leaning down and whispering to Théoden.] My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. Hes a herald of woe.
GANDALF: The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Théoden King.
GRÍMA: [Whispering to Théoden.] Hes not welcome.
THÉODEN: Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? [Looks to Gríma for affirmation.]
GRÍMA: A just question, my liege. [He walks towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest.
GANDALF: Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm! [Raises his staff against Gríma.]
GRÍMA: His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf while addressing the guards] I told you to take the wizards staff!
GANDALF: Théoden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows.
GIMLI: [Growls] I would stay still, if I were Hearken to me! I release you from the spell. [Gestures with his hand]
GANDALF: Hearken to me! I release you from the spell. [Gestures with his hand]
THÉODEN: [Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf opens his eyes in surprise.] You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
THÉODEN: [Points his staff towards Théoden.] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
GANDALF: [Points his staff towards Théoden.] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
ARAGORN: [In Sarumans voice.] If I go. . . Théoden [Gandalf moves his staff sharply and Théoden flies back against the chair You did not kill me, you will not kill [in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!
THÉODEN: [In Sarumans voice.] If I go. . . Théoden [Gandalf moves his staff sharply and Théoden flies back against the chair You did not kill me, you will not kill [in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!
GANDALF: You did not kill me, you will not kill [in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!
THÉODEN: [in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!
GANDALF: Be gone!! [Gandalf smites Théoden as he lunges at him. Théoden is thrown back into the chair and the shot changes to Saruman flying backwards from the Palantír which he used to manipulate Théoden. He lands landing hard on the floor of Orthanc, bleeding from a gash in his forehead. In the hall, Théoden lets out a moan and slumps forward in the chair. Éowyn runs to her uncles side as he falls. Théodens head rises again and his face begins to change gradually into that of a much younger-looking man. Clarity and recognition returns to his eyes.]
THÉODEN: [Looks closely at Éowyn] I know your face. Éowyn Éowyn.
THÉODEN: Breathe the free air again, my friend.
GANDALF: Breathe the free air again, my friend.
THÉODEN: [Standing up and looking around him.] Dark have been my dreams of late. [He looks down at his trembling hands.]
GANDALF: Your fingers would remember their old strength better. if they grasped your [Háma runs up with his sword. Théoden reaches for it with trembling hands. He wraps his fingers around it slowly and then draws it, gazing upon the shiny steel. In a corner, Gríma trembles and tries to escape but is pulled back by Gimli. Suddenly, Théodens gaze turns to Gríma. Gríma is thrown out of the hall and down the stairs.]
GRÍMA: Argh! [Beseechingly to Théoden] I've only ever served you, my lord!
THÉODEN: [Advancing towards Gríma, holding the sword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
GRÍMA: [Grovelling] Send me not from your side.
ARAGORN: No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his [Gríma scrambles to his feet and pushes through the crowd]
GRÍMA: Get out of my way!
HÁMA: Hail, Théoden king! [The crowd kneels in homage before Théoden. Aragorn kneels also. Gríma rides out of Edoras. As Théoden turns to go back into the hall, he looks up.]
THÉODEN: Where is Théodred? Where is my son?
THÉODEN: Simbelmynë. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf] Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house.
GANDALF: Théodreds death was not of your making.
THÉODEN: No parent should have to bury their [Théoden starts to weep]
GANDALF: He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu hál. Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu. ( Be-thou well. Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou. )
ÉOWYN: They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree.
FREDA: Wheres mama?
ÉOWYN: This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. [Leans forward and puts a hand on Théodens chair. Théoden looks at his hand warily.] You must fight.
GANDALF: This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. [Leans forward and puts a hand on Théodens chair. Théoden looks at his hand warily.] You must fight.
ARAGORN: You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak. Éomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king.
THÉODEN: They will be three hundred leagues from here by now. Éomer cannot help us. I know what it is that you want of me. But I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war.
ARAGORN: Open war is upon you. Whether you would risk it or not.
THÉODEN: When last I looked, Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
GANDALF: Then what is the kings decision? [Scene shifts to outside Meduseld]
HÁMA: By order of the king, the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helms Deep. Do not burden yourselves with treasures. Take only what provisions you need.
GIMLI: Helms Deep! They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king.
ARAGORN: Hes only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helms Deep has saved them in the past.
GANDALF: There is no way out of that ravine. Théoden is walking into a trap. He thinks hes leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Théoden has a strong will but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defences HAVE to hold.
ARAGORN: They will hold.
GANDALF: [Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him] The Grey Pilgrim. thats what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of men Ive walked this earth and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East.
ARAGORN: [Opens the stall gates] Go. [Legolas jumps back as Gandalf rides out of the stable and over the plains of Rohan.]
ARAGORN: You have some skill with a blade. [With a swift move, Éowyn swings her sword and renders Aragorn vulnerable, gaining the upper hand.]
ÉOWYN: [Stepping back and sheathing her sword.] Women of this country learned long ago: Those without swords may still die upon them. I fear neither death nor pain.
ARAGORN: What do you fear, my lady?
ÉOWYN: A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
ARAGORN: You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden of Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] I do not think that would be your fate.
GRÍMA: Théoden will not stay at Edoras. Its vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helms Deep, the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. They will be slow. They will have women and children with them.
SARUMAN: Send out your warg riders. [The Orc smiles. In a pit behind him, ferocious growls are heard and shadows [Gollum is trying to catch a fish in the river. He slips and falls, grasping at a slippery fish as he goes. Frodo and Sam follow behind.]
SAM: Hey Stinker! Dont go getting too far Why do you do that?
FRODO: Why do you do that?
SAM: Call him names; run him down all the Because because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.
FRODO: Call him names; run him down all the Because because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.
SAM: Because because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.
FRODO: [Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what it did to him. What its still doing to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.] I want to help him, Sam.
SAM: Because I have to believe he can come You cant save him, Mr. Frodo.
FRODO: Because I have to believe he can come You cant save him, Mr. Frodo.
SAM: You cant save him, Mr. Frodo.
FRODO: [Snapping at Sam]What do you know about it? Nothing!
FRODO: [With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.
SAM: [Looks back at Frodo with tears in his eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. You have to fight it!
FRODO: [Grows angry again] I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He walks away]
SAM: Cant you hear yourself? Dont you know who you sound like?
GOLLUM: We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precioussss. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked, trickssssy, falssse!
SMÉAGOL: No! Not Master.
GOLLUM: Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie.
SMÉAGOL: Masters my friend.
GOLLUM: [Tauntingly] You dont have any friends. Nobody likes YOU.
SMÉAGOL: [Covers his ears] Not listening. Im not listening.
GOLLUM: Youre a liar and a thief.
SMÉAGOL: [Shaking his head] Nope.
GOLLUM: [Starts to weep and whimper] Go away.
SMÉAGOL: [Starts to weep and whimper] Go away.
GOLLUM: Go away! [Cackles] HAHAHAHA!!
SMÉAGOL: [Weeping and in a small voice] I hate you. I hate you!
GOLLUM: [Fiercely] Where would you be without me? Gollum, gollum. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me!
SMÉAGOL: [Resolute] Not anymore.
GOLLUM: [Startled] What did you say?
SMÉAGOL: Master looks after us now. We dont need you.
GOLLUM: Leave now and never come back.
SMÉAGOL: Leave now and never come back.
GOLLUM: [Louder] Leave now and never come back!
SMÉAGOL: [Louder] Leave now and never come back!
GOLLUM: [Growls and bares his teeth] Arrrgh!!!
SMÉAGOL: LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK! [Sméagol pants and then looks around.]
SMÉAGOL: We. we told him to go away! And away he goes, preciousss. [He hops around in joy and does a little dance.] Gone, gone, gone! Sméagol is free!
SMÉAGOL: Look! Look! See what Sméagol finds! Hehehe! Hahaha!
SMÉAGOL: They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat [He bites and tears into the raw meat. Sam rushes over and snatches the rabbit out of Gollums hands]
SAM: Youll make him sick, you will, behaving like that! [Holding up the two rabbits] Theres only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
SMÉAGOL: [Looking into the pot] Argh!! Whats it doing! Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins Whats to ruin? Theres hardly any meat on em.
SAM: Whats to ruin? Theres hardly any meat on em.
SAM: What we need is a few good taters.
GOLLUM: Whats taters, preciousss? Whats taters PO-TAY-TOES! Boil em. Mash em. Stick em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish..
SAM: PO-TAY-TOES! Boil em. Mash em. Stick em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish..
SMÉAGOL: [Sticks out his tongue in disgust] Pbbbttt!!
SAM: Even you couldnt say no to that. [He takes a sip of the stew]
SMÉAGOL: Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish. [scrambles up close to Sam] Give it to usss rrraw. and wrrriggling! [Makes sickeningly happy face.] You keep nasty chips. [Hops away]
SAM: Youre hopeless. [Frodo follows the source of the sound. Sam suddenly notices that Frodo is no longer in his sight.]
SAM: Mr. Frodo? [He goes in search of Frodo and finds him lying down near some bushes looking at a Haradrim army marching across the land. He moves to lie low beside Frodo. Sméagol also moves in beside Frodo.]
SAM: Who are they?
GOLLUM: Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It wont be long now. He will soon be ready.
SAM: Ready to do what?
GOLLUM: To make his war. The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.
FRODO: Weve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.
SAM: [Suddenly grabs Frodos arm] Mr Frodo! Look! Its an Oliphaunt!
SAM: No one at home will believe this.
FRODO: [Looking around] Sméagol? [Suddenly, pandemonium breaks out from below; the soldiers are being ambushed. Cloaked rangers are firing deadly arrows at the soldiers and Oliphaunts from behind bushes. One of the Oliphaunts starts trumpeting and stomping towards Frodo and Sam, swinging his huge trunk and tusks. Faramir takes aim and shoots a soldier. He falls from the Oliphaunt and lands right behind Frodo and Sam, Weve lingered here too long. Come on, [Frodo runs right into a Gondorian Ranger, who grabs hold of him and throws him onto his back. Sam sees Frodo in danger and grapples for his sword]
FRODO: Weve lingered here too long. Come on, [Frodo runs right into a Gondorian Ranger, who grabs hold of him and throws him onto his back. Sam sees Frodo in danger and grapples for his sword]
SAM: [He charges at Faramir but is grabbed by another ranger and thrown down. A sword appears at his throat. Faramir Bind their hands. [Meanwhile, the Rohirrim refugees are heading towards Helms Deep. Gimli is on a horse, chatting with Éowyn who is leading it by the reins.]
FARAMIR: Bind their hands. [Meanwhile, the Rohirrim refugees are heading towards Helms Deep. Gimli is on a horse, chatting with Éowyn who is leading it by the reins.]
GIMLI: Its true you dont see many Dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, haha that theyre often mistaken for Dwarf men.
ARAGORN: [Gestures and whispers] Its the beards..
GIMLI: And this, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women. And that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground!
ÉOWYN: [Laughs gaily] Hahahaha!!
GIMLI: Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous [The horse suddenly rears up and gallops away as Éowyn loses her hold on the reins. Gimli falls off after a short distance and lands with a loud thump.]
ÉOWYN: Ooh! [She rushes forward to Gimli]
GIMLI: [Struggling to get up] Its alright, its alright. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate.
[FLASHBACK: Aragorn is lying on a chaise in Rivendell. He opens his eyes and sees Arwen before him, smiling down at him.]
ARAGORN: I am asleep. This is a dream.
ARWEN: [Bends down to kiss him] Then it is a good dream. Sleep
ARAGORN: Min lû pennich nin i aur hen telitha. ( You told me once that this day would come. )
ARWEN: [Turns to look at Aragorn] Ú i vethed. nâ i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han bâd lîn. ( This is not the end. it is the beginning. You must go with Frodo. That is your path. )
ARAGORN: [Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i vâd o nin. ( My path is hidden from me. )
ARWEN: Si peliannen i vâd na dail lîn. Si boe ú-dhannathach. ( It is already laid before your feet. You cannot falter now. )
ARAGORN: [Arwen hushes him, resting her fingers on his lips. As her hands moves down to rest on the Evenstar pendant around Aragorns neck, he clasps her hand in his and they gaze into each others Ae ú-esteliach nad. estelio han. Estelio ammen. ( If you trust nothing else. trust this. Trust us. )
ARWEN: Ae ú-esteliach nad. estelio han. Estelio ammen. ( If you trust nothing else. trust this. Trust us. )
ÉOWYN: Where is she? The woman who gave you that jewel.
ELROND: Our time here is ending. Arwens time is ending. Let her go. Let her take the ship into the west. Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands. There it will be evergreen.
ARAGORN: But never more than a memory.
ELROND: I will not leave my daughter here to She stays because she still has hope.
ARAGORN: She stays because she still has hope.
ELROND: She stays for YOU! She belongs with her people!
ARAGORN: Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o auth a nîr a naeth. ( You have a chance for another life. Away from war. grief. despair. )
ARWEN: Why are you saying this?
ARAGORN: I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was a dream, Arwen, nothing more.
ARAGORN: This belongs to you.
ARWEN: [Closes Aragorns hand over the Evenstar] It was a gift. Keep it.
ÉOWYN: My lord?
ARAGORN: She is sailing to the Undying Lands, with all that is left of her kin.
GAMLING: What is it? Háma? [Their horses become restless.]
HÁMA: [Looking around] Im not sure. [A warg scout appears on a slope above and charges at them. The warg attacks Háma and kills him.]
GAMLING: [Just as it starts to turn on Gamling, Legolas runs over and kills the warg with an arrow. He then draws his knife and kills the Orc.]
LEGOLAS: Argh! [Shouts to Aragorn] A scout!
THÉODEN: What is it? What do you see?
ARAGORN: [Running back to Théoden] Wargs! We are under attack!
ARAGORN: Get them out of here!
THÉODEN: All riders to the head of the column!
GIMLI: [Trying to mount Arod] Come on, get me up here, Im a rider! Argh!
THÉODEN: [To Éowyn] You must lead the people to Helms Deep. And make haste!
ÉOWYN: I can fight!
THÉODEN: No! You must do this. for me. [Éowyn holds Théodens gaze for a moment and then turn to attend to the villagers.]
THÉODEN: [To his men] Follow me! Yah!
GIMLI: [Tries to get Arod to move] Forward. I mean, charge forward! March forward! [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather unsteadily.] Thats it! Go on!
ÉOWYN: [To the villagers] Make for the lower ground! Stick together!
THÉODEN: [The Rohirrim and warg riders crash head on and the battle begins. Théoden and company hack away at the warg riders. In the midst of fighting, Gimli falls off Arod. He turns to find a warg growling at him.]
CHARGE!!: [The Rohirrim and warg riders crash head on and the battle begins. Théoden and company hack away at the warg riders. In the midst of fighting, Gimli falls off Arod. He turns to find a warg growling at him.]
GIMLI: Bring your pretty face to my axe! [Just as the warg leaps at Gimli, Legolas kills it with one shot.]
GIMLI: [Jumping back as the warg falls, outraged] Argh! That one counts as mine!
GIMLI: Argh! Stinking creature. Argh! [As he tries to lift the warg off him, an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills him quickly, twisting his neck, and it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at the Orc and makes a face. He tries to lift both the warg and Orc off him. Just then, another warg comes upon him and bares its teeth, ready to strike.
GIMLI: [Eyes widening] Ooh..! [Aragorn plucks a spear as he passes on horseback and throws it at the warg. It dies, landing on Gimli and adding to the pile on top of him.]
GIMLI: [As the warg lands on him] Oooh!! [Théoden stabs at a warg rider. Aragorn is knocked off Hasufel and attacked by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while the latter is half-dragged by the warg. In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off and he rips the Evenstar pendant from Aragorns neck as he falls. Aragorn tries to let go of the warg but finds his wrist tangled with the saddle straps. He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle himself and is dragged closer and closer to the edge of a cliff at great speed. The warg runs right off the cliff and they both disappear over the edge. The battle is winding down as the Rohirrim finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.]
LEGOLAS: [Looking around] Aragorn!
GIMLI: [They come near to the cliff and hear Sharku wheezing and laughing]
GIMLI: [Standing over the dying Orc] Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
SHARKU: Hes [cough] dead. [Laughs evilly] Took a little tumble off the cliff.
LEGOLAS: [Looks towards the edge of the cliff, and grabs Sharku] You lie!
THÉODEN: [To his men] Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of Isengard will return. Leave the dead.
THÉODEN: [Puts a hand on Legolas' shoulder] Come.
REFUGEES: Helms Deep! At last! There it is!
OLD WOMAN: [To Éowyn] Were safe, my lady! Thank [Éowyn embraces the woman and they walk on towards Helms Deep. The gate is opened for the villagers. Many have already taken refuge within and are resting along the passage. Éothain and Freda run towards their mother.]
FREDA: Éothain! Freda! [The three hug and cry with joy. Théoden and company returns from the battle with warg riders]
MORWEN: Éothain! Freda! [The three hug and cry with joy. Théoden and company returns from the battle with warg riders]
GAMLING: Make way for Théoden!
SOLDIERS: Make way for the king! [Éowyn rushes down to meet them]
GAMLING: Make way for the king! [Éowyn rushes down to meet them]
ÉOWYN: [Looking about] So few. So few of you have returned.
THÉODEN: [Dismounting] Our people are safe. We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLI: [Going up to Éowyn] My lady.
ÉOWYN: Lord Aragorn, where is he?
GIMLI: He fell. [Éowyn is shaken and raises teary eyes to Théoden. The latter looks down and then walks away, confirming her unasked [At the battlements]
THÉODEN: Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate, and set a watch on the What of those who cannot fight, my lord? The women and children?
GAMLING: What of those who cannot fight, my lord? The women and children?
THÉODEN: Get them into the caves. [Walks down the steps and past a sewer gate] Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
GRÍMA: How? How can fire undo stone? What kind of device could bring down the wall?
SARUMAN: If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
GRÍMA: [Following Saruman] Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep.
SARUMAN: Tens of thousands.
GRÍMA: But, my lord, there is no such force.
SARUMAN: A new power is rising. Its victory is at hand!
SARUMAN: This night, the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms Deep! Leave none alive!
SARUMAN: To war!! [The army cheers and roars even louder.]
SARUMAN: [Sneers] There will be no dawn for Men.
PIPPIN: Look! Theres smoke to the south!
TREEBEARD: There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
MERRY: [The two hobbits climb higher up onto Treebeard for a better view.]
TREEBEARD: There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods. But now he has a mind of metal and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things.
PIPPIN: What is it?
MERRY: Its Sarumans army! The war has started.
ARWEN: [Kissing him on the lips] May the grace of the Valar protect you.
ARAGORN: [Mumbles] Brego [He grabs hold of Bregos mane, pulls himself onto the horse and rides slowly to Helms Deep.]
ELROND: [Coming into her room] Arwen. [Arwen hears him and sits up.]
ELROND: Tollen i lû. I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no círar. ( Arwen, it is time. The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go now. before it is too late. )
ARWEN: I have made my choice.
ELROND: He is not coming back. Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
ARWEN: There is still hope.
ELROND: [Walks towards window and looks out] If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. If Sauron is defeated, and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true, you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will die.
ELROND: And there will be no comfort for you. No comfort to ease the pain of his passing. He will come to death, an image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the [The body of Aragorn is now cast as a monument in stone. Arwen stands before the monument, veiled and in black.]
ELROND: But you, my daughter, you will linger on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Here you will dwell, bound to your grief, under the fading trees, until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
ELROND: [Tuning to Arwen] Arwen. there is nothing for you here, only death.
ELROND: A im, ú-'erin veleth lîn? ( Do I not also have your love? )
ARWEN: [Crying and moving into her fathers embrace] Gerich meleth nîn, ada. ( You have my love, father )
GALADRIEL: I amar prestar aen. han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han nostan ned gwilith. ( The world has changed. I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it in the air. ) The power of the enemy is growing. [Saruman is communicating with Sauron via the Palantír.] Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed. [View of Saruman's marching army] The eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last free kingdom of men. [View of Osgiliath] His war on this country will come swiftly. He senses the Ring is close. The strength of the Ringbearer is failing. In his heart, Frodo begins to understand. [Close-up of Galadriel] The quest will claim his life. You know this. You have foreseen it. It is the risk we all took.
FARAMIR: What news?
MADRIL: Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. Théodens people have fled to Helms Deep. [Points at the map] But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate.
FARAMIR: How many?
MADRIL: Some thousands. More come every day.
FARAMIR: Whos covering the river to the north?
MADRIL: We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but if the city is attacked, we wont hold [Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel [The hobbits are unbound and blindfolds taken off them by Damrod and another ranger. Sam and Frodo find themselves in a cave behind a waterfall, with Damrod sitting behind them on a rock constantly watching them. Faramir comes up to them and sits.].

FARAMIR: My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
SAM: Spies?! Now wait just a minute!
FARAMIR: Well if youre not spies, then who are [Frodo and Sam remain silent.]
FARAMIR: We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
FRODO: We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
FARAMIR: Your bodyguard?
SAM: His gardener.
FARAMIR: And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured [The merest hesitation.] There was no [Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.]
FRODO: [The merest hesitation.] There was no [Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.]
FRODO: We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Mória. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
FARAMIR: [Intently] Youre a friend of Boromir?
FRODO: Yes. for my part.
FARAMIR: It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
FRODO: [Shocked] Dead? How? When?
FARAMIR: As one of his companions, Id hoped you would tell me. [Pause] He was my [Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought. Suddenly someone comes up to him.]
GONDORIAN RANGER: Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found the third one.
FARAMIR: You must come with me. Now. [Frodo gets up and follow. They come to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking the Forbidden Pool.]
FARAMIR: [Pointing down] Down there. [Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving into the water.]
FARAMIR: To enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death. [He gestures to archers hidden in the bushes.] They wait for my command.
FARAMIR: Shall I shoot? [Frodo looks stricken. Gollum emerges from the pool onto a rock. He holds a fish in his hand and starts singing, slapping the fish on the rock as he [singing] The rock and pool is nice and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The fish almost wriggles out of his grasp and he whacks it some more.]
GOLLUM: [singing] The rock and pool is nice and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The fish almost wriggles out of his grasp and he whacks it some more.]
FRODO: Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please, let me go down to [Faramir nods. Frodo descends to the Forbidden Pool and approaches Gollum who is gorging on the raw fish.]
FRODO: Sméagol. [Gollum turns round at Frodos voice.] Master is here. Come, Sméagol. Trust master. Come!
GOLLUM: We must go now?
FRODO: Sméagol, you must trust master. Follow me, come on. Come. Come, Sméagol. Nice Sméagol. Thats it. Come on.
FRODO: Dont hurt him! Sméagol dont struggle! Sméagol listen to me!
GOLLUM: [wails] Master!! [A black cloth is brought over Gollum's head. Frodo stares after them with a stricken expression as Faramir leads Gollum and his men away. Back in the cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground. Crying, he crawls into a corner and curls up into ball.]
GOLLUM: No! No!
FARAMIR: Where are you leading them? Answer me!
GOLLUM: [Cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder] Sméa gol. Why does it cry, Sméagol?
SMÉAGOL: [Sobbing] Cruel men hurts us. Master trickst us.
GOLLUM: Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false.
SMÉAGOL: [Sobbing] Master is our friend. our Master betrayed us.
GOLLUM: Master betrayed us.
SMÉAGOL: No, not its business. Leave us alone!
GOLLUM: [Hits his fist against the wall] Filthy little hobbitses. They stole it from [Whimpers] No. No!
SMÉAGOL: [Whimpers] No. No!
FARAMIR: What did they steal?
GOLLUM: [Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression] Myyy PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!
SAM: We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. I cant. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me, but Im sorry. The Rings taking me Sam. If I put it on, hell find me. Hell see.
FRODO: I cant. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me, but Im sorry. The Rings taking me Sam. If I put it on, hell find me. Hell see.
SAM: Mr. Frodo. [They both stand as Faramir enters.]
FARAMIR: [Unsheathes his sword] So. this is the answer to all the riddles. Here in the wild I have you. Two halflings and a host of men at my call. The Ring of power within my grasp.
FARAMIR: A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
FRODO: No!! [He runs away from Faramir]
SAM: Stop it! Leave him alone! Dont you understand? Hes got to destroy it. Thats where were going. Into Mordor. To the mountain of fire.
DAMROD: Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements.
SAM: Please. Its such a burden. Will you not help him?
DAMROD: Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
FARAMIR: Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
ARAGORN: [Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn. ( Well done, Brego, my friend )
REFUGEES: Hes alive!
GIMLI: [Pushing his way through the crowd.] Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way. Im gonna kill him! [He sees Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless you, laddie!
ARAGORN: Gimli, where is the king? [Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn makes his way in, he runs into Legolas who stands waiting.]
LEGOLAS: Le ab-dollen. ( Youre late. ) [They smile. Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorns wounds.] You look terrible.
ARAGORN: Hannon le. ( Thank you. ) [Éowyn looks on and smiles even as tears fill her eyes.]
THÉODEN: A great host, you say?
ARAGORN: All Isengard is emptied
THÉODEN: How many?
ARAGORN: Ten thousand strong at least.
THÉODEN: Ten thousand?!
ARAGORN: It is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. They will be here by nightfall.
THÉODEN: Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]
THÉODEN: [to Gamling] I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
THÉODEN: We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg.
GIMLI: This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
THÉODEN: I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep.
THÉODEN: They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Sarumans hordes will pillage and burn, weve seen it before. Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. Within these walls, we will outlast They do not come to destroy Rohans crops or villages. They come to destroy its people. Down to the last child.
ARAGORN: They do not come to destroy Rohans crops or villages. They come to destroy its people. Down to the last child.
THÉODEN: [Draws close to Aragorn] What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid.
ARAGORN: Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid.
THÉODEN: And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.
ARAGORN: Gondor will answer.
THÉODEN: Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us? Where was Gon  No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone. [He walks away, calling out orders] Get the women and children into the We need more time to lay provisions for a siege, lord 
GAMLING: We need more time to lay provisions for a siege, lord 
THÉODEN: [Cutting him off] There is no time. War is upon us!
ROHAN CAPTAIN: [to the soldiers] Secure the gate!
TREEBEARD: We Ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time. But now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age. Ent Moot.
MERRY: Whats that?
TREEBEARD: 'Tis a gathering.
MERRY: A gathering of what? [Merry and Pippin turns round as they hear movement from the forest around them. They see many more Ents like Treebeard Beech, oak, chestnut, ash. Good, good, good. Many have come. Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
TREEBEARD: Beech, oak, chestnut, ash. Good, good, good. Many have come. Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
SOLDIER 1: Move back! Move to the caves!
SOLDIER 2: Keep moving!
SOLDIER 3: Quickly now! [Old men and young lads are being drafted for war. The women and children say their tearful and reluctant farewells as their fathers, husbands and sons are led away by soldiers. In the armoury, weapons are being distributed. Aragorn picks up a battered sword, looks at it and tosses it back.]
ARAGORN: Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers.
GIMLI: Most have seen too many winters.
LEGOLAS: Or too few. Look at them. Theyre frightened. I can see it in their eyes. [The men around them fell silent. Legolas speaks to Aragorn.] Boe a hûn: neled herain dan caer menig! ( And they should be. Three hundred against ten thousand! )
ARAGORN: Si beriathar hýn. Amar nâ ned Edoras. ( They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras. )
LEGOLAS: Aragorn, men i ndagor. Hýn ú-. ortheri. Natha daged aen! ( Aragorn, we are warriors. They cannot win this fight. They are all going to die! )
ARAGORN: Then I shall die as one them! [He pauses and then walks away. Legolas makes as if to go after him.]
GIMLI: [Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go, lad. Let him be.
GAMLING: Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. My lord?
THÉODEN: Who am I, Gamling?
GAMLING: You are our king, sire.
THÉODEN: And do you trust your king?
GAMLING: [Puts armour onto Théoden] Your men, my lord, will follow you to whatever [The villagers are handed their weapons. An oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed boy. Another stares at the axe that he is handed with frightened eyes. Another child wearing oversized chain mail takes up a huge shield. Théoden stands inside the main hall of the keep, his back to the entrance where a bright white light is streaming through.]
THÉODEN: To whatever end Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the west. Behind the hills, into shadow. How did it come to this?
ARAGORN: Give me your sword. What is your name?
HALETH: Haleth, son of Háma, my lord. The men are saying that we will not live out the night. They say that it is hopeless..
ARAGORN: This is a good sword, Haleth, son of [He hands the sword back to Haleth and leans close to him, putting a hand on his shoulder.]
ARAGORN: There is always hope. [Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his battle gear. His sword is handed to him as he reaches for it. He nods and accepts the sword from Legolas.]
LEGOLAS: We have trusted you this far. You have not led us astray. Forgive me. I was wrong to despair.
ARAGORN: Ú-moe edhored, Legolas. ( There is nothing to forgive, Legolas. )
GIMLI: If we had more time Id get this adjusted. [He drops the bundle and the chain mail lands with its length right to the floor.] Its a little tight across the chest.
LEGOLAS: That is no Orc horn. [They run out to the battlements.]
BEREG: [to another guard] Send for the king. Open the gate!
SOLDIER: Open the gate! [An army of Lothlórien Elves march up the Causeway into the Hornburg. They are led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldiers look upon them in wonderment and delight as they pass.]
THÉODEN: How is this possible?
HALDIR: I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. An alliance once existed between Elves and men. Long ago we fought and died together. [He looks up to see Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli running down the steps, and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.
ARAGORN: [He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. ( Welcome, Haldir ) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace. Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back You are most welcome! [Legolas and Haldir clasp each other on the shoulder.]
ARAGORN: You are most welcome! [Legolas and Haldir clasp each other on the shoulder.]
HALDIR: [Turning to Théoden] We are proud to fight alongside men, once more.
GIMLI: [Grumbling and straining to look above the wall.] You could have picked a better [Legolas smirks. Aragorn approaches and stands beside them]
GIMLI: Well lad, whatever luck you live by, lets hope it lasts the night.
LEGOLAS: Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
GIMLI: Lets hope they last the night. [The marching and thumping grows louder and louder. Lightning flashes and it begins to rain. While the Uruk-hai army continues to march at the fortress, an Uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop.]
ARAGORN: A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas! ( Show them no mercy! For you shall receive none! )
GIMLI: [Jumping and straining to see] Whats happening out there?
LEGOLAS: Shall I describe it to you? [Looks at Gimli with a grin] Or would you like me to find you a box?
GIMLI: [Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!!
ARAGORN: Dartho! ( Hold! ) [The Uruk-hai army stop their roaring and thumping. With a hollow groan, the Uruk that was shot collapsed to the ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their teeth and roar with anger. With a cry, the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts So it begins.
THÉODEN: So it begins.
ARAGORN: Tangado halad! ( Prepare to fire! ) [The Elves notch their arrow and aim.]
LEGOLAS: Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc a nu ranc. ( Their armor is weak at the neck and beneath the arms. )
ARAGORN: Leithio i philinn! ( Release the arrows! )
GIMLI: Did they hit anything?
THÉODEN: Give them a volley.
GAMLING: [to the men] Fire!
ARAGORN: [Impatiently] Send them to me! Cmon!
GIMLI: [Impatiently] Send them to me! Cmon!
ARAGORN: Pendraid! ( Ladders! ) [The Elves draw their blades in preparation for combat. The first ladders are almost reaching the walls with big nasty Uruk Berserkers on top of them.]
ARAGORN: Swords! Swords!
GIMLI: [Close combat begins as the Uruk-hai climb over the wall.]
GIMLI: Legolas, two already! [Holding up two Im on seventeen!
LEGOLAS: Im on seventeen!
GIMLI: [Outraged] Argh! Ill have no pointy-ear outscoring me! [He turns to a Uruk just climbing over the wall, whacking it in the groin with his axe and killing it as it falls.]
LEGOLAS: [Fires two arrows] Nineteen! [The Ent Moot is still in progress. The Ents sway a little as they continue to deliberate. Merry and Pippin are sitting a distance away. Suddenly, Treebeard nods and turns to the hobbits.]
PIPPIN: [Gesturing] Merry!
TREEBEARD: We have just agreed. [Long pause with his eyes closed.]
MERRY: [Angles his head in query] Yes?
TREEBEARD: I have told your names to the Ent moot and we have agreed  you are not Orcs.
PIPPIN: Well, thats good news.
MERRY: [impatiently] And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about HIM?
TREEBEARD: [Waving a hand] Now dont be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
MERRY: Hasty? Our friends are out there! They need our help! They cannot fight this war on their own.
TREEBEARD: War, yes It affects us all. But you must understand, young hobbit. It takes a loong time to say anything in ooold Entish. [Merry and Pippin roll their eyes in disgruntlement.] And we never say anything unless it is worth taking a looong time to say.
GIMLI: Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! Twenty-one! Twenty-two!
ARAGORN: Na fennas! ( Causeway! ) [Directs the Elf archers to aim at the Uruk-hai column.]
THÉODEN: Is this it? Is this all you can conjure, [At the bottom of the Deeping Wall, two spiky bombs are lodge in the sluice gate. The rest opens a path and an Uruk-hai carrying a torch starts to run towards the sluice gate. Aragorn spots the Uruk-hai.]
ARAGORN: Togo hon dad, Legolas! ( Bring him down, Legolas! ) [Legolas shoots the Uruk-hai in the shoulder but the latter keeps going] Dago hon! Dago hon! ( Kill him! Kill him! )
THÉODEN: Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!
GIMLI: Aragorn!! Argh! [He is soon overpowered. Aragorn gets up and sees Gimli falling.]
ARAGORN: Gimli! [He yells to the Elves behind him] Hado i philinn! ( Hurl the arrows! )
ARAGORN: Herio! ( Charge! ) [Aragorn leads the Elves in a charge towards the Uruk-hai streaming in. He rushes to Gimlis side and picks him up. At the top of the battlements, Legolas grabs a shield and sends it sliding across the ground. He then hops onto it and surfs down the steps, releasing three arrows as he goes, and kicking the shield to stab an Uruk-hai as he lands at the bottom.]
TREEBEARD: The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done.
MERRY: How can that be your decision?!
TREEBEARD: This is not our war.
MERRY: But you're part of this world! Arent you?! [The Ents look at one another, taken back] You must help, please! You must do something!
TREEBEARD: You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home.
PIPPIN: Maybe Treebeards right. We dont belong here, Merry. It's too big for us. What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.
MERRY: [Looking into the distance.] The fires of Isengard will spread. And the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. [Turns to Pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder] There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
GAMLING: Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there!
ARAGORN: Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad! ( To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep! Haldir, to the Keep! )
GIMLI: [Protesting] What are you doing? Argh! What are you stopping for!
ARAGORN: [Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs up the steps to Haldirs side and catches him and he collapses. Haldir's head rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and swings down to the ground, killing as he goes.]
GAMLING: Brace the gate!
SOLDIER: Hold them!
THÉODEN: [Drawing his sword] To the gate! Draw your swords!
GAMLING: Make way! We cannot hold much longer.
THÉODEN: Hold them!
ARAGORN: [Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-hai through the broken gate] How long do you need?
GAMLING: Brace the gate!
THÉODEN: As long as you can give me!
ARAGORN: Timbers! Brace the Gate! [Aragorn and Gimli slip out a side exit and stand on a ledge just to the side of the main gate. Aragorn peeks over, seeing the large band of Uruk-hai storming the gate.]
THEODEN: Timbers! Brace the Gate! [Aragorn and Gimli slip out a side exit and stand on a ledge just to the side of the main gate. Aragorn peeks over, seeing the large band of Uruk-hai storming the gate.]
GIMLI: Come on! We can take em!
ARAGORN: Its a long way. [Gimli takes a peek and then steps back.]
GIMLI: [Mumbles] Toss me.
ARAGORN: I cannot jump the distance! Youll have to toss me!
GIMLI: I cannot jump the distance! Youll have to toss me!
GIMLI: Oh! [Gimli stays Aragorns hand] Dont tell the Elf.
ARAGORN: Not a word. [He tosses Gimli to the head of the Causeway and then leaps over.]
GIMLI: [Making quick work of killing the Uruk-hai]
ARGH!!: [On the other side of the gate]
THÉODEN: Shore up the door!
SOLDIER 1: Make way!
SOLDIER 2: Follow me to the barricade.
SOLDIER 3: Watch our backs!
SOLDIER 4: Throw another one over here!
THÉODEN: [Men are bracing the gate with wood and nails. Aragorn and Gimli continue to fight off the Uruk-hai just outside. Meanwhile the Uruk-hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements. Hundred of Uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls, the super-ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips. Legolas takes aim as another super-ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes. The ladder falls back onto the Uruk-hai army.]
SOLDIER: Hold fast the gate!]
THÉODEN: [Through a crack in the gate] Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!
LEGOLAS: Aragorn! [He throws them a rope] [Aragorn grabs Gimli in one hand and the rope with the other as they are pulled up the wall. Just then the Uruk-hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements. Hundred of Uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls, the super-ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips. Legolas takes aim as another super-ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes. The ladder falls back onto the Uruk-hai army.]
THÉODEN: Pull everybody back! Pull them back!
GAMLING: Fall back! Fall back!
THÉODEN: Theyve broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat!
GAMLING: Fall back!
THÉODEN: Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!
ARAGORN: Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!
GAMLING: Into the Keep! [They all run towards the keep, Legolas firing two arrows into the Uruk-hai army as he goes.]
TREEBEARD: I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
PIPPIN: Wait! Stop! Stop! [Treebeard comes to a stop.] Turn around. Turn around. Take us south!
TREEBEARD: South? But that will lead you past Isengard.
PIPPIN: Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. Its the last thing hell Mmmm. That doesnt make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps youre right. South it is then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going down hill.
TREEBEARD: Mmmm. That doesnt make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps youre right. South it is then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going down hill.
MERRY: Are you mad? Well be caught!
PIPPIN: No we wont. Not this time. [Faramir and company draws close to Look! Osgiliath burns!
RANGER 1: Look! Osgiliath burns!
RANGER 2: Mordor has come.
FRODO: [With tears in his eyes] The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy. Please, let me go.
FARAMIR: Hurry. [He presses them on]
FRODO: Faramir, you must let me go! [Frodo and Sam are pushed on towards [Treebeard, Merry and Pippin come to the southern edge of the forest.]
TREEBEARD: And a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and they tickle me awfully. Theyre always trying to get somewhere where they  Oh!! [He sees the desolated landscape of tree stumps that used to be forested grounds] Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
PIPPIN: Im sorry, Treebeard.
TREEBEARD: [With tears in his eyes] They had voices of their own. [His gaze turns to the treeless Isengard and its smoking caverns] Saruman! A wizard should know better!
TREEBEARD: There is no curse in Elvish, Entish or the tongues of men for this treachery. My business is with Isengard tonight. With rock and stone!
MERRY: Hoorarooom. Come my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely that we go to our doom. Last march of the [Osgiliath is still under siege as Faramir and company arrives, dodging arrows and falling rocks.]

MADRIL: Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great. By nightfall well be overrun.
SAM: Mr Frodo!
FRODO: Its calling to him, Sam. His eye is almost on me.
SAM: Hold on, Mr. Frodo You'll be alright.
FARAMIR: Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
SAM: Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect him, he tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!
RANGER: Watch out! [A boulder crashes into a tower overhead and shatters it. Suddenly, Frodos eyes roll up and he stares at Faramir strangely.]
SAM: Mr Frodo?
FRODO: [In a faraway voice] Theyre here. Theyve [Looking up] NAZGÛL!! [He grabs the hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.] Stay here. Keep out of sight. [To his men] Take cover!
FARAMIR: [Looking up] NAZGÛL!! [He grabs the hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.] Stay here. Keep out of sight. [To his men] Take cover!
THÉODEN: The fortress is taken. It is over.
ARAGORN: [Carrying a table with Legolas to shore up the door of the hall] You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it! They still defend it! They have died defending it!
WOMAN: They are breaking in!
ARAGORN: Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? [There is no answer.] Is there no other There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.
GAMLING: There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.
ARAGORN: Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance.
THÉODEN: So much death. What can men do against such reckless hate?
ARAGORN: [Pause] Ride out with me. Ride out and meet them.
THÉODEN: [A light of determination shines in his eyes] For death and glory.
ARAGORN: For Rohan. For your people.
GIMLI: The sun is rising. [Aragorn looks up at a window to see faint light streaming through. He recalls Gandalf's words.]
THÉODEN: Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep one last time!
GIMLI: Yes! [Gimli runs up the steps to the horn of Helm Hammerhand]
THÉODEN: Let this be the hour when we draw swords together. Fell deeds awake. Now for wrath! Now for ruin! And a red dawn!
THÉODEN: FORTH EORLINGAS!! [Théoden leads the charge out of the keep into the Hornburg, slashing away at the Uruk-hai as they go. Without pause, they storm out of the gate and down the Causeway, right into the column of waiting Uruk-hai. In the midst of battle, Aragorn looks east and sees a white rider against the rising sun]

ARAGORN: Théoden king stands alone.
GANDALF: Théoden king stands alone.
ÉOMER: [Coming up from behind] Not alone. [He raises a hand] Rohirrim!!
THÉODEN: [Looking to the east] Éomer!
ÉOMER: To the king! [The Rohirrim and the White Rider charge down the slope. Half the Uruk-hai army turns to face the challenge, bearing their spears down towards the riders. As the riders draw closer, the sun rises behind them, momentarily blinding the Uruk-hai who raise the hands ( and spears ) to shield their eyes. The riders crash right into the Uruk-hai and engage them in battle.]
PIPPIN: A hit. A fine hit! [Two Ents rock a wooden structure and push it over into the caverns below, smashing against the rock. Some Orcs fire flamed-tipped arrows at an Ent, setting him on fire. Saruman continues to look about from his balcony, helpless. Some Ents are now breaking away at a Break the dam! Release the river! [The dam is broken and Saruman looks up to see the river rushing down the slope towards Isengard, washing away Orcs and wooden structures in its path.
TREEBEARD: A hit. A fine hit! [Two Ents rock a wooden structure and push it over into the caverns below, smashing against the rock. Some Orcs fire flamed-tipped arrows at an Ent, setting him on fire. Saruman continues to look about from his balcony, helpless. Some Ents are now breaking away at a Break the dam! Release the river! [The dam is broken and Saruman looks up to see the river rushing down the slope towards Isengard, washing away Orcs and wooden structures in its path.
TREEBEARD: Break the dam! Release the river! [The dam is broken and Saruman looks up to see the river rushing down the slope towards Isengard, washing away Orcs and wooden structures in its path.
MERRY: Pippin, hold on! [The hobbits tighten their hold on top of Treebeard]
TREEBEARD: Hold on, little hobbits! [Treebeard braces himself against the flood. As the water rushes over Isengard, an Ent rushes in and thrusts his burning body into the water. The water rushes into the caverns, washing away the bridges, mechanisms and structures within.]
SAM: What are you doing? Where are you going?!
[SLOW MOTION: Frodo walks up some stairs and stands on a bridge. A Nazgûl on a Fell beast emerges in front of him. Frodo stares at the Nazgûl, fixated. Feeling the call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir watches the unfolding tableau from below. As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his finger and the Nazgûl flies closer and closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo over. Faramir releases an arrow and shoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Sam roll down the stairs. As they come to a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam in a death grip, yells and points Sting at his throat, his eyes livid with madness and anger that someone would try to take the Ring away.]
FRODO: [With tears running down his face] Its me. Its your Sam. Dont you know your [The madness fades and recognition returns to Frodos eyes. He realises what he nearly did and is overcome. Stumbling backwards, he collapses against a wall and Sting falls to the ground with a clang. Sam gets up slowly.]
SAM: [With tears running down his face] Its me. Its your Sam. Dont you know your [The madness fades and recognition returns to Frodos eyes. He realises what he nearly did and is overcome. Stumbling backwards, he collapses against a wall and Sting falls to the ground with a clang. Sam gets up slowly.]
FRODO: [Slowly and with despair] I cant do this, Sam.
SAM: [Getting up slowly] I know. Its all wrong. By rights we shouldnt even be here. But we are. [He stands and leans against a wall, looking out into the distance.] Its like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didnt want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? [Images of the riders winning the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helms Deep] How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had Victory! We have victory! [He raises his sword with a victorious cry]
THÉODEN: Victory! We have victory! [He raises his sword with a victorious cry]
SAM: But in the end, its only a passing thing, this shadow. [The women and children welcome the men as they return. Éowyn runs up to Aragorn and embraces him, crying tears of relief.] Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on from their perch on Treebeard. On the balcony, Saruman stumbles back into his chamber] And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt. They kept going because they were holding on to something.
FRODO: What are we holding on to, Sam?
SAM: Theres some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And its worth fighting for.
FARAMIR: I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
MADRIL: You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
FARAMIR: Then it is forfeit. Release them. [Sam shakes the rangers hand from his shoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramir with gladness. Over in the realm of Rohan, Gandalf, Théoden and company ride to the top of a slope, looking towards the Mountain of Fire in the Saurons wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. The battle for Helms Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere in the wilderness.
GANDALF: Saurons wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. The battle for Helms Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere in the wilderness.
SAM: I wonder if well ever be put into songs or tales.
FRODO: I wonder if people will ever say, lets hear about Frodo and the Ring. And theyll say yes, thats one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasnt he, dad. Yes, my boy, the most famousest of hobbits. And thats saying Huh, you left out one of the chief characters  Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam.

FRODO: Huh, you left out one of the chief characters  Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam.
FRODO: Frodo wouldnt have got far without Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldnt make fun. I was being serious.
SAM: Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldnt make fun. I was being serious.
FRODO: [smiling] So was I. [He turns to walk [Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]
SAM: [Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]
FRODO: Were not gonna wait for you. Come on!
SAM: Were not gonna wait for you. Come on!
SMÉAGOL: Master. Master looks after us. Master wouldnt hurt us.
GOLLUM: Master broke his promise.
SMÉAGOL: Dont ask Sméagol. Poor, poor Sméagol.
GOLLUM: Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy, false. We ought to wring his filthy little neck. [Twists the branch of a tree] Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both. And then we take the precious and we be the master.
SMÉAGOL: [Scuttles and hides behind a tree] The fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.
GOLLUM: Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses. And make HIM crawl.
SMÉAGOL: [Bites on his finger and nods eagerly] Yes! Yes! Yes!
GOLLUM: Kill them both.
SMÉAGOL: Yes! No no! [Backs away against a tree] Its too risky, its too risky.
SAM: Wheres he gone? Hey Gollum, where are [Softly and sinisterly] We could let HER do it.
FRODO: [Softly and sinisterly] We could let HER do it.
GOLLUM: [Softly and sinisterly] We could let HER do it.
SMÉAGOL: Yes. She could do it.
GOLLUM: Yes, precious she could. And then we takes it once theyre dead.
SMÉAGOL: Once theyre dead
GOLLUM: Shh [He pops out from hiding in front of the hobbits.]
SMÉAGOL: Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet. Sméagol will show you the way.
GOLLUM: Follow me. [ Camera pans up over the forest and Ephel Dúath to reveal the desolation of Mordor. To the left of the frame is the glowing Eye of Sauron atop Barad-dûr, and to the right of the frame is the fiery Mount Doom. Three Fell Beasts circle the dark skies. Lightning flashes as the scene fades to black.]
