LOGANS RUN: Screenplay By Saul David Michael Anderson Production Design: Dale Hennesy Revised : April 30, 1975
LOGAN: Wake up.come on, Logan-6.
FRANCIS: You should've seen me take my last Runner.perfect. I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated.his So now you've seen him.what's the difference awake or asleep? Open your eyes once, idiot. It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis - that's him!
FRANCIS: Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out. But Logan isn't moving. Francis gets an idea.
FRANCIS: Okay.you really want to wake him up? Francis starts to pry at the Panel.knowing it will sound an
LOGAN: Hey, cut that out ! Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they stand is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and stops him from prying at the panel:
LOGAN: Now you've done it. The CHIMES STOP.but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:
VOICE: Break-in scanners report intrusion, Logan-5.Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
LOGAN: Logan-5.Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
VOICE: Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7. The violet light goes off. Had enough? Even the alarm didn't wake him. As Francis starts out: All right, Francis.I'm with you. They move off down the corridor.the lights behind them DIMMING as they pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, CHILDREN automatically tended. CHIMES.soft. A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE.
VOICE: Sleep time.go to sleep. Sleeping time, little ones. As they exit Nursery.Logan stops and takes one final look You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate. your alert successor.Logan-6.
FRANCIS: You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate. your alert successor.Logan-6.
LOGAN: Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
FRANCIS: ( putting a card key into a door which opens soundlessly ) Not in my time. They move through the door which closes.
LOGAN: just wondered.what happens? Dunno.flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out? One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it. The two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it through the doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES softly off into a kind of twilight.
LOGAN: but you don't know, you Just say what everyone says. One for one. One for one."
FRANCIS: Well, why no!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -You have a better idea?
FRANCIS: Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering. You know, Logan you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people to: RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
MAN: Well? How do you like it? I don't know. The cheeks maybe. look a little -
MAN: Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
WOMAN: Too little.
MAN: Too little? Too little. Okay, wait for me. And he darts back into NEW YOU #483. The woman shrugs, glances around, smiles and goes off with a passer-by.
LOGAN: Did you ever see Francis-8? I never even visited Nursery before When you wonder, it slows you up you know? They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs promise: LIFT OFF, CRAZY LIFT, SUPER LIFT.here the people going in are simply excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned out of their minds.
FRANCIS: I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was? Of course not! I m curious, not sick. The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway. Logan and Francis are swallowed up in the group.
FRANCIS: and that's my friend, Logan. We're celebrating his next in line. Carousel - Arcade - who knows? Want to come along? Only if I make it to the top of Thirty and the big spin. In her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. Francis nods, gives her a half-squeeze.
FRANCIS: You're thirty already? I always thought I was older than you - Well, give it a good try. You know I always have. Another beautiful WOMAN joins them. Sorry I won't be at Carousel tonight. It¹s my Love-Shop turn.
WOMAN: That's all right. Happy turn.
2ND WOMAN: You'll renew. I've got a feeling. So do I.but if I don't at least I'll have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost rather have that than renew.
2ND WOMAN: I feel the same way. Sometimes I think I'm not even going to try and renew when my time comes. But that's three years away. So long. The 2nd Woman walks away.
WOMAN: They look briefly and then she turns away. Francis takes Logan's arm and they move off.
FRANCIS: I guess you never had her? Logan shakes his head.
FRANCIS: You missed something special.
LOGAN: Well.you can't have them all.
FRANCIS: The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than - come on, Sandman. The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall.
LOGAN: You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him - Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think. Yes. Me, too. You know we're both on Monitor tonight.
FRANCIS: Damn! That's right. Just when I feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in Arcade .
LOGAN: Want me to take your shift? I'm feeling restless anyway
LOGAN: Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
FRANCIS: Only a few? You're just not trying.
CROWD: The man continues to strain:
CROWD: 51 CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN Almost a blur.but still straining:
CROWD'S CHANT: 52 CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS 53 CLOSE ANGLE - THE MAN The blur.but still there.straining with all his might for the Suddenly, the man.topples into the whirling blackness below.where he is instantly incinerated.
CROWD'S CHANT: Suddenly, the man.topples into the whirling blackness below.where he is instantly incinerated.
LOGAN: ( to Francis ) Looks like I'm working.
LOGAN: Who invited you?
FRANCIS: I'm in my party mood.
LOGAN: Runner terminated 0:31 Ready for cleanup. Done with his job, he rises to face Francis.
LOGAN: ( smiling ) That was a great shot you made.
FRANCIS: ( beat ) But you look a little rusty to me what were you doing, wondering? Logan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the hall, passing CAMERA
FRANCIS: .Well I think you're getting stale. You need old LuceyGo on. Gee the whole burntry the new psycho-lift-they tell me it turns you inside out. He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down.
FRANCIS: ( calling after him ) I'll look for you here when I'm off And he is gone.
LOGAN: What's wrong, Available?
JESSICA: ( breaking away gently ) Please . . .No. She backs away, almost apologetically. Logan follows, smiling.
LOGAN: Please . . . no ? You mean "not here"that's it? You're a private Available but Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
JESSICA: ( that stops him ) Just no.
LOGAN: You prefer women?
JESSICA: Well then.?
LOGAN: Well then.?
JESSICA: Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
LOGAN: Sad? What made you sad?
JESSICA: A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
LOGAN: ( after a beat ) Yes.probably he was renewed?
JESSICA: ( flatly ) He was killed
LOGAN: Killed? Why do you use that word?
JESSICA: Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
LOGAN: I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners Who brought you?
JESSICA: Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself on the circuit.
LOGAN: You felt sad. What's your name?
JESSICA: ( matter-of-fact ) You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
LOGAN: ( matter-of-fact ) You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
JESSICA: But you put yourself on the circuit!
LOGAN: But you put yourself on the circuit!
JESSICA: But you put yourself on the circuit!
LOGAN: But you put yourself on the circuit!
JESSICA: I thought I had to do something.
LOGAN: I changed my mind
JESSICA: I changed my mind
LOGAN: And now?
JESSICA: About what?
LOGAN: About what?
JESSICA: How a Sandman lives. Logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc.
LOGAN: Let's have sex. I thought you were curious.
JESSICA: Not about that.
LOGAN: ( after a beat ) I'm listening.
JESSICA: I'm afraid to tell you.
LOGAN: ( smiling ) I'm not armed. ( a beat ) Why is it wrong to run?
JESSICA: Why is it wrong to run?
LOGAN: You shouldn't even think such things. And you picked a strange person to say them to -
JESSICA: I suppose. But what if you want to live?
LOGAN: So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal. Logan stretches out his right hand. We see a red flower crystal embedded and centered in his right palm. It is exactly the same shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.
LOGAN: When this turns black.that's it. If for any reason you want to be 31. you have the same chance as everyone Logan takes his gun and points it at her. But if you're one of the misfits. that's where I come in. I didn't say that I would run. I Just. Are you a 5 or a 6?
JESSICA: Six. I go red next year.
LOGAN: You're years away . . . I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them. Want to try? Jessica shakes her head. Logan looks at Jessica carefully.in an admiring sexual way.from her toes to her head.briefly noticing ( in the process ) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry that he has taken off the dead runner.around her neck.
LOGAN: What Quad do you live in?
JESSICA: LOGAN ( softly ) You're sure you don't want to try? Jessica nods.
LOGAN: It's nice to know you can nod. Jessica smiles.
LOGAN: It's nice co know you can do that, laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned, hilarious, they crowd around Logan one of them embracing him. In the wild hilarity, Jessica slips away and Logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort after her. Francis notices, laughs. Amid the noise he shouts to These are for me you've got your She must have been something?
FRANCIS: These are for me you've got your She must have been something?
LOGAN: What happened to you? I lost a Runner in Cathedral.
LOGAN: How come?
SANDMAN: Ran into some Cubs I couldn't manage. One of them cut me bad. all the way down.
FRANCIS: ( with anger )
CUBS!: SANDMAN ( shrug ) On my way to the New You for repairs.
LOGAN: Get yourself a new face while you're at it They know you now. They wave. Logan and Francis continue.
LOGAN: I just might look in on New You 483 You? Why? You're already beautiful.
FRANCIS: You? Why? You're already beautiful.
LOGAN: No it's that last Runner someone in 483 was trying to help him.
IDENTIFY: appears on a SCREEN. Francis places his palm into the groove. . . and the words:
CLEAR: appear on the SCREEN.
FRANCIS: See you in the hydrotoner!
PROBABILITY: blinks on and off.on and off.catching Logan's attention. As Logan turns toward the SCREEN.the scanner stops moving. The word PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word:
APPROACH: We can tell from Logan's expression as he walks to the corner. . . that he has never seen this before.
IDENTIFY: Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove. We hear a HUMMING NOISE..then: The piece of jade Jewelry appears on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words appear on the SCREEN:

LIFECLOCKALTER: My Lifeclock. Question: My Life Before the startled Logan can finish.he feels a shock of pain and his hand is immobile. Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it wasn't his. His forehead shines with sweat. Now the entire area, including the chair and the screen begins to glow bright red. The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced to close his eyes. As the glow subsides.Logan looks at his right hand. The red flower crystal in his palm is blinking. He stares at it, fascinated, Am I still six Red?

LOGAN: ( urgent tone ) Am I still six Red?
FRANCIS: What the hell took you so long?
LOGAN: ( after a beat ) Did you ever see anybody renew?
FRANCIS: I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid Did you?
LOGAN: Did you?
FRANCIS: Of course.
LOGAN: Anybody we know?
FRANCIS: Look..why don't you get into the water..you need it..more than I do.
LOGAN: ( after a beat ) I'm fine.. ( walking away ) See you..
FRANCIS: At Carousel tonight? Logan nods, exits. The CAMERA REMAINS on a slightly puzzled FRANCIS for a moment then FOLLOW Logan out to:
LOGAN: ( into box ) Location.female Green Six. name Jessica.living in Quad K.
LOGAN: She has. Jessica half turns and shrugs a 'see?'. The young Sandman's smile widens, he waves to Logan and shoves off.
JESSICA: You could have called me yourself.
LOGAN: But I wasn't sure you'd come.
JESSICA: ( the game has started ) Here I am. ( beat ) Shall I come in? Logan gestures, leading her inside to the living area.
LOGAN: I couldn't get you out of my mind.
JESSICA: I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
LOGAN: Thanks.but I have the choice.
JESSICA: Thanks.but I have the choice.
LOGAN: Of course.
JESSICA: Then it's still no. Logan laughs.
JESSICA: You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
LOGAN: You know
JESSICA: I don't believe you. There has to be more.
LOGAN: All right. Logan extends his right hand. He turns his right palm so that. Jessica can see it blinking red. Jessica gasps for a moment.then:
JESSICA: Why show me?
LOGAN: I'm going to run. Why tell me?
LOGAN: You know something.
JESSICA: About running, dying what?
LOGAN: Both.running's what I'm interested I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
JESSICA: I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
LOGAN: It's different now. Help me.
JESSICA: How can I? Logan takes out the ankh.
JESSICA: Where did you get that?
LOGAN: A Runner gave it to me.
JESSICA: And then you killed him, right?
LOGAN: I let him go.believe me.
JESSICA: I don't.. Speak to your friends for me, Jessica. Please? What friends?
JESSICA: Please? What friends?
LOGAN: ( clutching the ankh, looking at Jessica's; then: ) I don't have much time.
JESSICA: I never heard of a Sandman running . . . ever. . . ankh in his pocket; dropping the bombshell ) And I never heard of Sanctuary. Jessica reacts. She is about to speak. . .doesn't.. Logan reaches out and touches her hand.
LOGAN: What can I do to make you believe me? Jessica draws her hand away quickly from his touch. Logan stands and starts out.as Jessica watches him..
SECOND MAN: He's blinking.so what? Sandmen get old, too.
FIRST MAN: But what if he's telling the truth?
THIRD MAN: I say no. It's not worth the risk.
WOMAN: I absolutely agree. He's killed Runners for a decade. He has no feelings.
JESSICA: He was born a Sandman. He had no Neither do we.
WOMAN: Neither do we.
1ST SANDMAN: Thanks, Francis.
1ST SANDMAN: Ah-h you love it. You're afraid you'll miss a really good Run. They all laugh. Francis takes up his watch as the other exits.
89 OUT: 89X1 EXT - RESTAURANT - THREE MEN A WOMAN AND JESSICA Leaning together talking in an undertone
JESSICA: Why Arcade Station?
JESSICA: Right at the station itself?
MAN: No - just there - on the first level. Don't look for us. We'll see you. You don't seem quite sure, Jessica. Can you do it? Will you? Slowly, Jessica nods.
THIRD MAN: JESSICA ( stalling ) Y-yes.if I can find him.
WOMAN: I think you can. Don't you? Jessica faces her squarely, nods. The woman looks deeply into her eyes, relaxes.
WOMAN: I'm sorry. We all are. But he has heard about Sanctuary and that makes him dangerous to all of us. After murmurs of agreement:
SECOND MAN: ( staring at Jessica ) We're counting on you. Jessica exits. They look at each other in dismay.. After a moment, one of the men follows her. They don't trust her.
LOGAN: Are you here to help me?
JESSICA: What do you need? A moment, then Logan moves toward her hungrily, pulling her in to him as the door closes.
JESSICA: What're you going to do?
LOGAN: That's tomorrow.
JESSICA: ( turning away slightly ) I wish I could help you.
LOGAN: ( turning her gently back ) Maybe you'll chink of something.
JESSICA: ( hating herself ) I wish I knew what you think I know. Logan smiles at her, both knowing what's false, but drawn to each other anyhow. They commence walking again.
LOGAN: If you did know, you'd tell me.
JESSICA: Of course If you trusted me, you'd know.
LOGAN: Tell me, Jessica. Behind him the two men move in. The man with the garrote raises his hands. One more step. Logan senses something, half-turns just as we hear a familiar urgent SOUNDthe sound of his transceiver. Behind him the man hesitates, drops his hands. Logan takes the transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side, Jessica with him. Now he bends to read the message and Jessica cranes her head to see too.
1ST SANDMAN: Hey, Logan's got a mean one tonight why don't you But Francis is already at the door. A wave and he's gone. The others ad lib interest "watch out in therethey can cut you before you see them" etc.
106X1 OUT: 106X2 ARCADE - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA As he speaks he leads her into the maze-car station and punches out his destination on the car caller.
LOGAN: A Runner.Cathedral. A woman.
JESSICA: You're not going, are you?
LOGAN: Have you ever been through Cathedral? Jessica shakes her head.
LOGAN: They're like beasts. Wild.
JESSICA: Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders. Instead of what? Nine months inside a We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
JESSICA: Some people say children need human Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
LOGAN: Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
JESSICA: I'm only telling you what I've heard. Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like.?
LOGAN: I have.
JESSICA: I have.
LOGAN: ( after a beat ) When did you begin to question Lastday?
JESSICA: I don't remember exactly.except I was a Green. What would you like to relive, Logan? Let's see - how long has it been? As Jessica turns her head.looking somewhat guilty, the maze-car slides to a stop. A warning light pulses on the car's console and a RECORDED VOICE speaks before the hatch opens.
VOICE: Attention passengers. Cathedral Station is a personal risk area. Persons with business are warned to be careful.
JESSICA: I've never been in this quadrant. Is that Arcade off there?
LOGAN: Let me go first. Sometimes they're waiting just inside thereto rush you when it opens.
LOGAN: Quickly now He helps her through the narrow openingthe portal's walls are very thick.. They turn abruptly and see:
JESSICA: Muscle? I don't know that one.
LOGAN: It's unauthorized. No good for any- one over thirteen anyhowshakes you to piecesspeeds everything up to a you can see what happens when some flying Cub tries to go through this on musclesplat!
JESSICA: What's your name?
MARY: I'm Mary 2.
JESSICA: Where do you live, Mary?
MARY: Why aren't you in Nursery?
JESSICA: Why aren't you in Nursery?
MARY: I'm very smart.
JESSICA: When do you go up?
MARY: I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady. As soon as she finishes her last sentence, Mary grabs at Jessica's clothing.tearing a pin ( piece of Jewelry ) off.and running away As Jessica instinctively starts after her.Logan. holds her back.
LOGAN: ( shaking his head ) Not here. Might be a decoy. Cautiously, Logan and Jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into-
LOGAN: Silence. Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does, the Runner moves from behind an upright and stands.- The figure is shadowed, the arms out, palms facing in a kind of gesture of surrender. In the Runner's left hand, the tiny red crystal pulses on and off. The Runner is a woman! There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly Jessica gasps, grasping at him.
BILLY: ( speaking of the Runner ) Don't worry about her. We'll have that one later. Right now I think we've got a Runner and his pairup. And what a Runner! The CAMERA PANS the other Cubs.mean, filthy.
A VOICE: We're going to have ourselves a time, we are. Right, Billy?! There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest.
LOGAN: I'm a Sandman!
BILLY: I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him.but I cut him up good, I did. I feel sorry for you, boy! Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader.
BILLY: For me? Better feel sorry for your- self, Sandman!
LOGAN: No, for you! How old are you, Billy? Billy is silent.
LOGAN: Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six What happens when you're sixteen and you go green? Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
LOGAN: No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here. If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
BILLY: Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth! Logan falls back into a fighting crouch.but before he can strike a blow..he is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut his mouth! Let's watch him shake himself to death!!
ANOTHER VOICE: Let him suck Muscle! That'll shut his mouth! Let's watch him shake himself to death!!
A VOICE: Give him some Muscle!!
ANOTHER VOICE: Shake him to death!!
A VOICE: Kill him!
BILLY: We can rush him.we can take can take him again, we can!! The pack hesitates.stops backing away.
LOGAN: ( moving the gun slowly back and forth ) All right! How many of you want this to be Lastday?! The pack moves back again.and disperses, leaving Billy facing Logan alone.
LOGAN: Come on, Billy.come on.you cut a Sandman, didn't you?! Logan tucks the gun back into his waist.
LOGAN: Come on, Billy.cut me.Come on After a beat, Billy turns and runs away. Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the small box from his pocket and turns it.until it starts BEEPING. The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessica.following the SOUND. They move over the rubble.and cautiously around abandoned We HEAR A SCREAM.and HEAR the Cubs who've only obviously found and attacked someone. The SOUND is coming from a different direction than where the beeping is coming from.
LOGAN: ( shaking his head ) They've got someone else! Why would anybody come here? Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly. The BEEPING is now very loud. Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to a door inside and kicks it down. We SEE the Runner. The WOMAN cringing, expecting death.
WOMAN: I'll kill you!! I'll kill you!! After Logan pushes her away.and she falls down: I'm not going to hurt you. Slowly, she rises. Logan takes out the ankh.
LOGAN: Sanctuary? Anything? Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round object.the size of a large marble.
LOGAN: If they find you throw this hard enough to break it. Then hold your breath till you get away.It's blind gas. Her reaction is blank, then, with desperate ferocity she attacks Logan again. During the course of the struggle, Logan subdues her again. Jessica enters, bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds her. Eyeing him, the woman stands and takes the small round object.she appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move 132 EXT. - THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ABANDONED BUILDING - MED. ANGLE - FRANCIS WATCHING He is shocked, unbelieving.
SECOND MAN: I almost believed her. They move off soundlessly. Behind them, a maze-car has arrived.
JESSICA: I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
LOGAN: Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
JESSICA: Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you. All right. But why? I didn't kill the Yes, but they won't know that.or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, That's nothing.there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them. I - I can't.
LOGAN: Then - why don't you leave me - go to them - explain
JESSICA: No. Not that either. Logan considers her. A long BEAT. Thinking, then:
LOGAN: All right. New You 483. I'll find out myself.
IDENTIFY: appears on a SCREEN Francis pauses a moment and places his palm into the groove. Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them on the scanning table. An ALARM SOUNDS and the word:
REJECT: flashes on and off on the SCREEN. Sandmen come running into the Area.
SANDMAN: What happened?! Francis hesitates..then..quickly, as if changing his mind, taking the items off the table:
FRANCIS: Can you beat it..I've got the damn wrong bag.
SANDMAN: You ought to put yourself on reliefcall, 140 EXT. - NEW YOU #483 - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA as they enter NEW YOU #483 they are being watched by:
RECEPTIONIST: Hello, Sandman.
LOGAN: Do you want to see Doc? Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching.
RECEPTIONIST: Do you want to see Doc? Logan nods, impatient - he knows someone's watching.
RECEPTIONIST: We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here. A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor? I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd Like him to give your face to somebody else.
LOGAN: It's all right with me. Is he here?
RECEPTIONIST: My name's Holly.Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
LOGAN: No - Look, I'm in a hurry.
HOLLY: Doc'll be with you soon, Sandman. Logan and Jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and sit down next to an attractive WOMAN.
WOMAN CUSTOMER: Is this your first time? Logan and Jessica nod. This is my third. . I did it when I turned yellow . and green. I turned red yesterday. Beautiful work. This man do them all?
WOMAN CUSTOMER: No. But I hear he's terrific. Have you seen any of his work?
LOGAN: Just one.
HOLLY: Doc's ready, Sandman.
DOC: It's a real privilege, Sandman.
LOGAN: ( slightest beat ) I thought you'd be older. I ex- pected a Red. the flower crystal is Red ) I am.
LOGAN: Your own work? And I did it myself right on there.
DOC: I designed it myself. What'll it be .a face job or a full-body job?
LOGAN: Just the face.
DOC: Fine..Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me. Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic. As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms:
DOC: Holly works here because she gets a lift out of watching the Table. and other things. I'll be back in a He's going to sterilize himself.
HOLLY: He's going to sterilize himself.
LOGAN: Do I have to undress?
HOLLY: Not for your face. Logan follows Holly to the Table. ( Jessica remains behind with Doc who speaks to her with soft urgency ).
DOC: You shouldn't have brought him here.
JESSICA;: I didn't bring him what's the difference. He's blinking. He wants to run.
DOC: Run!? He's a Sandman.
JESSICA: I tell you he's running. I know.
DOC: Maybe.Maybe. But I wish he'd gone somewhere else. All right. He gets a face.
HOLLY: ( leaning - close to Logan ) I like dark hair. Have him give you dark hair.
DOC'S VOICE: All set?
HOLLY: Um huh. Would you take a picture of him, Doc? I'd like you to give his face to somebody else.
DOC: Why not? Doc pushes a button.there is a tiny FLASH.
DOC: Do you have anything special in mind?
LOGAN: I don't care.Just get it over Dark hair.
LOGAN: Holly'd like dark hair.
DOC: Holly'd like a lot of things. We can start by narrowing the next to Doc, is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUM.as a pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster and extend toward Logan, forming inner cones as they approach. CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces and shoulders slowly.the visible cold streaming off the points. A vibrobeam begins to KEEN. SOUND: An insistent chiming. Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's been called to the phone too many times. He turns to a phone-like apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. The table and the laser heads stop moving.
DOC: ( as if speaking on a phone ) ( listening ) ( listening ) Yes, they are. ( listening; his expression changing ) Doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at Logan, then up at the brightly smiling Holly. Something in his look registers, and Holly's smile fades. Now Doc engages the machine Pay attention, Sandman. I'm proud of this machine. As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position near Logan's face. It pauses as
DOC: Pay attention, Sandman. I'm proud of this machine. As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position near Logan's face. It pauses as
DOC: With this one there's no waiting for scar burnishing. It's all in one.watch now. The laser arm sweeps across Logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a bright trail of blood as
DOC: But here's the improvement. Instant healing-before you feel a thing. Watch now. Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track, spraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is moist and whole.
DOC: Perfect depth adjustment on this one, Sandman. The beam will cut through that uniform and just exactly through the skin beneath absolute precision. Watch now
DOC: Of course, it doesn't mend uniforms, Sandman, but otherwise it does everything, doesn't it? Just imagine what would happen to you if the healing stopped functioning.
HOLLY: No! You're scrambling the table. He'll be cut to pieces, Doc.
DOC: Damn right! It was a trap. They No - I'm Running! Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY. Jessica tries to turn the machine off.Doc starts to wrestle with her as:
LOGAN: No - I'm Running! Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY. Jessica tries to turn the machine off.Doc starts to wrestle with her as:
HOLLY: Watching two stun beams lower. Doc knocks Jessica down. She is groggy on the floor as The stun beams lance into Logan's cheeks. The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee.
157X3 LOGAN: Making an effort to stop the machine, pulling levers and pushing buttons in vain. He sees what's happening, pulls Jessica away from Holly and, grabbing up his gun and tunic, heads for the entrance. Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of:
LOGAN: It has nothing to do with you.
FRANCIS: ( choking but still loyal ) What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go? ( up a notch ) I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!! Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention. Instantly Logan jumps him, grabs and throws him sprawling. Without a look back, he and Jessica run out.
JESSICA: Follow me, Logan. Stay close. As they run into Hallucimill.Francis.never too far behind. spots them and follows.
WANTON: I have an empty one, Sandman Logan tries to pull away, looks around for Jessica just in time to see a man almost carrying her off. Then the light is gone again and Jessica with it.
LOGAN: Are you taking me to them?
JESSICA: ( beat ) I don't know what else to do with him following us. ( she hesitates ) Why do you keep running from your
LOGAN: Because he's my friend - and I don't want to be killed by him - or anyone.
JESSICA: He's good, isn't he?
LOGAN: Will he find us and kill us? Yes.or one of the others. You know there's only one place to go now. They won't believe us.
LOGAN: ( beat ) I'd rather take my chances with them.than with Francis.
JESSICA: They won¹t listen.
JESSICA: We'll convince them. They pause. He puts his hand over hers. Jessica is silent. Then she turns his hand over. The crystal blinks red on, off.
JESSICA: Yes, Logan. I'm glad they didn't change your continue down into the darkness.
187X1 FRANCIS: they went through somehow. Hands claw at him - he brushes them away as he searches.
VOICE: Hold still, Sandman, or die where you are.
2ND VOICE: Is she the one?
LOGAN: I'm a runner. She brought me here because I begged her to help me. He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in the At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument.
VOICE: He's lying. No Sandman ever ran.
2ND VOICE: You don't run. You kill runners. You have killed runners all your life. -
LOGAN: Yes I have. Now it's my turn. And I want to Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly: What's the matter with you. He's a runner he's blinking. We must help anyone who asks.we must-or we're the same as they aredeciding who lives and dies. One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce burn. She shrieksa tiny soundand is silent.
HOLLY: Holly. Holly, New You 483. He's dead. Doc's dead and the Sandmen came. HollyHolly. Remember the code. The code, please Holly. They smashed everything and I barely got away. Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7. Holly. Holly. She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightenedthe bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall. She reacts with fear at the sight.
HOLLY: It's him! The first Sandman. He No, Hollywait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
JESSICA: No, Hollywait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
JESSICA: Holly. Holly! Please.The other Sandman. Remember the one who came Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid. That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning! .and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him. Yes. Oh yes. He was after you. I remember. You're 207-208 OUT 208X1 ANOTHER ANGLE 1 The spear points are withdrawn. Logan and Jessica relieved but shaken, wary.
LOGAN: May we move? A long beat. Then
VOICE: I saw we pass them through. Somebody help Holly. Other VOICES mumble agreement. Holly moves off into the dark room, hands reaching out to help her.
VOICE: You two. Just go straight ahead. Follow the corridors with the pipes overhead to the end. Then use the key. As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow around the perimeter, we see we're in some kind of large underground chambersome part of the vast undercellars of the city. The light is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the room, reds and greens bothbut all are silhouetted, no face seen. There's a kind of aisle open down the room's center and it's obviously the way they are to go. Logan and Jessica move off. Logan I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
LOGAN: I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
VOICE: It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
LOGAN: I Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there.? A murmur of discussion then:
VOICE: Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how Co go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
LOGAN: ( a deep breath ) No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back. ( suddenly his tone is urgent as he speaks to her ) Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica. She is bewildered by the change.
JESSICA: Why?- No.no.I'm going with you.
VOICE1: Only to the lock. After that there's no way back. I don't care. I'm going to Sanctuary. With you. A BABBLE of VOICES. "Impossible".She ignores, watches Logan.
LOGAN: Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
LOGAN: Come on thenthey'll be here any Uncomprehending, she starts to run with him. Too late. An EXPLOSION shakes the chamberthe wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen, led by Francis, burst into the room, firing as they come.
209X2 LOGAN: Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down again into the shadow. Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his crystal can be seen from the room.
FRANCIS: ( believing the blinking crystal is Jessica's ) Logan. I know you're in here. What've you done.gone crazy over a ( whispering ) Nobody knows except me. You know I won't say anything. I should have turned you in but I couldn't. Leave her. Come on out with me. It'll look like you're part of the group that hit this nest. ( pleading ) Logan.you're a Sandman! ( slightest beat ) After the slightest beat, Logan FIRES and Francis falls, a great chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan all vision obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue.
VOICE: Runner, this is the last gate. Use your key now. When the Bell sounds again.use your key. Good luck, Runner. May you find Sanctuary. SILENCE. Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center of the wheel where there's a kind of keyhole. The WHIRRING continues for about ten seconds. Then it stops and the light goes out.
LOGAN: Wait - I have the one I took from the Runner. SOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the Runner's ankh. Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again.and the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel. As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything. In the distance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching. As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more.Logan pushes the ankh into the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted center becomes brighter as the door opens. There is a hesitation.in which Logan turning his head back. realizes what he has done and is shaken. As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:
JESSICA: There's no turning back, is there? Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door. following her. as the door closes and they are:
JESSICA: How do we know this is the right It's the only way.
LOGAN: It's the only way.
JESSICA: What do you suppose this was.?
LOGAN: Some kind of breeding pens.I suppose.They say people used to breed animal s, fish, anything To eat, of course.
JESSICA: ( shudders ) To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
JESSICA: It's Francis, isn't it? He nods.
LOGAN: It's brighter there.besides, we can't go back. He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back.
JESSICA: He halts.
LOGAN: It doesn't make any difference anymore.
JESSICA: You're really one of us now, aren't you?
LOGAN: You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you? Why did you stay with me? I wanted to. .And you.what made you kill Sandmen?
LOGAN: I had to. I did kill.for the first time in my life I killed.
JESSICA: Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
LOGAN: I guess so.I know I felt something I never felt before.and I didn't like it.not a bit. I'll tell you one thing.Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
JESSICA: For us. Logan mouths "Us".a strange word.and why not. in the last minutes he has done strange things.
VOICE: Overwhelming, isn't it? Logan and Jessica turn and see:
BOX: Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken? I'm neither machine nor man.but a perfect fusion of the two.and better than either. No human sculptor could match this greatness.don't you agree?
LOGAN: All right - what are you?
JESSICA: It's incredibly beautiful.
BOX: Ah, but wait for the winds. Then my birds sing. My walrus breathes. My palace chimes and bells. And the deep grottoes whisper my name.Box We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
BOX: Anything to eat? Box starts to laugh.He is roaring with laughter as: We're human and we're hungry. I know.I know.
LOGAN: This place is a link to Sanctuary, isn't it? Box looks totally confused. How do you think we got here??!!
BOX: You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember? Logan contains his anger. Where do you think we came from?
BOX: From? From? From?
LOGAN: We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
LOGAN: Where do we go?! Where do we go from here??!! We hear a NOISE outside.
BOX: Is that the wind? Not yet. You must hear my birds sing.
LOGAN: You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
BOX: Never a pair. I have never had a Where do you send them?
LOGAN: Where do you send them?
BOX: You're a beautiful pair.
JESSICA: I've never seen humans whom I thought worthy of being here. I'd like to sculpt you. Where would I put you? I know.you'd be the base of the column. You'd hold up my world! Answer the question!
BOX: I've never seen humans whom I thought worthy of being here. I'd like to sculpt you. Where would I put you? I know.you'd be the base of the column. You'd hold up my world! Answer the question!
BOX: Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years.or thirty thousand years.but thirty thousand thousand years.and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll.Ages. And you'll be here.the two of you. eternally frozen.frozen.beautiful. There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
LOGAN: That's better. How do you want us?
BOX: Nude. Imagine, a pair. It'll be all right.
BOX: Up there. Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal. As they stand there:
LOGAN: How do you want us? Up there. Logan looks at Jessica. Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight. Logan takes Jessica into his arms.
BOX: Enchanting. Is that what humans do? By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to Box.their arms are enveloping one another.with strong feelings.
BOX'S VOICE: 242 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX As his metal hand begins to BUZZ.he brings it to the base of the huge column supporting the cavern. As he works furiously.at Incredible speed:
BOX'S VOICE: Logan and Jessica break. They turn and see:
LOGAN: All right. Now you keep your Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you! We're ready. Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice 250 INT. - ICE ROOM As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica. This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide. It stretches back as far as the eye can see. The ice along the left wall is frosted.but the ice along the right wall is perfectly clear. And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are:
BOX: Regular storage procedure.the same as the other food. The other food stopped coming and they What other food?
LOGAN: What other food?
BOX: Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea. It's all here - ready - fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.And then it stopped coming and they ( gesture ) came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job - protein, plankton, grass from the Logan pulls out his gun.
LOGAN: Tell us how to get out.or I¹ll destroy you..I'll kill you! Box laughs.The same LOUD, ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier. Then: Such a beautiful pair. I'll stand you facing one another.
270X7 ANGLE: The ceiling full of birds loosening, crashing down upon Box. Again and again like great spears and wedges
270X8 BOX: ice crashes down, in the terrible darkness.
JESSICA: Is there something on fire!! Logan shakes his head.he doesn't know. As Logan looks up at the sun.
LOGAN: It seems to be moving away. Come on.
LOGAN: It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving. And yours. They reach the level below and pause, look around.
LOGAN: Jessica we must be outside! She looks at him, uncertainly, he puts an arm around her and they set out again.
OUT: 288 EXT . - FOREST AREA As Logan and Jessica reach it. They are startled by the SOUND of BIRDS SINGING for a moment.then continue through some high grass and thorned bushes being scratched, A swarm of insects attack.Logan and Jessica fight them off: The sun is starting to go down.as they see a rabbit dart away in the grass.startling them for a moment.
288XA1 FRANCIS: unexpected light from the sky, then setting out as Logan and Jessica 288XB1 WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - A BUSHY AREA They come upon bushes of berries. Logan picks a few, looks at them and smells them. As he is about to put them in his mouth.Jesslca grabs hold of his hand.
JESSICA: Sooner or later, we'll have to try Logan eats the berries.as Jessica watches intently. After a beat
LOGAN: Sooner or later, we'll have to try Logan eats the berries.as Jessica watches intently. After a beat
LOGAN: They're good. Logan and Jessica pick berries and eat. When they are finished:
JESSICA: It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
LOGAN: Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these. They sit on the ground.
JESSICA: Where do you think that heat-ball went? Logan shrugs.
JESSICA: Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
LOGAN: I doubt it.
JESSICA: Don't ever let go.
LOGAN: I won't.
LOGAN: It all seemed to make sense until Do you think he was telling the Logan shrugs. Maybe we're the first ones to get Maybe Sanctuary is near, now. another protected place. It couldn't be outside. How would anyone know? Even if we find it we can never go back. At her stricken look.Logan touches her in a caring way.
JESSICA: Do you think he was telling the Logan shrugs. Maybe we're the first ones to get Maybe Sanctuary is near, now. another protected place. It couldn't be outside. How would anyone know? Even if we find it we can never go back. At her stricken look.Logan touches her in a caring way.
LOGAN: You're right.it must be near now. We'll find it. Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
JESSICA: ( Logan turns around ) No.your palm.look!!! Logan looks at his palm.the blinking crystal is clear. He grabs Jessica's hand and looks at her palm. the same. What does it mean?
LOGAN: Of course.
JESSICA: Then the answer's Yes. They embrace there in the water.
LOGAN: I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old. Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad-? Logan shrugs. They turn, start to EXIT from memorial.
LOGAN: They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
JESSICA: "Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
JESSICA: 301X17 LONG SHOT - CAPITOL ( MATTE COMPOSITE ) Logan and Jessica walking up steps toward building.
LOGAN: How old are you?
MAN: As old as I am I suppose.who knows ?
LOGAN: Your hair is white.
MAN: It wasn't always. I remember when it wasn't. But it wasn't your color either. .or yours. I have my color somewhere.
JESSICA: Those cracks in your face.do they hurt?
MAN: Oh, no.
JESSICA: Could I touch them?
MAN: Oh, my.please try. Jessica walks up to the man and touches his face.
JESSICA: What's your name?
MAN: I've forgotten. It's been so long since I've used it.
MAN: But all of my cats have names.
LOGAN: Is that what they're called Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
OLD MAN: Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
JESSICA: But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
OLD MAN: Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three. "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE
DIFFERENT NAMES.": ( a beat ) An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?
LOGAN: How long have you been living For as long as I can remember.
OLD MAN: For as long as I can remember.
LOGAN: What kind of place is this?
OLD MAN: Just a place, I suppose.who The man looks puzzled.
LOGAN: How did you get here?
OLD MAN: I have always been here.
LOGAN: Are there any other humans?
OLD MAN: Have any other people ever passed The man shakes his head.then:
LOGAN: Have any other people ever passed The man shakes his head.then:
OLD MAN: But there may be a few around somewhere.
LOGAN: What makes you think so?
OLD MAN: My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know? Mother and ? You knew your mother and father? The man nods.
JESSICA: And.and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
OLD MAN: Are you sure?
JESSICA: Are you sure?
OLD MAN: Mother and Father said so. you know?
LOGAN: Where are they?
OLD MAN: Dead.they're dead.and buried. Logan wheels.as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING SLIGHTLY.as it opens a bit wider:
OLD MAN: May I see your hand again? Logan and Jessica extend their left hands. The Old Man takes them, looks from one to another with delight.
OLD MAN: They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
LOGAN: NoI'm sorry. It's not possible.
LOGAN: I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
JESSICA: Here you can have this. The man seems pleased.
OLD MAN: What kind of jewel is this?
JESSICA: I don't know.
OLD MAN: You're both full of secrets like Did you steal this?
JESSICA: OLD MAN ( reciting ) "Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
OLD MAN: ( reciting ) "Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
LOGAN: What's beyond this place - do you No, no, no
OLD MAN: No, no, no
LOGAN: Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
OLD MAN: Never, never, ever. Nothing. After a pause:
LOGAN: May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
OLD MAN: Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
JESSICA: What belongs to the people?
OLD MAN: All this. All of it.
JESSICA: What people?
OLD MAN: I don't know.but it does. The man stands.and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining I'll be right back. Oh, yes.about the cats. one rule is true: "Don't speak till you are spoken to."
OLD MAN: I'll be right back. Oh, yes.about the cats. one rule is true: "Don't speak till you are spoken to."
LOGAN: That sweet madman how could he Come to exist?
JESSICA: He had a mother and father and he knew them.
LOGAN: One in a million, I suppose .Who knows? We're going on, aren't we?
LOGAN: ( shaking his head ) There's nothing to go on to, Jessica. Logan continues to shake his head through Jessica's following line:
JESSICA: There's a Sanctuary.there is!
LOGAN: You want there to be one.that There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!! No, there doesn't. Not really just so many want it to exist.so many who don't want to die.want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope. You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!! As Logan takes her in his arms.comforting her:
OLD MAN: Oh, my don't cry. The man proudly shows them the portrait..which is a portrait of himself in his twenties. He sort of brushes the hair.which is rich There are larger pictures of other people over there. I don't know who they are. Perhaps they're family. She man leads Logan across the chamber to a far corner.
LOGAN: That's the same fellow who's outside. If he was so important - why isn't he The old man shakes his head.
FRANCIS: What did you do to him? Jessica is silent. Francis' tone becomes increasingly sexual.
FRANCIS: Why? Why you? Do you know you ruined him? Do you know that? Can you tell me why? Why you? And now you've killed him, you Francis starts to tear off her clothes.obviously to rape.but his expression remains cold and without passion. As she screams, Francis clamps a hand over her mouth and drags her
FRANCIS' VOICE: Logan looks up.and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of the first row of the gallery.with his gun pointing down at Logan, holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm.
LOGAN: Look at your palm, Francis.. look! It's clear. Clear!
FRANCIS: Why did you do that??!!
LOGAN: I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that.. Why did you do that???!!! Francis leaps from the gallery and falls on Logan.
FRANCIS: Logan! You renewed! And he is dead. DIRECT CUT TO:
OLD MAN: Oh, my.he died.
OLD MAN: We¹ll have to bury him.
JESSICA: What¹s that?
OLD MAN: They¹re put into the ground so they can be visited by the living. Logan¹s eyes are glistening with tears. The man starts out.
OLD MAN: I¹ll make the arrangements. At least it¹s over. Jessica¹s words don¹t help as Logan shakes his head.then:
OLD MAN: Are you ready to put him in?
LOGAN: Not yet.
OLD MAN: All right. The man sits down. Gently, Logan lifts Francis¹ body.trying to straighten him out from the slightly twisted position he assumed when he fell to the After resting Francis¹ body on the floor again. He cradles Francis¹ head in his arms.
339X2 JESSICA: quietly watching:
OLD MAN: Of course.that's settled then. But just you remember your promise.
JESSICA: We'll remember. But that's a long time She sees Logan awake and listening, crosses to him, smiling. Logan rises to her.
LOGAN: What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
JESSICA: He asked if we would bury him when his time comes. We can't. We're going back.
JESSICA: To what?
LOGAN: I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
LOGAN: Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
JESSICA: Things won't change.you know that! We can live here together, Logan. have a life as long as his. together! Things change!
JESSICA: You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever.!!!! Logan shakes Jessica who is becoming hysterical. Jessica.listen to me.listen to me. The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that.I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want. Logan puts his arms around her.
JESSICA: I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want. Logan puts his arms around her.
LOGAN: I know.I know. The Old Man comes to them, wondering.
LOGAN: We're leaving.
OLD MAN: What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
JESSICA: Come with us.
OLD MAN: Where are you going?
LOGAN: To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
OLD MAN: Logan nods.
OLD MAN: Thousands and thousands.as many as my cats?
LOGAN: More.many more.
OLD MAN: And all alive you say? Logan nods.
OLD MAN: Yes, I would like to see that. Is it a long journey? Again, Logan nods. Thousands and thousands alive. oh, my.
LOGAN: I promise. We '11 go on as soon as it's light. But now I'm tired. Let's go back to the fire. They turn, the Old Man still marveling at the sight.
OLD MAN: That's better than gold when it's cold.
LOGAN: Thank you. Tell me - what do those words mean? "Beloved husband².²Beloved son". "Beloved wife"'.
OLD MAN: My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used - to stay together.
LOGAN: Stay? They lived together all their years?
OLD MAN: Oh, yes.I think. ³Beloved son². So people stayed together for that feeling of love. They would live and raise children together and be remembered. I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way? Yes. You and I, Jessica.
JESSICA: And Sanctuary?
LOGAN: Sanctuary is the right to live.. nothing more. But nothing less, either.. There is a long beat.then Jessica snuggles up to Logan.she is ready for sleep. Beloved husband. Beloved wife.
361X2 OUT: 361X3 EXT. - DAY - GREENBELT AREA - LOGAN, JESSICA AND 361X4 OUT 361X5 EXT. - WOODED AREA - NIGHT - LOGAN, JESSICA AND THE OLD MAN The Old Man marvels at what he sees.they walk on.
JESSICA: What does that water do?
LOGAN: It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
JESSICA: Is it inside the city?
LOGAN: Of course. I don't know where. I Just took them for granted. It's our only chance. The CAMERA PANS LOGAN, JESSICA and the OLD MAN down the STRANGE STEPPED CONSTRUCTION until they reach:
LOGAN: I'm sorry.
OLD MAN: Can you make it back?
LOGAN: Can you make it back?
OLD MAN: Oh my.I'll try. Oh, my. The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and 367 THE OLD MAN he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment.like a young child at a pond or lake.
OLD MAN: Oh, my. The Old Man watches Logan and Jessica dive into the POOL and 367 THE OLD MAN he bends and plays with the water in the POOL for a moment.like a young child at a pond or lake.
LOGAN'S VOICE: No!! Don't go in there !! The CROWD turns and looks up at:
369X2 LOGAN: On a high balcony in the Great Hall. Looking down at them.
LOGAN: You don't have to die!! No one has to die at thirty!!! You don't have to blink out on Lastday. There's no renewal on Carrousel! You can live longer and grow old. I've seen it. She's seen it!! Believe me!! There is an angry murmur in the CROWD as Logan continues: See. it's' clear. The Lifeclocks are a lie - Carousel is a lie!!
PROBABILITY: Logan is dragged in by a number of SANDMEN. We see Jessica , too, still groggy, being held by SANDMEN in the b.g. of the SHOT. Logan is placed on the chair in which his CRYSTAL was altered.
410X2 SANDMEN: Rushing in from the Ready Room to join the others who have closed in on Logan One holding Jessica.
410X6 SANDMEN: The battle is lost the smoke and noise overwhelming. They pick up their wounded and get out as best they can.
410X12 CAROUSEL: As people run in there, the red crystal glowing and sputtering, the petals moving spasmodically. As people look, the white crystal comes on, begins spinning wildly, bursting into strange, lancing lights. A great roaring commences and the whole arena starts to rock with the crystals. Now the white crystal explodes and the whole room is crisscrossed with deadly arcing discharges. People flee the scene of 410X13 GREAT HALL The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.
410X14 ARCADE: People are stampeding like cattle, all heading down and for the exits, trampling each other in their fright.
