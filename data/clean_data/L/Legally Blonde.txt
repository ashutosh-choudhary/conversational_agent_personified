LEGALLY BLONDE: Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith
ELLE: ( into the phone ) I love you, too!
SERENA: Jeremy, enough! I am not going to formal with you.
MARGOT: Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
. SERENA: Helloo.he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
MARGOT: Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
ELLE: ( excited ) You think?
SERENA: I can't believe you're getting engaged!
ELLE: C'mon · you have to help me pick out the perfect outfit.
AMY: I don't really know anyone.
ELLE: ( teasing ) That's because you spend too much time in the library. Come with me. ( to Serena and Margot ) I'll meet you outside.
BRANDON: It was classic. Jason hit with wood all And we never ran out of balls
GRANT: And we never ran out of balls
ELLE: Too demure?
MARGOT: I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
ELLE: Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming. . .
SERENA: I don't understand why you're completely disregarding your signature color.
ELLE: He's proposing! I can't look like I would on any date. This is the date. The night I'll always remember. I want to look special. Bridal . . . but not like I suspect anything.
SALESWOMAN: ( sot.to ) There ' s nothing I love more than a dumb blonde with daddy's plastic.
. SERENA: I can't wait to see you wearing The Rock!
ELLE: Wh at if you know it's not the Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year it's not like he's trying to impress you.
MARGOT: Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year it's not like he's trying to impress you.
SERENA: Elle, you've heard the man pass gas in his sleep. That practically means you're pre-engaged. '"
SALESWOMAN: Did you see this one? We just got it in
ELLE: Is this a low-viscosity rayon?
SALESWOMAN: Uh, yes of course.
ELLE: With half-loop top-stitching on the hem?
SALESWOMAN: ( smiling a lie ) Absolutely. It's one of a kind.
ELLE: It's impossible to use a half-loop topstitch on low-viscosity rayon. It would snag the fabric. And you didn't just get this in, because I remember it from the June Vogue a year ago, so if you're trying to sell it to me at full price, you picked the wrong girl.
MARGOT: ( to the saleswoman ) Nice try.
ELLE: ( dramatically ) Girls, this is it. In a few hours, I'll be the future Mrs. Warner Huntington III.
AMY: ( whispering ) He's here! You're beautiful.
WARNER: You're beautiful.
ELLE: So are you!
WARNER: ( nervous ) You ready?
ELLE: I am so ready.
ELLE: Here' s to ~ us.
WARNER: The reason I wanted to come here tonight was to discuss our future.
ELLE: I ' m fully amenable to that discussion.
WARNER: I mean, we're having a lot of fun now but things are gonna be different when I ' m at Harvard Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
ELLE: Of course.
WARNER: My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I .plan on running for office some day.
ELLE: And I fully support that.
ELLE: I completely agree.
WARNER: T hat 's why I think it's time for us to
ELLE: Elle starts to flush, completely caught off guard.
WARNER: I ' m sorry, Elle, I just
ELLE: You're breaking up with me?! I thought you were proposing.
WARNER: Proposing?! Elle, If I ' m going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn.
ELLE: ( stunned ) You're breaking up with me because I ' m too blonde?
WARNER: T hat' s not entirely
ELLE: Then what? My boobs are too big?
ELLE: So when you said you'd always love me, you were just "dicking around"?
WARNER: I do love you, Elle. I just can't marry you. You have no idea the pressure I ' m under. My family has five generations of senators. My brother is in the top three at Yale Law. He · just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for crissakes.
WARNER: C'mon. Let me take you home.
ELLE: Elle it's twenty miles back to campus.
WARNER: Elle it's twenty miles back to campus.
WARNER: Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
ELLE: How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
ELLE: So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me? Everybody likes me!
WARNER: East coast people are different.
ELLE: Just because I ' m not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I ' m white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderb ilt
WARNER: I told you, Elle. I need someone I ' m seriously in love with you Isn't that enough? He looks away.
ELLE: I ' m seriously in love with you Isn't that enough? He looks away.
WARNER: I ' m sorry.
1L: 10 10
MARGOT: Why are you back so soon?
MARGOT: Where's the Rock?
SERENA: Where's the Rock?
ELLE: He broke up with me!
SERENA: Is it a Kappa?
MARGOT: It's not a Theta
ELLE: No it's just not me. I ' m canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
ELLE: Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
SERENA: What happened?
MARGOT: S e r i o u s ? ! Who the hell does he think he i s ? Y o u ' r e the most popu l a r month on the U S C calendar!
ELLE: I just don ' t underst a n d what went wrong
ELLE: Last month on his birthday. And she liked me! She said I looked like Britney Spears. Why would you say that to someone you didn't like?
SERENA: How could this happen?
ELLE: I don't know! I don't know anything any I just need to be by myself.
SERENA: Are you sure?
MARGOT: We still love you. Sisters forever!
ELLE: ( sniffling ) Thank you. I love you, too.
MARGOT: Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I ' m serious enough? .
SERENA: Helloo. you let him have anal sex with Helloo. you let him videotape you diddling yourself. ·
MARGOT: You're right. Phew!
AMY: ANOTHER SISTER passes.
ELLE: I just love him so much! I loved him the first moment I saw him. He's beautiful and smart and someone I totally respect. And I did everything I could to make him love me, but it wasn't enough. Now what am I supposed to do? I planned my whole future around him. My life was going to be all about Warner. Now what's it going to be about?
ELLE: ( teary )
MARGOT: Honey, stop! You have to leave this room it's been a week.
ELLE: S erena sits down on the edge of the bed, trying to psyche Elle up.
SERENA: What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what? .
MARGOT: ( CONTINUED )
SERENA: No the thing after that,
SERENA: It was awful. We all thought she'd be the first to walk down the aisle and now she's totally adrift. Oh, my God! .
ELLE: Oh, my God! .
OLD LADY: It's Warner's older brother!
ELLE: It's Warner's older brother!
OLD LADY: Elle continues, undaunted.
EL LE: He just got engaged to this this very unfortunate-looking girl. "Third year Yale Law student Putnam Bowes Huntington III and his fiance Layne Walker Vanderbilt, first year Yale Law."
OLD LADY: Butt ugly?
ELLE: No a law student.
SERENA: ( turning back to her nail She'll never get him back with those
ADVISOR: ( flummoxed ) Harvard Law School?
ELLE: That's right.
ADVISOR: But it's a top three school
ELLE: ( offended ) I have a 4.0.
ADVISOR: Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
ELLE: I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I' m going to.
ADVISOR: Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
ELLE: ( confident ) I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me I can handle
MARGOT: What are you doing?!
ELLE: Reading about the LSATs.
SERENA: ( in a horrified whisper ) My cousin had them. Apparently you get a really bad rash on your
ELLE: The LSATs are an exam.
· SERENA: What, like on va-kay?
MARGOT: Let's all go! Road trip!
. SERENA: Wait Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!
ELLE: No I ' m going to law school at Harvard.
MARGOT: I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
SERENA: I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
ELLE: Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
MARGOT: But isn't it kind of hard to get into law I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
ELLE: I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
MARGOT: Here. You're gonna need this.
ELLE: Your scrunchie?
MARGOT: My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass
MARGOT: ( duh ) Yeah, luckily.
ELLE: ( to the camera ) My name is Elle Woods and for my admissions essay, I ' d like to tell all of you at Harvard why I ' m going to make an amazing lawyer.
ELLE: ( to the camera ) I ' m able to recall hundreds of important details at the drop of a hat.
MARGOT: ( badly acting ) Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
ELLE: Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been . brainwashed by the evil Stefano
ELLE: ( to the camera ) And the laws and bi-laws of civil obedience are crucial to my life
ELLE: I feel confident using legal jargon in daily life.
ELLE: ( to the camera ) I've seen every episode of "The Practice" and I ' m even on speaking terms with Dylan
SERENA: There he is!
. MARGOT: Pull up next to him!
ELLE: Dylan! We love you!
SERENA: ( convinced )
AMY: It's here!
ELLE: One seventy-five.one seventy- five.
ELLE: ( on TV ) And that's why you should vote for me. Elle Woods. Future lawyer. For the Class of 2003.
DANIEL: ( frowning ) Law school? It's a perfectly respectable place.
ELLE: It's a perfectly respectable place.
DANIEL: Sweetheart, you don't need law school. Law school is for people who are boring and ugly and Serious. And you, button/ are none of those things.
SAPPHIRE: You were first runner-up in the Miss Hawaiian Tropic contest. Why throw all that away?
ELLE: Because this is what I want. I've worked hard for it. Don't you understand that this is important to me?
SAPPHIRE: Can't you just suck his wiener?
ELLE: We're here!
ARROGANT AARON: Whose knob did she honk to get in here?
ELLE: H a s Warner Huntington checked in yet?
ELLE: W a i t my social events schedule is . mis sin g.
ELLE: You know mixers, formals, beach
FUZZY 2L: ( deadpan ) There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
ELLE: ( wrinkling her nose ) I guess it'll have t o . . .
FUZZY 2L: What the hell.was that?
BALD 2L: ( watching her go ) Malibu Barbie lives.
DORKY DAVID: I have a Masters in Russian Literature, a Ph.D in Biochemistry, and for the last eighteen months, I've been de- worming orphans in Somalia.

INTENSE IVAN: I've got an MBA from Wharton, worked on Wall Street for four years, mushed in three ididarods and I ' ve figured out how to crash the stock market in Sri Lanka if any of you want to get together later.
ELLE: I ' m a Gemini. I have a Bachelors degree from USC, where I was Sigma Chi Sweetheart and president of Delta Gamma, and last year '· I was Homecoming Queen .
ELLE: Wish me luck, Underdog. It's my first class as a serious law student.
ARROGANT AARON: ( seductively ) H l o t e e. . . . . . . el hr.
WARNER: ( stunned )
ELLE: Warner?! Oh my God, I completely forgot you were going here!
WARNER: What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
ELLE: No, silly. I go here.
WARNER: ( still confused ) You go where?
ELLE: Harvard. Law school.
WARNER: v- y
WARNER: Uh sure.
ARROGANT AARON: If you're looking for the best seat, I hear the front row is the place to be.
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: A legal education means you will learn to speak in a new language. You will be taught to achieve insight into the world around you, and to sharply question what you know.
DORKY DAVID: ( confidently )
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: Are you sure?
DORKY DAVID: PROFESSOR STROMWELL
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: ~ Would you be willing to stake your life
DORKY DAVID: I think so.
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: H o w about
DORKY DAVID: ( scared ) I don't know.
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: Well, I recommend knowing before speaking.. The law leaves much room for interpretation but very little for
IVAN: Gordon sued her doctors for malpractice.
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: And what did the dispute entail? Let's call on someone in the hot zone. Elle Woods? Elle looks up, distressed.
ELLE: Uh. I wasn't aware that we had an Sarah Knottingham?
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: ( looking at her chart ) Sarah Knottingham?
SARAH: No, I don't.
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: Would you support my decision to ask her to leave and return to class only when she is prepared?
SARAH: Elle can't believe that this girl would betray her. Having no choice,, she gathers her purse and goes, completely humiliated. Professor Stromwell returns to the matter at
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: Now, Ms. Knottingham, did diversity jurisdiction'exist in this case?
EMMETT: Are you okay?
ELLE: Do they just put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
EMMETT: The professors? Yeah, they tend- to do that. Socratic method.
ELLE: And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
EMMETT: You have Stromwell.
ELLE: ( hopeful ) Did she do that to you, too?
EMMETT: No, but she made me cry once. Not in class I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls or you know, your whatevers .
ELLE: ( stricken ) Neat . · ' , '
EMMETT: Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
ELLE: Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
EMMETT: Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
ELLE: Wow. I ' m glad I met you.
EMMETT: Oh, and getting one of Stromwell's daily quotes right is almost as important as acing the mid-term. But you didn't hear it from me.
WARNER: Elle looks up, pure adoration on her face.
ELLE: Emmett rises and walks off.
EMMETT: Good luck.
ELLE: ( calling after him ) Thanks again for your help!
WARNER: S o uh how was your first class?
ELLE: Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here
· WARNER: ( distracted ) Good. Good.
ELLE: Do anything exciting?
WARNER: ( nervous ) Urn, hey, have you met Sarah?
SARAH: Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
ELLE: ( to Warner; horrified )
WARNER: She 's
ELLE: ( in disbelief ) I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
WARNER: Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
SARAH: Warner told me all about you. You're famous at our Club.
WARNER: I didn't know
ELLE: Excuse me.
SARAH: ( to Warner ) I thought you said she was pretty.
PAULETTE: Bad day?
ELLE: You can't even imagine.
PAULETTE: Elle lets it all out in a rush.
ELLE: I worked really hard to get into law school I blew off Spring Break and Greek Week to study for the LSATs, I completely neglected my Homecoming Queen duties, I hired a Coppola to direct my admissions video all so I could get my boyfriend Warner back and now he's engaged to this awful girl Sarah so it was all for nothing! I wish I ' d never even come to Harvard.
PAULETTE: After you went to all that trouble?
PAULETTE: You're asking the wrong girl. I ' m with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
ELLE: ( horrified ) What'd you do?
PAULETTE: Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
ELLE: ( CONTINUED )
PAUL ETTE: What could I do? He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I ' m a middle-aged high- school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
PAULETTE: So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits? -
ELLE: She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
PAULETTE: Is she as pretty as you?
ELLE: ( embarrassed ) I ' m not pretty I ' m genetically
ELL E: She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate- looking.
PAULETTE: ( hating herself ) . Could I be anymore goddamn spastic? ( beat ) So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the Definitely! I love him!
ELLE: Definitely! I love him!
PAULETTE: If a girl like you can't hold on to her man then there sure as hell isn't any hope for the rest of us. What're you waiting for? Steal the bastard back.
ELLE: When she gets no answer, she write a message on his memo board CLOSE ON "Call me! Love, You Know Who". She leaves the wine bottle and two glasses and goes.
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: I should warn you that in addition to competing against each other for the top grade in this class, you'll also be competing for one of my firm's highly coveted four internship spots next year where you will get to assist on actual cases. Let the bloodbath begin. Now, let's commence with our usual torture
SARAH: This should be amusing.
ELLE: PROFESSOR DONOVAN
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: Why not?
ELLE: I'd rather have a client who's innocent. . Dare to dream, Ms. Woods. Ms.
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: . Dare to dream, Ms. Woods. Ms.
SARAH: Malum prohibitum. Because the client would've committed a regulatory infraction as opposed to a dangerous
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: Yes? Ms. Woods?
ELLE: ' I ' m here to join your study group. And She holds up the muffins as the others look up, frowns all Elle pulls up a chair from another table and holds up a muffin. '
WARNER: ( nervously looking at Sarah ) Elle, what're you doing here?
ELLE: Who's first?
SARAH: Our group is full.
ELLE: Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
CLAIRE: No, it's like a smart people thing. And like Sarah said, we're full.
WARNER: Come on ~ we can make room for one more.
SARAH: We've already assigned the outlines, and everyone has started theirs',
CLAIRE: ( to Warner ) Besides, you wouldn't let the fat guy
WARNER: He tried to watch me take'a shower!
SARAH: The answer is no.
ELLE: Then I guess I'll leave you alone.
ENID: Maybe there's a sorority you could join
ELLE: ( to Enid ) You know, if you'd come to a Rush party, I would've at least been nice to you.
ENID: Before you voted against me and called me a dyke behind my back?
ELLE: I don't use that word. Only mean people use that word. You must've heard it from Sarah. .
MARGOT: ( to Serena ) It's Elle! ( into phone ) Guess what I ' m doing right this second?
ELLE: Power yoga?
MARGOT: Picking out my wedding dress!
ELLE: · What?!
MARGOT: Josh proposed!
ELLE: ( startled ) N o way
SERENA: ( into phone ) ;;po you have The Rock yet?
ELLE: Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
SERENA: Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
ELLE: I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
SERENA: Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell I got bangs!
ELLE: I got bangs!
SERENA: I got bangs!
ELLE: ( hurt and annoyed ) Re a ll y
ELLE: il. . .
SARAH: It's not just any Halloween party. It's a "Come as Your Favorite Defendant" party.
CLAIRE: That-'s genius.
ELLE: ( excited ) No way! Someone at this school is actually having a party?
SARAH: You must've heard us wrong.
CLAIRE: You must've heard us wrong.
SARAH: Sorry. Looks like you'll be staying home ton ig ht. Alone.
ELLE: I can't believe this. Not only do I not have Warner, but I ' m unpopular!
ENID: The English language is all about subliminal domination. Take the word "semester". It's a perfect example of this school's discriminatory preference of semen to ovaries. That's why I ' m petitioning to have next term be referred to as Winter Ovester.
ELLE: Enid, please silicone is so 90's.
ELLE: ( continuing; sarcastic ) Thanks for inviting me, girls. This party is super fun.
SARAH: You're supposed to be dressed as a famous
ELLE: I am. Didn't you hear about the Playboy Bunny who slit her ex- boyfriend's new fiancee's throat with a broken wine glass? It was tragic.
ELLE: Hey, O.J.
WARNER: Wow. You're a walking felony.
ELLE: Thank you. Having fun?
WARNER: ( c h e c k i n g her out ) Now I am.
ELLE: ( flirty ) I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
WARNER: That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
ELLE: Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots . You're not smart enough.
WARNER: ( scoffing ) Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots . You're not smart enough.
ELLE: ( cutting him off ) Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
WARNER: ( covering ) We ll , yeah, but
ELLE: But what? We took the same LSAT, we take th e same classes
WARNER: I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
ELLE: I'11 never be good enough for you, will
I?: When he doesn't answer, she walks back into the house.
ENID: I give her two more weeks.
DORKY DAVID: Two and a half?
SARAH: If she spreads her legs, maybe
ARROGANT AARON: ( adjusting his crotch ) Only if I ' m feeling generous.
CLAIRE: We're betting on how much longer you're going to last.
ELLE: ( stung ) Look around, Elle. Do you actually think you belong here?
SARAH: Look around, Elle. Do you actually think you belong here?
ELLE: ( hurt ) Why wouldn't I?
ENID: Because the rest of us provide some worthwhile value to society?
ARROGANT AARON: Hold on, now every society needs a bimbo. Who are we supposed to sleep with after we get rich?
ELLE: You know what? All of you can just kiss my ass.
ELLE: Don't ask.
EMMETT: Wasn't gonna. -
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: And the purpose of "diminished capacity"
ELLE: To negate mens rea?
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: So you've filed a claim. Now what? Ms. Woods?
ELLE: Don't you also need to have evidence?
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: Everyone now stares at Elle.
'ELLE: Meaning you need reasonable belief that your claim would have, like, evidentiary support?
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: And what kind of evidentiary support does this case require? Let's ask Mr. Harriman, who clearly believes that I might be hungry.
WARNER: . According to Swinney v. Neubert, Swinney,
PROFESSOR DONQVAN: But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor, and in our case, the defendant was a habitual sperm donor, who also happens to be harassing the parents in his quest for
WARNER: But , without this man's sperm the child in question would not exist. Now you're thinking like a lawyer.
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: Now you're thinking like a lawyer.
SARAH: ( sotto ) The idiot speaks.
ELLE: Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: ( bemused ) Why do you ask?
ELLE: Well, unless the defendant attempted to contact every single one-night- stand to determine if a child resulted in those unions then he has no parental claim whatsoever over this child. Why this s p e rm ? Why now? '
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: I believe you've just won your case.
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: You did well today.
ELLE: I did?
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: You're applying for my internship, aren't I don ' t know
ELLE: I don ' t know
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: You should. Do you have a resume?
ELLE: ( excited )
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: It's pink.
ELLE: And engraved. Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it? . See you tomorrow!
EMMETT: I brought you the Windham notes.
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: ( watching Elle go ) You think she just woke up one morning and said, "I think I'll go to law school
EMMETT: Aside from that lapse in judgement she's got potential.
PAULETTE: You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
ELLE: I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard- ass.
ELLE: Yes, you are. Go you can do this. .
DEWEY: ( to Paulette ) What the hell do yon want? We're eating I just
PAULETTE: I just
DEWEY: You just thought you'd come over and show me what I 'm definitely not missing?
DEWEY: How many times you gonna show up here, beggin1 me to take you back? '
ELLE: Dewey Newcomb?
DEWEY: Who's askin'
ELLE: . I ' m Elle Woods. Ms. Bonaf ante's · .
DEWEY: ( confused ) Come again?
ELLE: Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
ELLE: Tell him, Paulette.
ELLE: W e did it! .
PAULETTE: God, that felt great!
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: "An image and a good hook can get you into a room · but something has to keep you in that room."
INTENSE IVAN: Judge Sandra Day 0'Connor?
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: C ose.. . .
ELLE: The class rolls their eyes and laughs, watching Stromwell.
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: Damn. Thought I ' d get everyone on that
ELLE: What's going on?
DORKY DAVID: Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
ELLE: He chose them already? We got it!
SARAH: We got it!
ENID: The competition must not have been that
ARROGANT AARON: Why? ion .got a spot?
ENID: Hey! Watch your hands, Mr.Grabass.
ELLE: ( shocked )
WARNER: You look nice.
ELLE: Thank you.
DONOVAN: There's your office, there's the bathroom, there's the coffee machine. There's Gerard, Dick and1Bobby.
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: We're defending Brooke Windham, whose very wealthy husband was found shot to death in their Beacon Hill mansion.
SARAH: Gold digger?
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: You'd think so, since the stiff was sixty, but she was rich on her own. Some kind of fitness empire. You can buy her exercise tapes on infomercials.
ELLE: Wait a minute are we talking about Brooke Daniels?
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: M a i d e n nameDaniels. You know her?
ELLE: She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything she graduated ,five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: Amazing how?
ELLE: She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
SA RAH: ( correcting him ) His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
ELLE: Maybe she found him like that.
EMMETT: Sorry I ' m late.
WARNER: ( to Donovan ) What about the murder weapon?
ELLE: There's no way Brooke could've done this - - exercise gives you endorphins, endorphins make you happy happy people don't kill their husbands!
PROFESSOR DONOVAN: You don't really believe she's innocent?
ELLE: Of course, I do!
EMMETT: Then we may actually have a case.
DONOVAN: What alibi?
BROOKE: I can't tell you.
BROOKE: I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
DONOVAN: Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
BROOKE: Why would I kill my husband?
DONOVAN: Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
BROOKE: Then show them a picture of his cock. They might put a few things together.
BROOKE: I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
DONOVAN: Were you with another man?
BROOKE: Go to hell.
DONOVAN: I'll take that as a no.
BROOKE: Are we done for today?
DONOVAN: I believe we are. Hey I know you.

BR OOKE: You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
ELLE: Sort of.
BROOKE: Well, thank God one of you has a brain.
ELLE: I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I ' m the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
UPS GUY: Afternoon, ladies.
PAULETTE: It's him!
UPS GUY: I've got a package.
ELLE: ( agreeing ) He's got a package. ·
UPS GUY: How ya doin' today? .
ELLE: So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
PAULETTE: No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
ELLE: Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
PAULETTE: What's the point? Look at me.
ELLE: I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
PAULETTE: Good one.
ELLE: Trust'me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
PAULETTE: Bend.and snap!
ELLE: Good. Now this time, put a little arch in your back and maybe get your footing more
HAIR CLIENT: Like this? .
ELLE: She adjusts her like a yoga instructor would.
ANOTHER CLIENT: Am I doing it right?
ELLE: More snap, less bend.
EVERYONE: And snapping back up on "House" .
MAURICE: Oh, my God! The Bend & Snap! Works every time.
CHUTNEY: I got out of the shower," walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
DONOVAN: Did she have a weapon in her hand?
CHUTNEY: Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
DONOVAN: Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
CHUTNEY: Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
DONOVAN: Was there any evidence that Mrs . Windham shot him?
CHUTNEY: ( duh ) His dead body with a bullet in it. .
DONOVAN: What did you see when you entered the I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
ENRIQUE: I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
DONOVAN: Was she carrying a weapon?
· ENRIQUE: No, she was crying her eyes out.
DONOVAN: So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
ENRIQUE: Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
GERARD: She's screwing the pool boy.
ELLE: There is no way a Delta Gamma would sleep with a man in a shiny shirt. Warner, back me up here.
SARAH: I hate to agree ~ but I don't see the two of them actually doing it.
ENID: Women like that will screw anything.
ELLE: So, because she's beautiful and has a good body, she's easy? What book of feminist theory did you read iiiai in, Enid?
EMMETT: Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
ELLE: My money's on the angry daughter or the Chutney has a trust fund. She didn't need the insurance payoff or the What about her mother?
DONOVAN: Chutney has a trust fund. She didn't need the insurance payoff or the What about her mother?
BOBBY: What about her mother?
DONOVAN: Covered. She was in Aspen at the time. Ten people saw her downing cosmopolitans at the Caribou Club.
ELLE: Al l I know is it's not Brooke.
DONOVAN: That's touching, Elle, but we need an

GUARD: Delta. Gamma.
ELLE: Delta. Gamma.
ELLE: Are you okay? You look so sad.and so
BROOKE: I ' m glad it's you and not Donovan.
BROOKE: He better be, for what I ' m paying him.
ELLE: I brought you some necessities. Pink sheets. Aromatherapy candles. Loofah. And The Bible.
BROOKE: You're an angel.
ELLE: But I have to tell you the real reason I ' m here. Professor Donovan says we really, really need your alibi.
BROOKE: Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
ELLE: Who could better understand than me? It's so shameful.
BROOKE: It's so shameful.
ELLE: Whatever it is it could save you.
BROOKE: That's just it it would ruin me!
ELLE: Brooke composes herself. Takes a deep breath. Looks at Elle.
BROOKE: I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
ELLE: I know! You helped me go from a six to a
BROOKE: On the day of Heyworth's murder, I was
ELLE: ( completely shamed ) I ' m a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I ' d lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
BROOKE: ( completely shamed ) I ' m a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I ' d lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
ELLE: Your secret is safe with me.
DONOVAN: .. We've got two interviews tomorrow that
ELLE: I went to get her alibi.
DONOVAN: Did you get it?
ELLE: But I can't tell you what it is.
DONOVAN: Why the hell not?
' ELLE: I promised her I ' d keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
DONOVAN: Fuck sisterhood. This is a murder trial, not some scandal at the sorority house. I want the alibi.
ELLE: I can't give it to you. All I can tell you is that she's innocent.
ASSISTANT: Mr. Donovan? Mrs. Windham Vandermark is on line two.
DONOVAN: Someone reason with her while I take
BOBBY: Are you crazy? Tell him the alibi.
ELLE: , No!
DICK: We're gonna lose the case if you don't.
ELLE: Then we're not very good lawyers.
WARNER: ( quietly ) If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares.about Brooke? Think about yourself.
ELLE: I gave her my word, Warner.
DONOVAN: The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with the fact that her interview is today. She's at a spa in the Berkshires.
GERARD: A spa? Isn't that like, your Mother-Ship?
ENID: Why you?
GERARD: ( to Enid ) Have you ever been to a spa?
ENID: And subscribe to the doctrine of self- hatred imposed upon my gender by male delusions of the way women are supposed to look?
DONOVAN: Go with her.
ELLE: Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
EMMETT: Uh, for starters, she won'-t give us an al i bi
ELLE: Aside from that.
EMMETT: She's completely untrustworthy.
ELLE: She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping A ) He's an old man with a really big penis. B ) She never told me I was fat. And C ) Victoria Principal sells on that And D ) Brooke is obviously hiding But maybe it's not what you think.

EMMETT: And D ) Brooke is obviously hiding But maybe it's not what you think.
ELLE: But maybe it's not what you think.
EMMETT: Bu t maybe it is .
ELLE: You're kind of being a butt-head right How do you figure?
EMMETT: ( amused ) How do you figure?
ELLE: Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be
EMMETT: I can't believe you called me a butt- head. No one's called me a butt-head since ninth grade.
ELLE: Maybe not to your face.
ELLE: We have two o'clock massages. Kerrigan and Woods.
DESK CLERK: Go on back. .
ELLE: Oh, and my friend Katherine Windham Vandermark is here somewhere and I ' m supposed to meet her. for a Pilates class. Do you have her schedule?
DESK CLERK: ( checking ) She's in the mud room until four.
EMMETT: Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
ELLE: No, she can't move for an hour.
ELLE: Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
EMMETT: We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & So, you found me.
EMMETT: ( sotto ) She's naked.
ELLE: ( to Emmett ) I'll cover her parts.
EMMETT: Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
ELLE: ( interrupting her ) She's not!
EMMETT: Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas . Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
EMMETT: I ' m sure that was very awkward for Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
EMMETT: Why do you say that?
ELLE: ( uneasy ) Ys. . . . Like I said, I've never met Brooke, but I have seen her from a distance. When I ' d come over to pick up the alimony check that Heyworth forgot to mail every month, she'd be out by the pool, with Mr. Hot Pants hovering over her with some pink I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I ' d bet my next check that that ' s where he was about to put it .
EMMETT: MRS . WINDHAM VANDERMARK
EMMETT: How can you still believe she's innocent?
ELLE: You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
EMMETT: And you know this for a fact?
' ELLE: Did you see the icky black color of her I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I ' m starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
EMMETT: I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I ' m starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
ELLE: I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I ' m starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
EMMETT: The what?
ELLE: Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
EMMETT: You're serious?
ELLE: You should see the way I ' m treated in class! I'm a complete source of mockery. This is why the Blonde Legal Defense Fund is needed.
EMMETT: Okay, how would it work?
E LLE: It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it name one blonde intellectual role model.
EMMETT: I can't.
ELLE: That is a direct result of anti- blonde Wait Hilary Clinton.
EMMETT: Wait Hilary Clinton.
ELLE: If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
ELLE: Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take? ·.
EMMETT: That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night but maybe it should.
ELLE: Speaking of that · I bought you some seaweed cream while we were at the spa.
EMMETT: What the hell is that for?
ELLE: The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
EMMETT: I don't Do that stuff.
ELLE: Well, you should . I f you look good, you · feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
EMMETT: Projecting joy is not my job.
ELLE: . ( sighing ) She puts the cream back in her purse. They ride in silence fo r a moment. Then
EMMETT: You really think I ' m attractive?
ELLE: For a butt-head? Yes.
FRESHMAN GIRL: ( cold ) ' I heard. .
DORKY DAVID: I was thinking maybe we could go out Uh, n o . . . you're a dork. turns back to her FRIENDS who all laugh at him. Elle
FRESHMAN GIRL: Uh, n o . . . you're a dork. turns back to her FRIENDS who all laugh at him. Elle
DORKY DAVID: ( hopeful ) I ' m in law school
FRESHMAN GIRL: Look I ' m not going out with you. I can't believe you'd even ask. Girls like me don't go out with losers like you.
ELLE: ( upset ) Why didn't you call me?
DORKY DAVID: We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
ELLE: We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
DORKY DAVID: I uh

ELLE: I believe you! Don't worry.
ELLE: Come in.
SARAH: ( re the depo ) You done with that yet?
ELLE: Take it. I've read it twenty times.
SARAH: I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
ELLE: Too bad you and I are the only ones.
SARAH: I ' m still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
ELLE: It's not my alibi to tell
SARAH: ( interrupting ) I know. I thought that was very classy of you. .
ELLE: ( surprised ) Really? Thanks.
SARAH: y Have you ever noticed that Donovan never
ELLE: Men are helpless. You know that.
SARAH: Warner can't even do his own laundry.
ELLE: I know. He has it sent out.
SARAH: Did you know he got wait-listed when he appli ed? His father had to make a call.
ELLE: ( stunned ) You're kidding!
ELLE: Oh, my God! ' -.
SERENA: We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
MARGOT: ( tempting her ) We have a limo downstairs and lots more of these.
ELLE: You guys I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
SERENA: Where's Warner?
SARAH: ( confused ) At the office ~
MARGOT: Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
ELLE: Bring her, too. C'mon. You can wear one of Elle's T ha t ' s okay

ELLE: ( torn ) I can't believe you guys are actually here but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I
SERENA: Okay. . . Call us if you change your mind.
MARGOT: ( CONTINUED )
ELLE: I'll call you as soon as it's over, okay? Sisters forever?
ELLE: ( continuing ) Sorry about that.
SARAH: Save it.
PAULETTE: Oh my God!
ELLE: ( into phone ) You broke his nose?!
UPS GUY: I 'm okay
PAULETTE: I think he noticed me, Elle But only because I maimed him!
ELLE: ( consoling ) I'll be over right after the trial, okay? We're about to cross- examine Enrique. And don't worry! My friend Serena barfed on a guy during "The Blair Witch Project" and end up dating him for three months.
ENRIQUE: Don't stomp your little Prada sandals at me, Miss Thing.
ELLE: He's gay! Enrique is gay!
EMMETT: She grabs Warner as he's passing.
ELLE: Warner, what kind of shoes do I have on?
WARNER: Pink ones.
ELLE: Donovan frowns, not seeing.
DONOVAN: What are you talking about?
ELLE: He's gay he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
EMMETT: Back up. How do you know he's gay?
ELLE: Gay men know designers. Straight men
BROOKE: What's going on?
ELLE: Enrique's gay. I ' m sure of it.'
BROOKE: He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once
DONOVAN: While I appreciate your masterful legal theory, I have a murder trial to attend
ELLE: Thanks for the backup.
WARNER: How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
DONOVAN: Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an Just the love in my heart.
ENRIQUE: Just the love in my heart.
DONOVAN: If that's all the proof that he has, your Honor, I think I'm done here.
EMMETT: I have a couple of questions, Your Honor?
ENRIQUE: A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
EMMETT: A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
ENRIQUE: A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
EMMETT: And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
EMMETT: And what is your boyfriend's name?
ENRIQUE: The audience lets out a gasp. Elle looks up, shocked, then Enrique begins to sweat.
CHUCK: If I ' m just your friend, why have we been doing the slippy-slap every night for the past six months?
DONOVAN: Good work today, Ms. Woods.
ELLE: Thank you!
PAULETTE: ( in a giddy, rush ) And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
ELLE: ( hugging Paulette ) I ' m so happy for you!
PAULETTE: How'd it go at the trial?
ELLE: Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
PAULETTE: Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
SARAH: Donovan asked to see you before you · ' He's already got his coffee maybe he needs a donut.
ELLE: ( excited ) He's already got his coffee maybe he needs a donut.
SARAH: He's already got his coffee maybe he needs a donut.
DONOVAN: Come on in.
DONOVAN: Sit down.
ELLE: Is everything okay?
DONOVAN: You followed your intuition today and you . were right on target. I should"ve
ELLE: ( stunned ) Thank you.
DONOVAN: Ab ou t the alibi
ELLE: I ' m sorry, but
DONOVAN: ( cutting her off ) I ' m impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it.. That' s what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than ·· . most of the guys I have on my payroll.
ELLE: Wow. That means so much to me to hear you say that. I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
DONOVAN: I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
ELLE: ( still overwhelmed ) Not really. I know how competitive it . ·. a l l is
DONOVAN: You know what competition is really about, don't you?
ELLE: ( upset ) You're hitting on me?
DONOVAN: You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
ELLE: So everything you just said ?
DONOVAN: I ' m a man who knows what I want.
ELLE: And I ' m a law student who's finally realized her professor is a pathetic
DONOVAN: ( calling out ) Too bad. I thought you were a law student who wanted to be a lawyer.
SARAH: You almost had me fooled.
ELLE: Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
SARAH: Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
EMMETT: ( smiling ) He y
ELLE: I'm quitting.
EMMETT: Whoa Why?
ELLE: Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
EMMETT: What're you talking about? You earned
ELLE: I didn't earn anything. I got this internship because Donovan liked the way I looked. Which he made clear .tonight when he tried to feel me up.
EMMETT: ( mind reeling ) So now you're ?
. ELLE: Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty-hose. No more trying to be something I ' m not.
EMMETT: What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.
ELLE: Thanks for not treating me the way everyone else here does. Call me if you're ever in California.
PAULETTE: ( upset ) You can't go home!
ELLE: What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law s chool don't, Warner doesn't I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding mys elf Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass.
PROFESSOR STROMWELL: If you let one stupid prick ruin your life, you're not the girl I thought you
BROOKE: Is he always such an ass?
EMMETT: ( containing himself ) He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
EMMETT: He's an ass that's gonna try.
BROOKE: He thinks I ' m guilty, doesn't he?
EMMETT: That's not what's important.
BROOKE: To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
EMMETT: You're right. Why should you?
DONOVAN: Keep that bitch away from me.
EMMETT: She's our client.
DONOVAN: Not Brooke. Elle.
EMMETT: ( blatantly pissed ) Funny how a woman can turn into a bitch just by saying "no".
DONOVAN: What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
BROOKE: Get up.
DONOVAN: You're fired. I have new representation.
BROOKE: You're fired. I have new representation.
DONOVAN: The door of the courtroom BANGS open and ELLE STRIDES IN, dressed in a Prada mini-dress, Underdog in her purse. She blows a bubble, lets it pop, then sets her briefcase down next to Donovan's.
DONOVAN: She's a law student. She can't defend
DORKY DAVID: Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule .
ELLE: ( to Donovan ) - Counselors, approach the bench.
JUDGE: Counselors, approach the bench.
DONOVAN: You're not going up there.
ELLE: Yes, I am.
BROOKE: ( to Donovan ) I don't think you heard me. You're fired. She's my lawyer.
JUDGE: Counselors, now. All of you.
ELLE: Elle Woods, your honor. Rule 3:03 of the Supreme Judicial Court states that a law · student may appear on behalf of a defendant in criminal proceedings.
DONOVAN: I do. I'm not allowing it.
ELLE: ( pointedly ) But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my
JUDGE: ( reading the casebook ) The ruling also states that you need a licensed attorney to supervise you. Mr. That, I won't agree to.
DONOVAN: That, I won't agree to.
EMMETT: I ' m supervising, Your Honor.
JUDGE: Well, then, Ms. Woods. Proceed.
SERENA: Go, Elle!
DONOVAN: Enjoy prison.
JUDGE: Mrs. Windham, you do realize what you're
BROOKE: As Donovan sits, Margot leans over.
MARGOT: Don't fuck with a Delta Gamma.
SARAH: Kick some butt.
JUDGE: Ms. Woods, call your first witness.
ELLE: I'd like to recall Chutney Windham as a defense witness.
JUDGE: Ms. Woods, begin your questioning.
ELLE: First, your Honor, I ' d like to point out that not only is there no proof in this case, but there's a complete lack of mens rea, which by definition tells us that there is no crime without a vicious will.
ELLE: Okay Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
CHUTNEY: Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower. ' ,
ELLE: And when you came downstairs, what happened?
CHUTNEY: I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
ELLE: But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
CHUTNEY: No, she'd stashed it by then.
EMMETT: Move to strike that from the record, your Honor. Speculation.
JUDGE: Elle mentally kicks herself for not doing this herself. Eirimett gives her a reassuring nod. She takes a deep breath, · then continues on.
ELLE: Did you hear a shot fired?
CHUTNEY: No. I was in the shower.
ELLE: So at some point in the twenty minutes? you were in the shower, your father was shot?
CHUTNEY: I guess.
ELLE: Your father was shot while you were in the shower?
GERARD: Where's she going with this?
EMMETT: Have a little faith.
ELLE: But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
CHUTNEY: ( annoyed ) Yes. I was washing my hair.
ELLE: Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
CHUTNEY: I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
ELLE: Where you got in the shower.
CHUTNEY: ( impatient ) I believe the witness has made it clear that she was in the shower. Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a . . perm before, Miss Windham?
JUDGE: I believe the witness has made it clear that she was in the shower. Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a . . perm before, Miss Windham?
ELLE: Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a . . perm before, Miss Windham?
CHUTNEY: ( confused )
ELLE: How many, would you say?
CHUTNEY: Two a year since I was twelve. You do the You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to ~ curls really weren't the right look for her She didn't have your bone structure.
ELLE: You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to ~ curls really weren't the right look for her She didn't have your bone structure.
ELLE: ( to the judge ) I have a point. I promise.
JUDGE: Then make it.
ELLE: Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed Because they got wet.
CHUTNEY: Because they got wet.
ELLE: That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
CHUTNEY: Elle continues.
ELLE: And wouldn't someone who's had thirty perms ? throughout her lifetime, be well aware of this rule?
CHUTNEY: She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
ELLE: You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your
CHUTNEY: I didn't mean to shoot him ·
ELLE: ( shocked ) Oh, my God!
EMMETT: ( even more shocked ) Oh, my G^d.! !
REPORTER: Elle, how did you know Chutney was lying?
BROOKE: Because she is brilliant.
ELLE: ( humble ) The rules of haircare are simple and finite . Any Cosmo girl would ' ve known .
SAPPHIRE: Oh, my God! What happened to her tan? '
SERENA: I wish we could stay longer, but I have a I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
