ANNOUNCER: Good afternoon and welcome to Soldier Field, Chicago, site of today's confrontation between the L.A. Stallions and the Chicago Bears. This is Vern Lindquist with Terry Bradshaw, and, yes, my friends, it is that cold.
BILLY COLE: sprints onto the field. Cole walks. Straight ahead, eyes front. Like a robot. His HEARTBEAT THUDS on the
POLICE: riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the Cole crosses the goal line. Touchdown. Drops the ball. Turns, facing the cops. His eyes are insane. The crowd is screaming. People are running back and forth like extras in the Keystone Cops. The first TWO BLASTS from the cops' RIOT GUNS go high and wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost. The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice. Cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him. He smiles and says:
COLE: I'm going to Disneyland. Puts the GUN to his helmet. FIRES.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Sprawled across the seat. Half-empty bottle of Seagrams V.O. RADIO on, playing tinny JAZZ music. Picture the tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch self-hating loser you can. Now give him a two-year-old suit from C & R Clothing. Such is the aforementioned HALLENBECK.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk. One tosses a baseball from hand to hand. One picks his
KID #1: Dude's trashed.
KID #2: Shit, we should do something to Kid #3 continues mining for nose eggs. It looks like his entire fist is up there. Pause, then:
KID #3: I know where there's a dead ANOTHER ANGLE - BUNDLE OF PAPER TOWELS - SOME MINUTES The youngest Kid holds it aloft reverently. Looks in the open car window at Hallenbeck. Still snoozing. Dead to the world.
LATER: The youngest Kid holds it aloft reverently. Looks in the open car window at Hallenbeck. Still snoozing. Dead to the world.
KID #1: Do it. They heave the squirrel into the car and run away. A pause. Another pause. The sprinkler goes round. Nothing happens.
ANOTHER ANGLE: chest. A shadow falls across him as
KIDS: KID #2
KID #2: Goddamn. Dude's trashed.
KID #3: Take his bottle. Kid #1 smiles nervously. Reaches in with infinite Trembling hand inches closer and closer And closes on the bottle as, without warning
HALLENBECK: revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it.
HALLENBECK: Hey, motherfucker. The Kid, of course, shrieks. And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes. He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid. Swears under his breath. Watches the boys flee in terror. Notices a dead squirrel in his lap. Scowls. Heaves it out the window. Pumps a Camel into his mouth. Lights it. Rescues the bottle of Seagrams. Thus begins his morning. He opens the car door. The sprinkler douses him. He gets out. Stands on the lawn. One of the Kids, the toughest one, is standing on the I'm not scared. Hallenbeck scowls.
KID #3: I'm not scared. Hallenbeck scowls.
HALLENBECK: You're on my property, kid.
KID #3: Sidewalk belongs to the Hallenbeck stares at him. Smiles weakly.
HALLENBECK: Excuse me. He leans over and vomits on the lawn. One hand gripping the car fender. The sprinkler goes round and round.
BED: Like a sleeping kitten. Rumpled sheets, one breast exposed. No tan line. The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the sleeping girl. Meet Jimmy Dix. Twenty-seven years old, former National League heartthrob. He shakes his head and mutters:
JIMMY'S FACE: Young and proud. Seventy thousand voices tell him he's alive. He makes a difference.
JIMMY: I don't know. He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard stubble. Crows' feet around the eyes.
JIMMY: Yeah. I guess I am. He sniffs, clearing his nose.
HALLENBECK: Hallenbeck Investigations.
HALLENBECK: MALE ( V.O. )
HALLENBECK: Sat in the car. Looked at the sky. Got hammered.
HALLENBECK: I killed a squirrel and don't even That's bad, Joe.
HALLENBECK: Tell me about it. Look, I crawled out of a perfectly good bottle to answer the phone, what the fuck do you want?
HALLENBECK: No pride here. What'cha got?
HALLENBECK: Make her a one on your nose scale. Improve your looks.
HALLENBECK: I was gonna smoke some cigarettes.
HALLENBECK: These are really good cigarettes.
HALLENBECK: ( sighs ) Gimmee the address.
HALLENBECK: Gimmee the address.
HALLENBECK: 'Morning, gorgeous. Gorgeous does not respond: Coy. Very coy. Hallenbeck slides behind the wheel of his Plymouth. KEYS the IGNITION. Phil Woods' SAXOPHONE fills the air. He looks at himself in the mirror.
HALLENBECK: ( softly ) Nobody likes you. Everybody hates you. You're an asshole and you're stupid. You're gonna lose. ( pause ) Smile, you fuck.
JIMMY: 'Morning, boys. They all grunt. One of them, name of HENRY, looks up at him. Holds out a half-smoked doobie:
HENRY: Hey, Jimmy. You want some of No, man. Why do you think they call it dope? Henry, did I do anything last night that I should know about?
JIMMY: No, man. Why do you think they call it dope? Henry, did I do anything last night that I should know about?
HENRY: You puked a couple times. Pointed at some lady's tits. Chased a dog for a half an hour. Fucked a congressman's daughter, shit on someone's car.
JIMMY: No, man, I meant something bad, that I should know about.
HENRY: Mmmm. Nope. My ass hurts, I think I had gay sex last night. I don't remember. When are you gonna come look at my gun collection?
JIMMY: Soon, Henry. One of the other PLAYERS looks up, says:
PLAYER: Are you Jimmy Dix? Played for the '86 and '87, that was me.
JIMMY: '86 and '87, that was me.
PLAYER: Hell, I think the league gave you a raw deal.
JIMMY: Thanks. What the hell, shit floats. I'll be back.
PLAYER: I hope so.
JIMMY: I'll be back. Everyone plays cards. No one looks at him. He frowns. INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER on shoes. He hears a COMMOTION outside: A woman scream- ing. Water splashing. He frowns, puzzled. Gets up. Pads out onto a redwood deck.
JIMMY: Ho. Ray. The MAN looks up, annoyed.
JIMMY: What's with the girl? She surfaces, sputtering and screaming. Ray thrusts her beneath the surface again.
RAY: Bitch won't blow me.
JIMMY: ( pause, then ) Too early in the morning, Ray. Let her go.
RAY: Fuck you. She's not coming up till she starts blowing. Jimmy swallows hard. Says:
JIMMY: Ray. Let her go.
RAY: Fuck you, loser. What are you doing at a league party, asshole? You and ol' Dex Manley should get together, swap stories about gettin' booted. Jimmy controls himself with an effort.
JIMMY: Ray, she's gonna drown.
RAY: Not if she blows me. Jimmy's eyes are smoldering. He steps to the right. Casually scoops up a football lying on the deck.
JIMMY: Last chance, Ray.
RAY: Go spit.
JIMMY: Jimmy turns, as if to walk away. Instead, he spins back and launches the football. It sings, that's how hard he throws it. And when it smacks Ray in the face, something breaks. It ain't the The big man howls. Clutching his flattened nose. The girl comes up for air. Gagging and choking. Jimmy is at her side instantly. Pulls her out of the She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair. The guy is bleeding. Delirious. Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart.
JIMMY: Get out of here. Go. She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair. The guy is bleeding. Delirious. Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart.
JIMMY: Best arm in the National League, you son of a bitch. Remember that. He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious. The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside.
NEIGHBOR: 'Morning, Joe, how's it going?
HALLENBECK: My ears are burning, Andy. Even as we speak, someone, somewhere is calling me an asshole.
NEIGHBOR: You're funny.
HALLENBECK: I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th.
SARAH: I thought you were in Las Vegas.
HALLENBECK: I was.
SARAH: Where did you sleep?
HALLENBECK: He brushes past her and crosses to the bed. On the pillow, a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly.
HALLENBECK: Hey, Furry Tom. He sits on the bed. Lights a cigarette. Opens the night stand and removes a speedloader for his .38. Starts to load the gun.
SARAH: How much did you lose?
HALLENBECK: I wasn't there to gamble. I was doing a skip trace.
SARAH: How much did you lose?
HALLENBECK: Fifty bucks. He suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand. A crayon sketch. He picks it up, frowns:
HALLENBECK: What's this?
SARAH: Darian's class drew holiday pictures. That was hers. Her teacher wants to see us, Joe.
HALLENBECK: Satan Claus. Kid's got some talent, don't you think?
SARAH: It's hideous. Her voice is ice cold. Joe turns and regards her levelly.
HALLENBECK: You okay, Sarah.?
SARAH: I'm tense. I couldn't get to sleep last night.
HALLENBECK: Hmmmm. Well, I think the kid will be fine. Boys still tease her about the headgear?
SARAH: Are you kidding? Brace Face, that's the latest. Little bastards.
HALLENBECK: ( under his breath ) She'll be fucking them by the time she's fourteen.
SARAH: Watch your Goddamn mouth, Joe.
HALLENBECK: Well, Christ, you let her wear enough makeup. The kid looks like a goddamn raccoon. She comes in late at night, I think, 'Christ, a burglar.' I almost shot her You're not funny. All the girls at that school wear makeup.
SARAH: You're not funny. All the girls at that school wear makeup.
HALLENBECK: Yeah, but they don't apply it with a paint sprayer. And for your information, our neighbors think I'm very funny.
SARAH: Go live with them.
HALLENBECK: Don't tempt me. He tosses the holstered .38 on the bed. Stalks into the bathroom.
HALLENBECK: Damn raccoon. He sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet. Walks back out into the bedroom.
HALLENBECK: Who's the guy in the closet? Sarah stops dead. Spins and stares at him.
SARAH: Excuse me?
HALLENBECK: ( frowns ) Oh, that's right, you sometimes forget that I'm a detective. ( lights a cigarette ) See, first I noticed how tense you were, but I let that pass. Then I noticed there was steam in the shower like someone was just in there, but meanwhile your hair is completely dry, you follow? So. Why the steamy shower?
SARAH: Well, nothing changes. You're still a lunatic.
HALLENBECK: Mmmmm. I'm sorry, honey, I don't enjoy being observant, but someone's gotta do it. What's his name?
SARAH: Please leave. I have to get dressed.
HALLENBECK: It's okay, I've seen you naked. So, apparently, has someone else. What's his name?
SARAH: You want me to open the closet, Joe? Huh? You want me to indulge your fucking paranoia, I'll throw the door open, is that what you want me to do.?
HALLENBECK: Is this a trick question?
SARAH: I'll do it, Joe. Okay? And then we'll both know you're a psycho, is that what you want? Huh?? An awkward pause. Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says:
HALLENBECK: No. We won't open the door.
SARAH: Thank you.
HALLENBECK: ( sighs ) Nope. Door stays shut. Instead, what I'm gonna do is. ( he scoops up the
SARAH: If you shoot up my house, Joe, I will make you eat that gun.
HALLENBECK: Two. The truth is a beautiful He cocks the hammer. Arm extended, hand rock steady.
SARAH: Call your shrink, Joe. I still have the number. Call him and tell him you're losing it, I cannot fucking deal with you like this !
HALLENBECK: Three. Last chance.
SARAH: Joe, dammit ! He sighs. Starts to pull the trigger. And Sarah Jesus, no ! And grabs the gun. Everything freezes. She looks at him. He looks at her. Understanding occurs.
SARAH: Jesus, no ! And grabs the gun. Everything freezes. She looks at him. He looks at her. Understanding occurs.
CLOSET DOOR: And out steps a man in a bathrobe. Compact. Wiry. Hair still soaking wet. None other than MIKE MILLER, Joe's early morning phone call. We know this because Joe says:
HALLENBECK: Hello, Mike. Keeping her warm for me? The gun barrel does not waver. Not an inch.
MILLER: Easy, Joe. Don't do nothing dumb.
HALLENBECK: How as she, Mike? On your finger scale, how was my wife.?
MILLER: It just happened, Joe. It just You call me from here this morning?
HALLENBECK: You call me from here this morning?
MILLER: She said you were in Vegas. I was gonna leave a message on the machine.
HALLENBECK: When you found out I was back. Why didn't you split?
MILLER: She said relax, he never stops home once he's in the office.
HALLENBECK: Normally I wouldn't.
MILLER: ( stares at him ) You knew?
HALLENBECK: I suspected. So how about it, Mike? On a scale of one to ten. How was Joe, come on, how long we been friends, huh?
MILLER: Joe, come on, how long we been friends, huh?
HALLENBECK: How long? Mmm. I'd say roughly until you put your dick in my
MILLER: You gotta understand
HALLENBECK: I know, I know, it just happened. It was an accident. Sure. You tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and accidentally fucked my wife. Gee, Mrs. H., I'm sorry, just isn't my week. Sure, Mike. Happen to I don't gotta understand anything.
SARAH: Put the gun down.
HALLENBECK: Hmmm? Oh, right, the gun. You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts. Where was Darian?
HALLENBECK: Where was Darian?
SARAH: She stayed at Cindy's last night.
HALLENBECK: Let's take a walk, Buddy.
HALLENBECK: Where you want it, Mike? Head or gut?
MILLER: Listen, Joe, I Hallenbeck pats the dog. Straightens. Plants his back foot and spins. Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's Miller drops to his knees. Begins to retch. Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. Lights it.
HALLENBECK: If I see you again, I'll kill Miller nods weakly. Gasping for breath.
HALLENBECK: So. West Hollywood at seven, right?
MILLER: The job. Seven o'clock, right?
HALLENBECK: The job. Seven o'clock, right?
MILLER: You still. want the job.?
HALLENBECK: It's two hundred bucks.
MILLER: Yeah. I guess it is. He climbs to his feet, still doubled over.
MILLER: I'm sorry, Joe.
UNIFORM COP: Why did Mr. Miller visit your home this morning, Mr. Hallenbeck? Joe lies easily:
HALLENBECK: He came by to talk business. He had a case he was to busy to continue with, a routine surveillance. He farmed it out to me.
UNIFORM COP: I see. Is that all you talked Yeah. That's all. He looks the Officer in the eye. Betrays nothing.
HALLENBECK: Yeah. That's all. He looks the Officer in the eye. Betrays nothing.
HARP: My son. He writes his own material, he's proud of that. Some people are proud, they cured leukemia. Old guy stops beating off long enough to laugh, my son thinks he's Eddie Murphy. Jimmy uncaps a beer and raises it in a toast.
JIMMY: Alex the astronaut. Harp raises his own glass.
HARP: Alex the astronaut. It seems to be a common ritual between them. Jimmy drinks, thumps the bottle down. Says, resolutely:
JIMMY: I've had it, Harp.
HARP: Had what?
JIMMY: It, man. I've had it. I don't remember what I did last night. I'm an idiot, Harp, I act like a complete dickhead. I don't have friends. I drink too much. I fuck anything that's warm and Stay on that side of the bar.
HARP: Stay on that side of the bar.
JIMMY: ( sighs ) I cheated on my girl friend again.
HARP: You cheated on her? You must be Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so. His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on
JIMMY: Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so. His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on
HALLENBECK: The police won't help you, huh?
CORY: Sure. After I'm dead they'll perform the autopsy.
HALLENBECK: Guess you don't want to wait that Guess not.
CORY: Guess not.
HALLENBECK: ( scowls ) They only play this kind of music?
CORY: What did you expect?
HALLENBECK: Pat Boone? The Four Freshmen?
CORY: What are you, my father?
HALLENBECK: Yes, I'm your father. Get your clothes on. I hate this funk shit. It's gonna be an extra hundred bucks.
CORY: You're hilarious. Sit next to the speaker, you'll get used to it. After a while you'll be screaming play that funky music white boy.
HALLENBECK: The screaming part I believe.
ANOTHER ANGLE: ( seductive ) Hello, handsome. How'd you like to buy me a bottle of champagne?
CORY: ( seductive ) Hello, handsome. How'd you like to buy me a bottle of champagne?
JIMMY: How much for a bottle?
CORY: Forty dollars.
JIMMY: No thanks. Nothing personal, my seventh grade teacher was killed by a drunk driver.
CORY: Tall guy? Sandy hair?
JIMMY: That's the one.
CORY: I had to swerve three times to get him.
JIMMY: So no bottle, then?
CORY: So no bottle, then?
JIMMY: For forty bucks I'd rather drink my own piss.
CORY: That's extra. And with that, she leans over and moulds her lips to his. Time passes. These two know each other, it would seem. Cory pulls away. Jimmy smiles.
JIMMY: Hi, Cory. Rough night?
CORY: Arrgh. I've had it to here.
JIMMY: ( grins ) I'll bet you have. Who's the stiff?
JIMMY: Who's the stiff?
CORY: He's nobody. I have to get ready to dance.
JIMMY: Come back soon. I want to buy you a drink. She smiles and moves off, swishingly. Jimmy watches her go. His gaze wanders across the room to Hallenbeck. He ANOTHER ANGLE the mike and says:
ANOTHER ANGLE: the mike and says:
EMCEE: You know, crowd, these ladies are fine, but let me tell you the three reasons men prefer sheep: they're always in the mood, they never bitch, and after you fuck 'em you can eat 'em. A few chuckles. Some coughs. More coughs than chuckles.
EMCEE: ( plowing ahead ) And now, here's a lady that's always in the mood, put your hands together for the lovely and talented Ms. Cory.!
HALLENBECK: suit pockets, searching for a smoke. Removes a crumpled, empty pack, as:
JIMMY DIX: Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck does not look at him.
JIMMY: Hi. You're nobody.
HALLENBECK: Shhh. Don't tell anyone.
JIMMY: That's what Cory said. She said you were nobody.
HALLENBECK: Easy, Junior, I'm not raining on your parade. She's too young for me. I'm just keeping an eye on her for a few days.
JIMMY: I see. What are you, some kind of bodyguard?
HALLENBECK: Something like that. You got a No. Is Cory in trouble?
JIMMY: No. Is Cory in trouble?
HALLENBECK: I hope not. You tell me.
JIMMY: She didn't mention anything to me.
HALLENBECK: Mmmm. That bothers you, doesn't it?
JIMMY: Don't sweat it. Women have secrets. Water is wet, the sky is blue, and women have secrets. I'll buy you a beer. Sit down. Jimmy remains standing.
HALLENBECK: Don't sweat it. Women have secrets. Water is wet, the sky is blue, and women have secrets. I'll buy you a beer. Sit down. Jimmy remains standing.
JIMMY: She hired you, huh? What, you in the phonebook?
HALLENBECK: Yeah. Actually, she hired my buddy Mike. I'm filling in.
JIMMY: Where's Mike?
HALLENBECK: He died.
JIMMY: Sorry to hear it.
HALLENBECK: Don't be. He was a lousy surveillance man. Jimmy leans forward, palms flat on the table.
JIMMY: Look, friend, I don't know who you are or what's going on. But Cory is my girl friend and if she's in trouble, I want to hear about it.
HALLENBECK: That's client confidential.
JIMMY: Tell me anyway.
HALLENBECK: I say two words to Cory and you don't get paid, asshole.
JIMMY: I say two words to Cory and you don't get paid, asshole.
HALLENBECK: Do it.
JIMMY: You sure? I'm looking at your suit, you could use the dough.
HALLENBECK: You don't like my suit, guess what? I don't like your money.
JIMMY: Good, 'cause you're not getting any.
HALLENBECK: Story of my life.
JIMMY: What is?
HALLENBECK: Not getting any. They stare each other down. Hallenbeck calmly sips his You couldn't protect a cup of warm piss.
JIMMY: You couldn't protect a cup of warm piss.
HALLENBECK: ( nods ) Hit me.
JIMMY: Excuse me?
HALLENBECK: Hit me. Bust me in the chops, You're not afraid, are you, Jimmy.?
JIMMY: ( freezes ) You know who I am?
HALLENBECK: James Alexander Dix, L.A. Stallions, '86 and '87. Barred from the N.F.L. on gambling charges. Allegations of point shaving to support a cocaine habit, never proven.
JIMMY: Mister. You are now pissing me About fucking time. Joe Hallenbeck. I'm a private I don't know, Joe. You look like a dumb wop to me.
HALLENBECK: About fucking time. Joe Hallenbeck. I'm a private I don't know, Joe. You look like a dumb wop to me.
JIMMY: ( ignores the hand ) I don't know, Joe. You look like a dumb wop to me.
HALLENBECK: At least I didn't shit my talent away on coke, motherfucker.
JIMMY: Can I hit you now?
HALLENBECK: Jimmy throws a short jab at Hallenbeck's chin. It never gets there. Joe moves, lightning quick, and suddenly Jimmy's fist is trapped. Dead stops. Fingers grinding into palm. Jimmy swears. Stumbles. Sits down hard. Hallenbeck releases him.
HALLENBECK: Please, have a seat.
JIMMY: ( gasping ) You think you're some kind of hot shit tough guy, huh?
HALLENBECK: ( shrugs ) It's not a question of tough. I'm bigger than you, and I was trained. So I can take you. That's just the way it is. You can throw a better ( beat ) How about that beer?
JIMMY: Piss off.
HALLENBECK: ( signals the waitress ) You were a great quarterback, Jimmy. I watched you play at Washington State. Red shirt freshman in '82. Followed you with the Stallions. Good scrambling ability, seventy percent completions from the pocket. You had the best gun in the N.F.L. Yeah. Thanks. I guess.
JIMMY: Yeah. Thanks. I guess.
HALLENBECK: ( big smile ) Hell. I'm a fan.
JIMMY: Alex the pediatrician.
CORY: ( giggles ) Alex the pediatrician.
HALLENBECK: I didn't vote for you, you bastard. He looks away, and suddenly notices something on the A half-smoked cigarette butt. Just sitting there. Joe stares at it. Thinks it over. Starts to walk away. Stops.
HALLENBECK: You're a fuckin' lowlife, Joe.
HALLENBECK'S POV: Three silhouettes hover over him, backlit by streetlamps. Their voices are fuzzy.
HITMAN #1: That's him. He was with her.
HITMAN #2: Shit, he's packing. What should we do?
HITMAN #3: Get him away from here. Then kill There's no contract for him.
HITMAN #2: There's no contract for him.
HITMAN #3: Then do it for free. Just do it Start walking. I'm right behind
HITMAN #2: Start walking. I'm right behind
ANOTHER ANGLE: sedan. Climb into the car and sit, watching the EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT vard. Choked with weeds. Broken glass. A rusted-out car. A towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people to drink Scotch or get laid, it's hard to tell. Hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot. The crag-faced man follows behind him.
HALLENBECK: That's what you think. Last night I fucked your wife. The gunman cracks up. Hallenbeck grins drunkenly.
HALLENBECK: She said her husband was a greaseball with bad breath. The guy cracks up again.
HALLENBECK: After fucking your wife, I'll take The hitman wheezes laughter. Joe just grins.
HALLENBECK: Are you kidding? We barely know each other. The hitman is now giggling, shaking his head.
HALLENBECK: You need a special funny bullet.
HALLENBECK: That's what your wife said.
HALLENBECK: Ask me how fat she is.
HALLENBECK: She's so fat I had to roll her in flour and look for the wet spot. You wanna fuck her, you gotta slap her thigh and ride the wave in. Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except when you poke her in the stomach, she farts. I got a buddy he's an archaeologist, organized an expedition to her chin. They got lost in her nasal hair. But seriously, her eyes are like the streets of Paris: crossed. They're so crossed when she cries the tears run down her back. She's got back-tearia.
HALLENBECK: And then some. The guy pitches over dead. Hallenbeck kneels beside him. Retrieves his .38, holsters it. Slips the hitman's pistol into his waistband.
HALLENBECK: I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th. He takes off running.
CORY: I can't believe it. The bastard split on me. I'm staying at a motel for a couple days. Will you follow me?
JIMMY: He heads for his car.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Watching Jimmy and Cory. The driver keys the ignition. Starts the car. In his lap is an automatic rifle.
HALLENBECK: ( CONTINUED )
GRAY SEDAN: Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car. It's enough: Everyone inside is armed to the teeth. The SEDAN ROARS around the corner, cutting in front of
JIMMY: Oh God. This is a hit this is a fucking hit!!
GRAY SEDAN: Rams her car. Metal crumples. Meanwhile:
JIMMY: And stalls out. He roars with anger. Flings open the door. Leaps out and runs forward, screaming:
JIMMY: Cory, get out of there!!
CORY: Hey, can't you fucking drive??
JIMMY: Oh Gooood!! And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy. He takes a running start. Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap. BULLETS DICE the metal behind him. He lands, hard. Sucks the ground. Huddled behind his car, as:
TWO HITMEN: The kid is dead meat. Or so it seems until, without JOE HALLENBECK He's got a GUN in each fist, and both are BLAZING. One Hitman dies immediately: Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire. Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD. The second Hitman turns and OPENS UP on Hallenbeck. Too late. Joe rolls behind a mailbox. BULLETS chase him, blowing apart the metal box. The Hitman swears. Turns, running for the sedan. He knows when a getaway is in order. Just one problem. He forgot about Jimmy Dix. A SCREECH of TIRES. As Jimmy's Jag slews around the corner, laying rubber. Rockets toward the Hitman, pins him in its headlights The Hitman screams as Jimmy plows through him And CRUNCHES into the gray sedan.
JOE HALLENBECK: He's got a GUN in each fist, and both are BLAZING. One Hitman dies immediately: Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire. Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD.

JIMMY: glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window.
HALLENBECK: ( as Jimmy looks up ) Back up.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Steam pouring from the crumpled hood. The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street. Like a sack of flour. Hallenbeck limps toward him, wheezing. He stops as:
MOTEL MANAGER: Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street.
HALLENBECK: It's all over, compadre.
MANAGER: Get off my property, mister.
HALLENBECK: ( scowls ) Sidewalk belongs to the government.
POLICE CRUISERS: Surrounding Jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless And Joe, who smokes and looks at the moon.
BESSALO: Something stinks in here. My God, it's this statement! He flings the paper onto his desk. It's shit. Hallenbeck is hiding How do you know?
BESSALO: It's shit. Hallenbeck is hiding How do you know?
BESSALO: I know how the bastard's mind works. Every lie has eighty percent truth to it. Guy scares me. McCaskey is staring out the window at Hallenbeck. We lookin' at the same guy?
BESSALO: ( smiles ) Go ahead. Tell me what you see. I see a guy, looks like he just slept in his suit.
BESSALO: ( nods ) Yep. That's what most people see. There's more?
BESSALO: Oh, yeah. There's more. A long time ago, that son of a bitch saved the President's life.
JIMMY: That stuff Cory fed you about a weirdo hassling her. That was all bullshit, wasn't it.?
HALLENBECK: Yeah. I don't know what she was into, but those were professional hitters tonight. Mob style. Tell me about Cory. What was she None of your fucking business.
JIMMY: None of your fucking business.
HALLENBECK: Listen up, friend. I'm trying to get a handle on this. How was she fixed for money?
JIMMY: ( pause ) I don't know. Pretty strapped, I Always kept an eye out for work?
HALLENBECK: Always kept an eye out for work?
JIMMY: No hooking, if that's what you mean.
HALLENBECK: It isn't. Tell me what she did at the club, besides dance.
JIMMY: The usual. Waitressing. Get a guy to buy you a bottle of champagne. Sit in a private booth, let the poor fuck spill his troubles. Used to say she'd make a great psychiatrist.
HALLENBECK: She get many high rollers?
JIMMY: Sure. Even rich guys get lonely.
HALLENBECK: ( beat ) So suppose one night, her 'guest' gets a little too drunk, and brags to her. reveals something about himself. Something that could hurt if it came out. What would she do?
JIMMY: I don't get it.
HALLENBECK: Would she blackmail him?
JIMMY: Jesus, I've had about enough of you
HALLENBECK: Would she consider the possibility of She'd consider it. If she could get away with it. But she'd need hard evidence. Otherwise, it's 'I never said that,' his word against hers.
JIMMY: ( sighs ) She'd consider it. If she could get away with it. But she'd need hard evidence. Otherwise, it's 'I never said that,' his word against hers.
HALLENBECK: Right. So what does she do?
JIMMY: I don't know. Follow the guy? Have him followed?
HALLENBECK: Bingo. Kid, this is making sense. She hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence.
JIMMY: Who does she hire?
HALLENBECK: Ah. She hires my buddy Mike. Right? Right. It makes sense. Except you told me that Mike was a shitty surveillance man.
JIMMY: Except you told me that Mike was a shitty surveillance man.
HALLENBECK: Exactly. He got spotted. They made him, and they killed him. Then they took out Cory.
JIMMY: Christ, what did the two of them stumble onto?
HALLENBECK: Whatever it was, it was way over their heads. They knew they were in trouble.
JIMMY: How you figure?
HALLENBECK: Because Mike was scared. He bailed out and threw the case in my lap.
JIMMY: He handed it to you. without telling you how dangerous it was? Hallenbeck stares straight ahead. Sighs and says:

JIMMY: Do me a favor and shut up. You think I don't care that Cory's Christ, I feel like I been rode hard and put away wet.
HALLENBECK: Get some sleep.
JIMMY: Wow. What stunning advice. I was gonna go hiking.
HALLENBECK: Fuck you. They start down the hallway, side by side.
JIMMY: You know something, Joe, for a private eye, you sure don't go in for snappy comebacks.
HALLENBECK: How's this? Fuck you and the horse that looks like you.

JIMMY: Fuck you.
HALLENBECK: Hey, snappy comeback. You a As the two cross the muster room toward the front doors, they pass the hooker we saw earlier. She is talking to her pimp. There is a heated exchange. The pimp slaps her. Hard. Suddenly, Jimmy lunges forward. Balling his fists.
JIMMY: That son of a bitch! He's ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck grabs him, spins him bodily. Propels him out the front Away from trouble.
HALLENBECK: What the fuck are you trying to do, Tarzan?
JIMMY: He hit the chick.

JIMMY: Guy shouldn't treat a woman like that, is all I'm saying. He just shouldn't, okay?

HALLENBECK: I'm gonna get a message to the people who killed your friend.
JIMMY: What's the message?
HALLENBECK: That we're out of it. That whatever they're doing, they don't have to worry about us.
JIMMY: You're kidding. Joe gets in the car. Says nothing.

JIMMY: Don't drive away, Joe. Joe puts it in gear. Pulls away.
JIMMY: Joe ! I'll tell the cops, Joe. Joe taps the brake. Stops. Leans out the window, says Tell them what, Jimmy?
HALLENBECK: Tell them what, Jimmy?
JIMMY: That Mike Miller was fucking your Only reason you're not in the cooler, tough guy, is the cops got no motive for Miller's death. When they find out Mikey was dickin' your old lady, seems to me you become suspect numero uno. I'm scared, and I'm coming with you, got it? Joe gets out of the car and advances on Jimmy.
HALLENBECK: You little creep, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you.
JIMMY: Go for it. Then the cops'll really love my story. You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead.

JIMMY: I may have something.
HALLENBECK: Later. Let's get out of here.
JIMMY: Later. Let's get out of here.
HALLENBECK: Where the hell are you going?
JIMMY: As long as we're here, I might as well take Cory's car.
HALLENBECK: You got the keys?
JIMMY: Yeah. I'll follow you. Hallenbeck starts to turn away. Jimmy gets in the car. Hallenbeck stops. Frowns.
HALLENBECK: Cory has two cars?
JIMMY: Yeah. This one's just sitting here until she can sell it. The color drains from Hallenbeck's features.
HALLENBECK: Jimmy, no!! He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the driver's seat before he can key the ignition.
JIMMY: Ouch ! What's your problem?
ANOTHER ANGLE: ( CONTINUED )
HALLENBECK: They used a car bomb on Mike, it figures they'd try it on her, too. Except they wired the wrong car. Jimmy pales noticeably.
JIMMY: Oh. Shit. Oh. Jeez. Hallenbeck claps him on the back.
HALLENBECK: Easy, kid. No harm, no foul. We caught it in time. He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling. Cheerfully unaffected. Jimmy catches his breath. Swallows hard. Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other What are you doing? Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters.
JIMMY: What are you doing? Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters.
HALLENBECK: Gotta disconnect the fucker.

HALLENBECK: ( smiles ) Relax, Junior, I used to do this for a living. You wanna do it?
HALLENBECK: You wanna do it?
JIMMY: No, man, I
HALLENBECK: Come on, chickenshit. Just snip the wire. Jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters. Reaches beneath the wheel well. Plucks at the wire tentatively. Cuts.
HALLENBECK: Oh, shit not that one! Jimmy screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass. Hallenbeck is chuckling softly. Shakes his head as he walks around to release the hood.
JIMMY: You're a fucking asshole!
HALLENBECK: And then some, Junior. And then THREE STICKS OF DYNAMITE - ONE MINUTE LATER removes the taped bundle. Holds it up for inspection.
HALLENBECK: We'll hand this over to the cops. They can analyze it.

JIMMY: ( indicating bomb ) You're just gonna stick that in your trunk?
HALLENBECK: ( nods ) You're right. Let's leave it here for the neighborhood kids to play with.
TWO MEN: One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy. The other carries a silenced Beretta.
JIMMY: Is it the cops?
HALLENBECK: No, Jimmy. It's not the cops.
TALL MAN: Good evening, gentlemen. Bit late for a stroll, don't you think?

TALL MAN: Jake, apprise Rodney Dangerfield here of his situation.
TALL MAN: Perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now, yes? Jimmy rushes forward, snarling. The Beretta swivels. Jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut.
HALLENBECK: ( gasping ) Easy. Jim. All they want is the evidence.
TALL MAN: The evidence. Very smart. See, Jake, he knows when a situation is You like that word?
HALLENBECK: Great word.
TALL MAN: It occurs to me that you may have the evidence in question.
HALLENBECK: ( spits out blood ) Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing with geniuses. Leave him alone, you fuck!
JIMMY: Leave him alone, you fuck!
HALLENBECK: Back off, Jimmy. The Tall Man turns and eyes Jimmy.
TALL MAN: Leave him alone.? Whatever you say. Jake? The Short Man steps away from Hallenbeck. Turns and launches a kick at Jimmy's groin. Connects. The kid drops to the ground, retching.
TALL MAN: ( sighs ) Ah, my young friend. I neglected to tell you that Jake attacks his job with a certain. exuberance.
JIMMY: Christ. I'm being beat up by the inventor of Scrabble.
TALL MAN: He's still in a good mood, Jake. Kick him again. Jake steps forward.
HALLENBECK: Hallenbeck speaks through cracked, bloody lips:
HALLENBECK: You want the fucking evidence that the stripper had. I've got it. So we can play games, or I can hand it over.
JIMMY: And then you'll let us go, right?
TALL MAN: Sure. We'll let you go. Where is it? Hallenbeck meets the Tall Man's gaze. Speaks softly.
HALLENBECK: Hand me the car keys, Jimmy. Jimmy stumbles to his feet. Looks at the Tall Man.
TALL MAN: Walk over and hand him the keys. Slow and easy. Jimmy takes out the car keys. Crosses to Hallenbeck. Gives him the keys.
HALLENBECK: The evidence is in the trunk.
TALL MAN: Open it. Slow.
HALLENBECK: I don't think so. He turns and throws the keys as far as he can. They fall out of sight behind a cottage.
HALLENBECK: Oops. I guess nobody gets it.
TALL MAN: You dumb bastard, you're going to pay for that. Jake, open the Jake steps forward, drawing a .38 silenced pistol. He is going to shoot open the lock.
JIMMY: Jesus fucking Christ!

HALLENBECK: You alive?
JIMMY: Don't know yet. They crawl to their feet, inspecting for broken bones.
JIMMY: The dynamite?
HALLENBECK: Either that, or we're looking at a major factory recall.

BESSALO: Goddammit, this is a police matter, you son of a bitch! I'm sick and fucking tired of sweeping up your dead bodies, Joe, and the next time I see your ugly mug I'm puttin' a bullet in it. You got that? You are off the case, buddy. Is that Hallenbeck stares at him. Blows smoke. Says nothing.
JIMMY: If you thought there was dynamite in the trunk, wait'll you see this. Hallenbeck reaches into the envelope and extracts a photograph: Two men having lunch together on a secluded Both are older, distinguished-looking. Joe suddenly looks very pale.
JIMMY: The guy on the left is Connie Marcon, the owner of the L.A. Forget about him. Look at the guy on the right.
HALLENBECK: Forget about him. Look at the guy on the right.
JIMMY: Sort of familiar. Who is he?
HALLENBECK: Senator Calvin Baynard. Jimmy draws a sharp breath. Pause, then:
JIMMY: Let's go back to the cops. I'm Take it easy, kid. It's not so Not so bad. Excuse me, did you just say the words not so bad?

MEMORY FLASH: A younger-looking Hallenbeck. Rugged features. Clipped military haircut. He is driving. Down a turnpike, squinting through dense evening mist. Up ahead, a shape materializes out of the fog:
WRECKED CAR: He SCREECHES to a stop.
ANOTHER ANGLE: There are two dead bodies inside. A woman. A little boy. In the window, a stuffed Garfield doll clings with suction cups to the remaining glass. The furry cat is splattered with blood.
STAGGERING DRUNK: Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes. He wears an $800 suit. Tan Cordovan loafers. Silk tie.
DRUNK: Fuckin' bitch. She got in front of me, man. Shit. My fuckin' car. Stupid bitch wrecked my car. He stumbles toward Hallenbeck, eyes attempting to focus.
DRUNK: Do you know who I am.? I'm Louis Baynard, my father is Calvin D. Baynard, man. Call my father, he'll take care of it. The man lurches to a stop in front of Hallenbeck. Clutching at Joe's lapels. Wheezing liquor fumes. He presses a hundred dollar bill into Joe's hand.
DRUNK: You'll tell 'em what happened, right.? Bitch swerved in front of me, man. Wrecked my fuckin' Mercedes. Right.?
HALLENBECK: The blow was non-lethal. But when he fell, his head hit the pavement funny. Put him in a coma.
HALLENBECK: Even when he came out of it, he was never right in the head. His dad fixed everything with the cops. The accident report disappeared. A week later the police found half a kilo of crack cocaine planted in my house. Acting on an anonymous The senator fucked your job.
JIMMY: The senator fucked your job.
HALLENBECK: And my pension. And my marriage. Only reason I'm still licensed to carry a gun, the man himself made a few calls. Since then I'm just playing it out. Day by day.

MILO: Fine. It's done. Right after this next shot. A strident BEEPER GOES OFF on Milo's belt. He turns to the two-man crew and claps his hands for attention.
MILO: Okay, let's do it. Roll camera.
CAMERAMAN: And. action! The closet door opens. A hulking man emerges. He is carrying a chainsaw. The Girl on the bed stares, incredulous.

HALLENBECK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION DARIAN, is slumped in a big Lazy-Boy, staring sullenly at a movie on TV. Cute kid, cursed to wear ridiculous- looking dental headgear.

HALLENBECK: Gee, that's a shame. You always have such pleasant things to say. 'I hate you, Dad.' I'm gonna miss that, darn it. It's chocolate chip, your favorite.
DARIAN: I don't care. You're an asshole. Without missing a beat, Hallenbeck opens the window and heaves the ice cream outside.
HALLENBECK: That's for saying asshole. God, I hate wasting food. Wanna abuse me some more? Go ahead, shock me. You know, I hardly ever hear the word asshole.
DARIAN: Bullshit, I bet you get it all the All right, knock it off.

DARIAN: You'd probably like it. Hallenbeck takes her by the arm and drags her out of the chair. Toward her room.
HALLENBECK: Goddammit, you are my daughter and you will respect me, got that? You got it? You don't ever call me a fuck-up.
DARIAN: Why shouldn't I, Mom calls you that all the time. That stops him. He looks at her, stricken.
HALLENBECK: Your mother called me a fuck-up.? On the phone to Uncle Jay.
DARIAN: On the phone to Uncle Jay.
HALLENBECK: Uncle Jay? Ohh, Christ, I'm a fuck-up, but Uncle Jay, now there's a real stand-up guy. Shit, the bastard cheats on his tax form, I'm surprised he hasn't done time! Why don't you ask your mother why Mister Wonderful isn't in jail for tax evasion?
DARIAN: ( smiles ) Because he doesn't fuck up. You know, for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers.
JIMMY: You know, for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers.
HALLENBECK: No. Anything that much fun, I'd want to do myself.
JIMMY: I think we could both use a drink. Hallenbeck crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of Seagrams. Swigs. Hands it to Jimmy. As Jimmy drinks, he notices a photo on the wall: Hallenbeck shaking hands with George Bush.
JIMMY: That's you?
HALLENBECK: Yeah. That's me.
JIMMY: You look like the dad on 'The Brady Bunch.'
HALLENBECK: Yeah, I was a regular Boy Scout. Joe starts to fix a sandwich. Jimmy takes nips from the So. You gonna get a divorce?
JIMMY: So. You gonna get a divorce?
HALLENBECK: Don't know. He bites into the sandwich. Not really tasting it.
JIMMY: You don't like women much, do you, Mike Miller wasn't the first time. Sarah has cheated on me before. Twice. I never told her I knew. At first, my opinion of women took a real dip, yeah.
HALLENBECK: ( mouth full ) Mike Miller wasn't the first time. Sarah has cheated on me before. Twice. I never told her I knew. At first, my opinion of women took a real dip, yeah.
JIMMY: And now?

HALLENBECK: What am I, Jimmy?
JIMMY: He tried to get you killed.
HALLENBECK: Friends can't be perfect. I wish the sky wasn't blue. I wish water wasn't wet. I wish I didn't still love my wife. He eats in silence. Jimmy says:
JIMMY: You know what I did last night?
HALLENBECK: I went to a party and shit on a car.
JIMMY: I went to a party and shit on a car.
HALLENBECK: Damn. You, too?
JIMMY: I'm a complete loser. Capital 'L.' All I ever wanted. was to be somebody's hero, you know it.? Now I mostly sit around. Watch T.V. Get laid. I'm a fucking slug, throw salt on me I'd curl up. Life sucks.
HALLENBECK: You're wrong.
JIMMY: Life doesn't suck?
HALLENBECK: No, life sucks. But you're not a loser. Cory loved you.
JIMMY: Yeah, and the last thing I did was cheat on her. Why do people cheat, Joe?
HALLENBECK: Because it's easier than paying the tax, Junior.
JIMMY: Ooooooh. Very deep.
HALLENBECK: So deep I don't know what the fuck it means.
JIMMY: It means another drink is required. He raises the bottle.
JIMMY: Alex the accountant. He drinks. Hallenbeck frowns, watching him.
HALLENBECK: Is Alex your accountant?
JIMMY: No. But he could have been. Alex was my son. Hallenbeck stares at him.
JIMMY: I was married at 19. Sweet young thing, looking to get out from under daddy's thumb. I didn't know she was a junkie. All during her pregnancy. Shooting up. There were complications. She died. Alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator. Fell asleep. Died before he woke up. He was born. He had time for one dream. and then he died. I wonder what his dream was I'm sorry.
HALLENBECK: I'm sorry.
JIMMY: I think about him a lot. I mean, who was this. guy?
HALLENBECK: He would have been a great ball player. Like his dad.
JIMMY: ( shakes his head ) No. He had to die, Joe. Don't you see?
HALLENBECK: Why did he have to die?
JIMMY: ( softly ) Because he came out of me.
JIMMY: I'm gonna borrow your shower.
HALLENBECK: Not in my house, you dumb Joe, man, you don't get it
JIMMY: Joe, man, you don't get it
HALLENBECK: Shut up. He picks up the vial of powder.
HALLENBECK: This is what you went looking for in Cory's apartment, isn't it? You found this when you found that He crosses to the toilet. Jimmy cries out.
JIMMY: Joe, please! Joe drops the vial in the water. Flushes. Jimmy darts forward. Joe shoves him back.
JIMMY: You stupid bastard, do you know what you've done? That was a thousand bucks' worth of shit!
HALLENBECK: You got it, son. I'm just mixing it in with all the other shit. Get the fuck out of my house. Now.
JIMMY: You don't understand.
HALLENBECK: I said, get out. I'll break your fucking neck, kiddo. Jimmy glares at him. Coldly defiant.
JIMMY: Go ahead, tough guy. Go ahead. I'm trying to survive, man. I use that stuff to get by, so fuck you.
HALLENBECK: I don't use it. I get by.
JIMMY: Oh, sure, Dudley fucking Do-Right, you stand there and judge me, and, meanwhile, you never had your old lady die on you, did you, pal?? And your fucking kid?? And I said to God, 'Hey, buddy, what gives? I go to church, I give to the United Way, what is this dead wife and kid shit.?' And he didn't say nothin', Joe. He grabs a towel. Scrubs savagely at his wet torso.
JIMMY: And then I lose my job, my fucking life, okay, and why.? You know why? Because I gambled. Whoa, hold on, stop the presses, Jimmy gambled, well shit, of course I gambled, everybody does, and the fucking league knows it! He advances on Joe, trembling with anger.
JIMMY: Why, Joe? Why is there an injury report in pro football, huh.? Nobody else has a fucking injury report, but the N.F.L. does, so the fucking gamblers will know the spread! Marcon. the commissioner . those fucking hypocrites. killed the last thing I could do, Joe.! I can't do anything. And suddenly he is crying.
JIMMY: I couldn't save my wife. She died screaming and I couldn't do a Goddamn thing. And my baby came out. and he was so fuckin' small, Joe. He was too fuckin' He collapses against the wall. Slides down to a sitting position. Huddled on the floor. Hallenbeck watches him. Says nothing. For a moment, he seems moved to compassion. Then his gaze hardens. He kneels next to Jimmy.
HALLENBECK: When you're through feeling sorry for yourself, the front door's that way.
JIMMY: ( wipes his eyes ) You're a total bastard.
HALLENBECK: You brought cocaine in my house. End of story. Jimmy is silent. He stands. Exits into the hall. Joe's daughter, Darian, is standing there.
DARIAN: You're Jimmy Dix, aren't you?
JIMMY: There is an awkward pause. Darian holds out a football Young, smiling Jimmy. The card is old. Tattered.
DARIAN: I'm sorry I acted like a bitch. Would you sign my card? Hallenbeck steps forward.
HALLENBECK: I told you to go to your room.
DARIAN: But, Dad !
HALLENBECK: Go to bed. This guy's not signing Aw, come off it.
DARIAN: Aw, come off it.
HALLENBECK: Forget it, Darian. The guy's a loser. Big time. Darian's face is a mask of confusion.
JIMMY: I never shaved points, Joe. I never did. Joe is silent. Stone-faced.
JIMMY: If you want my help, I'm at the Casa Loma Apartments on Ventura. He exits. Shuts the door behind him. Darian goes into her room, fuming. Shuts the door. Joe is alone. He turns. Sees his reflection in the hall Smile, you fuck.
HALLENBECK: Smile, you fuck.
DARIAN: Hallenbeck recoils. Stares at her. The DOORBELL RINGS. Startling him. He mutters under his breath. Stalks out of the room.
HALLENBECK: Goddammit, Jimmy, I told you ! It isn't Jimmy. Standing on the porch is a tall, thin man with blond hair. The man removes a TASER GUN from his overcoat.
MILO: Good morning, Joseph. He FIRES point-blank. The electrode hits Hallenbeck in the chest. A CRACKLE of electric current. Hallenbeck jerks The world spirals away. He plunges down into darkness.
PABLO: Good morning, Jimmy.
JIMMY: Who are you, and how the fuck do you know my name?
CHET: ( frowns ) This is the guy? You sure it's the guy?
PABLO: This is him.
CHET: The kid with the million-dollar Shit. He don't look like much. I wouldn't pay no million dollars for this bozo.
PABLO: Shit. He don't look like much. I wouldn't pay no million dollars for this bozo.
CHET: Shit. He don't look like much. I wouldn't pay no million dollars for this bozo.
PABLO: Neither will anyone else, anymore.
JIMMY: I'm growing whiskers here, guys. You got something to say, fucking say it.
CHET: Wow. Tough guy stuff. Must have caught it from his buddy Don't play dumb, shithead. You were with him last night at the Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, Jimmy. Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business.
JIMMY: Don't play dumb, shithead. You were with him last night at the Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, Jimmy. Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business.
PABLO: Don't play dumb, shithead. You were with him last night at the Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, Jimmy. Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business.
CHET: Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, Jimmy. Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business.
PABLO: Get ready, kid. This one's an E And, with that, they grab Jimmy under the arms. Carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence.
JIMMY: Please, guys, don't do this. Jesus Christ, I was just her boyfriend, I swear to God, please! They toss Jimmy over the fence.
ANOTHER ANGLE: In this case, however A fifty-foot drop. Awaits him beyond the fence. A huge, looming pit dug into the earth. Foundation for a new parking garage. Jimmy plummets like a stone. Under normal circumstances, he'd be dead. But since it rained last night, he's got three feet of water to land in. He hits with a splash. Disappears beneath the water. Surfaces, screaming in pain. Thrashes in the muddy water, and only when he looks down does he notice the splintered bone jutting out of his skin at a crazy angle.
JIMMY: Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm, oh Jesus Christ!!! He kneels in the muddy water, rocking back and forth.
BESSALO: Gimmee the bad news first. Bad news is, they just pulled Jimmy Dix out of a construction site on Ventura. He's busted up.
BESSALO: Okay, now gimme the bad news. I just got a call from Hallenbeck's Bessalo looks up, intrigued. McCaskey continues: Now, according to Hallenbeck, Mike Miller came to the house early that morning to talk about a case, Okay. So how come Hallenbeck's neighbor claims that Miller's car was parked there all night, in the same spot? Bessalo sits bolt upright. Eyes glazed. Wheels turning.
BESSALO: ( CONTINUED )
BESSALO: He lied. Why did he lie.? Realization hits him like a thunderbolt.
BESSALO: Shit. Miller was fucking his That's why the car was there, Miller was fucking Hallenbeck's wife, Hallenbeck just got back from out of town, remember? Christ, Joe wasted the bastard He stabs a button on the phone. Barks into the receiver:
BESSALO: That's why the car was there, Miller was fucking Hallenbeck's wife, Hallenbeck just got back from out of town, remember? Christ, Joe wasted the bastard He stabs a button on the phone. Barks into the receiver:
BESSALO: I want an A.P.B. out on Joe Hallenbeck. Now. Find him and if he resists arrest, shoot the He slams down the phone. Stares, stricken, at McCaskey.
BESSALO: I let him go, Mick. He wasted Mike Miller and waltzed right out of my office, I let him go, Goddammit! Relax, Ben. We'll bring him in. He's not that good.
BESSALO: You wanna bet? And, with that, we promptly
HAND: Rocks his head to one side.
CHET: I think he's awake.
PABLO: Make sure. Chet's hand flashes out for a third slap And from nowhere, Joe Hallenbeck's hand magically Intercepts the blow. Clamps onto Chet's hand and wrenches it. A cry of pain. Chet stumbles backward, cradling the wrist.
HALLENBECK: I'm awake. His eyelids creak open. He squints, adjusting to the light. Studies his captors.
CHET: You nearly broke my wrist, man.
HALLENBECK: Life's a bitch.
PABLO: Milo warned us to watch out for this guy. Chet is seething. He glares at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck yawns.
CHET: Fuck that. Look at him. He's nothin'. Guy's a piece of shit. Hallenbeck ignores him. Sits up. Rubs tired eyes.
HALLENBECK: Anybody got a cigarette.? Chet steps forward. Grins wickedly.
CHET: Sure, buddy. I got a cigarette. He reaches into his shirt pocket. Extracts a Marlboro. Hands it to Hallenbeck. Takes out a lighter. Hallenbeck places the cigarette between his lips. Leans forward for a light And Chet slugs him in the face. The cigarette goes flying. Hallenbeck's head snaps back. Blood creeps from his lower lip.
CHET: ( guffaws ) Hey, baby, I thought you were tough. See, Pablo, he ain't so
HALLENBECK: I seem to have dropped my cigarette. May I have another? Chet turns, meets his gaze. The grin falters a bit.
CHET: ( unnerved ) Sure. Sure thing, buddy.
HALLENBECK: I need a light. And if you touch me again. I'll kill you. A pregnant pause. The challenge hangs in the air. Slowly, Chet takes the lighter from his pocket. Pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features. Hallenbeck leans forward for a light. Chet extends his arm And slugs Hallenbeck in the face again. Rocks him. Chet howls with laughter. Pablo grins.
CHET: Baby! Two for two! The laughter continues. Hallenbeck takes a deep breath. Stands up. Strikes with a flattened palm. Breaks Chet's nose. Drives it up into the brain. Chet stands, pole-axed. Blinks once. Pitches over dead. And suddenly Pablo isn't laughing. He stares at Hallenbeck, incredulous. Stares at Chet, lying on the carpet.
PABLO: Jesus Christ. You son-of-a-bitch. Jesus Christ!! He rushes to Chet. Kneels beside him. Hallenbeck calmly returns to his seat.
PABLO: You killed him! 'Fuckin' A, you killed him, he's fuckin' dead!!! Hallenbeck says nothing.
MILO: Is there a problem?
PABLO: ( still dazed ) He killed Chet, Milo. The mother- fucker just killed him! Oh, my. Oh, Goddamn. Joseph, Joseph, you don't disappoint me.
MILO: Oh, my. Oh, Goddamn. Joseph, Joseph, you don't disappoint me. He draws a Walther PPK and approaches Hallenbeck. Smiling and cheerful.
MILO: You seem to have killed one of my men.
HALLENBECK: ( shrugs ) I needed a light.
MILO: You took an awful risk. Pablo here could have shot you dead.
HALLENBECK: If you wanted me dead, you'd have already killed me.
MILO: Yes, that's true. I suppose introductions are in Fuck it. You're the bad guy, Yes. I'm the bad guy.
HALLENBECK: ( waves his hand ) Fuck it. You're the bad guy, Yes. I'm the bad guy.
MILO: Yes. I'm the bad guy.
HALLENBECK: And you've got the gun, and I'm supposed to tremble in fear, something like that?
MILO: Something like that.
HALLENBECK: Fine. I'll start trembling in a minute. Mind if I have a drink I don't see why not. Pablo, please take Chet's corpse into the other room, and then fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink. Suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway:
MILO: ( smiles ) I don't see why not. Pablo, please take Chet's corpse into the other room, and then fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink.
HALLENBECK: Hey, look who's here. Connie Marcon himself. Sure enough, CONRAD MARCON saunters in, just like he owns the place. Which, by the way, he does. Tall, strong, Texas-tough. Dressed in a Saville Row suit. He frowns at Hallenbeck:
MARCON: Careful, son. Only my friends call me Connie.
HALLENBECK: You got friends? When did this I'll give you one thing. You're pretty calm for a man in your You're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year.
MARCON: ( chuckles ) I'll give you one thing. You're pretty calm for a man in your You're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year.
HALLENBECK: You're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year.
MARCON: They're having some problems.
HALLENBECK: They stink. Marcon's composure falters, but only for a moment.
MARCON: I'm glad you're here, Joe. We got a few things to discuss. He takes a moment to gather his thoughts.
MARCON: For starters, I'm sure you're aware that professional football is changing, and not for better. Used to be, you went to the local stadium come Sunday, you saw heroes. Guys who fought for their hometown. Anymore, no one gives a shit. Ever since Sonny Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe Namath back in '66, the sons of bitches just got greedier. Playing only for themselves. Giving nothing back to the game. Pablo hands him a double bourbon.
MARCON: This year, the final blow: the N.F.L. votes to decertify the Players Organization. Eliminates the draft, reduces all athletes to free agents. Reduces football, once and for all, to commerce. To greed, you follow?
HALLENBECK: When do I say the Pledge of Marcon looks directly at Hallenbeck.
MARCON: Do you know how many ratings points Monday Night Football lost this year? Per week? An average of two point eight.
HALLENBECK: Oh, for Chrissake. You're telling me this whole thing is about TV People have stopped watching, Joe! Everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow? Guys like you. Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the President, jumped in front of a sniper rifle. Hallenbeck reacts, startled. Looks at Milo.
MARCON: People have stopped watching, Joe! Everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow? Guys like you. Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the President, jumped in front of a sniper rifle. Hallenbeck reacts, startled. Looks at Milo.
MILO: We took the liberty of researching your background.
MARCON: How about it, Joe? Is it truth or I got the rifle in my closet as a There you go, that's what I'm saying. The public wants real heroes. Not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers. In fact, Joe, and this is my point, there's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football. Can you guess? It begins to dawn on Hallenbeck.
HALLENBECK: ( shrugs ) I got the rifle in my closet as a There you go, that's what I'm saying. The public wants real heroes. Not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers. ( beat ) In fact, Joe, and this is my point, there's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football. Can you guess?
MARCON: There you go, that's what I'm saying. The public wants real heroes. Not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers. In fact, Joe, and this is my point, there's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football. Can you guess? It begins to dawn on Hallenbeck.
HALLENBECK: ( CONTINUED )
MARCON: Exactly. Gambling. Just one problem: football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states. And that, Joe boy, is where I come in.
HALLENBECK: ( sudden realization ) Shit, that's what this is about! You're bribing United States senators. Paying them to pass Legalizing football gambling in all fifty states. Exactly.
MARCON: Legalizing football gambling in all fifty states. Exactly.
HALLENBECK: Attendance goes up again. TV ratings go up again.
MARCON: You got it, son. The networks are happy. I'm happy. Everybody's Before we get too fucking happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, I'm not your fucking son, and second. why am I still alive? Marcon stops pacing. Sighs and sits down facing It's like this, Joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then I hit a snag: Senator Calvin Baynard.
HALLENBECK: Before we get too fucking happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, I'm not your fucking son, and second. why am I still alive? Marcon stops pacing. Sighs and sits down facing It's like this, Joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then I hit a snag: Senator Calvin Baynard.
MARCON: It's like this, Joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then I hit a snag: Senator Calvin Baynard.
HALLENBECK: ( takes a sip of bourbon ) I don't get it. What's the snag?
MARCON: I offered him the bribe and he wouldn't take it. Hallenbeck actually does a spit-take. Sprays bourbon.
HALLEBECK: Baynard? Are you nuts? The guy's so crooked he shits slinkies.
MARCON: Allow me to clarify: I offered him the bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money.
HALLENBECK: ( sighs with relief ) Thank God. For a minute there I felt hell freezing over. Did he ask for more than a million?
MARCON: Does the Pope shit in the woods? He wants two million or he'll blow the lid off my whole plan. I don't feel like paying no two mil, so basically that good ole' boy's gotta die.
HALLENBECK: Taking off a U.S. senator, that's pretty ballsy. Even for an asshole like you.
MARCON: Oh, I'm not going to kill Baynard, Who is? Marcon says nothing. Just looks at Hallenbeck and Oh, shit. He rubs tired eyes.
HALLENBECK: Who is? Marcon says nothing. Just looks at Hallenbeck and Oh, shit. He rubs tired eyes.
HALLENBECK: Oh, shit. He rubs tired eyes.
HALLENBECK: I'm the perfect fall guy. Everyone and his uncle Max knows I hate Anything goes wrong, all the heat lands on you, Joe boy. My hands are clean. Hallenbeck scowls.
MARCON: ( nods ) Anything goes wrong, all the heat lands on you, Joe boy. My hands are clean.
HALLENBECK: Any particular reason I should go along with this prize-winning Just one.
MARCON: ( smiles ) Just one.
MARCON: Sit down, Joe. Do what he says, Joe.
SARAH: Do what he says, Joe.
HALLENBECK: Are you alright, Sarah?
SARAH: That's a temporary condition, Joseph. As you may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films. And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you. your wife will make her motion picture
MILO: That's a temporary condition, Joseph. As you may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films. And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you. your wife will make her motion picture
JIMMY: Look, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: I don't know anything and I can't help you. Okay? Can I go now? Bessalo grimaces in disgust.
BESSALO: Let me get this straight: you're walking along, minding your own business, when two guys you never met jump you and throw you in a ditch for no particular reason. Is that it?
JIMMY: That's it.
BESSALO: You're full of shit, kid. Tell me where Hallenbeck is.
JIMMY: How the fuck should I know? Try his house.
BESSALO: We did. Where is he?
JIMMY: For Chrissake, I just met the guy. Look, Sergeant. I don't give a shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just busted my throwing arm and I'm in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices: either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here. He glares defiantly at Bessalo.
DARIAN HALLENBECK: crumpled piece of paper clutched in her hand. He kneels beside her. Touches her shoulder.
JIMMY: Hey. Wake up. She stirs. Awakens, looking at him. Her eyes are puffy and red from crying. Her hair is a tangled mess. She hands him the piece of paper, and promptly bursts into tears. Buries her head in his chest, sobbing. He cradles her with his good arm. Awkwardly unfolds the crumpled paper and reads:
PABLO: Izod shirt. He stops in front of Sarah and Joe Hallenbeck.
PABLO: Get up.
HALLENBECK: Go fuck yourself. Pablo delivers a savage kick to Hallenbeck's ribs. Hallenbeck gasps in pain.
HALLENBECK: I meant that. in a good way. Pablo hauls him to his feet. Props him against the Time for a little payback, Joe. Call it a service to dear departed He slams a fist into Hallenbeck's middle. Sarah cries out in alarm.
PABLO: Time for a little payback, Joe. Call it a service to dear departed He slams a fist into Hallenbeck's middle. Sarah cries out in alarm.
PABLO: How's that feel, fuckhead?
HALLENBECK: ( weakly ) I'm asshole. she's fuckhead.
MILO: Easy, Pablo. I want him conscious. Pablo is kicking Joe's prone form.
SARAH: Goddamn you, stop it!! Oh, Jesus, leave him alone!
HALLENBECK: Don't. look at me.
SARAH: Shhh. It's okay, Joe. I'm here, it's okay. I love you, Joe. I get the shit beat out of me. puke all over myself. and now you love me?
HALLENBECK: I get the shit beat out of me. puke all over myself. and now you love me?
SARAH: I never stopped loving you, Joe.
HALLENBECK: Christ, you slept with three guys.
SARAH: You knew about the others?
HALLENBECK: I knew.
SARAH: You never said anything.
HALLENBECK: Figured. you needed them.
SARAH: Joe, Goddammit, why didn't you say something?
HALLENBECK: Like what? 'Fuck you, Sarah'?
SARAH: Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything to show that you. that you had some pride left.
HALLENBECK: Sorry. I'm fresh out.
SARAH: I'm scared, Joe. Get me out of Must be my trick ear. Sounded like you said, 'Get me out of You can take these guys, Joe.
HALLENBECK: Must be my trick ear. Sounded like you said, 'Get me out of You can take these guys, Joe.
SARAH: You can take these guys, Joe.
HALLENBECK: I've got cracked ribs and a Save me, Joe. Be a hero.
SARAH: Save me, Joe. Be a hero.
HALLENBECK: I don't believe in heroes.
SARAH: That's no excuse. He stares up at her for a moment. Then, through bloody Fuck you, Sarah. And he smiles. Just then, Milo signals from the boat. Seeing, this, Pablo approaches the couple again.
HALLENBECK: Fuck you, Sarah. And he smiles. Just then, Milo signals from the boat. Seeing, this, Pablo approaches the couple again.
PABLO: All right, lovebirds, break it up. He yanks Sarah to her feet. Lets his gaze roam up and down her body.
PABLO: Nice tits. He rips open her blouse. Roughly fondles her breasts. Hallenbeck. On the ground. He growls with fury. Starts to push himself up.
PABLO: Stay down, fucker. Don't you
MILO: Careful, Pablo. We don't want to get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby.
MILO: Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the You're gonna kill us both anyway.
HALLENBECK: You're gonna kill us both anyway.
MILO: Perhaps. But there are ways to die, and then there are. ways to die. Capisce? You determine your wife's fate.
SARAH: He stops. Turns. Looks at her. Boys and girls, there is, within Joe Hallenbeck, a spark: Tiny. Fizzling. Almost gone. But now, looking at his wife, that spark unexpectedly And eight years melt away. Just like that. The old Joe Hallenbeck looks his wife in the eye and says, with deadly calm:
HALLENBECK: I'll be back. That's a promise.
MILO: You're wasting my time, Joseph. Let's go.
HALLENBECK: If you touch me again. I'll kill
JIMMY: I need to borrow a gun, Henry.
MARCON: ON SHIPBOARD - MILO
MILO: It's Milo, sir. We're now underway and should be lying off Catalina within two hours.
MARCON: Good boy, Milo. The commissioner's party starts at six. I'll put in a token appearance around six-thirty.
MILO: Very good, sir.
MARCON: Any problems with Hallenbeck?
MILO: No, we're getting along famously.
MARCON: Glad to hear it. No fuckups, Milo. I want him deep-sixed.
MILO: I assure you, neither he nor the senator will see another sunrise.
MARCON: Christ, Milo, how come you always have to talk like a fruit?
MILO: If it annoys you, I could always adopt a Texas drawl, though I'm afraid I don't know any stories about fucking pigs. Sir.
MARCON: Cows, Milo. Never pigs.
MILO: I'll remember that, sir. He hangs up. Marcon replaces the receiver and chuckles.
MARCON: Goddamn fruitcake. He turns, and suddenly we realize he's not alone in the room: a STRANGE MAN is seated in the shadows off to one side. His face is obscured. Marcon addresses him:
MARCON: So far, so good. The Man in the corner nods, then speaks. As he does, we notice he has a speech impediment; it sounds like he's talking with his mouth full.
STRANGE MAN: We've worked too hard, Con. There's no margin for error.
MARCON: Take it easy, buddy. We're You're using the first team, yes?
STRANGE MAN: You're using the first team, yes?
MARCON: ( sighs ) Actually, I have no choice.
STRANGE MAN: How's that?
MARCON: Fuckin' Hallenbeck killed the second and third teams.
DARIAN: What do you need a boat for?
JIMMY: I'm gonna crash a party out on Catalina. Marcon will be there. He swings a bag of gear onto the boat. Starts to store Maybe. we should call the No, honey. Not now. There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. If I blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies. I'm sorry, Darian.
DARIAN: Maybe. we should call the No, honey. Not now. There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. If I blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies. I'm sorry, Darian.
JIMMY: No, honey. Not now. There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. If I blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies. I'm sorry, Darian.
DARIAN: ( about to cry ) So. what do we do.?
JIMMY: What I do. is confront Conrad Marcon and threaten to go to the cops, unless he gives them back.
DARIAN: Is that gonna work?
JIMMY: Beats me, but I think it's what your dad would do.
DARIAN: I'm scared.
JIMMY: Me, too, honey. His gear stashed, he turns to Darian. Tries a smile.
JIMMY: So. why'd you come to me, I don't know. I thought you'd. know what happened, know what to I mean, you were one of my dad's big heroes. Jimmy almost chokes.
DARIAN: I don't know. I thought you'd. know what happened, know what to I mean, you were one of my dad's big heroes. Jimmy almost chokes.
JIMMY: ( CONTINUED )
DARIAN: When I was little, he used to talk about you all the time. Best football player in the game. Great this. Wonderful that. You shoulda seen him when you got
JIMMY: I'll get them back, kiddo. I'll get them back.
CATALINA FERRY: ON SHORE A steady stream of guests. Tuxedoes and evening gowns. A parade of phony hair and phony boobs. All mounting the stairs to a huge chalet. Inside, a dinner party is in progress.
ON SHORE: A steady stream of guests. Tuxedoes and evening gowns. A parade of phony hair and phony boobs. All mounting the stairs to a huge chalet. Inside, a dinner party is in progress.
AUTOMATIC RIFLE: INT. FORTY-FOOT YACHT - CABIN - NIGHT Milo is preparing the weapon. He works the action. Pumps a round into the chamber. Looks up at Hallenbeck, who is bound hand and foot. Seated across from him in the boat's cabin.
MILO: Your wife's very pretty.
HALLENBECK: Fuck you, cocksucker.
MILO: My, my. Little testy this evening. He pulls a switchblade out of his Windbreaker.
MILO: That's not very polite, you know, calling someone a cocksucker. A lot of hard Ks. Very abusive Hallenbeck says nothing.
MILO: What would you do, Joseph, if someone called you that? Would you cut out one of his eyes.?
HALLENBECK: What would you do?
MILO: What would you do?
HALLENBECK: I'd go off and suck some cock and leave him the fuck alone. Milo studies Hallenbeck the way a museum curator might study a new species of fish.
MILO: It occurs to me, Joseph, that I would very much like to hear you Come again?
HALLENBECK: Come again?
MILO: You're so cool, aren't you? So. if you'll pardon the expression. hard-boiled. I'd like, just once, to hear you scream in pain.
HALLENBECK: Play some rap music. Milo chuckles, shakes his head.
MILO: When do I kill Baynard?
HALLENBECK: When do I kill Baynard?
MILO: ( laughs ) Come now, Joseph, did you really think that I'd hand you a loaded ( beat ) You're not really going to kill I'm not?
HALLENBECK: I'm not?
MILO: He leans forward.
MILO: You're going to be framed for the senator's murder. when they find your corpse at the scene of the EXT. PRIVATE DOCK - NIGHT boats. Money, money, everywhere, and plenty of drinks to drop.
JIMMY: Okay, hot shit, let's do it.
JIMMY: Goddammit, I told you to go home!
DARIAN: Fuck you, I stowed away. They're my parents, okay? Jimmy shakes his head. Exasperated.
JIMMY: Fine, whatever. Just stay here. With the boat.
JIMMY: Anything funny happens, get the fuck out of here. Darian takes the keys. Frowns, says:
DARIAN: You look terrible.
JIMMY: I feel terrible.
DARIAN: Are you really a drug addict?
JIMMY: I was. I kicked the habit.
DARIAN: This morning. Stay here. He swings over the side, onto the dock.
JIMMY: This morning. Stay here. He swings over the side, onto the dock.
DARIAN: Don't let them break your other Thanks, kid. You're a fuckin' INT. MILO'S YACHT - CABIN - SAME TIME At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard will leave the party, hopefully unobserved. He and his entourage will board a fast boat, and rendezvous with us at sea.
JIMMY: Thanks, kid. You're a fuckin' INT. MILO'S YACHT - CABIN - SAME TIME At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard will leave the party, hopefully unobserved. He and his entourage will board a fast boat, and rendezvous with us at sea.
MILO: At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard will leave the party, hopefully unobserved. He and his entourage will board a fast boat, and rendezvous with us at sea.
HALLENBECK: Jesus. He thinks he's geting his two-million-dollar payoff. Milo nods. Points to two identical suitcases in the Baynard will not leave his boat. One of his men will board us, and inspect the contents of the suitcase. This suitcast. He opens one of the cases. Hallenbeck stares.
MILO: Baynard will not leave his boat. One of his men will board us, and inspect the contents of the suitcase. This suitcast. He opens one of the cases. Hallenbeck stares.
MILO: Then we pull a simple switch. When the man returns to his boat, he's carrying this suitcase. He points to the identical twin.
HALLENBECK: ( nods ) Detonation upon opening. Enough to kill the passengers, not enough to sink the craft. ( smiles ) And when we place your charred corpse amidst the wreckage, the police will draw the inevitable conclusion: a down-on-his-luck P.I. makes a suicide strike against the man who cost a That sounds lovely, but how is my body gonna get charred?
MILO: ( nods ) Detonation upon opening. Enough to kill the passengers, not enough to sink the craft. ( smiles ) And when we place your charred corpse amidst the wreckage, the police will draw the inevitable conclusion: a down-on-his-luck P.I. makes a suicide strike against the man who cost a That sounds lovely, but how is my body gonna get charred?
HALLENBECK: That sounds lovely, but how is my body gonna get charred? With a flourish, Milo pulls aside a tablecloth. Under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline.
MILO: Maybe I'll get to hear you scream, after all. Just then, one of Milo's crew sticks his head in the You better get up here, we got a problem.
CREW MEMBER: You better get up here, we got a problem.
FISHING BOAT: A FISHERMAN is waving his arms. Hailing them. Beside him, his wife and seventeen-year-old son.
FISHERMAN: Hey! Buddy, I got a cracked engine casing, I'm dead in the water! Can I get a tow? Milo swears under his breath. Calls out:
MILO: I'm sorry, sir. This boat is Island Security, we're under strict orders to stay within this Aw, shit! Look, it'll take ten I'm sorry, we can't help you.
FISHERMAN: Aw, shit! Look, it'll take ten I'm sorry, we can't help you.
MILO: I'm sorry, we can't help you.
FISHERMAN: Goddammit, now I gotta call the Coast Guard! Milo's crewman steps up to the rail. Speaks urgently:
CREW MEMBER: Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast Guard down on top of us. Milo ponders for maybe three seconds. Then he calls out:
MILO: Excuse me. Sir? The Fisherman turns. His family beside him.
MILO: Fuck you, sir.
MILO: Problem solved. Get over there and put the bodies below where they can't be seen. He saunters away as if nothing unusual has occurred.
SENATOR: Christ, I can't believe I agreed to this dog and pony show. Let's get it over with. The head for the boats. Jimmy stares after them, mind racing. Makes a decision: heads for the boats. Following Baynard.
JIMMY: Gimmee the keys, kiddo.
DARIAN: Where are you going?
JIMMY: The Senator's here, and he's leaving by the back door. I'm gonna follow him. He keys the ignition.
JIMMY: Get off the boat.
DARIAN: Fuck you, man. No way.
JIMMY: Darian, Goddammit She runs below decks.
JIMMY: Okay. Shit. Okay. Easy. Shit. He throttles forward. The Hatteras pulls away from the dock.
MILO: Roger, Air One, over and out. Up anchor, gentlemen, we have a go. Gag him and stash him. As Milo goes topside, one of the men tapes Joe's mouth. The other opens a cramped storage compartment. They stuff him inside. Shut and lock the door.
JIMMY: Goddammit, I lost him. I can't see a fucking thing.
DARIAN: See if this boat has sonar.
JIMMY: Oh, yeah, little Miss Know-It-All.
DARIAN: Fuck you.
JIMMY: Watch your mouth.
DARIAN: Take a bath in my ass. They're clearly having no fun.
AIDE: Okay. We're cool. Just then Milo enters the cabin. Adopts a harsh New York accent as he angrily barks:
MILO: Hey! Any of you stupid fucks bother to frisk this goombah?
CREWMAN: No, sir, we didn't think
MILO: Exactly, you didn't think! Goddammit, that's two million bucks there, now frisk the fuckin' guy!
AIDE: Hey, baby, I'm clean, take it Fuck easy. Against the wall, spread 'em!
MILO: Fuck easy. Against the wall, spread 'em!
AIDE: Okay? Satisfied? Milo smiles apologetically.
MILO: We're cool, baby. He hands over the suitcase.
BACK TOPSIDE: Steps over the rail, crossing to the Senator's boat. Gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there. They cast off the lines. Freeing the two boats.
MILO: Hard to starboard, get us out of here. Back off a hundred yards and wait for the blast.
JIMMY: All we're doing is burning gas. Sorry, kid, I'm turning back. Do you hear that ?
DARIAN: Do you hear that ?
AIR ONE: bursts from the fog. Directly in front of them. Hovers like an avenging angel, TURBINES SCREAMING
JIMMY: Holy fucking shit!
PILOT: Code yellow, code yellow, we got a bogie, repeat, we got a bogie,
MILO: Air One, Air One, where the fuck is he?
ANOTHER ANGLE: And suddenly he's in a world of shit. Less than fifty yards to port is Milo's yacht. Fifty years to starboard is the Senator's Marlineer.
JIMMY: Oh, wow. We're fucked.
AIR ONE: the roof Jimmy, wrestling the wheel, and meanwhile
MAN: Shit! Something's going on.
BAYNARD: What is it?
MAN: Another boat. It's a fucking Get us out of here, now!
BAYNARD: Get us out of here, now!
MILO: Who the fuck is he?
CREWMAN: Son of a bitch! It's Dix, the Goddamn quarterback!
BACK TOPSIDE: ON DECK
ON DECK: Air One, Air One, follow the Senator, roger? I'll take the sport boat, you take Baynard, over.
MILO: Air One, Air One, follow the Senator, roger? I'll take the sport boat, you take Baynard, over.
MILO: ( turns to his men ) Okay, let's go. Full throttle.
BACK TOPSIDE: Hatteras. The crew members take up positions on the prow. OPEN FIRE.
WITH JIMMY: The wheelhouse is RAKED by GUNFIRE. He grits his teeth. Reaches beneath his tux. Yanks out the BERETTA and returns FIRE, BAM BAM ! and meanwhile:
CREWMAN: Fire in the hole! Fire, indeed. It's a rapidly-spreading blaze. The pursuit is momentarily forgotten as the crew races to put out the fire, and meanwhile:
HALLENBECK: the ocean, screams:
DARIAN: the ocean, screams:
DARIAN: Jimmy whirls around, startled.
JIMMY: Shit. I don't believe it.
DARIAN: Do something! Hurry!
JIMMY: Keep the wheel like this! Don't let it move! She grabs the wheel. Jimmy bends down. Opens a compart- ment. Takes out the boat's anchor. Metal hook, attached to seventy yards of chain. He hefts it like a grappling Third and long, baby, lets' go. And, sure, his left arm isn't his good arm But, boy, does he heave that anchor. It soars through space, chain playing out behind it. Hits water, thirty yards past Hallenbeck Who turns, sees the anchor skimming toward him over the EXT. MILO'S YACHT He growls in rage. Hefts the Ingram machine gun, as:
JIMMY: Third and long, baby, lets' go. And, sure, his left arm isn't his good arm But, boy, does he heave that anchor. It soars through space, chain playing out behind it. Hits water, thirty yards past Hallenbeck Who turns, sees the anchor skimming toward him over the EXT. MILO'S YACHT He growls in rage. Hefts the Ingram machine gun, as:
ANOTHER ANGLE: the passing anchor and whoosh ! He is catapulted forward, jerked like a rag puppet. BULLETS CHOP the water where he just was. He skims over the waves. Bounced. Battered. Trailing behind Jimmy at fifty miles an hour. Jimmy and Darian begin to haul him in. Struggling. Straining. The boat rushing headlong, driverless. With a last, desperate surge of energy They drag Hallenbeck over the side. Into the boat.
DARIAN: ( CONTINUED )
HALLENBECK: What the hell's she doing here??
DARIAN: I stowed away. GUNFIRE splits the air. Reminds them they're not out of the woods.
MILO'S YACHT: is behind them again. The fire is out. The chase is on. It steadily cuts the distance.
JIMMY'S BOAT: Get below, Darian. And stay He stumbles into the wheelhouse. Dazed. Barely Got any ideas?
HALLENBECK: Get below, Darian. And stay He stumbles into the wheelhouse. Dazed. Barely Got any ideas?
JIMMY: Got any ideas?
HALLENBECK: Yeah. Go really fast and hope they don't catch us. Oh, shit.
JIMMY: Fog bank, dead ahead. Hang on. Into the fog they go, and, folks This is really scary. Because you can't see a foot in front of your face. They plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour. Hallenbeck sweats, eyes glued to the windshield.
HALLENBECK: Fog bank, dead ahead. Hang on. Into the fog they go, and, folks This is really scary. Because you can't see a foot in front of your face. They plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour. Hallenbeck sweats, eyes glued to the windshield.
HALLENBECK: We're dead. Except, just then, a strange thing happens: Milo's yacht veers off to the left. Away from Hallenbeck. Jimmy stares, dumbfounded.
JIMMY: What the fuck? They're peeling off. Why? A pause. then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt:
HALLENBECK: 'Cause they got sonar, that's why! Hard to port!
JIMMY: Left, Goddammit. The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog The Catalina ferry looms right in front of them.
HALLENBECK: Left, Goddammit. The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog The Catalina ferry looms right in front of them.
JIMMY: Shit fuck piss! They almost make it. As it is, they avoid a head-on. Instead, they hit A sickening CRUNCH ! Jimmy and Joe are thrown from their feet. A momentary glimpse of faces rushing past Horrified tourists And then the ferry is behind them. Jimmy gets up. Staggers to the controls. Pushes the throttle. The boat lurches forward Then SPUTTERS. Fizzles. He swears violently.
JIMMY: We're on half power, we lost an EXT. FOG BANK - SAME TIME We're sitting ducks. They got sonar. They can find us.
JIMMY: We're sitting ducks. They got sonar. They can find us.
JIMMY: We're sitting ducks. They got sonar. They can find us.
HALLENBECK: Kill the running lights and radio the Coast Guard. Jimmy flicks off the lights. Grabs the mike. As he does, a VIBRATING RUMBLE fills the cockpit, causing him to pause. and then stare in shock as their boat emerges from the fog And Air One hovers directly overhead.
JIMMY: Fuck me. The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends, the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket.
HALLENBECK: Get down! They both hit the floor. Hands over their heads And then the pilot makes a costly error: He descends right into the path of Milo's yacht. With no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out of the fog PLOWS right INTO the HELICOPTER. Second number one: The boat pierces the chopper, rips it to shreds. Second number two: The whole boat-slash-chopper mix erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass. Turns night into day.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Stare in disbelief. Joe looks at Jimmy. Jimmy at Joe. Debris rains down.
HALLENBECK: What's that? Jimmy looks: A bright object. going in circles.
JIMMY: That's Baynard's boat!
HALLENBECK: ( nods ) It can get us to shore faster than this one, don't you think?
HALLENBECK: Hand me the pole. Jimmy hands him a long, wooden pole with a hooked end. He fishes in the water. Snares a large, floating object. Swings it aboard. Drops it at Jimmy's feet. The suitcase.
JIMMY: What is it?
HALLENBECK: Birthday present.
JIMMY: Holy fucking shit!!
HALLENBECK: Wait here. He swings aboard the senator's boat. Gun cocked. Ready.
HALLENBECK: Sorry, Cal. Life in the big city.
HALLENBECK: Listen carefully. I'm gonna go get your mom back, okay? You're gonna go in the Denny's restaurant and stay there. Talk to the waitress but don't mention me. Mom and I will come pick you up later, got it?
DARIAN: ( crying ) They're gonna kill you.!
HALLENBECK: Are you kidding? I do this for a Buy me an ice cream. I'll be back. I love you. She throws her arms around him.
JIMMY: Your prints are all over that boat. What happens when they find the bodies inside?
HALLENBECK: Quit being a fuckin' killjoy. He cuts the headlights. Cruises to a stop behind a road- side dumpster.
HALLENBECK: Come on. We've got some things to pick up.
THEIR POV: There is a man slouched inside. Smoking.
HALLENBECK: Shit. Someone's staking me out.
JIMMY: ( clears his throat ) Oh, I forgot to tell you. The police want you for killing Mike
ENSIGN: I think I got someone! Four
MILO: Half his hair is burned away. His face is blistered. He looks up, pleading, at the Ensign, as:
ANOTHER ANGLE: CUT TO:
HALLENBECK: Let's get him inside and tie him Are you crazy? That's a cop! You don't punch cops!
JIMMY: Are you crazy? That's a cop! You don't punch cops!
HALLENBECK: I forgot. Hurry up.
HALLENBECK: Wear that. He strips off his own shirt. Crosses to the closet.
HALLENBECK: You know how to use a gun?
JIMMY: The trigger's the little black He hands Jimmy a shotgun and a box of odd, black Use these. They're shredders. Equipped with an explosive charge. When you fire the gun, they spray on impact. Take out anything within ten yards.
HALLENBECK: He hands Jimmy a shotgun and a box of odd, black
HALLENBECK: Use these. They're shredders. Equipped with an explosive charge. When you fire the gun, they spray on impact. Take out anything within ten yards.
JIMMY: What are you gonna use?
HALLENBECK: A little souvenir. He reaches into the closet. Pulls out a sniper rifle. The rifle. The one responsible for the puckered scar on his chest.
HALLENBECK: Go bring the car around.
PABLO: Face it, pal. You're fucked by PAD AND PAPER He is seated on the bed. Three guns covering him. Beside him sits Furry Tom, grinning his stuffed-toy grin.
PABLO: Are you a literate man, Joe?
HALLENBECK: I got a subscription to Jugs That's good. See, Joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story. A GOON sticks his head in the door.
PABLO: That's good. See, Joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story. A GOON sticks his head in the door.
GOON: We've got Jimmy Dix in the trunk.
PABLO: Get him out of here. Take him to Mr. Marcon. I'll follow you as soon as my business here is The Goon departs, leaving Hallenbeck with Pablo and two others. He studies them. Calculates the odds. Verdict: Yeah, you're gonna write a little story, Joe. About how guilt- stricken you are over Senator Baynard's death, which is all over the air waves, by the way. Yeah. you're so guilty about paying those hitmen to kill him, that you're gonna kill yourself.
PABLO: Yeah, you're gonna write a little story, Joe. About how guilt- stricken you are over Senator Baynard's death, which is all over the air waves, by the way. Yeah. you're so guilty about paying those hitmen to kill him, that you're gonna kill yourself.
HALLENBECK: Hey, who's writing this story? You're doing all the good parts.
PABLO: Oh, and, Joe.? Don't forget to include how guilty you are over that cop you murdered.
HALLENBECK: What cop?
PABLO: That one.
HALLENBECK: You son of a bitch.! Pablo is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it. He is fueling Joe Hallenbeck's rage. Pity the fool. Hallenbeck regards him with dead, lifeless eyes. A thoroughly unnerving stare. Then Joe does something very odd. He says, softly:
HALLENBECK: We don't like Pablo very much, do we, Furry Tom.? There is a pause. And then, incredibly Furry Tom answers. A high-pitched, squeaky stuffed cat voice.
HALLENBECK: ( as Furry Tom ) No, Mr. Hallenbeck, we think Pablo is a motherless fuck who takes it up the ass.
PABLO: Shit, is he doing that? Hallenbeck's face remains cold. Expressionless.
HALLENBECK: Furry Tom, tell Pablo what I'm gonna do to him.
HALLENBECK: ( as Furry Tom ) You're gong to make Pablo eat all his teeth, Mr. Hallenbeck.
PABLO: That's amazing, man! Hallenbeck picks up Furry Tom. Inserts his hand, makes the furry head bob back and forth.
HALLENBECK: ( as Furry Tom ) Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they're laughin' at me. That's not very
HALLENBECK: Are you mad, Furry Tom?
HALLENBECK: ( as Furry Tom ) I don't get mad. I get even.
MARCON: You know I don't enjoy doin' this, Jimmy curls up in a fetal ball. Marcon paces, shaking his head.
MARCON: I remember how much you hated the pain. You got hooked on Demerol, didn't you.? I'll make a deal with you. Tell me who you talked to, and I'll give you all the painkillers you can swallow.
JIMMY: Nobody knows. Just. just me. and Hallenbeck.
MARCON: Now, see, I'd love to believe you. But we are talking about the future of my football team.
MARCON: And ain't nothin' more important than my ball club, 'cept maybe my collection of autographed footballs. Got one of yours, you Who'd you talk to, Jimmy?
JIMMY: Marcon raises the poker. Brings it down on Jimmy's broken arm.
HARDGUY: Mr. Marcon?
MARCON: He's nothing, he can't hurt us. Take him somewhere and kill him.
HARDGUY: Yes, sir. The Hardguy crosses the room. Grips Jimmy by the With a soft SPIT of sound, his forehead blooms crimson. He collapses, lifeless. At his desk, Marcon whirls, stunned, as:
JOE HALLENBECK: He resembles nothing human. A demon in black. Eyes burning. Gun held loosely. An extension of his Marcon reaches for the button to summon help.
HALLENBECK: He jams the rifle barrel into Marcon's throat, nearly crushing his larynx. Hisses:
HALLENBECK: The gun is silenced, I'll fuckin' kill you. Where's my wife?
MARCON: I. I don't remember, I. Joe shoves on the gun. The barrel chokes him.
HALLENBECK: My wife. Grabs a pen. Shoves it in Marcon's hand.
HALLENBECK: The address. Now!
MARCON: It's. Milo's film studio.
HALLENBECK: Write it down, dumbfuck.
HALLENBECK: Jimmy, you okay.?
JIMMY: Hurts like hell.
HALLENBECK: Okay, Connie, you're gonna walk us out of here, nice and easy, got Can you walk, Jimmy?
JIMMY: Yeah. I think so Joe, behind
STRANGE MAN: Drop it.
HALLENBECK: You drop it, asshole, or I kill
STRANGE MAN: Sorry, but that won't work. I don't care if he lives or dies, now drop the gun.
STRANGE MAN: Walk over there by your friend,
LOUIS BAYNARD: doesn't quite match the left. The muscles don't work. Hallenbeck recovers his composure. As Jimmy climbs to his feet, Joe walks over and stands next to him. Two gunmen appear behind them, covering the rear.
HALLENBECK: Well, Goddamn. How's the head, Aside from permanent facial neuralgia, just lovely.
HALLENBECK: Next time, Lou, just say no.
JIMMY: Shit. This is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his Marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid. He snaps at You son of a bitch, you were gonna let him kill me!
MARCON: You son of a bitch, you were gonna let him kill me!
BAYNARD: Nothing more or less than you'd do for me, Conrad. I never thought I'd see you again, Speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing here?
HALLENBECK: Speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing here?
BAYNARD: Call it a financial partnership. For a price, I agreed to connect Mr. Marcon to the necessary people in Washington.
HALLENBECK: In other words, you dropped your father's name a bunch of times.
BAYNARD: ( ignores him ) But imagine my delight this morning, Joe, when Mr. Marcon informed me of a golden opportunity: a chance to kill my father and frame you for the crime. What can I say, inherit a fortune and humiliate you in the bargain, who could resist?
HALLENBECK: Do I also have you to thank for dragging me into this mess?
BAYNARD: ( sighs ) It was I, unfortunately, who bought a forty-dollar bottle of champagne. spoke a little too freely to that hooker.
JIMMY: She wasn't a hooker, dickhead.
HALLENBECK: He should know, Jimmy. With a face like that, he's gotta be paying for it.
BAYNARD: You can die fast or slow, so watch your mouth. Jimmy chimes in:
JIMMY: We'd rather watch yours. It's Marcon has had enough. He pounds his fist on the desk.
MARCON: Kill them, Goddammit, waste 'em Any bright ideas, Joe?
JIMMY: Any bright ideas, Joe?
HALLENBECK: Gimmee a minute.
JIMMY: Excuse me, could you give him a minute? He's trying to think of a way out of this.
HALLENBECK: You know of course, Connie, that you're a dead man. Marcon holds up his hand.
MARCON: The gunmen lower their weapons.
MARCON: Let's humor this asshole. What are you talking about?
HALLENBECK: ( shrugs ) Nothing much, just that I made a phone call from the boat on the way in.
MARCON: You called the cops? Fuck it, they can't prove a thing.
HALLENBECK: Oh, but I didn't call the cops. I called the mob. Marcon stares at him. Blinks.
HALLENBECK: See, Connie, every year, the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking. If you succeed in making gambling legal, all that money goes to the I wouldn't be surprised if they put out a contract on you. Of course, I might be able to call it Marcon stares him down. A pause. Then Marcon smiles:
MARCON: He's bluffing. He's not connected to the mob, what a load of horseshit. Nice try, asshole. Kill them.
HALLENBECK: ( plowing ahead ) Then there's the matter of two million dollars. Or didn't you know that watertight suitcases
HALLENBECK: I've got your money, Connie. Stashed in the back of a rented Subaru. We'll take you to it.
MARCON: ( laughing ) Jesus, I don't believe it. This guy's a riot.
JIMMY: ( sotto ) I don't think it's working, Joe. Try another one.
HALLENBECK: Hell, I'm fresh out. You wanna try one, kid, go for it. A pause. Then, without warning, Jimmy turns And slugs Hallenbeck with his good arm. Decks him.
JIMMY: Fuck you, Joe, I'm not just gonna stand here and die. Mr. Marcon, he's lying. We do have the money, but it's not in a car, it's in a storage locker. I have the key on me. I'l hand it over if you let me go. Hallenbeck stares in disbelief. The kid's actually trying something.
MARCON: Where is the key, Jimmy?
JIMMY: It's stashed in my shorts.
MARCON: ( nods ) All right. Slow and easy.
JIMMY: Sure. Slow and easy. Jimmy reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls something out, concealed in his fist. We see, but Marcon doesn't: It's a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist.
JIMMY: Promise you'll let me go.
MARCON: Hell with that, son. Hand it over or I'll have you kneecapped.
JIMMY: Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad. See, it's one of those new plastic keys. The kind that melt.? And, with that, he hurls it into the fire. So fast that nobody can see just what he threw.
JIMMY: I guess nobody gets the money. The two hardguys rush to the fireplace.
MARCON: Pull it out of there! One of them grabs a pair of tongs and the SHREDDER EXPLODES. Sprays the two hardguys. Cuts them to ribbons. Then, several things happen at once: Everybody goes for a gun. Hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol As Marcon draws his GUN and FIRES, missing Joe RETURNS FIRE, BAM-BAM ! Catches Marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile
HALLENBECK: Plastic keys.? The kind that Hey. Short notice, best I could You did fine, junior.
JIMMY: Hey. Short notice, best I could You did fine, junior.
HALLENBECK: You did fine, junior.
JIMMY: Learned it from a pro. Come on.
JIMMY: Son of a bitch!
HALLENBECK: Forget about him. Let's get my He crosses to a parked Mercedes. SHOOTS open the door. Gets in. Pops the ignition package. Hotwires it. The CAR ROARS to life.
HALLENBECK: Get in. He's so slick, it's scary.
HALLENBECK: On my way, honey, on my way.
MARCON: Shit, Joe Boy, you wasn't He draws his gun. Blows out the glass. Reaches in. Opens the car door. Snatches up the briefcase.
MERCEDES: without headlights. Lurches to a halt near the mouth of an alley. Jimmy and Joe burst from the car, guns in hand. Hellenbeck is grim, purposeful. Jimmy is nervous.
JIMMY: I'm new at this, Joe. How do we do it?
HALLENBECK: We get in, we get out. Shoot anyone who's not my wife. Check that: Don't shoot me.
LOCKPICK: Hallenback finds the tumblers. Springs the lock in INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT Jimmy and Joe. Side by side. Walking. Expressionless. They round a bend in the hall.
SENTRY: rig. Sees them, leaps to his feet, gun clearing Joe blows him out of his socks. TWO-SHOT BURST. Silenced. Guy hits the wall. Paints it with blood. Flops, dead. Jimmy and Joe step over him. Joe braces himself. Draws back his foot. Kicks the door, as:
MOVIE SET: bright lights on her. Around her, a director. A and he's standing right over her. Jimmy BLOWS down the two artistes. Joe takes the actor.
SARAH: bright lights on her. Around her, a director. A and he's standing right over her. Jimmy BLOWS down the two artistes. Joe takes the actor.
MAN: and he's standing right over her. Jimmy BLOWS down the two artistes. Joe takes the actor.
HALLENBECK: He throws the hunting knife. It pierces the guy's neck. The chainsaw clatters to the floor. He does the funny little dance peculiar to those with pierced necks. Falls. Dies. And then, mercifully, it's over. Joe crosses to the bed, puts out an arm, and Sarah collapses against him, shaking with sobs.
HALLENBECK: I'm here. it's all right. I'm here. He cradles his wife in the middle of a slaughterhouse.
HALLENBECK: Drive one of their cars. They won't be needing them.
JIMMY: Where do you want me to go?
HALLENBECK: The two million bucks is still in the Subaru. Parked on Mulholland above Marcon's house. Go pick it up and bring it to the office. We're gonna go get Darian.
JIMMY: Yes, massah. He moves off into the parking lot. Hallenbeck says to Sarah.
HALLENBECK: I'll take you and Darian to the office. You can sleep there.
SARAH: Why can't we go home?
HALLENBECK: There's four corpses in the bedroom.
SARAH: It's a very tiny "oh."
HALLENBECK: Jimmy should be here any minute. Then we gotta talk to the cops.
SARAH: Will the police catch Marcon?
HALLENBECK: Maybe. He's probably in some secret crash pad, packing to leave
SARAH: I remember when we got married. My friends would talk about their husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my husband is a big-time publisher,' or, 'My husband is a brilliant lawyer.' I used to say, 'My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking.'
HALLENBECK: Don't knock it. It's a skill.
SARAH: I want to try, Joe. Do you still want to try?
HALLENBECK: Ahh, shit. Looks like the local constable has come to chat.
SARAH: Shall we invite him in?
HALLENBECK: No. Stay here. I'll deal with
HALLENBECK: That's not L.A.P.D..
HALLENBECK'S POV: the insignia on the door panel reads LONG BEACH SHORE

DARIAN: Mommy, what's happening? Sarah leaps off the couch, cradling Darian and EXT. OFFICE - SAME legs, as BULLETS CHOP it to splinters.
MILO: changing clips. Methodical. Precise. Like a robot. He is obsessed. All vestige of sanity gone.
MILO: You fucked up my face, Joseph!
MILO: Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've got all night, you fucked up my
HALLENBECK: upward. Through the wooden frame. A hot SLUG RIPS through Joe's arm. An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain. Rolls away from the gunfire. Looks around. Desperate. Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby. He counts to three.
DOWN BELOW: Hallenbeck bursts from cover. Hurls the bucket down at Milo, dashes across the front of the billboard, hard and fast BULLETS CHOPPING the board right behind him, blowing holes in Gorgeous's derrierre And then Joe does a risky thing: He sprints to the end of the billboard, running full tilt, and he leaps out into space, what the hell is he It's a good fifteen feet. Try it sometime. He flies through open air Milo's GUN CHATTERING below, seeking him out And just does make it. Hits the freeway surface and collapses forward, screaming as he rolls on his injured arm. Looks up
JIMMY: I don't fucking believe it. He swerves over to the side and meanwhile
HALLENBECK: Walks across the front of the billboard. Toward the freeway. Toward Joe. Snarling. Joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground. Heaves it. Milo puts up an arm, catches a glancing blow. Blood flows. All it does is piss him off.
MILO: You ruined my flesh!
CAR: He dives aside, rolls to his feet And he's right in Milo's sights. My friends, the fat lady just sang. Except another lady says different: A single GUNSHOT SPLITS the air. Milo's chest explodes with bubbling blood. He shrieks. Turns, staring in disbelief at
SARAH HALLENBECK: You just fucking die. She FIRES again, and Milo reels backward. Leaves a bloody smudge on the billboard. She DROPS the HAMMER again and again. Empties the gun. Milo jerks and twitches. Racked by gunfire. Paints a bloody stripe across the billboard, making Gorgeous's bloody buns even bloodier Clutches himself. Looks over at Hallenbeck.

HALLENBECK: She's something, isn't she? Milo pitches forward. Falls to his death.
HALLENBECK: A moment passes between them. Around Hallenbeck, a sea of crumpled cars. HORNS BLARING. Amidst it all, he stands. Beaten. Bloody. Jimmy winds his way through the cars. Walks up to Joe. They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says:
JIMMY: The car's over on the other side. C'mere, I want to show you EXT. 405 FREEWAY - SOUTHBOUND LANE - NIGHT rented Subaru. Jimmy points to the shattered window.
JIMMY: Somebody broke in and swiped the suitcase from the back seat. Had to be Marcon, right? There is a pause. They both stare at the car. Two million. Down the drain. Except, after a beat. they begin to laugh. First chuckling, then chortling.. Now it's go-for-broke. Jimmy hoots. Joe howls. Jimmy pulls out a key and opens the trunk You can guess what's inside.
JIMMY: Son of a bitch got the wrong one!
AUTOGRAPHED FOOTBALL: Signed by Joe Montana, no less.
CONRAD MARCON: possessions into a travel bag. Hefts it. Puts it near the door.
FUCK YOU: EXT. DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER - 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT along with his earthly possessions. He plummets like a EAST L.A. SIDESTREET - NIGHT Out strolling in the poverty that exists in the shadow of the skyscrapers. Quite suddenly, without warning A football drops out of the sky. Hits and bounces, very high Comes down. Settles. Rocks, back and forth. The kids look up, puzzled. Searching the sky. The ball sits there. Only slightly scorched. Tentatively, almost like he's afraid of being caught, one of the boys bends down. looks both ways. Picks up the ball. Smiles. Then, as if by some unspoken agreement The other boy starts to run. Slowly at first, then faster. faster still. A slant pattern, heading for the mailbox. And at 12 midnight on December 22nd, the San Pedro Street quarterback throws an absolutely perfect pass. Their laughter is joyful. Innocent. Fervid. They will grow up to be sports heroes.
BESSALO: You got a lot of questions to I know.
HALLENBECK: I know.
BESSALO: You'll probably lose your license.
HALLENBECK: I know. Bessalo glares at him.
BESSALO: Do you care? Hallenbeck smiles.
HALLENBECK: My wife loves me. Bessalo looks at him like he's grown a tail.
JIMMY: Yeah. So.
HALLENBECK: Yeah. So.
JIMMY: ( clears his throat ) You gonna keep it?
HALLENBECK: Some of it.
JIMMY: How much? Hallenbeck frowns. Opens the case. Reaches in And plucks out two crisp $100 bills. Stuffs them in a pocket. Jimmy stares at him.
HALLENBECK: ( shrugs ) My fee.
JIMMY: Shit, Joe. I got all the money I need. He shoves it back into the center. Joe nods.
HALLENBECK: I'm thinkin' I could use a partner. Think you could handle that for I maybe could handle that. For He pours a drink. Raises his glass on high:

HALLENBECK: See, Jim, the thing is, life sucks. But you still can't be hangin' around Satan Claus, you know why.?
JIMMY: 'Cause someday, compadre. Satan Claus and Santa Claus are gonna have a big fight, and you know Santa's gonna kick some royal ass. He puts a fatherly arm around Jimmy's shoulder, grins:
