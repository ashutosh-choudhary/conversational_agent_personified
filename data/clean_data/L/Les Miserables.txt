OVERSEER: No work here.
OFFICER: The officer hands back the passport. Valjean leaves.
INNKEEPER: My inn is full.
VALJEAN: Jailer. Would you let me stay here for tonight?
JAILER: This is a prison, not an inn. Get yourself arrested. Then we will open up for you.
BISHOP: Come in, sir, for you are weary And the night is cold out here. Though our lives are very humble What we have we have to share.
BISHOP: There is wine here to revive you. There is bread to make you There's a bed to rest till morning - Rest from pain, and rest from Sit, my brother.
BISHOP: Sit, my brother.

BISHOP: Then let this be your home, for as long as you need it.
BISHOP: Sleep well. Tomorrow morning before you leave you will have a cup of milk from our cows, nice and hot.
VALJEAN: You let me sleep here next to you? How do you know I'm not a murderer?
BISHOP: God will take care of that.
CONSTABLE: Monsignor, we caught the thief red-handed! He has the nerve to say you gave him all this!
BISHOP: That is right.
BISHOP: But my friend, you left so early, You forgot I gave these also. Would you leave the best behind?
BISHOP: ( to policemen ) Messieurs, release him. For this man has spoken true. I commend you for your duty Now God's blessing go with you.
BISHOP: But remember this, my brother - See in this some higher plan. You must use this precious silver To become an honest man. By the witness of the martyrs,
VALJEAN: What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run! And have I fallen so far And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody Here where I stand at the turning of the years. If there's another way to go I missed it twenty long years My life was a war that could never be won. They gave me a number and murdered Valjean When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of Yet why did I allow this man To touch my soul and teach me He treated me like any other He gave me his trust He called me brother. My life he claims for God Can such things be? For I had come to hate the world - This world that always hated me! Take an eye for an eye! Turn your heart into stone! This is all I have lived for! This is all I have known! One word from him and I'd be back Beneath the lash, upon the rack. Instead he offers me my freedom!
VALJEAN: I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in. As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin. I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now!
VALJEAN: I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now!
VALJEAN: Another story must begin!
BEGGARS' CHORUS: At the end of the day you're another day older And that's all you can say for the life of the poor. It's a struggle! It's a war! And there's nothing that anyone's One more day standing about - What is it for? One day less to be living.
BEGGARS' CHORUS: At the end of the day you're another day colder And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill. And the righteous hurry past They don't hear the little ones And the plague is coming on fast Ready to kill - One day nearer to dying!
BEGGARS' CHORUS: At the end of the day there's another day dawning And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise Like the waves crash on the sand Like a storm that'll break any There's a hunger in the land There's a reckoning still to be And there's gonna be hell to pay At the end of the day!
FOREMAN: ( flirtatiously, to women ) At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing! Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread!
FOREMAN: ( quietly, to Fantine ) And in a bed!
FOREMAN: At the end of the day just be glad to be working For a master who cares for the lives of the poor.
FACTORY WOMEN: Bless the man who leads the way! At the end of the day!
FANTINE: Give that letter to me It is none of your business. With a husband at home And a bit on the side! Is there anyone here Who can swear before God She has nothing to fear? She has nothing to hide?
VALJEAN: What is this fighting all about? Will someone tear these two This is a factory, not a circus.
VALJEAN: Now come on, ladies, settle down. I run a business of repute.
VALJEAN: ( to the foreman ) Deal with this, Foreman. Be as patient as you can.
FOREMAN: Now someone say how this began!
FANTINE: Yes, it's true there's a child And the child is my daughter And her father abandoned us, Leaving us flat. Now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife And I pay for the child. What's the matter with that?
FACTORY WOMEN: At the end of the day she'll be nothing but trouble And there's trouble for all when there's trouble for one! While we're earning our daily She's the one with her hands in the butter - You must send the slut away Or we're all going to end in the And it's us who'll have to pay At the end of the day!
FOREMAN: I might have known the bitch could bite! I might have known the cat had I might have guessed your little Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine Who keeps herself so pure and clean - You'd be the cause, I had no Of any trouble hereabout. You play a virgin in the light But need no urging in the night!
FACTORY WOMEN: She'll be nothing but trouble again and again!

VALJEAN: I will see it done! I will send for her immediately!
JAVERT'S ASSISTANT: From Paris, Monsieur.
JAVERT: Monsieur le Mayor I have a crime to declare! I have disgraced The uniform that I wear. I've done you wrong, Let no forgiveness be shown. I've been as hard On every rogue I have known. I'll bear the blame, I must be treated Just the same.
VALJEAN: I don't understand. What is this crime, Javert?
JAVERT: I mistook you for a convict, I have made a false report. Now I learn they've caught the culprit - He's about to face the court.
JAVERT: And of course the thief denies You'd expect that from a con. But he couldn't run for ever, No, not even Jean Valjean.
VALJEAN: You say this man denies it all, And gives no sign of understanding or repentance? You say this man is going to And that he's sure to be returned to serve his sentence?
JAVERT: He will pay, and so must I. Press charges against me, sir!
VALJEAN: You have only done your duty It's a minor sin at most. All of us have been mistaken You'll return, sir, to your post.
JAVERT: Must I do as you say?
VALJEAN: It's your duty to obey!
VALJEAN: They think that man is me - Without a second glance. This stranger they have found - This man could be my chance! Why should I save his hide? Why should I right this wrong? When I have come so far And struggled for so long? If I speak I am condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned! I am the master of hundreds of workers - They all look to me. Can I abandon them? How would they live If I am not free? If I speak they are condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned!
VALJEAN: I am the master of hundreds of workers - They all look to me. Can I abandon them? How would they live If I am not free? If I speak they are condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned!
VALJEAN: Can I conceal myself for ever Pretend I'm not the man I was And must my name until I die Be no more than an alibi?
VALJEAN: My soul belongs to God, I know, I made that bargain long ago. He gave me hope when hope was He gave me strength to journey Who am I? Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean!
VALJEAN: And so, your honour, you see it's That man bears no more guilt than Who am I?
VALJEAN: If you don't believe me ask Inspector Javert. He knows where to find me.
JUDGE: Monsieur le Mayor, you are not well, you must come with me, do you have a carriage outside? Monsieur le Mayor, we must get you home to bed immediately!!
VALJEAN: Is her daughter with her?
NURSE: No, monsieur. Her guardian sent
VALJEAN: `Money not enough. Send more. Thenardier.' What sort of man is

VALJEAN: Your child will want for nothing.
FANTINE: Good m'sieur, you come from God in heaven.

FANTINE: Take my hand. The night grows ever colder.
VALJEAN: Then I will keep you warm.
FANTINE: Take my child I give her to your keeping.
VALJEAN: Take shelter from the storm.
FANTINE: For God's sake, please stay till I am sleeping. And tell Cosette I love her And I'll see her when I wake.
JAVERT: Valjean, at last We see each other plain! `M'sieur le Mayor' You'll wear a different chain!
VALJEAN: Before you say another word, Before you chain me up like a slave again, Listen to me! There is something I must do. This woman leaves behind a suffering child. There is none but me who can intercede - In mercy's name, three days are all I need, Then I'll return, I pledge my Then I'll return.
JAVERT: You must think me mad! I've hunted you across the years. Men like you can never change - A man such as you!
VALJEAN: Believe of me what you will There is a duty that I'm sworn to You know nothing of my life - All I did was steal some bread. You know nothing of the world - You would sooner see me dead. But not before I see this justice Men like me can never change. Men like you can never change. No, 24601! My duty is to the law. You have no rights. Come with me, 24601!
JAVERT: Men like me can never change. Men like you can never change. No, 24601! My duty is to the law. You have no rights. Come with me, 24601!
VALJEAN: I am warning you, Javert, I'm a stronger man by far! There is power in me yet! My race is not yet run!
JAVERT: Now the wheel has turned around - Jean Valjean is nothing now. Dare you talk to me of crime And the price you had to pay. Every man is born in sin Every man must choose his way. You know nothing of Javert! I was born inside a jail. I was born with scum like you. I am from the gutter too. Javert stares into the black sea - there is no sign of Javert and various police search the harbourside with Valjean, dripping wet, watches from a tunnel under a factory, as Fantine's body wrapped in a shroud is dumped on a cart. They sing to themselves, continuing their duet without
VALJEAN: And this I swear to you tonight -

VALJEAN: Your child will live within my care -
JAVERT: Wherever you may hide away -

VALJEAN: Hush now, do not be afraid of me. Don't cry. Show me where you live.
COSETTE: I'm called Cosette.
VALJEAN: She gazes up at him. Hardly knowing why, the little girl trusts this stranger. Valjean picks up the heavy buckets, and they head back towards the inn. As they go, they hum `Castle on a Cloud' together.
VALJEAN: I found her wandering in the wood This little child, I found her trembling in the shadows. And I am here to help Cosette, And I will settle any debt you may think proper. I will pay what I must pay To take Cosette away. This is a duty I must heed. There is a promise I have made.

COSETTE: How strange - This feeling that my life's begun at last! This change - Can people really fall in love so What's the matter with you, Have you been too much on your So many things unclear - So many things unknown. In my life There are so many questions and That somehow seem wrong. In my life There are times when I catch in the silence The sigh of a faraway song And it sings Of a world that I long to see - Out of reach Just a whisper away Waiting for me! Does he know I'm alive? Do I know if he's real?
VALJEAN: Dear Cosette, You're such a lonely child. How pensive, how sad you seem to Believe me, were it within my I'd fill each passing hour. How quiet it must be, I can see, With only me for company.
COSETTE: There's so little I know That I'm longing to know Of the man that you were In a time long ago. There's so little you say Of the life you have known, Why you keep to yourself, Why we're always alone. So dark! So dark and deep, The secrets that you keep! In my life Please forgive what I say You are loving and gentle and But papa, dear papa, In your eyes I am still like that Who was lost in a wood.
VALJEAN: No more words - No more words. It's a time that is dead. There are words That are better unheard, Better unsaid.
COSETTE: In my life I'm no longer a child and I yearn For the truth that you know Of the years. Years ago!
VALJEAN: You will learn. Truth is given by God To us all in our time, In our turn.
MARIUS: In my life She has burst like the music of The light of the sun! And my life seems to stop As if something is over And something has scarcely begun! Eponine, you're the friend Who has brought me here. Thanks to you I am one with the And heaven is near! And I soar through a world that is new, That is free!
EPONINE: Every word that he says Is a dagger in me! In my life There's been no one like him Anywhere, where he is If he asked. I'd be his!
MARIUS: ( sees Cosette in the Waiting near!
EPONINE: Waiting here!
MARIUS: A heart full of love!
MARIUS: A heart full of song! I'm doing everything all wrong - Oh God, for shame - I do not even know your name. Dear Mad'moiselle, Won't you say? Will you tell?
COSETTE: A heart full of love! No fear, no regret!
MARIUS: My name is Marius Pontmercy.
COSETTE: And mine's Cosette.
MARIUS: Cosette. I don't know what to say -
COSETTE: Then make no sound.

COSETTE: Every day.
VALJEAN: Cosette! Cosette!
MONTPARNASSE: This is his lair! I've seen the old fox around.
BABET: He keeps himself to himself He's staying close to the ground.
THENARDIER: I smell profit here! Ten years ago He came and paid for Cosette. I let her go for a song. It's time we settled the debt. This'll cost him dear.
BRUJON: What do I care Who you should rob? Gimme my share! Finish the job!
THENARDIER: You shut your mouth! You'll get what's yours!
BRUJON: What have we here?
THENARDIER: Who is this hussy?
BABET: It's your brat Eponine! Don't you know your own kid? Why's she hanging about here?
THENARDIER: Eponine, get on home! You're not needed in this. We're enough here without you.
EPONINE: I know this house, I tell you! There's nothing here for you! Just the old man and the girl. They live ordinary lives.
THENARDIER: Don't interfere! You've got some gall! Take care, young miss, You've got a lot to say!
BRUJON: She's going soft!
CLACQUESOUS: Happens to all!
MONTPARNASSE: Go home, Eponine! Go home, you're in the way! I'm gonna scream! I'm gonna warn them here!

THENARDIER: You wait, my girl! You'll rue this night! I'll make you scream! You'll scream all right!
VALJEAN: My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark. I heard the shout of angry voices in the street.
COSETTE: Three men I saw beyond the Three men in shadow moving fast!
VALJEAN: This is a warning to us all! These are the shadows of the
VALJEAN: Must be Javert. He's found my cover at last. I've got to get Cosette away Before he returns.

VALJEAN: Hurry, Cosette! It's time to close another door And live another day!
COSETTE: Please give this to Marius! He must know where to find me.
EPONINE: And now I'm all alone again - Nowhere to turn, no one to go to. Without a home, without a friend,
EPONINE: In the rain The pavement shines like silver All the lights Are misty in the river In the darkness the trees are full of starlight And all I see is him and me forever and forever! And I know it's only in my mind - That I'm talking to myself and not to him. And although I know that he is Still I say there's a way for us. I love him But when the night is over He is gone - the river's just a Without him the world around me changes - The trees are bare and everywhere The streets are full of I love him But every day I'm learning All my life I've only been Without me, his world will go on A world that's full of happiness That I have never know. I love him I love him I love him But only on my own.
EPONINE: I came to tell you she's gone.

MARIUS: I did not live until today - How can I live when we are parted?
VALJEAN: One day more!
COSETTE: Tomorrow you'll be worlds away And yet with you my world has
EPONINE: One more day all on my own.
EPONINE: One more day with him not I was born to be with you!

JOLY: He's back!
JAVERT: Listen, my friends, I have done as I said. I have been to their lines, I have counted each man. I will tell what I can. Better be warned They have armies to spare And our danger is real - We will need all our cunning To bring them to heel.
ENJOLRAS: Have faith! If you know what their movements We'll spoil their game. There are ways that a people can fight - We shall overcome their power!
JAVERT: I have overheard their plans. There will be no attack tonight. They intend to starve you out Before they start a proper fight - Concentrate their force, Hit us when it's light -
GAVROCHE: They all look up. There's Gavroche, on the top of the Guns swing round to aim at Javert. He stares back in Gavroche comes dancing down the barricade to Courfeyrac's delighted embrace.
GAVROCHE: Good evening, dear Inspector. Lovely evening, my dear! I know this man, my friends. His name's Inspector Javert! So don't believe a word he says Cause none of it's true. This only goes to show What little people can do.
COURFEYRAC: Bravo, little Gavroche! You're the top of the class!
PROUVAIRE: So what are we going to do With this snake in the grass?
ENJOLRAS: Tie this man and take him To the tavern in there! The people will decide your fate, Inspector Javert!
JAVERT: Shoot me now or shoot me later - Every schoolboy to his sport! Death to each and every traitor! I renounce your people's court!
ENJOLRAS: Take this man. Bring him through. There is work we have to do.
ENJOLRAS: When are they coming!?
ARMY OFFICER: Who's there?
ENJOLRAS: French Revolution.
ARMY OFFICER: A flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut. A dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade. The red flag falls, the pole sliced through. Bullets richochet off the cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade and wound several men.
ENJOLRAS: ( as students return fire ) Comrades, do not fire back! Do not waste powder!
ARMY OFFICER: Who's there? Get down!
MABEUF: Vive la France!
ARMY OFFICER: A second volley. Father Mabeuf falls down dead. While everyone is reacting to the dead old man and the wounded, the men are distracted from noticing that some French soldiers have used the cover of darkness to creep down the street. All at once the FIRST FULL ATTACK begins. Shouts and the rattle of gunfire as SOLDIERS throw themselves up and over the barricade. The students run for their guns and return fire. They are taken by surprise. All could be lost in the first instant. Some soldiers make it up to the top of the barricade, where they're driven back by the fierce resistance of the defenders. Eponine sees one soldier aiming his rifle at Marius - she throws herself in front of Marius just as the rifle fires - and Marius is safe.
MARIUS: Clear out or I'll blow up the
ARMY OFFICER: Blow it up then and take yourself with it!
MARIUS: And myself with it!
FEUILLY: ( to Marius ) Thank you!
LESGLES: What were you thinking!
MARIUS: Eponine! What have you done?
EPONINE: Here. It's from Cosette. I kept it from you.
EPONINE: Don't be too hard on me.
MARIUS: Eponine, you're hurt! You need some help!
EPONINE: Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius - I don't feel any pain. A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now. You're here - that's all I need to know And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close And rain will make the flowers But you will live, Eponine - Dear God above! If I could close your wounds with words of love -
MARIUS: But you will live, Eponine - Dear God above! If I could close your wounds with words of love -
EPONINE: Just hold me now, and let it be. Shelter me. Comfort me.
MARIUS: You will live a hundred years If I could show you how. I won't desert you now.
EPONINE: The rain can't hurt me now. This rain will wash away what's And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close I'll sleep in your embrace at
MARIUS: Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine You won't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt you now I'm here.

MARIUS: I will stay with you Till you are sleeping.
EPONINE: That's all I need to know And you will keep me safe
ENJOLRAS: They were the first to fall. The first to fall upon this Her name was Eponine! Her life was cold and dark, yet she was unafraid!
MARIUS: Her name was Eponine! Her life was cold and dark, yet she was unafraid!
COMBEFERRE: We fight here in her name.
PROUVAIRE: She will not die in vain.
LESGLES: She will not be betrayed.
COURFEYRAC: ( to Gavroche ) Are you alright?
GAVROCHE: That was my sister.
MARIUS: Gavroche! Do you know the Rue de l'Homme Armé?
GAVROCHE: Course I do!
MARIUS: Will you take this for me?
GAVROCHE: Letter for Cosette.
VALJEAN: I'll take it.
GAVROCHE: Something for you, something for me. Who needs charity?
VALJEAN: `Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul And soon you will be gone. Can it be only a day since we met And the world was reborn? If I should fall in the battle to Let this be my goodbye. Now that I know you love me as It is harder to die. I pray that God will bring me To be with you. Pray for your Marius. He prays for you.'
VALJEAN: They haven't got a chance, these They almost certainly will die She'll be alone And she will need me all the more And we will go on as before When he is gone I dare not think like this I must find this boy
VALJEAN: Don't shoot!
JOLY: Here comes a man in uniform! What brings you to this place?
VALJEAN: I come here as a volunteer.
JOLY: Approach and show your face!
PROUVAIRE: You wear an army uniform.
VALJEAN: That's why they let me through.
JOLY: You've got some years behind you, There's much that I can do.
VALJEAN: There's much that I can do.
JOLY: You see that prisoner over there?
GRANTAIRE: A volunteer like you!
COMBEFERRE: A spy who calls himself Javert!
GRANTAIRE: He's going to get it too! Don't shoot! I know him! He's no
GAVROCHE: Don't shoot! I know him! He's no
ENJOLRAS: For your presence of mind, For the deed you have done, I will thank you, M'sieur, When our battle is won.
MARIUS: Thank you, M'sieur.
VALJEAN: Give me no thanks, M'sieur. There's something you can do.
ENJOLRAS: If it is in my power.
VALJEAN: Give me the spy Javert! Let me take care of him.
JAVERT: The law is inside out. The world is upside down.
ENJOLRAS: Do what you have to do - The man belongs to you.
ENJOLRAS: The enemy may be regrouping! Hold yourselves in readiness! Come, my friends, back to your The dawn is breaking fast.
VALJEAN: We meet again.
JAVERT: You've hungered for this all your Take your revenge. How right you should kill with a
VALJEAN: You talk too much. Your life is safe in my hands.
JAVERT: Don't understand.
VALJEAN: Get out of here.
JAVERT: Valjean, take care! I'm warning you.
VALJEAN: Clear out of here!
JAVERT: Once a thief, forever a thief. What you want, you always steal. You would trade your life for Yes, Valjean, you want a deal! Shoot me now for all I care - If you let me go, beware! You'll still answer to Javert!
VALJEAN: You are wrong, and always have been wrong. I'm a man no worse than any man. You are free, and there are no conditions - No bargains or petitions. There's nothing that I blame you You've done your duty, nothing No doubt our paths will cross
VALJEAN: As Javert goes, he raises the gun barrel and fires a single shot into the air.
ENJOLRAS: Courfeyrac, you take the watch - They may attack before it's Everybody keep the faith, For certain as our banner flies, We are not alone - The people too must rise!
ENJOLRAS: Marius, rest.
GRANTAIRE: Drink with me to days gone by!
FEUILLY: Sing with me the songs we knew!
PROUVAIRE: Here's to pretty girls Who went to our heads!
JOLY: Here's to witty girls Who went to our beds!
STUDENTS: Here's to them - And here's to you!
GRANTAIRE: Drink with me to days gone by! Can it be you fear to die? Will the world remember you when you fall? Can it be your death Means nothing at all? Is your life just one more lie?
ALL: Drink with me To days gone by! To the life That used to be! At the shrine of friendship Never say die. Let the wine of friendship Never run dry! Here's to you And here's to me! Do I care if I should die Now she goes across the sea? Life without Cosette Means nothing at all.. Please don't weep, Cosette, Should Marius fall. Will you weep, Cosette, For me?
MARIUS: Do I care if I should die Now she goes across the sea? Life without Cosette Means nothing at all.. Please don't weep, Cosette, Should Marius fall. Will you weep, Cosette, For me?
VALJEAN: God on high Hear my prayer
ENJOLRAS: The people have not stirred.
COURFEYRAC: Yet we will not abandon those Who still live in fear.
ENJOLRAS: The people have not heard, Yet we will not abandon those who cannot hear. Let us not waste lives! Let all who wish to Go from here!
GAVROCHE: ( from top of barricade ) Do you hear the people sing
FEUILLY: Enjolras! Ammunition's short.
MARIUS: I will go into the streets. There are bodies all around. Ammunition to be had. Lots of bullets to be found.
ENJOLRAS: I can't let you go.
VALJEAN: Let me go! He's no more than a boy. I am old. I have nothing to fear.
GAVROCHE: I volunteer!
COURFEYRAC: Come back, Gavroche! Don't you Someone pull him down right now!
JOLY: Someone pull him down right now!
GAVROCHE: Look at me, I'm almost there!
GAVROCHE: Little people know When little people fight We may look easy pickings But we've got some bite! So never kick a dog When he's just a pup - We'll fight like twenty armies And we won't give up! So you'd better run for cover When the pup grows -
GAVROCHE: So you'd better run for cover When the pup grows -
COURFEYRAC: He runs up the barricade, seizes Gavroche's body in his arms, convulsed with grief, and brings it back through the gate in the barricade. At the other end of the street Javert has appeared. He sees this gate. And talks to the Army Officer. As the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed drawing field artillery into position. The Army Officer is lining up the big guns carefully.
ARMY OFFICER: You at the barricades listen to The people of Paris sleep in their beds! You have no chance, No chance at all! Why throw your lives away?
ENJOLRAS: Let us die facing our foes! Make them bleed while we can!
COMBEFERRE: Make'em pay through the nose!
COURFEYRAC: Make'em pay for every man!
ENJOLRAS: Let others rise to take our place Until the earth is free! Students and soldiers fight in the café, on the stairs, up the stairs to the upper room. Students driving back the pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them - students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants of the stairs. Grantaire is still unconscious from drink.
GRANTAIRE: Long live the republic!
SOLDIER: Nothing here!
THENARDIER: Here's a hint of gold Stuck into a tooth - Pardon me, m'sieur, You won't be needing it no more. Shouldn't be too hard to sell.
THENARDIER: Well, someone's got to clean'em up, my friends, Before the little harvest Disappears into the mud. Someone's got to collect their odds and ends When the gutters run with blood.
THENARDIER: Here's a tasty ring Pretty little thing Heart's no longer going And he's lived his little time, But his watch is ticking yet. It's a world where the dog eats the dog. Where they kill for the bones in the street. And God in his heaven, He don't interfere Cos he's dead as the stiff at my I raise my eyes to see the And only the moon looks down. The harvest moon shines down!
VALJEAN: How do I get out of here?
THENARDIER: There! That way!
VALJEAN: It's you, Javert! I knew you wouldn't wait too The faithful servant at his post once more. This man's done no wrong. And he needs his family's care.
JAVERT: I warned you I would not give in! I won't be swayed!
VALJEAN: Another hour yet And then I'm yours And all our debts are paid.
JAVERT: The man of mercy comes again And talks of justice!
VALJEAN: Come, time is running short - Look down, Javert! He's standing in his grave!
JAVERT: One more step and you die. Then I die.
VALJEAN: Then I die.
JAVERT: Take him, Valjean, Before I change my mind! I will be waiting.
JAVERT: Who is this man? What sort of devil is he? To have caught me in a trap And choose to let me go free? It was his hour at last To put a seal on my fate Wipe out the past And wash me clean off the slate! All it would take Was a flick of his knife Vengeance was his And he gave me back my life!
JAVERT: Damned if I live in the debt of a Damned if I yield at the end of the chase!
JAVERT: And my thoughts fly apart Can this man be believed? Shall his sins be forgiven? Shall his crimes be reprieved? And must I now begin to doubt Who never doubted all those My heart is stone and still it The world I have known is lost in Is he from heaven or from hell? And does he know That granting me my life today This man has killed me even so?
JAVERT: I am reaching but I fall And the stars are black and cold As I stare into the void Of a world that cannot hold. I'll escape now from that world From the world of Jean Valjean This is nowhere I can turn. There is no way to go on.
WOMAN 1: Did you see them Going off to fight?
WOMAN 2: Children of the barricade Who didn't last the night.
WOMAN 3: Did you see them Lying where they died? Someone used to cradle them And kiss them when they cried.
WOMAN 4: Did you see them lying side by Who will wake them?
WOMAN 5: Who will wake them?
WOMAN 6: No one ever will.
WOMAN 2: No one ever told them that A summer day can kill.
WOMAN 7: They were schoolboys Never held a gun Fighting for a new world that Would rise up like the sun.
WOMAN 3: Where's that new world Now the fighting's done?
GILLENORMAND: Marius! You've come back to us!
MARIUS: He struggles to rise, but he lacks the strength. His grandfather's face shows only love and concern.
GILLENORMAND: Rest, Marius. No more harsh words between us. I just thank God you're alive.
GILLENORMAND: You've come home. To all of us.
MARIUS: There's a grief that can't be There's a pain goes on and on Empty chairs at empty tables Now my friends are dead and gone.
MARIUS: Here they talked of revolution Here it was they lit the flame Here they sang about tomorrow
MARIUS: Oh my friends, my friends, forgive me That I live and you are gone There's a grief that can't be There's a pain goes on and on. Phantom faces at the window Phantom shadows on the floor Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will meet no Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me What your sacrifice was for Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will sing no
COSETTE: Every day You walk with stronger step, You walk with longer step. The worst is over.
MARIUS: Every day I wonder every day Who it was brought me here From the barricade.
COSETTE: Don't think about it, Marius! With all the years ahead of us! I will never go away And we will be together Every day. Every day We'll remember that night And the vow that we made.
COSETTE: A heart full of love A night full of you The words are old But always true.
VALJEAN: She was never mine to keep She is youthful, she is free.
MARIUS: Cosette, Cosette!
COSETTE: I saw you waiting and I knew -
GILLENORMAND: Thank God, thank God you are here! Thank God, thank God you are home!
MARIUS: Waiting for you! At your feet!
COSETTE: At your call!
MARIUS: M'sieur, this is a day I never can forget. Is gratitude enough For giving me Cosette? Your home shall be with us And not a day shall pass But we will prove our love To you, whom we shall call A father to us both, A father to us all.
VALJEAN: Not another word, my son. There's something now that must be done.
VALJEAN: There lived a man whose name was Jean Valjean. He stole some bread to save his sister's son For nineteen winters served his In sweat he washed away his
VALJEAN: Years ago, He broke parole and lived a life How could he tell Cosette and break her heart? It's for Cosette this must be If he is caught, she is The time has come to journey on, And from this day he must be Who am I? Who am I?
MARIUS: You're Jean Valjean!
MARIUS: Monsieur, you cannot leave! Whatever I tell my beloved She will never believe me.
VALJEAN: Make her believe I have gone on a journey A long way away. Tell her my heart was too full for farewells - It is better this way. Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette will never know.
MARIUS: I give my word.
VALJEAN: .What I have spoken, why I must For the sake of Cosette, it must be so.
MARIUS: For the sake of Cosette, it must be so.
COSETTE: Where's he gone without a word That wouldn't be his way to go
MARIUS: All he asked for me to say He's on a journey, far away. Dear Cosette, he loves you so Perhaps he will return some day.
COSETTE: He can't leave us now What's our wedding day Without him giving me away?
WEDDING GUESTS: Ring out the bells Upon this day of days! May all the angels Of the Lord above In jubilation Sing their songs of praise! And crown this blessed time With peace and love!
MAJORDOMO: The Baron and Baroness du Thenard
THENARDIER: I forget where we met. Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge Where the Duke did that Puke Down the Duchess's decolletage?
MARIUS: No, `Baron du Thenard', The circles I move in are humbler by far. Go away, Thenardier! Do you think I don't know who you He's not fooled! Told you so! Show M'Sieur what you've come here to show. Tell the boy what you know!
MADAME THENARDIER: He's not fooled! Told you so! Show M'Sieur what you've come here to show. Tell the boy what you know!
THENARDIER: Pity to disturb you at a feast like this But 500 francs surely wouldn't come amiss.
MARIUS: In God's name say what you have to say.
MADAME THENARDIER: ( to Thenardier ) He speaks. ( to Marius ) You pay!
THENARDIER: What I saw, clear as light, Jean Valjean in the sewers that Had this corpse on his back Some boy he'd killed in a viscious I was there, never fear! Even found me this fine souvenir!
MARIUS: I know this! This was mine! This is surely some heavenly sign!
THENARDIER: And there's more! Mark this well - It was the night that the barricades fell.
MARIUS: Then it's true! Then I'm right! Jean Valjean was my saviour that
THENARDIER: Jean Valjean - the old con. You pay up and I'll say where he's
MARIUS: Not so loud! Here's for you. God forgive us the things that we How's about some extra On a day so glad Our little orphan girl She hasn't done so bad. Raised in a convent Cash to spare - We want our share.

THENARDIER: Quite the little nun, ain't she!
MARIUS: Where is he?
THENARDIER: ( cowardly voice ) The convent.
THENARDIER: Ain't it a laugh? Ain't it a treat? Hob-nobbin' here Among the elite? Here comes a prince There goes a Jew This one's a queer But what can you do? Paris at my feet! Paris in the dust! And here's me breaking bread With the upper crust -
THENARDIER: Beggar at the feast! Master of the dance! Life is easy pickings If you grab your chance!
MADAME THENARDIER: Everywhere you go Law-abiding folk Doing what is decent
THENARDIER: But they're mostly broke!
MADAME THENARDIER: Singing to the Lord on Sundays

God on high Hear my prayer Take me now To thy care Where you are Let me be Take me now Take me there Bring me home Bring me home!

VALJEAN: At the end of my days.
FANTINE: You raised my child in love,
VALJEAN: She's the best of my life.

COSETTE: Papa, papa, I do not understand - Are you all right? Why did you go Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day!
VALJEAN: Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day!
MARIUS: It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool! It's you who must forgive a thankless man! It's thanks to you that I am And again I lay down my life at your feet. Cosette, your father is a saint! When they wounded me He took me from the barricade, Carried like a babe, And brought me home to you!
VALJEAN: Now you are here Again beside me Now I can die in peace For now my life is blessed.
COSETTE: You will live, papa You're going to live It's too soon Too soon to say goodbye.
VALJEAN: Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to I'll obey I will try.
