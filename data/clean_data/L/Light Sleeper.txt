LIGHT SLEEPER: Written by Paul Schrader
SHOOTING DRAFT: JOHN LETOUR, forty, light sleeper. Never meant to be a drug dealer, it just came along. He's been other things: messenger boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub shill never meant to be them either. Now he's a D.D. Drug JOHN LETOUR, well-groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket, tippet-like scarf, belt pouch, "Beatle" boots, a shadow drifting in and out of other shadows, New York, day, night: watching, listening, rarely speaking nonexistent, seen only by those he sees. His face an affable blank. Make of it what you will. The eyes flicker; the hands shift discreetly. A map of calculation. Once he had a drug problem. Life turned a page. Today he follows instructions: he sleeps light one eye open, anticipating. JOHN LETOUR, D.D., loner, voyeur, has been drifting toward an unknown destination. At mid-life the destination draws near. The circle tightens. The dealer is anxious. The destination is love.
LETOUR: ( voice over ) Labor Day weekend. Some time for a sanitation strike. Everybody crazy to stock up. They decide to score at the last minute and want it now. Never fails. The faces look alike. You gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity it keeps you sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. I started writing after that. Not every night now and then. Just to burn off the night. Fill up one book, throw it out, start
HOMEBASE: Four a.m.: streets empty. LeTour's sedan drops him off near a ten-story West 80s apartment building. JOHN gives the DRIVER a forty-dollar tip ( standard procedure ), turns the corner. He presses the intercom; a buzzer unlocks the door. He enters the lobby, walks past English reproduction furniture toward the elevators. Presses the button. Penthouse C door opens. ANN lets JOHN in with a smile. ANN, forty-four, striking in a tailored dress, greets him with a wet kiss. Her hair is coiffured, her face made up. She is John's employer, mentor, confidante, Mother Hen: she keeps the books. Her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff: she's been in the drug business fifteen years. Ann's apartment is a jumble of sensibilities: dark green walls, zebra-skin sofa, Haitian wall friezes, framed magazine photos of Paramahansa Yogananda, Liz Taylor, the Duke of Windsor paintings stacked behind an oversized urn. A bird flits in its cage. One corner of the living area is devoted to a fledgling cosmetics business: Macintosh computer, billboard of trade paper clippings and ads, herbal samples, reference books, color charts. ROBERT, fifty, slight, waves hello as JOHN locks the door. Gay, hip, worn, he's John's "co-runner." They work and eat out of Ann's apartment. Take-out tins of Indian food are stacked amid crystals, tarot cards, glasses, and vitamin bottles. No sign of drugs, drug paraphernalia, or money.
ANN: Have we made New York safe for another Get a job.
LETOUR: Have we made New York safe for another Get a job.
ANN: Have we made New York safe for another Get a job.
LETOUR: ( waves ) Get a job.
ROBERT: Get a job.
LETOUR: ( about ROBERT ) Sad what ten years without sex can
ANN: Any hundreds?
LETOUR: Twenties and tens.
ROBERT: Goddamn cash machines.
ANN: Goddamn cash machines.
ROBERT: Did what's-his-name give you a hard You mean ?
LETOUR: ( out of shot ) You mean ?
ROBERT: Cash Before Delivery.
LETOUR: Cash Before Delivery.
ROBERT: Fucking investment bankers.
ANN: These Wall Street kids deal with fake money all day, they think cash is a theoretical concept like it doesn't apply. I see 'em at two, shudder to think at nine they're buying and selling turned me off the stock market.
LETOUR: It's late. You staying?
ROBERT: It's over.
LETOUR: I'm gonna crash try, at least.
ANN: ( to LETOUR ) Tomorrow will be easier. Maybe we can all eat together. Go on. You look tired. Here, take a couple of C's. I'll pick up anything that comes
ANN: Sleep tight.
ROBERT: Pick up the trash.
LETOUR: ( laughs ) Yeah big kiss.
JOHN'S APARTMENT: First light reflects across the Hudson as LETOUR walks west on 22nd Street toward his Chelsea apartment building. A delivery truck passes uncollected garbage. He enters a nondescript doorway. Inside his studio apartment, JOHN sits at a second-hand table writing in a composition book. He drinks from an eight-ounce glass of white wine, continues. The room has little personality; Ann's apartment has enough for two. Nails indicate where pictures once hung; a boombox sits on the linoleum floor amid cassettes, books ( Autobiography of a Yogi, The Secret Doctrine ), fashion magazines, a stack of unopened CDs. A futon is unrolled beneath the room's sole decoration, a poster of a human foot advertising a forgotten photo exhibit. Wine bottles Chenin Blanc. Precious little to show for forty years. LeTour's narration resumes as he writes:
LETOUR: ( voice over ) "Labor Day." "Union Movement" there's a contradiction in terms. I know about long hours. It's worse when I'm off I just walk and walk. Where am I going? There's an element of providence to it all. Like rolling numbers. Luck. You're walking down the street, some guy that looks maybe a little like you does a stick-up four hours ago, there's an APB description out and a cop pulls you in cause he's cold and wants to go inside they grab your stash. Your number's up. You're busted for nothing. For bad luck.
JEALOUS: Five p.m. A Clinton transient hotel. Inside hotel room, LETOUR meets with JEALOUS, a twenty-five- year-old drug intermediary in leather jacket. JOHN counts hundred-dollar bills, hands them to JEALOUS.
JEALOUS: Are they "faced"?
LETOUR: Don't bore me.
JEALOUS: Is it so much work to face them the same direction? You don't do it, I got to. It's time my time
LETOUR: ( overlap ) We've been through all this. ( LETOUR shrugs ) This nineteen-gram shit is a drag.
JEALOUS: We've been through all this. This nineteen-gram shit is a drag.
LETOUR: We pay you more, you put up with more. White drugs for white people. Twice the price, twice the safety.
JEALOUS: I can't believe Ann's been working as long as she has never busted. She's something.
LETOUR: Never made any big money either.
JEALOUS: She blows it.
LETOUR: She blows it.
JEALOUS: You believe that? What you gonna do after she quits? How long you been with her?
LETOUR: She always says that. We'll see, She's out. You should pick up her trade. You're too old to be a go- fer. They know you, they trust you.
JEALOUS: She's out. You should pick up her trade. You're too old to be a go- fer. They know you, they trust you.
LETOUR: No way. I'm not the management type. I get in charge, I'll start using again not for me. I know music people. I'm gonna get in recording.
JEALOUS: LETOUR reaches for the door.
JEALOUS: Normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled.
LETOUR: Normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled.
JEALOUS: Normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled.
LETOUR: You read the papers? The Park murder. All over the Post. Mariah Rangel nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch dead in Turtle Pond coked to the fucking gills. All of a sudden they're hot after mid-level dealers. They're buzzin'. You know her?
JEALOUS: You read the papers? The Park murder. All over the Post. Mariah Rangel nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch dead in Turtle Pond coked to the fucking gills. All of a sudden they're hot after mid-level dealers. They're buzzin'. You know her?
LETOUR: ( shrugs ) I look like an encyclopedia? Who ( opens door ) Thanks for the warning.
ROBERT: JOHN kisses him atop the head.
ROBERT: You pick up from Jealous?
LETOUR: ( passes bag ) Yeah, nineteen grams after four times last night. We're certainly not his favorite people.
ROBERT: We don't make the laws. Nineteen is carrying, twenty is dealing. Let him be stupid.
LETOUR: He took my hundreds.
ROBERT: ( stands ) Take over for a while. I'm getting contact high.
LETOUR: ( sits ) Who's Her Majesty talking to?
ROBERT: The Ecstasy connection. From Arizona. She's trying to get them to come here or, better, Europe.
LETOUR: That's where the money is.
ROBERT: All mark-up the "Big One."
LETOUR: ( laughs ) Don't dress. ( beat ) You really think she means it?
ROBERT: That's what she says. New Year's Eve and out no Acid House, no product, no deliveries.
LETOUR: That's just her mouth talking.
ROBERT: Next year strictly Akasha.
LETOUR: Cosmetics. That's what Ann's calling the company now
ROBERT: Cosmetics. That's what Ann's calling the company now
LETOUR: ( interjects ) this week. I don't get it marigolds, violets, sage why'd anyone pay to put weeds on their Why'd anyone pay to put them up their nose? I like cosmetics. I need cosmetics. You should come in with You forget: she hasn't asked me.
ROBERT: Why'd anyone pay to put them up their nose? I like cosmetics. I need cosmetics. You should come in with You forget: she hasn't asked me.
LETOUR: You forget: she hasn't asked me.
ANN: ( out of shot ) Johnny! Robert! Come here!
ANN: ( open arms ) Plant me two kisses, boys, fifteen hundred Ex at thirty each and the delivery's here.
ANN: ( to LETOUR ) Whatja think?
LETOUR: Of what?
ANN: The face cream. Almond, marigold, chamomile, egg, aloe the "Almilk" formula. I remixed it.
LETOUR: ( smells her ) Very nice.
ANN: Reminds me, if you get downtown stop at Enhancements and pick up some almond oil not the California. What should we order?
LETOUR: How about Indian?
ANN: Darling, it's Saturday.
ROBERT: Thai. We haven't had Thai in a while.
ANN'S VOICE: "Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a message, we'll get back to you sooner than you think."
ANN: ( to ROBERT ) Answer that. He'll call back every five minutes.
ROBERT: ( walking ) The night begins. "Ped Srilom"? it's Northeastern. ( glancing ) I'm going veggie. Get me the "Puk ( out of shot from phone ) Me too.
ANN: "Ped Srilom"? it's Northeastern. I'm going veggie. Get me the "Puk Me too.
LETOUR: ( glancing ) I'm going veggie. Get me the "Puk ( out of shot from phone ) Me too.
ROBERT: ( out of shot from phone ) Me too.
LETOUR: Use it for facial cream.
ROBERT: ( out of shot ) Remove unsightly hair!
ANN: Laugh, one day you'll be watching me on "Oprah" from a welfare hotel.
LETOUR: Forgive us.
ROBERT: ( returns ) Eddie wants now. Now. His place. Top Lady. God knows what happened to his shit yesterday.
ANN: ( to LETOUR ) You take it call in.
LETOUR: It was supposed to be light tonight.
ROBERT: Don't you watch TV?
LETOUR: Don't have one.
ROBERT: Well if you were the normal stupid fuck you should be so lucky to be and had one, you'd know it's supposed to rain
ANN: Good for the trees
ROBERT: Some farmer whacked his numerology on us.
ANN: ( peers through curtain ) It's started.
ROBERT: The Farmer's Almanac is based on Take a coat. And you, clean up the product before the food delivery comes.
LETOUR: Take a coat. And you, clean up the product before the food delivery comes.
ANN: Take a coat. And you, clean up the product before the food delivery comes.
CONFESSOR LETOUR: Rain falls on LeTour's car near an East Side luxury high- rise. The door opens to Eddie's apartment: severe decor, once chic, now dated. EDDIE, thirty-two, is a mess: puffy face, sweaty shirt, pinched lips on a drug jag.
EDDIE: Le Tour! finally. What took so Traffic. It's raining.
LETOUR: ( steps inside ) Traffic. It's raining.
EDDIE: How's things?
LETOUR: I need a quarter you got it?
EDDIE: I need a quarter you got it?
LETOUR: ( nods ) Robert said he sold you a quarter ( slurs ) Some friends came over. How much is that? Fourteen-hundred? Eddie. Look at yourself. Sit down. I've known you, what, like eight ( counting ) Knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up. I knew your wife remember her? We used to sit and talk and talk
EDDIE: ( slurs ) Some friends came over. How much is that? Fourteen-hundred? Eddie. Look at yourself. Sit down. I've known you, what, like eight ( counting ) Knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up. I knew your wife remember her? We used to sit and talk and talk
LETOUR: Eddie. Look at yourself. Sit down. I've known you, what, like eight Knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up. I knew your wife remember her? We used to sit and talk and talk
EDDIE: ( counting ) Knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up. I knew your wife remember her? We used to sit and talk and talk
LETOUR: Knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up. I knew your wife remember her? We used to sit and talk and talk
EDDIE: ( whining ) You don't know what she was like
LETOUR: This is no good. I'll sell you a gram and some downs, but I ain't gonna put you in the emergency room. Cool it. Go to bed. Sleep it off.
EDDIE: ( stands ) You charge $200 for what goes for ninety on the street and you're not gonna sell?
LETOUR: ( clicks beeper ) So go to the street.
EDDIE: I'll call Ann.
LETOUR: Go ahead. You know what she'll say. Phone's over there.
EDDIE: ( irrational ) I'll tell the fucking cops.
LETOUR: ( flashes cold ) Fuck you. That's it. You're out. ( turns to leave ) Don't call again. Catch you next ( contrite ) Please, Tour, I'm sorry. You're right. I didn't mean that. I'm quitting anyway. I'll take the gram. Sorry.
EDDIE: ( contrite ) Please, Tour, I'm sorry. You're right. I didn't mean that. I'm quitting anyway. I'll take the gram. Sorry.
LETOUR: ( turns back ) Two hundred?
EDDIE: Two hundred?
LETOUR: You got downs? One more thing. I gotta use the phone. .but if there's no God, how can man conceive of him? The idea of God presupposes the existence of God. That's the Ontological Argument. Anselm. Twelve hundred. Fourteen hundred I'm not sure
LETOUR: ( checks his watch ) I've got to go.
LETOUR: ( Voice over ) Everybody wants to talk. It's like a compulsion. My philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it. They figure you can tell a D.D. anything, things they would never tell anyone else. He understands. Of course they're stoned to start. If I could tie together all the hours of coke talk I've heard, that would be a lot of string. It was Robert's idea to add twenty-five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle. Fifty is more like it.
FIRST STUDENT: C'mon, Tour, stick around.
SECOND STUDENT: FIRST STUDENT
FIRST STUDENT: There's only four of us and like seven of them and we're paying for the dope. See her, over there, the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? she's gonna model for Elite.
LETOUR: ( smiling ) Me? I'm an old man. She'd break me like an old horse.
SECOND STUDENT: Shit, dude
LETOUR: Nah. Thanks anyway. I gotta go. Have fun.
LETOUR: ( to DRIVER ) Carlos. Wait a second.
LETOUR: Marianne! Marianne! Hop in! I'll give you a ride.
LETOUR: John. John LeTour.
MARIANNE: ( recognizes him ) Get in. You're getting soaked.
LETOUR: Get in. You're getting soaked.
MARIANNE: ( awkward )
LETOUR: Where are you going?
LETOUR: I didn't know you still lived here.
MARIANNE: ( second thoughts ) Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I should get out.
LETOUR: Don't be crazy. It's pouring.
MARIANNE: I'm not supposed to be around
LETOUR: ( completes sentence ) former drug associates.
MARIANNE: It's four years I'm clean. No alcohol, no cigarettes, no nothing.
LETOUR: I heard. I'm happy for you.
MARIANNE: It's still not easy.
LETOUR: I know. Mar, you don't need to avoid me. I'm straight two years. It came that time. I tried to tell you. I wrote. I called.
MARIANNE: ( looks around ) I should get out.
LETOUR: But you're dealing.
MARIANNE: But you're dealing.
LETOUR: No. I stopped.
MARIANNE: What's in the bag?
LETOUR: Almond oil. You can check.
LETOUR: What's that for? In case someone needs almond oil in the middle of the night?
MARIANNE: What's that for? In case someone needs almond oil in the middle of the night?
LETOUR: I still deal a little, but I'm straight that part's true. Believe Stop here. Now. Stop!
MARIANNE: ( to DRIVER ) Stop here. Now. Stop!
LETOUR: I won't say anything. I promise. I'll just sit here. I'll just give you a ride.
MARIANNE: Goodbye, John.
LETOUR: Where do you live?
DRIVER: Eighty-third Street.
LETOUR: Eighty-third Street.
MEMORIES: John's apartment. Pre-dawn. His diary lies open on the desk. LETOUR sits clothed on the futon, drinking white wine. He pages through a cheap, half-filled photo album. He touches snapshots, 3×5's from another time: JOHN and MARIANNE, arm in arm, on a Florida beach MARIANNE, surprised by the camera, snorting coke at a JOHN, MARIANNE, and ANN posing, smiling, same party JOHN and MARIANNE kissing over birthday cake, same party

TERESA: It's a lot of money?
LETOUR: I don't care.
TERESA: ( explaining ) I look at you. I give you my impressions. I feel your "vibrations" I don't like that word, it sounds phony, but I can't think of anything ( watching ) You're anxious. ( he shrugs ) More than usual. Your aura is very strong. I feel a very strong vibration from you. A change is coming. You're worried about money. You say you don't care about money but that's not true.
LETOUR: Your livelihood is endangered. You're worried about the future. You don't have much money saved. What will you I don't know.
TERESA: Your livelihood is endangered. You're worried about the future. You don't have much money saved. What will you I don't know.
LETOUR: I don't know.
TERESA: I see a woman who has betrayed you.
LETOUR: ( smiles ) My mother?
TERESA: ( cuts him short ) Who will betray you.
LETOUR: Not. I.
TERESA: Keep it in mind. I have a strong feeling about this woman, a woman close to you, she will betray you. You're in the entertainment business, aren't you?
LETOUR: But you're not happy. You want to do something else. Is it music?
TERESA: But you're not happy. You want to do something else. Is it music?
LETOUR: You have a talent for music.

You're still drinking, aren't you? You have a drinking problem? It's interfering with your health and your life too. You've had other problems. Drug addiction.
LETOUR: This was very important in your life.
TERESA: This was very important in your life.

TERESA: You're young.
LETOUR: I have trouble sleeping. Look. What do you see around me? Is there anything? Is it dark? Have I run out of luck? Is there luck?
TERESA: I see a glow. Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside
MONEY CHANGER: Ann's apartment. The night has already begun. ANN sits on the floor beside a YOUNG HASID counting money. He wears Orthodox garb: black hat, black coat, peyas. Tibetan bells reverb from speakers as the Bergmanesque cambist runs faced twenty-dollar bills through a battery-operated counting machine, places stacks of cash on the floor. ROBERT returns a call from the kitchen; LETOUR emerges from the bathroom, wiping his hands.
ANN: ( to LETOUR and ROBERT ) Your pay's on the table.
YOUNG HASID: ( dialogue punctuates action ) One hundred thirty-one, let's make it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small bills. One percent commission, $130 to you add tens or whatever if you want.
YOUNG HASID: Same time?
ANN: ( nods ) Two weeks don't run. Stay a while. We'll order kosher. We'll tell you dirty stories. We'll talk Zionism.
YOUNG HASID: ( passes hundreds ) I'm late already. I only come 'cause I like you. Sure you're not Jewish? I don't want to see you hurt. Find a man. You should do something else.
ANN: ( offers commission ) Invest in my cosmetics line.
YOUNG HASID: ( takes money ) Don't mix business with friendship.
YOUNG HASID: ( opens door ) See you next week. ( calls after him ) Don't eat any hot dogs!
ANN: ( opens door ) See you next week. ( calls after him ) Don't eat any hot dogs!

ROBERT: ( heads for door ) Mixed sushi. Oshitashi.
LETOUR: ( heads for door ) Mixed sushi. Oshitashi.
ST. LUKE'S: EMS vehicles line street outside St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital. Inside, LETOUR weaves through Emergency ( eerie ), double-steps the stairs, looks for the second floor waiting TIS ( Mathis pronounced Tees ), thirty-five, Swiss, paces in the waiting room. He wears a linen jacket, horn-rim glasses, Cerrutti Euro-swank. He spots JOHN, takes him aside:
LETOUR: What's going on?
TIS: You got some valiums?
LETOUR: ( nods ) 'n 'ludes.
TIS: Just a valium a ten.
LETOUR: What is it?
TIS: You won't believe it. What a nightmare. I brought in this chick. She O.D.ed man, I didn't even know her. I didn't have to bring her in. The cops are coming back to talk to me. I'm hyper. I gotta come down.

TIS: Make it two. She okay?
TIS: She okay?
LETOUR: She okay?
TIS: The girl.
LETOUR: The girl.
TIS: Yeah, yeah. Met her last night. A walking vacuum cleaner. What a nightmare. Underage.
LETOUR: You need a lawyer?
TIS: ( gestures toward suited man ) He's here. Thanks.
LETOUR: Any time.
RANDI: He turns to see RANDI JOST, thirty, Marianne's younger sister. She wears running shoes, jeans, red sweater.
LETOUR: ( kisses him ) I can't believe it. Marianne's here too. She flew in. It's been so long. You look great.
RANDI: ( kisses him ) I can't believe it. Marianne's here too. She flew in. It's been so long. You look great.
LETOUR: ( deactivates beeper ) You too. Randi, what's wrong? Why are you here?
RANDI: Mom. She's back in. Didn't Marianne tell you?
LETOUR: ( nods ) More chemo.
RANDI: ( nods ) More chemo.
LETOUR: Can I see her?
RANDI: She's sleeping. She sleeps most of the time. She'd like it, though. She still talks about you.
LETOUR: ( sad ) I'm so sorry. She's a terrific woman. I was crazy about her. God.
RANDI: It's John. What a coincidence.
MARIANNE: ( gathering herself ) ( extends hand ) ( shakes hand ) Randi told me about your mom. I'm She's sedated?
LETOUR: ( shakes hand ) Randi told me about your mom. I'm She's sedated?
MARIANNE: She's sedated?
LETOUR: She's sedated?
MARIANNE: She would be so happy to see John.
RANDI: She would be so happy to see John.
MARIANNE: I don't think that would be a good
LETOUR: You both look so tired.
MARIANNE: One of us has to be here.
RANDI: The hospital lets us stay in her Let me buy you some coffee or something the cafeteria's downstairs. It helps to talk.
LETOUR: Let me buy you some coffee or something the cafeteria's downstairs. It helps to talk.
RANDI: You go, Marianne, it's my turn with I shouldn't.
MARIANNE: I shouldn't.
RANDI: Go. You haven't eaten. Go on. Go on.
MARIANNE: Bring me a coffee.
RANDI: Bring me a coffee.
LETOUR: This way. Kiss your mother for me.
EUPHORIC RECALL: Hospital cafeteria. JOHN and MARIANNE carry trays to a formica table, molded chairs. He mixes sugar in his coffee as she sets out her salad, diet soda, to-go coffee. An awkward moment. MARIANNE scans the fluorescent room: doctors, nurses, relatives.
LETOUR: I like your mom.
MARIANNE: She liked you. You know this will happen someday, but when it does. Your mother that was a shock.
LETOUR: ( re: Marianne's mother ) She's been sick a while?
MARIANNE: A year.
LETOUR: Your father?
MARIANNE: ( "no" ) Not this time. His new wife he'll make it to the funeral.
LETOUR: What have you been doing? Where do you live?
MARIANNE: ( deciding ) I don't want you to know about my Anything? You married? Have children? A dog? ( smile ) House plants?
LETOUR: Anything? You married? Have children? A dog? House plants?
MARIANNE: Details just open the door.
LETOUR: The door to what? It's not like we're strangers. We were married.
MARIANNE: We were not.
LETOUR: There was a ceremony.
MARIANNE: He wasn't even a minister. He was an He was also a minister. "Universal He was a Pisces.
LETOUR: He was also a minister. "Universal He was a Pisces.
MARIANNE: He was a Pisces.
LETOUR: You're a Pisces.
MARIANNE: It was not legal.
LETOUR: In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're I was on the cusp.
MARIANNE: I was on the cusp.
LETOUR: We were happy.
MARIANNE: We were miserable. We were either scoring or coming down mostly coming down.
LETOUR: There were good times. Area, out on the street, laughing, dancing with friends we were magical.
MARIANNE: You took off for three months without telling me and called once. That's how magical we were. You were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies I heard them all. Nobody could clear a room like you, John. And the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours. I envy you. A convenient memory is a gift from God.
LETOUR: You exaggerate.
MARIANNE: In rehab they call this "euphoric recall." You only remember the highs, never the lows.
LETOUR: We were happy.
MARIANNE: I was drowning.
LETOUR: It wasn't me
MARIANNE: You watched
LETOUR: You jumped
MARIANNE: You did nothing "It wasn't your business, you weren't responsible" you still think like that. Actions have consequences; so do
LETOUR: ( overlap )
I: I didn't I meant well.
MARIANNE: I didn't I meant well.
LETOUR: I didn't I meant well.
MARIANNE: You always meant well.
LETOUR: We were in love?
MARIANNE: We were happy?
LETOUR: We were happy?
LETOUR: You bought it for me. It's inscribed
LETOUR: Ann's quitting. I've got to find something else to do.
MARIANNE: Ann? I'll believe it when I see it.
LETOUR: It's true.
MARIANNE: Are you really straight?
LETOUR: Let me see your eyes.
MARIANNE: Let me see your eyes.
MARIANNE: Eyes are deceiving. If I could do that, I could do What do you mean?
LETOUR: If I could do that, I could do What do you mean?
MARIANNE: What do you mean?
LETOUR: We could do anything. We could start What was that? I think I heard I'm serious. You're crazy.
MARIANNE: ( bangs her head ) What was that? I think I heard I'm serious. You're crazy.
LETOUR: I'm serious. You're crazy.
MARIANNE: You're crazy.
LETOUR: ( gestures to room ) This is crazy.
MARIANNE: I have to get back.
LETOUR: I'll walk you.
NEW DIARY: Later. LeTour's sedan pulls up near Palio, a midtown JOHN steps around garbage bags, enters. Inside, JOHN "maps" bar, greets the MAÎTRE D'. LETOUR spots the FRENCH ( LaCroix and Montana ) COUPLE in the dining section, catches the man's eye. He nods to the MAÎTRE D', makes his way toward their table. He joins the FRENCH COUPLE, declines a drink, exchanges drugs/money amid air kisses. Late night. Fog hangs over 22nd Street: Chelsea's deserted. Homeless men behind windbreaks of trash. John's apartment. He writes bareback at the desk. He completes his composition book diary mid-sentence, closes it, discards it. He lifts a new book from the floor, opens it on the desk, He fills his glass with wine:
LETOUR: ( voice over ) I can always find another way to make a living. I never planned this in the first place not like Ann. She came up to sell, have parties, make contacts. She was so glamorous. I just wanted to be around her. She'd sit up listening to coke stories. Now it's me and Robert. The whole crowd was the same age. Everybody's younger now. She made me.
CÔTE BASQUE: Midday. JOHN, wearing a black tweed jacket, tie, khaki slacks, mails the Sacramento letter, enters CÔTE BASQUE, a hoity- toity 55th Street restaurant. Midmeal. ANN and LETOUR sit in a prominent booth; power moguls confer quietly. A deferential WAITER brings fresh berries, retrieves empty salmon plates.
ANN: You have any money saved?
LETOUR: There's some. Not much. A thousand or two. Maybe more I'm not sure.
ANN: What do you do with your money?
LETOUR: I don't know. It's not that much in the first place as you know.
ANN: ( counterpoint ) It's tax free
LETOUR: Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs what about your money?
ANN: Kitty Ford once told me, "Ann, the only person I know that lives as well as you is my grandmother." All the money I've made, all the money I've spent it never adds up. This last two years cosmetics' been taking I wish I could help.
LETOUR: I wish I could help.
ANN: You still go to meetings?
LETOUR: No, but I'm okay. What are the odds of meeting someone you haven't seen in years twice in two days?
ANN: Ask Robert to make up a chart for you; the other person who is it?
LETOUR: Just a contact you don't know What's the plan?
ANN: What's the plan?
LETOUR: The plan?
ANN: What you gonna do?
LETOUR: My future?
ANN: Too conceptual?
LETOUR: We had this conversation two years ago. We'll have it two years from This time it's for real.
ANN: This time it's for real.
LETOUR: ( accepting premise ) I'm thinking of some music courses. Mixing, sound editing
ANN: You took that before.
LETOUR: That was acting.
ANN: ( corrects him ) Why all this concern? Suddenly you I have feelings too you may have noticed. I guess I'm worried. I'm tough, you gotta to be tough, especially in this business, it's one thing to act tough I've seen Zipporah twice this week.
LETOUR: Why all this concern? Suddenly you I have feelings too you may have noticed. I guess I'm worried. I'm tough, you gotta to be tough, especially in this business, it's one thing to act tough I've seen Zipporah twice this week.
ANN: I have feelings too you may have noticed. I guess I'm worried. I'm tough, you gotta to be tough, especially in this business, it's one thing to act tough I've seen Zipporah twice this week.
LETOUR: She helps you?
ANN: ( nods ) harmonizes, she's encouraging me to get out of this into the cosmetics
ANN: ( about CUSTOMER ) Nomination for Best Picture. I knew every girl he fucked how, why. I knew when he had trouble shitting. Like this. ( crosses fingers ) His wife says he gets straight or she cuts him off. Old money. I remember the last thing he said to me: "See you soon." Yeah, sure. That was five years ago.
ANN: ( vulnerable ) You'll still talk to me, won't you?
LETOUR: You ? Of course I will.
ANN: It'll be strange without you around. I hadn't thought of it it hit me.
LETOUR: ( clever ) We'll always have Paris.
ANN: ( reproachful ) Ann, you want me, call, write a letter, tell a wino I'll be there.
LETOUR: Ann, you want me, call, write a letter, tell a wino I'll be there.
GENERAL HOSPITAL: Afternoon. St. Luke's. LETOUR, wearing tweed jacket, walks down the corridor, checks room numbers. A NURSE passes. He stops at a room, pushes the door a crack, peeks inside, quietly enters. Inside the hospital room, MRS. JOST, sixty-five, lies sedated, attached to IV tubes and a respirator. Flowers wreathe the RANDI sleeps in a chair by the window. LETOUR looks from MRS. JOST to RANDI and back again: a vibrant woman reduced to a shell. He soundlessly eases into a vacant His mind goes back. RANDI twists fitfully in her chair. A stuffed bear peeks over family photos on the window sill. MARIANNE steps into the doorway, stops, frozen watching the tableau: JOHN, RANDI, her mother. Her face is ravaged: the death watch has taken its toll. LETOUR reaches his arm, touches the hospital bed. MARIANNE tiptoes behind JOHN. He turns, stands.
LETOUR: ( soft ) I'm sorry. I.
LETOUR: ( after a moment ) I always thought my father would die first. He would die, then my mother and I would reconcile. Just her and me. I hated him for living.
MARIANNE: It's like a joke. It's not a real feeling. It's like a feeling of a My old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded. I miss you.
LETOUR: My old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded. I miss you.
MARIANNE: You tried to kill me. You took ten years of my life one way or another. I couldn't hate my mom I was too busy hating you.
LETOUR: I thought I was just killing myself.
LETOUR: I remember.
MARIANNE: I remember.
LETOUR: What it felt like. What this tasted like.
MARIANNE: What it felt like. What this tasted like.
LETOUR: I see you and my heart starts Excuse us. Let's go.
MARIANNE: They kiss deeper, bodies grinding. The painful present fades. A NURSE approaches with WHEELCHAIR PATIENT. She tries to pass one side of JOHN and MARIANNE, tries the other side, is blocked again. The NURSE stops, stares at their soap opera. Sensing her glare, JOHN and MARIANNE, hands over and under each other, stop, look to the NURSE: embarrassed yet
LETOUR: Excuse us. Let's go.
MARIANNE: Come. Come with me.
HOTEL SEX: Paramount hotel room: Vermeer's Lace Maker dominates Phillipe Stark decor. LETOUR and MARIANNE are all over each other. The pain of the moment, the pain of the past are subsumed by passion. Blind, welcome sexuality. Naked, they kneel facing each other on the bed, faded bleeding heart tattoo on his bicep:
LETOUR: Have you ever had sex totally Not with you.
MARIANNE: Not with you.
LETOUR: Neither have I.
MARIANNE: Such an erection.
LETOUR: Never had anything like it stoned. Feel it.
MARIANNE: ( caresses erection ) I'm dripping.
LETOUR: ( caresses erection ) I'm dripping.
MARIANNE: I'm dripping.
LETOUR: Let's disappear.
LETOUR: Kiss, kiss, kiss.
MARIANNE: Kiss, kiss, kiss.
LETOUR: Later: night. They lie nude in a scramble of twisted sheets and mattresses. Street lights cast horizontal shadows. LETOUR crawls over, falls upon Marianne's breast. She wakes up, looks at JOHN, looks out the window, returns to slow sad MARIANNE stands, pulls on her panties.
LETOUR: ( waking ) You need to go back?
MARIANNE: This is the end. It was wonderful. I'm glad it happened this way. It will never happen again. You will not see me, you will not call me again. I'm happy for you. I wish you the best. I'm leaving. I'm going back to the hospital. I shouldn't have left but I don't regret it. Please dress and leave as soon as possible. I have a key. Goodbye.
LETOUR: It's my fault.
MARIANNE: It's my fault.
LETOUR: I love you.
ANN: Johnny, what is this? Your beeper broke, gettin' some shiatsu? Two hours: where have you bee?
LETOUR: There was a mix-up
ANN: How you gonna survive on your own? The U.N.'s got some conference in two days. The holiday's over ragheads everywhere trying to score. U.N. security at every hotel little creeps with lapel pins. Even I've been out. This is where our money is: Europe, Asia, not the streets you wouldn't know crack from Where's Robert?
LETOUR: Where's Robert?
ANN: Busting his ass. He's out doing your It was a confusion.
LETOUR: It was a confusion.
ANN: Get confused on your day off.
LETOUR: When is that?
ANN: Don't get wise. What do you want me to do? Suck your dick? okay. A raise? No way. Get out there. There's a list on the TV. I love you. Get your ass outta here before I kiss I'm on my way. Love you. Forgive me.
LETOUR: ( pecks her cheek ) I'm on my way. Love you. Forgive me.
AU BAR: LeTour's sedan waits between limos. Inside, JOHN passes the MAÎTRE D', looks around: he's known here. Au Bar, a restaurant/club open 9:00 p. m. to 4:00 a. m., caters to the young, the rich, the European. He spots TIS with THOMAS, twenty-five, his handsome trainer, and TWO MODELS at a second-floor table. They exchange nods. LETOUR scans the room: suspicion is second nature. A laughing man ( GUIDONE ) at the bar catches his eye. He seems to blend: Italian, twenty-eight, silk suit, impeccable hair, accent but something's not right. His black shoes have rubber soles. LETOUR looks for a gun bulge, dirty hands. The ITALIAN turns; LETOUR glimpses his face: too pale. The ITALIAN averts his eyes. Glancing back, LETOUR walks up the stairs to Tis' table.
TIS: Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this is Gabri, Tasha you know Thomas. They're here for a show.
LETOUR: ( to TIS ) How'd it turn out?
TIS: ( to GABRI ) Questo è un vero Americano. ( to LETOUR )
LETOUR: St. Luke's.
TIS: No problem, but can you believe this? she's out of the hospital in one day, calls me up, wants to "get together." Some people are just born for losing. Want to go in back?
LETOUR: Not now.
TIS: Look at the bar. Black-haired guy, late twenties, brown suit, drinking He's casing you. Not me, you. Undercover, whatever he's on you.
LETOUR: Look at the bar. Black-haired guy, late twenties, brown suit, drinking He's casing you. Not me, you. Undercover, whatever he's on you.
TIS: You know him?
LETOUR: ( shakes head "no" ) Just a feeling. You holding?
TIS: No. Need help?
LETOUR: ( "no" ) Leave a message. Robert or I will come by later.
TIS: Forget it. It wasn't for me anyway. Who am I trying to impress? Make it tomorrow. A half no, three- Nineteen is the top. I'll make two Nineteen is fine.
LETOUR: Nineteen is the top. I'll make two Nineteen is fine.
TIS: Nineteen is fine.
LETOUR: ( leaving ) A domani. Take care, girls.
LETOUR: ( voice over ) I feel my life turning. All it needed was a direction. You drift from day to day, years go by. Suddenly there is a direction. What a strange thing to happen halfway through your life.
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD: ( out of shot ) Paramount Hotel.
LETOUR: Marianne Jost, please.
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD: ( out of shot ) Just a moment.
HOTEL MESSAGE: "Welcome to the Paramount. Your party is out. If you would like to leave a message for
'MARIANNE JOST': ( back to message ) please do so after the beep."
PHONE CALLS: Midday. Twenty-second Street. A helter-skelter of daytime activity unseen before. John's apartment. Sunlight fills the studio apartment. LETOUR, unshaven in T-shirt and slacks, sets the phone on the desk beside his open composition book. He pauses, dials.
HOTEL SWITCHBOARD: ( out of shot ) Paramount Hotel.
LETOUR: Marianne Jost.

LETOUR: Are the funeral arrangements local?
MEDICAL VOICE: ( out of shot ) Just a sec yes, Plaza Memorial.
LETOUR: Thank you.
MEDICAL VOICE: ( out of shot ) You're welcome.
DIRTY LAUNDRY: Afternoon. Chelsea laundromat. Mothers and maids gossip, sort clothes. Hispanic radio underscores the whirl of LETOUR, unshaven, shoves dirty clothes into a washer. He counts out quarters, starts the machine. Heading toward a vacant chair, he spots a MAN out the window. It takes a second to place the face: it's the "Italian" from Au Bar in street clothes. He watches JOHN watching him. LETOUR walks outside, approaches GUIDONE on the sidewalk:
LETOUR: Can I help you, officer?
GUIDONE: I hope I haven't made a mistake. You are a cop, aren't you?
LETOUR: I hope I haven't made a mistake. You are a cop, aren't you?
GUIDONE: Could I see a badge?
LETOUR: Could I see a badge?
GUIDONE: ( shows credentials ) Bill Guidone.
LETOUR: What is it?
GUIDONE: You think you're invisible, don't you? You think we don't know you, LeTour that's the name you use, My father's a partner in a powerful law firm. If you have anything in mind, do it by the book.
LETOUR: My father's a partner in a powerful law firm. If you have anything in mind, do it by the book.
GUIDONE: ( in his face ) You? Who the fuck cares about you? I could grind you right here! maybe I will! and nobody would give a fuck! You're not worth the paperwork. I look like Narcotics? I'm Homicide I'm investigating the Park murder.
LETOUR: ( acquiescent ) I don't follow the news.
GUIDONE: Downtown's interested how a Barnard honors student with fancy parents got a quarter of uncut coke on her when she was murdered. I mean, we just don't see this girl cruising Alphabet City trying to score. Somebody sold her, somebody upscale and classy you're classy, I hear and that somebody knows something we need to know. Delivery boy!
LETOUR: I wish I could help. I don't even know who's president.
GUIDONE: Let me put it this way. Here's my Ask around, take a week or so. Call me. Tell me something I don't know. Either that, leave town, or get your ass busted day in, day out.
FUNERAL HOME: Evening. LETOUR, shaven, in black tweed jacket, white shirt, black tie, crosses Amsterdam Avenue, enters Plaza Memorial Inside funeral home, JOHN checks the letterboard for Mrs. Jost's name. An arrow directs him. Nondenominational muzak. Senior citizens whisper off-screen. Walking, he sees MARIANNE, dressed in black. She sees him, turns to him; her face hollow, desperate:
MARIANNE: Get out.
LETOUR: ( emotion rising ) Every time you come into my life something terrible happens. I thought I was rid of you. How'd you get here? I don't want you here! I don't want you around me, I don't want you around my mother! Damn you!
MARIANNE: ( emotion rising ) Every time you come into my life something terrible happens. I thought I was rid of you. How'd you get here? I don't want you here! I don't want you around me, I don't want you around my mother! Damn you!
LETOUR: ( wild ) Get out!
MARIANNE: ( wild ) Get out!
LETOUR: I didn't.
RANDI: I'm sorry. That's the way it is. You shouldn't have come. Marianne has been up all night, crying and crying. She wasn't there when Mother passed died she blames herself. It wouldn't have made any difference. She just slipped away. Marianne's I'm worried

ROBERT: We're going Chinese tonight, okay? I mean we're on a roll
ANN: Spring roll.
LETOUR: ( preparing to leave ) Sure, whatever. Surprise me.
INTERVENTION: Eddie's high-rise apartment. EDDIE is worse, if anything. He's been scoring on the street: broken pipes and vials crunch EDDIE and LETOUR argue ( "Fuck you!" "Fuck you!" ). EDDIE spits, pushes TOUR, JOHN pushes back. Eddie's feet tangle. He trips, FALLS. A bottle SMASHES. JOHN goes to the phone, checks Eddie's directory, dials.
EDDIE: ( on floor ) You gotta get permission? Check with I'm calling your brother.
LETOUR: I'm calling your brother.
EDDIE: Yeah, the lawyer in Bronxville. I'm gonna ask him to come over. You've told me so much about him.

LETOUR: ( on phone ) He'll be here.
LEXINGTON AVENUE: LETOUR walks from his sedan around the corner to the Lexington Avenue entrance to Grace Towers, a pre-war apartment building. In the lobby, he gives his name to the SECURITY GUARD, is directed to the express elevator. He exits on the thirtieth floor; footsteps muted by thick Victorian prints on dark blue walls. He looks about, approaches a door, presses the buzzer. THOMAS opens the door; JOHN enters Tis' opulent apartment. Salle and Clemente hang on the walls; New York twinkles outside panoramic windows. A pipe and syringe lie atop art books. TIS, in jogging sweats, comes from the bedroom to greet him.
TIS: Tour, just in time. We were out. Nineteen, right?
LETOUR: Thirty-eight hundred got any Some, not the whole thing. You got hundreds?
TIS: Some, not the whole thing. You got hundreds?
THOMAS: LETOUR hands him a plastic bag of gram envelopes. TIS opens a packet, pours the contents on the coffee table.
TIS: I like that about Ann. Always takes the time to grind it. If you do it, do it right.
TIS: ( to MARIANNE ) Looks like you could use some help. ( MARIANNE looks up, sees JOHN, goes pale ) Mari, this is Tour. You got any
TIS: Not the talkative type. Haven't seen her in years. You know her, don't Why they call me? What a nightmare. You want it or not?

TIS: See you later.

CARLOS: Where to?
LETOUR: Where to, sir? Where are we going?
CARLOS: Where to, sir? Where are we going?
LETOUR: Nowhere just now. Wait.
CARLOS: ( after a moment ) You want me to wait here?
LETOUR: Pause. More police cars. The EMS siren starts up; the ambulance speeds downtown past LeTour's sedan. No reaction. CARLOS turns off the engine.
LETOUR: CARLOS starts the car, pulls into traffic.
CARLOS: CARLOS starts the car, pulls into traffic.
NEWSCASTER: ( out of shot radio ) This story is just in. A woman has fallen thirty stories to her death from a posh Grace Towers apartment on Lexington Avenue.

We will bring you more details as we get them. ( teletype efx ) An end to the sanitation strike seems imminent. Negotiations at the Helmsley Palace are continuing to this hour.
MOTHER TERESA: First light. Jones Street. LETOUR, sleepless, pounds on Teresa's door. No answer. Knocks again. Again. Noises from inside. A sleepy voice:
TERESA: ( out of shot ) Who is it?
LETOUR: John. John LeTour. Can I see you?

LETOUR: It's important, Teresa.

LETOUR: ( she shrugs ) Am I lucky?
TERESA: Yes. Don't be afraid. Go home.
LETOUR: What do I owe you?
TERESA: Nothing. Forget it. Let me sleep.
SNITCH: Mid-morning. LETOUR, still awake, walks past towering Chelsea He passes a newsstand. Tabloids feature yearbook photo of MARIANNE; the headline: "Fall from Grace." LETOUR walks to a pay phone, takes out Guidone's card, inserts a quarter, dials.

LETOUR: That it'd be like this like, your life, you. that it would turn out this way?
ROBERT: Compared to what? My thinking this or that is going to make any difference? There's a plan unfolding. "Will my plane crash?" "Does life have meaning?" why ask me? Thinking's a fear of living, negative living; living's something else. You're afraid. Let the plan unfold. Stop. Stop, live one day one day
LETOUR: day at a time.
ROBERT: day at a time.
LETOUR: ( touches ROBERT ) You've lost your fucking brain.

LETOUR: A lie. I don't want to go. The suicide and all. Let's stay away.

LAST RIDE: Night. ANN and LETOUR side by side in the sedan. CARLOS, at the wheel, anonymous. Outside, SANITATION WORKERS toss sacks of trash into garbage trucks: the strike is over. ANN reminisces as lights flash:
ANN: It's going to be strange, not doing this. I mean I've had it, but You're gonna do it, aren't you? You're gonna quit.
LETOUR: You're gonna do it, aren't you? You're gonna quit.
ANN: ( nods ) I think so. Seal this thing with Tis, turn it go with the cosmetics. You gotta take a chance in life. No risk, no gain. I've already got retail connections here, London. It was great at the beginning, though.
LETOUR: You know, when we first started out of the place on Greene Street. Before deliveries, when you were still using. It was open house every night but Sunday. We had everything: uppers, downers, meth, six kinds of hash, all in that trousseau, remember? You could get in for a gram, stay all night everybody, music people, movies, Wall Street, fashion even politics. I think like five marriages came out of those parties, babies really. God. You stayed, you then Robert but he. I'da never thought you'd, what is it, twelve years? Others, lucky a year max, eight months, in, out, start using, unreliable nice kids. Remember when you first came: long hair, dirty fingers

Remember when you first came: long hair, dirty fingers
LETOUR: ( overlapping ) You made me
ANN: never washed
LETOUR: khaki pants.
ANN: I should write a book someday. Did you know somebody wanted to do my story? Ghostwrite. It was impossible, of course my lawyer freaked I even had the meeting. People envy me. They think my life is so glamorous, but they don't know. I know. Glamorous. It was for a while. Then came crack and fucked everything.
LETOUR: I gotta stop home a second.
ANN: Why? It's out of the way. They're expecting you. You know I got a bad vibe about Tis.
LETOUR: You know I got a bad vibe about Tis.
ANN: ( unconvincing ) Chill. This is routine.
LETOUR: I want to get my lucky jacket.
ANN: Oh. Okay.
ANN: That took long enough. What did you do, douche while you were at it?
LETOUR: Ann, you got some mouth on you.
ANN: You don't want to know where it's For you.
LETOUR: For you.
ANN: Phew. It smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. It's no good for your skin. All chemicals.
ANN: What's that?
LETOUR: Do me a favor.
ANN: Don't ask why, just promise.
LETOUR: Don't ask why, just promise.
ANN: What is it?
LETOUR: ( testing again ) If anything happens to me if I should like, you know, fucking die write and tell her.
LETOUR: It's my sister. Her husband's in San Quentin. She worries, you know.
ANN: ( eye contact )
LETOUR: I thought we were going to Tis'?
ANN: We are. He's here. He can't very well work out of his apartment after what happened yesterday, can he?
ANN: ( on phone ) Mathis Bruge, please. ( beat ) Tis? Ann. I'm here with Tour. ( beat ) ( hangs up )
LETOUR: Tis there?
ANN: They go to the elevators, wait with CHATTY CARD COLLECTORS [Pete Rose this, Pete Rose that]. Twelfth floor. ANN and JOHN step out of the elevator, look for 1204. LETOUR, a step behind, is all eyes, all ears. ANN checks the number, rings the bell. THOMAS lets them in the standard issue suite, locks the door. LETOUR was right: it's a set-up. THOMAS and a TEENAGE CUBAN stand either side of them, waistbands conspicuously bulging. No TIS. JOHN turns to ANN:
LETOUR: ( Jesus-to-Judas )
ANN: I told you greasy fucks I don't deal with guns! I see guns, I walk! How dare you?
ANN: And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass!
THOMAS: ( pointing gun ) Hold it! Stop right there.
TIS: ( to THOMAS ) ( to ANN ) Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I was just trying to make a point I
TIS: ( about THOMAS and
CUBAN ): Assholes. What a nightmare. We'll make the deal tomorrow same terms. Ann. Sorry. Go on, leave, you're upset. I just need to talk to Tour a second. About a police matter. Go on.
LETOUR: ( to ANN ) Go on.
TIS: Tour and I need to get our stories straight. Somebody's talking to the police. The guns were for emphasis, to make a point, dumb
ANN: ( to TIS ) We came together, we're leaving ( to LETOUR ) Johnny, come with me.
TIS: ( a command )
TIS: ( to ANN ) Don't be stupid. Get out. Leave. ( to LETOUR ) I had nothing to do with Marianne she jumped: she was there, then she was gone. ( nods ANN to leave ) Nothing will happen to Tour. ( out of shot ) Fire! Fire! Fire! ( desperate ) I didn't
ANN: ( out of shot ) Fire! Fire! Fire! ( desperate ) I didn't
TIS: ( desperate ) I didn't
LETOUR: Checks watch.
ANN: Checks watch.
LETOUR: Twenty minutes. You look terrific.
ANN: I look respectable. Any news?
LETOUR: Sentencing's in ten days supposed to be. Because of the extenuating circumstances our cooperation they say it won't be more than five years maybe seven. With time served, good behavior, parole, I could be out in two years maybe. I hope.
ANN: It feels like forever.
LETOUR: It's not so bad. It's a relief in a way at least so far. I've been writing, reading.
ANN: I love your letters.
LETOUR: How's business?
ANN: Robert quit. He went back to dealing. I think he thought it would be less work, more money. It's lucky in a way I got mixed up in it now I have to see this thing through. So it's cosmetics after all.
LETOUR: ( affectionate ) I miss you.
ANN: Me too.
LETOUR: Did we ever fuck?
ANN: What do you mean?
LETOUR: You know, make love.
ANN: ( thinks ) There was that party when everybody was so stoned, but oh yeah, that night you came over and crashed and we slept together.
LETOUR: We were naked, but did we ?
ANN: You had a hard-on.
LETOUR: I didn't
ANN: You tried.
LETOUR: I was thinking about it and I realized we never really did. It's one of the things I think about. It's one of the things I look forward to. I've been looking forward.
ANN: Me too.
LETOUR: ( touches her hand ) Something can be right in front of you and you can't see it.
ANN: ( kisses his hand ) Strange how things work.
