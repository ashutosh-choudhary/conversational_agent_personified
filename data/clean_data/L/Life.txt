"LIFE": Screenplay by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone
SHOOTING DRAFT: FADE IN: EXT. PRISON CEMETERY DAY A handful of people are gathered in an open field under a fierce Mississippi sun. A couple of young inmates, JAKE and LEON, lean on their shovels. They are waiting to bury two identical CASKETS with inmate numbers stenciled on the pinewood lids. A GUARD rests the butt of his rifle on the ground and takes a long, healthy pull from his canteen. He offers it to the PRISON CHAPLAIN, who is much obliged. SUPERINTENDENT BILL BURKE, a 40-year-old black man, glances at his watch and loosens his tie. Sure is hot. MARY HUMPHRIES, an elderly white woman in a nurse's uniform, stands behind WILLIE LONG, an ancient inmate sleeping peacefully in a wheelchair. She readjusts an umbrella to shield the old black man from the blistering sun. Burke dabs his forehead with a handkerchief. He gives the nod to the chaplain, who steps forward and cracks his bible. The men remove their hats.
CHAPLAIN: In accordance with the regulations of the State of Mississippi, we gather here today to lay to rest the remains of inmates R. Gibson, number 4316, and C. Banks, number 4317. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God have mercy on their souls.
BURKE: Go ahead, fellas.
NURSE HUMPHRIES: I'll come back for you in a little while, Willie. These two guys friends of yours, old We spent some time together.
JAKE: These two guys friends of yours, old We spent some time together.
WILLIE: We spent some time together.
LEON: Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
WILLIE: I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
LEON: 1932? That's like, that's like.
WILLIE: Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
JAKE: Hey, the dude's holdin'.
LEON: Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers
LEON: Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
JAKE: I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Damn, that shit's nasty.
WILLIE: Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
LEON: What were they, bootleggers? Something like that.
WILLIE: Something like that.
BOUNCER: Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
RAY: Is Spanky here?
BOUNCER: No, but.
RAY: Then what's the problem?
BOUNCER: Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is.

COCKTAIL WAITRESS: I get off at two, but you ain't never getting off.
BARKEEP: You can't drink that in here, Ray.
RAY: I sure can't drink that watered-down swill you're serving. Give me a glass of ice.
BARKEEP: I can't give you a glass of ice. I can't give you anything until you pay your damn tab.
CLAUDE: For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
DAISY: Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
CLAUDE: Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
CLAUDE: Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line. What's wrong, baby?
DAISY: I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
CLAUDE: Engagement ring!
DAISY: That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right

RAY: ( displeased ) You have any of that French stuff?
ATTENDENT: Here you go.

ATTENDENT: Why, thank you, sir!
RAY: Don't I know you?
CLAUDE: I don't think so.
RAY: Sure I do. What's your name again?
CLAUDE: Claude Banks.
RAY: Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school You went to Monroe?
CLAUDE: You went to Monroe?
RAY: ( beaming ) That's right! Good old Monroe.
CLAUDE: Well, I went to Jefferson, so you must have a different Claude Banks in mind.
RAY: Sorry, man. My mistake.
RAY: Watch the threads, Bullethead. If this is about my tab, I've got it
BULLETHEAD: This ain't about your tab, Ray. You've got bigger problems than that.
BOUNCER: Is that Ray Gibson? Who the hell let him in here?
CLAUDE: Come on, honey, let's get out of But I'm having a good time.
DAISY: But I'm having a good time.
WAITER: Excuse me, sir, I believe you forgot
CLAUDE: The bill. Of course, the bill. We couldn't leave without paying the bill. Especially such an incredibly large bill.
RAY: Save your energy, Claude. You're gonna need it.
RAY: Here, this belongs to you. It was empty when I found it.
CLAUDE: Good old Monroe. What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
RAY: What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
CLAUDE: I don't see where that's any of your Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
RAY: Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
CLAUDE: Where they taking us, anyway?
RAY: Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
CLAUDE: Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
RAY: I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
CLAUDE: ( sotto ) What are they gonna do to us?
RAY: You? Dine and ditch, right? Over ten bucks? You're probably looking at a thumb.
CLAUDE: A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks? That include the tip?
SPANKY: ( from the darkness ) You picked the wrong night to fuck with me, Ray. I just lost three men and a truck full of Canadian whiskey. You know what that kind of thing does to my business? It makes me want to lash out and hurt somebody.
SPANKY: Who's he? Friend of yours, Ray?
CLAUDE: I never saw this man before tonight. He's a lowlife degenerate who lurks in bathrooms. I'm a professional man, an upstanding citizen. I go to church on Sunday.
SPANKY: Then what are you doing here?
BULLETHEAD: Failure to pay.
CLAUDE: ( rattled ) Look, Mr. Johnson, you seem like a reasonable man. I got a good job starts Monday. I'll pay you back with my first pay check. With interest. I don't want to tell you how to conduct your business, but if you cut off my finger you won't get jack. Working an adding machine, I gotta be whole. ( his fingers dancing over imaginary keys ) I need my thumbs and all my fingers for praying and doing good.
SPANKY: The choirboy wants to keep his fingers. Who am I to argue? Drop Drop him? What does drop him mean?
CLAUDE: Drop him? What does drop him mean?
SPANKY: You gotta lotta balls showing your face around my club. If a man's gonna run numbers on my side of Broadway, you think he'd have the common sense to keep a low profile. But not Ray
CLAUDE: No, not down there! That water's filthy! Help me out here, man!
RAY: You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
SPANKY: But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
RAY: Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
CLAUDE: I was supposed to wear this suit on
SPANKY: What's that, some of your bathtub Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
RAY: Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
SPANKY: Where'd you get this?
RAY: Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
SPANKY: I'm interested. Keep talking.
RAY: All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
SPANKY: If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
RAY: Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
SPANKY: Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
RAY: I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
SPANKY: If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
RAY: I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is
SPANKY: For your sake, I hope you can drive. Somebody give him some dry clothes.
RAY: Tell me about that hot sketch you were hypin' last night. She was a choice bit of calico. You two been seeing each other a long time? Gonna slap the handcuffs on her and stroll down the aisle one of these days?
RAY: Sometimes I wish I could find me a sheba to settle down with. Suppose I'm just a tomcat by nature. This little rum run is gonna seriously improve my relationship with Spanky. He's a good man to have on your side. He's got the capital and the connections. That's what you got to have in that business. Spanky's place is pretty plush, but one of these days I'm gonna open up my own establishment. Ray's Boom-Boom Room. You like that? Ray's Boom-Boom Room. That's in the groove, don't you think?
RAY: Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
CLAUDE: Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
RAY: Start your job? What kind of job?
CLAUDE: Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of That's some long green.
RAY: That's some long green.
CLAUDE: Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
CLAUDE: No, tell me what's so funny.
RAY: No, tell me what's so funny.
CLAUDE: No, tell me what's so funny.
RAY: I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
CLAUDE: Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
RAY: Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
CLAUDE: I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
RAY: Why didn't you take it?
CLAUDE: The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
RAY: You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
CLAUDE: At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
RAY: You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
CLAUDE: Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
RAY: A loan officer?
CLAUDE: That's right, a loan officer.
RAY: So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like
CLAUDE: Ray pulls out his pocket watch. A mechanical tune plays as he checks the time.
RAY: How would I get a loan, anyway?
CLAUDE: You need collateral.
RAY: ( re: watch ) Like this?
CLAUDE: That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
RAY: My daddy gave me this watch.
CLAUDE: Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
RAY: My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
CLAUDE: Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
RAY: Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
CLAUDE: There is no Boom-Boom Room.
RAY: When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
CLAUDE: I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
RAY: I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
RAY: Man, something smells good in here. How's everybody doing?

BLOCKER: We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
CLAUDE: You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
BLOCKER: Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
CLAUDE: You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
BLOCKER: Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
CLAUDE: Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
BLOCKER: There are ways around that. Right
BLOCKER: Nice looking squad. See you after the game.
MRS. ABERNATHY: Of course, the superintendent's hoping for a boy, but personally, I'd prefer a girl.
MRS. DILLARD: Whatever it is will be a little gift from heaven. Look at the way she
CLAUDE: You're my boy, just keep what little mind you have focused on the game. If you hit that ball the way I know you can, you might just be our ticket off this farm.
BLOCKER: Mark my words, within five years there's gonna be a colored man playing in the majors.
RAY: Come on, the world hasn't changed that much.
BLOCKER: Maybe not yet. But it will. And I'll be out of a job. Damn, that's some tasty hooch.
CLAUDE: It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
RAY: So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
BLOCKER: I think that boy could be the next Josh Gibson. I'm gonna talk to the front office about him, you can bet on that. Damn, it's getting late. We got a game in Memphis tomorrow.
CLAUDE: What about us? Don't forget to mention We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
RAY: We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
BLOCKER: I'll put in a good word for you. You've done a good job with that boy. Thanks for your hospitality.
ABERNATHY: Uh, doctor.
DOCTOR: She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
ABERNATHY: Is Mae Rose okay?
DOCTOR: She's doing just fine.
ABERNATHY: And the baby?
DOCTOR: ( vague ) He's a big one.
ABERNATHY: It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
ABERNATHY: Well, where is he? Where's my new
POKER FACE: You really think they'll let him out of here just to play baseball?
WILLIE: Why not? Boy's got God-given talent.
CLAUDE: God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
RAY: Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
CLAUDE: ( glancing out the window ) Heads up, here comes trouble.

BISCUIT: Hell with him. It ain't that.
RAY: These are free papers.
BISCUIT: ( devastated ) What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.

CLAUDE: Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
BLOCKER: Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
CLAUDE: Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
BLOCKER: I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
RAY: Let it go, Claude.
CLAUDE: I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you.
BLOCKER: Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you.
CLAUDE: But you can't.
BLOCKER: At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
CLAUDE: ( resigned ) Yeah. Of course it is.

RAY: One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
CLAUDE: I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
RAY: He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
CLAUDE: They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right I don't see you coming up with any My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now.

RAY: Crop duster.
CLAUDE: I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
RAY: My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
CLAUDE: Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
RAY: Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
CLAUDE: Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
RAY: Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
CLAUDE: The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
RAY: Well, if that's the way it is.
CLAUDE: That's the way it is.
RAY: Then I have nothing left to say to
CLAUDE: You never said nothing of value
RAY: Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.

CLAUDE: Take care of me?
YVETTE: You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
CLAUDE: I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
YVETTE: Want me to come back some other time?
CLAUDE: ( shaking his head ) Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said

DILLARD: As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
CLAUDE: As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
DILLARD: We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles if one toe so much as touches the dirt one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
DILLARD: How about it, Ray?
DILLARD: I'll make you trusty right now. If that pie-eatin' son of a bitch falls off those bottles and you have to shoot him, I'll see to it you get a pardon. Hell, I'll personally escort you out the gate.
RAY: You don't want to give me a gun, boss. I'm liable to use it on you.
CLAUDE: You're a sucker. I'd have taken that Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
RAY: Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
CLAUDE: I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
RAY: After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
CLAUDE: I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
RAY: I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all. I was sorry to hear about your mama That was five years ago.
CLAUDE: I was sorry to hear about your mama That was five years ago.
RAY: That was five years ago.
CLAUDE: I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
RAY: We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
CLAUDE: You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.

DILLARD: Fourteen acres today and only 12 hours of daylight! Eat up and move it out! Gibson! Banks! Get your sorry asses over here!
DILLARD: Every morning I wake up praying that Ray Gibson and Claude Banks have died in their sleep and every morning you disappoint me.
DILLARD: I stand before you a defeated man. Try as I might, I can't seem to break you. I swear, if they dropped a nuclear bomb on this camp, you and the cockroaches would be the only things left. But starting today at least I won't have to endure your presence any longer. You've got fifteen minutes to clear out your footlockers. You're both being reassigned to the Superintendent's mansion. And I, for one, will not miss you.
RAY: I always wanted to do that. There is so much love inside of this

CLAUDE: Yes, boss.
WILKINS: You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
CLAUDE: Ocean views, palm trees, two heated swimming pools and a golf course sounds a damn sight better than that infirmary across the way where I'm gonna end up.
WILKINS: I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
CLAUDE: That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
WILKINS: You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
CLAUDE: Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
WILKINS: Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
CLAUDE: It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
WILKINS: Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
CLAUDE: You have to forgive me if I don't
RAY: You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
CLAUDE: He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
RAY: Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
CLAUDE: I'm not working on a plan.
RAY: You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
CLAUDE: Goodnight, Ray.
RAY: What the hell are you doing?
CLAUDE: Don't touch that car.
CLAUDE: Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.

RAY: You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
CLAUDE: I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.

CLAUDE: You ain't getting out of that trunk.
RAY: Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here. We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
CLAUDE: Go where, Ray?
RAY: Back to New York for starters.
CLAUDE: And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.

WILKINS: Come on, Claude, time to go.
RAY: You sure it was him?
CLAUDE: Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
RAY: I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
CLAUDE: We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
RAY: I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
WILKINS: I prefer bourbon.
PIKE: I prefer bourbon.
WILKINS: I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
PIKE: Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
WILKINS: Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
PIKE: You don't have to twist my arm. Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
WILKINS: Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
CLAUDE: Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
WILKINS: Goodnight, Claude.
PIKE: If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
WILKINS: I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
PIKE: ( sarcastic ) Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
WILKINS: If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
WILKINS: Well, that's a pretty good haul. What do you say, Mr. Pike? Ready to call it a day?
PIKE: Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
RAY: That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
PIKE: Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
RAY: Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
PIKE: Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
RAY: Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
PIKE: ( eyes narrowing ) Something like that, yes.
RAY: She give you that scar, too?
PIKE: I oughta shoot you for that comment, Like you shot Winston Hancock?
RAY: Like you shot Winston Hancock?
WILKINS: What's going on here?
PIKE: I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in That's Mr. Uppity Nigger to you.
RAY: That's Mr. Uppity Nigger to you.
CLAUDE: Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
WILKINS: He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
RAY: I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
PIKE: Shoot him, Wilkins!
CLAUDE: Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
RAY: He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
PIKE: He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Do you realize what your saying, That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
WILKINS: Do you realize what your saying, That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.

PIKE: Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
RAY: He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
WILKINS: Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
PIKE: What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
CLAUDE: Forty years of cheap labor! Gimme that gun.
RAY: No, I'm gonna kill him
CLAUDE: No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
CLAUDE: I can't do it.
RAY: That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
CLAUDE: What'd you say?
RAY: I said you're soft.

DEPUTY #1: Where were the two convicts when the shot was fired?

CLAUDE: ( giving him a hand ) Sure, boss.
WILKINS: I'm not your boss. Not anymore.

CLAUDE: Looks like old Jonesy finally got his walking papers.
RAY: Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
CLAUDE: 'Course I was right. About what?

BURKE: How did it start?
FIRE INSPECTOR: Probably old wires. The place was a tinderbox just waiting to go.
BURKE: I guess we should have torn this old building down a long time ago.
FIRE INSPECTOR: Gibson made it this far before he was probably overcome by smoke. From the look of things, Banks never even made it out of bed. Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story. Nigger, you crying?
