LOOPER: Written by Rian Johnson
LATER: Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck. Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them.
BEATRIX: Bon jour, Joe.
JOE: Bon jour, Beatrix.
BEATRIX: How's the French?
JOE: Slow. How's the coffee?
BEATRIX: Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down.
JOE: Two, Jedd.
DALE: Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?
JOE: Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves his gun and exits.
DALE: Four, Jedd.
LATER: On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.
JOE: Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!
JOE: Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok.
SETH: Walk around! Around, I'm not kidding. Wide around, ya shit. The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.
JOE: Hi Joe.
SETH: Hi Joe.
JOE: That's new. Seth kicks the bike.
SETH: Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going to the Belle?
JOE: Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick with rubber on the road.
SETH: Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them, they get respect.
JOE: They get respect cause they run the town. How much did that thing set you back? How much? Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.
SETH: I was gonna pull up in it. Tonight. Heads or tails, call it in the air. The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.
JOE: Congratulations. You're pulling up with me instead. Joe notices the floating quarter.
SETH: Chicks dig TKs.
JOE: It's tacky, don't do it. Seth catches the quarter, sullen.
BIG CRAIG: No loopers in the club on Wednesdays, Joe. Gat men only. Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him.
JOE: We'll stick backstage, just meeting up. In and out.
BIG CRAIG: Packing your blunderbusses?
JOE: Hardly. Right Seth?
SETH: Hardly. I'm with Joe. Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.
SETH: So are we - hey - Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.
MADAME: No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat Men only.
JOE: So I've read. He ducks out.
SETH: Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what- And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.
JOE: Zach. In there right now, with Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his For what?
DALE: Zach. In there right now, with Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his For what?
JOE: For what?
DALE: He closed his loop. This lands heavily on Joe.
JOE: No shit? The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder then retracts into the door. The loopers watch him in awe.
ZACH: So are we celebrating? At the bottom of the stairs, a skinny young thug in ratty jeans. This is KID BLUE.
KID BLUE: No loopers on fucking Wednesdays! The loopers collectively flip him off.
ZACH: Suck one, kid!
BRAKES: EXT. VAGRANT VILLAGE - NIGHT Screaming to a halt just shy of a malnourished BEGGAR KID. Caught in the headlights. Behind him, a miserable vagrant village in a field.
JOE: Sell that goddamn slat bike back. That's a lot of stupid money.
SETH: I got stupid money. Seth holds his hand under fuzzy dice hanging from Joe's mirror, and they spin.
JOE: Seth stumbles toward his door, checks his pants.
SETH: I think I did something. You know what? TKs are special. Fuck you.
JOE: Hey Seth. Seth slumps against the car.
SETH: So in five, ten years you're back to riding the rails, or worse you're like Kid Blue, working as a gat man, wagging your dick at loopers and roughing up shop clerks for payoff money.
JOE: So in five, ten years you're back to riding the rails, or worse you're like Kid Blue, working as a gat man, wagging your dick at loopers and roughing up shop clerks for payoff money.
SETH: Fuckin Kid Blue.
JOE: Save a little something. Alright? Cause that'll be yours, and then you've got yours and that's all that matters, your life is your I gots mine you gots yours. I wish I was smart like you. Saint Joe. Seth pats Joe's cheek, and waddles off towards his apartment.
SETH: I gots mine you gots yours. I wish I was smart like you. Saint Joe. Seth pats Joe's cheek, and waddles off towards his apartment.
BEATRIX: Bon jour Joe.
JOE: Ravi de te voir, Beatrix.
BEATRIX: Ooh la la.
DALE: What's that, fourth loop closed this month? Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his eyebrows at passing ladies.
JOE: On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage.
SUZIE: You working a shift tonight?
JOE: You working a shift tonight?
SUZIE: ( REALIZES )
JOE: Sweetie. I gotta work. She leaves him watching her go. He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen this whole exchange. The Kid smirks.
SUZIE: Sweetie. I gotta work. She leaves him watching her go. He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen this whole exchange. The Kid smirks.
JOE: Jesus, Seth.
SETH: They're gonna be here any minute, are they here?
JOE: No, they're not here. Who?
SETH: Christ. Joe. Christ. Joe's eyes focus a bit, he tunes in to the situation. Turns the apartment lights off.
JOE: Seth, sit down here. CRASH! Seth knocks something over in the dark. Joe opens the fridge, pale light. Seth sits at the kitchen table.
SETH: Late to my own funeral. Mom always Tell me now.
JOE: Tell me now.
SETH: Christ, Joe. Late to my own goddamn funeral. Can you help me?
JOE: Seth, what did you do?
SETH: You can protect me a little, right? Just so they don't. jeez. Oh jeez. This is like a nightmare. This is a nightmare.
SETH: He was singing.
SETH: Joe I can't even tell you. Looking in his eyes. I had to let him talk, then. I don't even remember the words, but I remember believing every one of them, or not even believing, but submitting. I've never felt that small before. I've never felt that happy. He told me. I remember, there's a new holy terror boss-man in the future, and he's closing all the loops. The Rainmaker, they call him. He told Then he wanted a cigarette and I untied him, and he gives me this look. And he just starts running.
SETH: What do I do? You're the only friend I got Joe you gotta help me
JOE: You fucking idiot coming here. Seth, sucker punched.
SETH: Joe? A little - where am I gonna -
JOE: You hop a freight train, you beat it the hell out POUND POUND POUND. On the door this time. Seth makes a sound like he's going to die, Joe closes the fridge, hisses
KID BLUE: Open up Joe! ( to the gat man ) Watch the window.
JOE: I can't do anything for you Seth. Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand.
SETH: No! You gotta hide me! Joe, hide me, please Christ please Joe please hide me tell em something to buy time and I'll leave please-
JOE: Hold on! Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision. He flips the lights on, and briskly pulls back his oriental rug. A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad. He enters a code, opens it. Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big enough for a man. Seth scrambles in. Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face, framed by the gold bars, then closes the safe and smooths the oriental rug. POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door. Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the apartment with over-eager purpose. One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's kitchen table. Kid Blue gets in Joe's face.
KID BLUE: That took awhile.
JOE: You think it's easy looking this Tye's going to watch your apartment while we go have a talk with Abe. Joe grabs a jacket.
KID BLUE: Tye's going to watch your apartment while we go have a talk with Abe. Joe grabs a jacket.
JOE: There's coffee in the tin.
TYE: Thank you.
LATER: Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid stares daggers and spins his gun. Joe tries his best not to You know why they call that pea shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's impossible to hit anything farther than 15 feet, and impossible to miss anything closer. A gun for fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat. A gat has range. Accuracy. His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome.
KID BLUE: You know why they call that pea shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's impossible to hit anything farther than 15 feet, and impossible to miss anything closer. A gun for fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat. A gat has range. Accuracy. His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome.
JOE: Alright, cut it out Kid. You're gonna blow your foot off again. The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins.
KID BLUE: You're right, it'd be real easy for it to accidentally go off. He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably.
JOE: KID BLUE
KID BLUE: Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper. Joe stifles a chuckle. In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the face. Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe. Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory. Lowers his gun.
KID BLUE: S'alright, s'alright. Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again. After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the tension breaks.
ABE: Alright. Joe. Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily.
ABE: My great grandfather always told my grandfather, men's like spiders. It's the little ones you gotta be careful of.
JOE: Dunno I agree with that.
ABE: Oh yeah? Well. What the fuck did my great grandfather know.
ABE: How can you kids stand those chokers? This, the cravats.
JOE: Ridiculous. You're aware we don't have a dress code.
ABE: Ridiculous. You're aware we don't have a dress code.
JOE: ( SHRUGS )
ABE: You know, you don't know, the movies you're dressing like were copying other movies. Goddamn 20th century affectations, do something new. Put a glowing thing around your neck or use. rubberized.. ( waves at Joe's suit ) Be new.
JOE: A beat of silence.
ABE: I do like you, Joe. But we're sure enough Seth paid you a visit we're gonna hafta do something about You're expecting we're gonna break your fingers with a hammer or something awful, and I'm going to diffuse that tension right now, that isn't going to happen. What's going to happen is, I'm going to talk for a little, not even that long, then you're gonna give up your friend.
JOE: You're expecting we're gonna break your fingers with a hammer or something awful, and I'm going to diffuse that tension right now, that isn't going to happen. What's going to happen is, I'm going to talk for a little, not even that long, then you're gonna give up your friend.
ABE: You're expecting we're gonna break your fingers with a hammer or something awful, and I'm going to diffuse that tension right now, that isn't going to happen. What's going to happen is, I'm going to talk for a little, not even that long, then you're gonna give up your friend.
JOE: My friend Seth? I'm confused.
ABE: Well then I'll talk a little. You know you were the youngest looper I ever hired? You looked goddamn ridiculous they said, the blunderbuss up to here on you. But I remember they brought you in, I forget what it was for,
JOE: Watch shop.
ABE: That's yeah, you had rolled one of our fronts, a watch shop. And they had you, your arms pinned, this kid. Like an animal. But you looked at me, your hair stuck to half your face so just this one eye looking at me. And I thought what's this kid lived through, what he had taken away from him. What's he lost. And I could see, like seeing it happen clear as seeing it, the bad path in front of you, the bad version of your life. Like a vision I saw it happen, you turning bad. So I cleaned you up and put a gun in your hand. I gave you something that was yours.
JOE: You know I'm grateful, Abe. Genuine. But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going.
ABE: I gave you something that was yours. And I remember that kid, and I think when you ask yourself you ask who would I sacrifice for what's mine, I think Seth is deep and cozy inside that circle. Pause. Both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk.
JOE: Show you how much I know you, I'm not even gonna break you, just set you back a ways.
ABE: Show you how much I know you, I'm not even gonna break you, just set you back a ways.
JOE: Will you kill him?
ABE: No. Would be too cataclysmic a change to the future. What we'll do is dangerous in that regard, but not as dangerous as killing him, and not by twice as having him run Joe I let him run more than a few days, the boys in the future get nervous, then bing! my replacement shows up. With a gun. So we'll do what we have to do. Floor safe, beneath the rug. 6742. One of the gat men quietly exits.
JOE: Floor safe, beneath the rug. 6742. One of the gat men quietly exits.
ABE: It's the little ones that get you.
ABE: Why don't you kill an hour, Joe. On the house. After Joe exits, Abe and Kid exchange looks.
MADAME: Suzie's just getting off. Doubt she's up for it. He pushes through the velvet curtained door.
JOE: I can't remember my mother's face. I remember her touching my hair. Like this. He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in his eyes.
SUZIE: Do I want to go overseas? With you? Now?
JOE: Soon, maybe.
SUZIE: Baby that's sweet. You're a sweet boy. You gotta be careful, it's easy to think you know someone once you been like this. What's in here is services rendered.
JOE: Is that how it aughta be?
SUZIE: What, in nature?
MINUTESÂ: Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast. He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist himself over. and stops again. His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just gone, its stump worn with age. Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well. A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting, leading out of town. Behind him, the city. Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing has changed to a ragged whistle.
OLD SETH: No no no no no! A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying on the sidewalk. He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing. Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the street and into the headlights of an oncoming car. The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.
JOE: Oh god. Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But Late to my own funeral.
JOE: Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell him keep my bars safe cause I swear to god I'm going to fix this, I'm going to find my loop and I'm gonna kill him. Tell Abe- CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right ear explodes. More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now footsteps running down the hall. Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway, shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.
OLD JOE: EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY We abruptly CUT ON to a very familiar scene. Young Joe stands alone in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw. But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch, confused. 2:30 and change. This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being replayed before our eyes. But when Old Joe does APPEAR, it's different: his hands are tied, his head covered with a sack. And something very different happens: Joe raises his gun and without hesitation PULLS THE TRIGGER. Old Joe's chest explodes. He falls dead. Joe approaches the body, and slows. Sensing something. He pulls off the sack. The face of his older self. Old Joe. He flips him over. Gold bars CLINK beneath a bloody jacket. Joe has closed his loop.
OLD JOE: And your jacket.
OLD JOE: Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement between parked cars. It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the apartment building weighing his options.
KID BLUE: Two more trips. They enter the building. Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van. A GAT MAN DRIVER in the driver's seat.
OLD JOE: Stupid little shit. He lifts him in his arms.
ABE: Maybe. Sweep the train yard. Every second that passes is bad, INT. ABE'S OFFICE Kid Blue slumps in a chair, holding a rag to a wound on his head. Eyes wet from crying. Abe storms in.
ABE: Stupid little shit.
KID BLUE: I can't hear you Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts
ABE: Well that's what happens when you fire a gat in a steel box you stupid little shit.
KID BLUE: I can fix this. I can find him.
ABE: Go home and let the grown ups work. Kid Blue.
JOE: Where would I go if I were me.
BEATRIX: OLD JOE
OLD JOE: Please. Black. And water.
BEATRIX: Anything else?
OLD JOE: ( TO JOE )
JOE: I ordered something.
OLD JOE: Steak and eggs, rare and scrambled.
BEATRIX: Two steak
OLD JOE: We're not going to talk about time Must hurt. His arm.
JOE: OLD JOE
OLD JOE: Must hurt. His arm.
JOE: Yeah. Didn't know if you'd
REMEMBER HER: OLD JOE
OLD JOE: I put it together. Clever.
JOE: I'm not cutting myself again to-
OLD JOE: I'm not asking you to.
JOE: It's an interesting question, I've just lost a lot of blood today.
OLD JOE: You know there's another girl here on weekends.
JOE: ( REALIZES ) OLD JOE
OLD JOE: Well. Have fun explaining who âBeatrix' is for the next thirty Beatrix sets Old Joe's black coffee next to Joe's white.
JOE: OLD JOE
OLD JOE: ( fast in French,
SUBTITLED ): I know you have a gun between your Joe's face registers obvious incomprehension.
JOE: I don't care what you're here for, whatever you think you're going to get from me. More time or whatever you want. I can't let you walk away from this diner alive. Because the next 30 years of my
OLD JOE: You know what the voice of god sounds like? See now good you're confused now but you're listening. I hope the voice of god sounds like an old man speaking French. Old men speaking French sound like primeval trees in a strong wind, just irrefutable. Wise, strong, gentle, all these things in harmony, complimentary. At once. Old men speaking French. Young men speaking French sound, without exception, like weenies. Fact. You ever hear a Frenchman under 40 try to sound threatening? It's hilarious. English is a tight t- shirt, flatters the young. Rat a tat tat. French is a double breasted suit. Young man can put it on, but it always feels like he's putting something on. Some things, you just need the years. It's my favorite language.
JOE: I've got a life ahead of me that's mine and I'm not giving it up for you or anybody
OLD JOE: Well you know what you have to do then why don't you take your little gun out from between your knees and do it. One in the head, two in the heart. Boy. It's all âanybodyâ and âneverâ and then you show up here and think you can talk me into dying. Well bullshit we both know you're not going to kill me. Christ you ordered eggs. Old Joe downs two aspirin. Takes a breath.
JOE: Your face looks backwards.
OLD JOE: Yeah, that helps actually. That little twist of unfamiliar.
JOE: I wasn't trying to. Do you know what's going to happen? Have you already done all this, right now, as me?
OLD JOE: No not - exactly - I don't want to talk about time travel shit, because we'll start talking about it and then we'll be here all day making diagrams with straws. It doesn't matter.
JOE: When I hurt myself now, it changes your body. Do my actions change your memories?
OLD JOE: It doesn't matter because I don't know how it works. Nobody knows how it works. Time travel was an accident, thirty years from now the smartest men in the world know exactly one thing about it that you don't: they know to be scared to death of it.
THIS: ( the left straw ) is the present moment, right now.
AND THIS: ( the right straw ) is the moment thirty years from now when I was sent back. The machine is tuned to a fixed time, you know that, 30 some years, it's not What's the pepper?
JOE: What's the pepper?
OLD JOE: The pepper is a sort of fog. See my memories start clear here, ( at the right straw ) but as they go back they get cloudier, until they're totally obscured. It's like a fog. Because my memories aren't really memories, they're one possible eventuality now, and they grow clearer or cloudier as they become more or less likely. But then they get to the present moment ( the left straw ) And they're instantly clear again. Like a wall of fog moving forward with the present moment. I can remember what you do after you do He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it pushes the pepper with it.
JOE: So you can
OLD JOE: And it hurts.
JOE: So when we're apart you can remember what I do. After I do it.
OLD JOE: Uh huh. But Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates. Old Joe awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws.
JOE: Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his pocket, clicks it open. We don't see inside it, but he stares at it intently.
OLD JOE: She's gonna save your life. Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time, and holds it. Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it, he breaks off his gaze. The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he turns it into anger.
JOE: She's. How is she, you said save my life.
OLD JOE: Your life. Let's look. At your life. You're a killer and a junkie. And a fucking child mentality, âMy life,â âwhat's mine.â Save your life, you're asking how? The question is why. Why would someone waste themselves on you, give up the good life they had, sacrifice a good life to love My life is my own, I don't need it
JOE: My life is my own, I don't need it
SAVED: OLD JOE
OLD JOE: Shut your fucking child mouth. She's going to clean you up and you're going to take her love like a sponge and you're both going to pretend that she's saved you, you're so self absorbed and stupid.
OLD JOE: Have you heard of the Rainmaker?
JOE: Seth said, that night. A new boss in the future, he said.
OLD JOE: The Rainmaker came out of nowhere and in the span of six months took total control of the five major That would take an army.
JOE: That would take an army.
OLD JOE: But he didn't have an army. Legend is he did it alone. Alone alone. Don't know I believe the legend but he didn't have an army.
JOE: How did he do it?
OLD JOE: That's the question. And no one knows. Not only that, there's no pictures of him. It's insane. There's stories he has a synthetic jaw. Things like that. But word spread quick about him through the ex-looper grapevine, even before his mass executions and vagrant purges and reign of terror, because the first thing he did was start closing loops. All of them. Exterminating the whole program. Cleaning house.
JOE: None of this concerns me. We're done we're gonna walk outside now.
OLD JOE: This is going to happen
JOE: It happened to you, it doesn't have to happen to me. ( points: the pocket watch ) You got her picture in there? Show it to me. Show me her picture. And when I see her for the first time I'll walk away, and she won't be with me.
OLD JOE: She'll be safe. And then we can all do what we have to do. A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it. Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back.
JOE: She'll be safe. And then we can all do what we have to do. A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it. Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back.
OLD JOE: No you don't understand. We don't have to give her up. I'm going to tell you why I'm here now. He puts his hand on the folded papers.
JOE: It's been awhile since we've gotten a warm-up. Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet. Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left. Fled. Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the hair, dragging him like a doll. Joe's blunderbuss clatters to the ground. Old Joe drags him to the window. They look out. Nothing in the parking lot. Too quiet.
OLD JOE: It's been thirty years for me, so it's hard to remember. When you stole Seth's bike you stripped out the security tracker. Right? Joe's fearful face says âno.' Old Joe draws his gat.
A TRAIN: Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His papers and gun fall. The diner door EXPLODES.
JOE: I've got him! He's here! A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old Joe gets the gat. With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe returns fire, glass breaking and chaos. Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks. Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet. Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe.
OLD JOE: Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the broken window, jumps.
JOE: Around back!
KID BLUE: Alive! No, alive! Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition.
JOE: No fuck no fucking piece of shit CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike the engine turns over with a ROAR. The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground. Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running back to the Gat Men.
KID BLUE: The tracker! Get the tracker!
SARA: EXT. FIELD - DAWN A bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts the dead stump of an old tree. A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart. Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn. Sara focused on her work as the sun rises.
SARA: C'mon baby. Time to get up.
SARA: Listen up fucker. I have shot and buried three vagrants in the past year. If you want to know the Christ's honest truth I'm starting to get a taste for it. So I don't care what hobo sob story you've got, I get a dozen a week and it cuts no cash with me. It's me and my husband here, we're broke and angry at our lot in this world and heavily armed. So take some corn and move on, but if you show your face again I will cut you the fuck in half. Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara turns, walks briskly back. Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field.
LATER: Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a clear sight line at the house. His gun on his knee. JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces. Pinches his eyes. Headache. The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map.
JOE: C'mon. C'mere. C'mon. C'mon. EXT. CITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY Helicopters sweep by.
ABE: Well. You found him. And you russeled up a posse and went to git âem. Like a good little cowboy from one of your movie movies. Without telling me.
KID BLUE: I can do it again.
ABE: You can fuck up again? Really. You know what happens to me if I don't get that old bastard? I got too much riding, Kid, I can't afford a fuck-up playing cowboy. Put your gat on the table. Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he doesn't take his hand off it.
KID BLUE: I wanted you to say I did good, that's all I wanted. This is all I Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the trigger. A tense moment. Abe pulls the gun away, across the KID BLUE ( CONT'D ) Please just give me one more chance, I'll bring him here alive and hold him and you can put a bullet in his brain yourself- Abe grabs the hammer. SLAMS it on Kid's bad hand, crushing it. Kid howls, the Gat Men grab him.
KID BLUE: I'm gonna make this good again. I will. I'm gonna be back.
KID BLUE: Oh no. Oh no no no no He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps, begs, clasps at whatever he can grab. The Gat Man turns a corner towards the alley's dead end.
SARA: Hey. Who's there. Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back. Quiet but definite - crunch crunch. And now, definitely a shape. A man. coming towards her.
JOE: His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he scrambles in the dirt for it.
SHIT: His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he scrambles in the dirt for it.
SARA: You stop right there, you stop! She fires her gun in the air. The man pauses, but then continues towards her. She trips on a root, FALLS.
BLESS YOUÂ: Joe lowers his gun, face melting.
SARA: Jee sus. ( to the MUTE VAGRANT ) Hey, hey. I'm going to get you
SARA: Hey you forgot your greasy goddamn hobo sign oh for godssakes. ( turns to Joe ) Alright, what are you? Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling to a heap on the grass. Sara checks his face.
SARA: Hey. Up here, at the light. Hey. Sara SLAPS HIM. Hard. His eyes snap open. He sees her face. She feels his head. Checks his eyes. Cherry red and veined, swollen under the lids.
JOE: ( TOTALLY GONE )
SARA: How long since you dropped?
JOE: Sara mimes an eye dropper.
DROPPED: Sara mimes an eye dropper.
SARA: Dropped, or what the kids call it.
JOE: A day.
SARA: One day. Wow. She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in thought. Deciding what to do. Joe lies prone, shaking, Thirsty. I can't feel my legs
JOE: Thirsty. I can't feel my legs
SARA: You're withdrawing from a synthetic barbiturate. It's a quick punch but it's this bad a day in, without care you might not make it through the night. Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine leather. Her eyes linger on his gun. They turn cold.
JOE: Thirsty. Thirsty. Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him through the front door. A young boy steps out onto the porch, 6 years old, named CID. Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks.
CID: Who's that man?
SARA: Just a vagrant babe.
CID: No he's not.
SARA: Oh yeah?
CID: His shoes are too shiny.
SARA: Well aren't you a smart monkey.
CID: Is he sick?
SARA: Will he get better?
CID: Will he get better?
SARA: Go to sleep. Okay. Night baby Kisses him.
CID: Go to sleep. Okay. Night baby Kisses him.
SARA: Go to sleep. Okay. Night baby Kisses him.
CID: Night Sara. Lingers over him in the pale light. Then goes.
SARA: INT. BARN - NIGHT Sara lights a gas lamp. Threads a hose from a tank of water around the cot. Joe on a metal cot, covered with blankets.
SARA: Water. Drink it, all night, more than you think you want. Moves a metal bucket next to the bed. Adjusts the blankets.
SARA: INT. RUNOFF ROOM Old Joe touches his temple. Head aching. Remembering.
OLD JOE: The first time I saw her face.
SARA: INT. RUNOFF ROOM No. No no. His POCKET WATCH sits open in front of him. He picks it up.
OLD JOE: No. No no. His POCKET WATCH sits open in front of him. He picks it up.
OLD JOE: No. The first time I saw her face.
SARA: Morning monkey.
CID: The man's up. Sara stiffens, looks out the window.
SARA: A WALL OF LEAVES Fingers part the green, and Old Joe peers through the dense EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING Old Joe hides in the trees across the street from a suburban track home. A young boy in a bright jacket runs out the front door and off down the street. Old Joe checks the folded map in his trembling hands. On it, this house is circled in black, exactly like Sara's farm. Stuffing the map in his pocket, he pushes out through the EXT. BARN - MORNING Sara approaches the barn, her shotgun in hand. Joe sits on the ground just outside the open barn door, the metal cot behind him still handcuffed to his wrist. Methodically cleaning and loading his gun.
SARA: Toss it. Joe freezes. Then, half annoyed
JOE: I just finished cleaning - alright. Tosses it into the dirt. Sara lowers the shotgun slightly.
SARA: How do you feel?
JOE: I'm at thirty percent.
SARA: Take it slow and by the end of the week you'll be at fifty. Good. She tosses him a key, he unlocks his handcuff.
JOE: I can't do that.
SARA: I'm sorry?
JOE: I need to stay here for a little while longer.
SARA: I am not cool with that.
JOE: Well I'm sorry.
SARA: Well I'm sorry too, you just lost your take the morning to rest privileges, get off my farm.
JOE: Sara raises the shotgun.
SARA: Get off my farm.
JOE: No. You couldn't scare a retarded hobo with that thing. Literally.
SARA: This is a Remington 870, one blast could cut you the fuck in half.
JOE: And that's, that's telling. You're holding a gun. I say I'm not afraid, so you describe the gun to me. But it's not the gun I'm not afraid of.
SARA: So now I saved your life that makes me weak?
JOE: Look I'm not a threat to you or your boy. I need to be on your property but I'd prefer to not have any contact with you at all, I'll stay in the fields. There's just one thing you need to do for me, and you won't have to deal with me He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it. Tosses it over to her.
SARA: What is this?
JOE: A map.
SARA: That's my house. Why is it marked?
JOE: Doesn't matter. Ok. I'll be out of the barn in an hour, if you can spare it I'll take the water jug with me. Does that well have water? I'll fill it from there. Sara turns the map over. Sees the NUMBER that Old Joe wrote on the back. 07153902935. And everything changes.
SARA: What is this. She shows him the number. She is not asking what the number is - she knows. Joe is suddenly not so relaxed.
JOE: Does that mean something to you? For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her eyes. Sara stares daggers, searching. Very different than she was ten seconds ago. Joe scoots back
SARA: Who are you? She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury
JOE: Time travel hasn't been invented yet. But in thirty years it will EXT. PARK - DAY A suburban park. On its far end, a birthday party. The YOUNG BOY in the bright jacket we saw run out of the house earlier sits alone under a tree. Old Joe approaches him.
OLD JOE: Hi. Daniel, right? I'm Chad's father. Aren't you going to come over? We're doing cake.
DANIEL: It's ice cream cake and I can't eat ice cream. Cause of the milk.
OLD JOE: Well you should join the party even if you don't have cake. You have a birthday coming up?
DANIEL: In July. We were gonna go to the lake but I don't think we are now.
OLD JOE: I'm sorry. Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass. Having trouble INT. BARN Sara sits. Joe weakly talks, the end of a long explanation.
JOE: I can't go back to the city and find him cause Abe, the boss, all his men are going to search the streets 24/7 till they turn up me or. him. All I have is this map. And that he's coming here. Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought.
SARA: A Looper.
JOE: Yeah. Did you know about Loopers, what we do
SARA: I've heard stories. So he's coming here to murder me and my son because he thinks we might be this Rainmaker. And once he kills the Rainmaker, what happens?
JOE: I think. he thinks, the instant the rainmaker dies, he'll never have been sent back, so he'll just vanish, and be back with his wife.
SARA: Who is he? The guy you let run? Just some random guy from the Yeah. Someone. You know what these numbers mean.
JOE: Yeah. Someone. You know what these numbers mean.
SARA: This is my son Cid's birthday. And this is the hospital he was born Joe's face, taking this in.
LATER: On the bed. Old Joe and the Wife. Faces close. Drifting into sleep. From a neighboring apartment, a BABY CRIES. Loud and insistent. Old Joe opens his eyes, joking-annoyed at the crying baby. âGod you have to be kidding me.â Then he sees her face. Her smiling eyes, listening to the neighbor's baby cry. Like she's listening to music. She touches his hand.
SARA: Would he do this?
JOE: Think about what doing this would fix. What he thinks it would fix. Sara caught that, and she did not like it.
SARA: If he comes here, can you stop him? She turns the paper over in her hands.
JOE: I've lost my life. I kill this man, I get it back. You can trust EXT. FRONT PORCH - LATER They sit on the steps, Joe stripped to the waist. Sara picks salt chunks from his chest with tweezers and antiseptic. Joe surveys the surrounding land, cleaning his gun.
JOE: We're surrounded by the corn, that leaves us blind. He can get within fifty yards of the house without a hawk spotting him.
SARA: No you cannot burn down my corn What kind of equipment's in the Farm equipment.
JOE: What kind of equipment's in the Farm equipment.
SARA: Farm equipment.
JOE: Nothing that shoots.
SARA: No farm equipment that shoots. No.
JOE: Good by me. He hisses as she applies antiseptic to a gash in his arm.
SARA: Hold still. Easy for things to get infected on a farm, start falling Caught off guard, Joe almost smiles. Then grimaces.
JOE: If I'm out here and you're in the house we're gonna need some way to There's a dinner bell down by the barn, ring that if someone's coming, I'll hear it.
SARA: There's a dinner bell down by the barn, ring that if someone's coming, I'll hear it.
JOE: Dinner bell. We need walkies, or Dunno what we've got but I'll look. She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them.
SARA: Dunno what we've got but I'll look. She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them.
JOE: Got any ammo for that shotgun? That isn't a seasoning?
SARA: How's the maths coming?
CID: I wanna help the man.
SARA: Help him what?
CID: I could help him with my toys.
SARA: Baby. Listen. I need you to stay away from that man. Okay? Let him-
HEY: Cid squirms out of her grasp, bats her away with a light but angry slap. She grabs his arm harder.
CID: Is he not good?
SARA: Well we're gonna see what he is. But you stick with me. Yeah?
CID: Hand me that Phillips. Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working.
JOE: What are we doing here?
CID: He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and an identical one next to Joe lights up. The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly.
JOE: How do you do that?
CID: Bigger battery. Joe idly fingers a toy.
JOE: Do you kill people? Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows.
CID: Do you kill people? Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows.
JOE: Let's say I kill people.
CID: With your gun?
JOE: Uh huh. Cid looks at him in the dark. Not scared at all. Then he goes back to fitting the backing on a toy. A long beat, Joe thinking. Broken by a PIERCING NOISE. They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is shrieking, sirens blaring. Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off, they both freeze. And look up at the ceiling. Silence in the house. With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck from Joe and finishes up his work.
CID: She's not my mom. My mom got killed when I was a baby. Someone bad, bad men killed her. Cid sets the two finished BUZZERS on the table.
JOE: I'm sorry.
CID: Sara doesn't think I remember cause I was a baby. But I remember my mom. I couldn't stop her getting killed. I don't remember it all but I remember. I was a baby. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't stop it. Cause I was a baby. Cid is crying. Joe has never been more at a loss.
JOE: I'm sorry Takes the buzzers. Stands, fumbling. Retreating.
CID: She's not my mom. She's a liar. With one last look back at Cid in the dark, Joe exits.
RUN: Every fucking car, every gat, every cop - get âem down there! Flood that fucker! Take him down!
ABE: Every fucking car, every gat, every cop - get âem down there! Flood that fucker! Take him down!
JOE: Can't you pull that out with a Uh huh. She keeps chopping.
SARA: Uh huh. She keeps chopping.
JOE: I found a, in the barn I found some parts, and I made a, thing. Joe pushes one of Cid's BUZZERS into her hands, which we now see is a colorful plastic frog toy with a light bulb nose.
SARA: Last night. He woke me up. Don't tell him I told you though, he. Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Starts chopping again. Joe doesn't leave.
JOE: Last night. He woke me up. Don't tell him I told you though, he. Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Starts chopping again. Joe doesn't leave.
SARA: You said you were his mom.
JOE: You said you were his mom.
SARA: Uh huh.
JOE: He told me you're not. This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it.
SARA: He said that?
JOE: If he's not your son who is he?
SARA: ( SHARP )
JOE: How'd she get killed? When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers.
SARA: I told you one thing, I told you to stay away from my son.
JOE: He asked about my gun. You think this is going to go away if you don't talk to him about it but it's just gonna grow
SARA: Stay out of it. Stay the fuck away from my son.
SUZIE: Sorry, I know I promised five, you know how it gets.
GIRL NEIGHBOR: Don't worry sugar. She was no problem. Gat men searched through here, lookin for god knows. Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters.
SARA: Where does 56 go? Good. 21.
CID: How long can you not sleep?
SARA: I don't know, awhile. That's a good question. Where's it go. Good, there. 32.
CID: We should help Joe watch.
SARA: Cause he can't stay awake all the He isn't our business.
CID: Cause he can't stay awake all the He isn't our business.
SARA: He isn't our business.
CID: He's keeping us safe
SARA: Baby. Let's do this now. You have 32 there, I know you know this one.
CID: I want to help him. Sara is distracted by a distant bell-like DINGING.
SARA: Cid. 32. She goes to the window, looks out, nervous. But it's just a loose LAUNDRY LINE down in the yard, whipping in the wind against its metal pole. In the distance, Joe paces the yard. Relieved, Sara returns to Cid. He sets the tile, petulant.
CID: Thirty two.
SARA: Eight times three is what?
CID: Thirty two.
SARA: I want you to count three eights.
CID: Eight. Sixteen. Thirty two.
SARA: Are you telling me you want alone Okay. Why don't you put that where it belongs? Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back down on the same spot.
CID: Okay. Why don't you put that where it belongs? Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back down on the same spot.
SARA: Okay. Why don't you put that where it belongs? Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back down on the same spot.
CID: He's protecting us cause you can't do it.
SARA: Ok. I told you to stay away from
HIM: I never did anything
CID: I never did anything
SARA: Do you think I'm stupid?
CID: I told you already Cid is building into a temper tantrum fast.
SARA: I told you already Cid is building into a temper tantrum fast.
CID: You do what I tell you
SARA: You do what I tell you
CID: You can't tell me what to do you're not my mom. ( a deadly beat ) You're not my mom! You're a liar and you're gonna get killed and you won't stop lying! Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back. Not hard, but Cid scoots back, eyes furious.
SARA: CID BABY
CID BABY: You're a liar! Liar! I hate you because you're lying! I hate you! Liar! You're lying to me! Sara scoots back.
CID: You're a liar! Liar! I hate you because you're lying! I hate you! Liar! You're lying to me! Sara scoots back.
SARA: You're lying!
CID: You're lying!
CID: You're lying!
KID BLUE: Hey Can. Can. Canady sees him, jumps and yelps. The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car. Coffee everywhere.
CANADY: Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the
FUCK: KID BLUE
KID BLUE: Pull into that alley.
CANADY: You get the fuck outta
KID BLUE: You don't wanna be seen with me Canady, pull in the alley. Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley, parks it.
CANADY: The fuck are you still doing in town, Abe wants you dead man
KID BLUE: All Abe wants right now is the looper. Unless he got him last Jssshhh. No we didn't get him. Spotted and lost him. West End, near Whore's Alley.
CANADY: Jssshhh. No we didn't get him. Spotted and lost him. West End, near Whore's Alley.
KID BLUE: Whore's Alley?
CANADY: That area, Mott working girl colony.
KID BLUE: ( has a thought ) Whore's Alley..
CANADY: You shoulda left town man.
KID BLUE: I'm gonna bring him in, get right with Abe.
CANADY: Yeah, maybe you bring him the looper, but short of that Abe don't get right with priced men.
KID BLUE: I got a price?
CANADY: Big one. Canady locks the car doors. And in that one moment, Kid Blue pulls Canady's gun from his holster. Holds it on him. A tense moment.
A PRICE: EXT. ALLEYWAY BANG and the drivers side window explodes outward bloody. A moment, then Kid Blue stumbles out, holding his ears in pain. Off down the alley and out of sight.
JESSE: Evenin ma'am.
SARA: Evenin. How can I help you?
JESSE: You can start by accepting my apologies re the hour, I hope I didn't catch you in supper.
SARA: No, that's fine.
JESSE: Yours was the last house on my list today, been walking between empty farms all day in the hot sun. Thought I'd tick this off my list, not have to come back tomorrow.
SARA: What's this about? Back in the house somewhere, a screen door bangs.
JESSE: You alone here, ma'am?
SARA: My husband should be back from the city, any time now.
JESSE: Happy to hear. Could I trouble you for some water?
SARA: Course. I'll get some, you can take the glass with you.
JESSE: Actually ma'am, my business tonight, this ticking off the list business, it's gonna require me coming in. If that's alright. Jesse shifts his weight, and Sara notices his heavy boot is now a few inches over the door jam.
SARA: Will you tell me what this is I will, yes. Can I come in? Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun. Possibilities whirling through her mind.
JESSE: I will, yes. Can I come in? Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun. Possibilities whirling through her mind.
JESSE: We're looking for his father too, similar look and build but late 50s. May or may not be travelling This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega, of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk. Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with Joe's. Mind spinning. Maybe making the connection, we're not sure.
SARA: She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take them. He notices the toys on the table.
JESSE: Keep em. Kids with your husband?
SARA: Yeah. Just one.
JESSE: How old?
SARA: Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe slipping through the hall and into the living room. He lifts his glass, drinks.
JESSE: Thank you.
SARA: I'll show you round the grounds, then the house, then you can be on your way. Sara holds the screen door open for him.
JESSE: We'll start with the house. Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him.
JESSE: Eight, you said? Boy? And your husband. Just gotta, check in. With the home office. This goddamn This man dangerous?
SARA: This man dangerous?
JESSE: Tween you me and a lamppost? No. Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My boss has half the city's looking for him. Half the city and me. So. And if you find him, there's a helluva price. Think on that if he comes by, acting sweet. Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs.
SARA: Drafts, in the house. Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway. Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe.
JESSE: Drafty house.
SARA: Farm house. Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it. CREAK. He looks at Sara.
JESSE: What's down there?
SARA: Laundry room. Door must've blown Jesse opens the door, then looks at Sara gravely.
JESSE: Two things. First, I have a family of my own back in the city, and I want to see them again. Second if anything happens to me, and I don't report back to my boss people in fifteen minutes, they're gonna know I disappeared searching this house, and inside of another fifteen you'll have an army of more me's kicking down your door. Ok?
SARA: It's a laundry room. Jesse motions - her first.
JESSE: You want to call out whoever's hiding in that hamper?
SARA: If someone was hiding in the house, that's what I'd do. But nobody is in the house. Open it up.
JESSE: No I think I'm gonna put a shot through it just to be safe. He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly.
SARA: Now if you promise not to wag your gun at my shoe rack I'll show you upstairs then show you the fuck She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his gun and follows her. The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the room, and into a drain hole under the hamper.
CID: My granddad built it, but he didn't tell anyone of us why. Nanna said cuz he was nuts.
JOE: Thank you granddad.
CID: That wasn't the man.
JOE: No. I know him, that's what's funny. His name's Jesse. I like him. He'll go away when he doesn't find me, he won't hurt her. They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking back towards the highway.
CID: But you didn't.
JOE: A man in the city found me, put a gun in my hand, and gave me some things. I didn't have my mom anymore. I had my work, my money. My plans. For my life. That's what I'd kill for. Not something I don't have, and can't ever get There's just men figuring out what they'd do to keep what's theirs, what they got. That's the only kind of man there is.
CID: I'm not gonna let Sara get killed. Joe looks at him. Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but I think we're clear. He opens the trap door, climbs out.
JOE: I think we're clear. He opens the trap door, climbs out.
KID BLUE: All working girls, yeah?
SUPER: Uh huh. This whole block. You wanna check those too, I can I do. On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the KID BLUE ( CONT'D ) âLo Joe. Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches Suzie through the window for a long while. Kid watches him Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves. Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket.
KID BLUE: I do. On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the KID BLUE ( CONT'D ) âLo Joe. Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches Suzie through the window for a long while. Kid watches him Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves. Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket.
SUPER: I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha. But you don't see what you wanna see, no refunds. Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels.
OLD JOE: INT. CHURCH - EVENING Rain beats against stained glass. Old Joe kneeling in a pew. Fists clenched as if in prayer. He stands, stumbles out.
JOE: Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head doesn't know where to go.
SARA: Don't wake Cid. She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain starts to fall against the windows.
LATER: Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned. Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She sets the lighter on her palm. It floats about a foot in the air, spinning, then drops.
JOE: That's pretty good.
SARA: In the city, young guys would hit on me by floating fucking quarters, I wouldn't tell âem I was TK but I'd keep their quarters down. One guy busted a blood vessel in his eye trying to get it up.
JOE: He's protecting his future. Not A beat.
SARA: When I came back, after my sister died. Cid was sitting on the porch, I remember seeing him for the first time, in two years.
OLD JOE: Don't. Don't wake up your Old Joe trains the gun on her. She goes silent.
SUZIE: No. I don't know you. Who are I need to tell you why I'm doing this. I gotta say it out loud to someone so I know.
OLD JOE: I need to tell you why I'm doing this. I gotta say it out loud to someone so I know.
SUZIE: Why you're doing what?
JESSE: Lo' Joe.
JOE: INT. APARTMENT 205 I threw my gun away once. To get her love. And I was going to do it again, now. Because I know she'd want me to. I was going to do it. And I saw then, I saw her vanishing, like how life probably goes when you die. That's what she was asking me to give up this time.
OLD JOE: I threw my gun away once. To get her love. And I was going to do it again, now. Because I know she'd want me to. I was going to do it. And I saw then, I saw her vanishing, like how life probably goes when you die. That's what she was asking me to give up this time.
SUZIE: .who are you?
OLD JOE: And if I picked up the gun. If I made this sacrifice. Life, my life. Absolution. Given back to me. My love. Given back, just like we were, and she wouldn't know what I did to get it back.
JOE: I'm unarmed Jesse, you can let her go. Sara, Jesse here's the best shot with a gat I've ever seen, when he lets you go you sit on the couch and don't do anything stupid. Jesse lets Sara go and trains the gat on Joe.
JESSE: I gotta take you in man.
JOE: I got eighty large in pure gold, I take my looper back in and get right with Abe, whatever he gives me back I'll split it with you.
JESSE: Was that your plan?
JOE: Ok. It's yours, all of it
JESSE: Are you delusional?
OLD JOE: Everything set right. Everything fixed. Through this sacrifice.
SUZIE: What are you gonna do? Old Joe stands, walks towards the back hall. Suzie screams
JESSE: I know you got no options you take the one you got but Joe, you aint gettin right with no one. Looper or no, you're beyond saving. As long as Abe's got one Gat Man standing, he'll be hunting you till his dying day. Joe's face falling.
JESSE: We're going now. We're gonna go to my truck, you're gonna CREAK. Cid on the stairs, sleepy eyed. Jesse, purely on instinct, spins and draws on Cid. Cid's POV - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel leveled at him. Cid makes a strange shouting noise, falls Everything slows down.
OLD JOE: The Rainmaker. A bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on. A six year old girl's room. But the only person in it is Kid Blue. He shoots Old Joe with a blue tazer. Old Joe hits the ground, mouth foaming, paralyzed. Knowing the answer now, knowing the who and the how but helpless and Kid Blue kicks him in the face.
CID: INT. ABE'S OFFICE A Gat Man circles a spot on the map in red ink, Sara's farm.
ABE: Call everyone, every Gat Man in the city, call âem here. Gather em all up here first. No mistakes this time. We're gonna take an army to that farm, all at once, and sweep it like hellfire. Now.
SARA: Cid! Cid!
SARA: What are you doing with those guns? What are you going to do? She lunges for him, wild. Wrenches his arm and he spins, throwing her to the ground.
JOE: How did your sister die? Sara holds his gaze. Then everything breaks inside her and she collapses in sobs. Heaving.
SARA: No! No he was climbing a bookshelf, it fell back on him. He has no control, he gets scared, it What is it a TK mutation?
JOE: What is it a TK mutation?
SARA: Joe someday he'll learn to control Yeah I know he will. Imagine what he could do.
JOE: Yeah I know he will. Imagine what he could do.
SARA: If he did good with it! If he grew up good!
JOE: He doesn't. Joe heads to the corn, Sara scampers after him but slips on the wet grass, and Joe hits the corn with a head start.
SARA: You stay away from him! Cid! Cid! She runs into the corn.
SARA: Cid! Make a noise baby, call to me! Cid! WITH JOE through the corn, following traces of blood on the SARA ( O.S. ) ( CONT'D ) You stay away from Joe, you come to me! Cid! Tries cocking the GAT but it's broken. Tosses it, wields the INT. SMALL CROP CLEARING Joe emerges from the corn. Cid crouches at one end of the small clearing. He looks at Joe. Terrified. Half covered in blood. Hair matted over one eye. Joe looks back at him. Approaches him, gun not raised, but in hand. Cid, like a frightened animal. A long moment. And just like that, Joe puts his hand on Cid's head. Cid leans against his legs, crying. Sara bursts into the clearing, sees this. Runs to Cid and embraces him, wiping the blood from his face. Joe steps back.
JOE: Right now two things have happened. My looper knows Cid's the kid he's looking for, and my gang knows I'm here. So in fifteen minutes one or both is coming down that highway. You pack up the Gat Man's truck, whatever you can fit in ten minutes, and you drive North away from the city.
SARA: Where are you going? Joe takes the Frog Buzzer from his pocket, presses it. Sara's buzzes in her pocket.
JOE: One buzz means come and get me. Two or nothing, don't. He vanishes into the stalks, towards the highway.
ABE: Arm âem up, let's go.
ABE: Well. Shhhhhit.
BIG CRAIG: Hoh. So both we got?
KID BLUE: Just the Looper. I got him. Knew he went for whores, so I checked every building.
BIG CRAIG: They found Joe too though, in a farm on the east side. That's why all the Gats are here, the whole crew's arming up to make a sweep.
KID BLUE: Joe fuck Joe, save your bullets I got the Looper. Not such a fuck up huh? I'm taking him up to This happens very fast: Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back into Kid Blue, SLAMMING him against the opposite wall. Old Joe grabs ( behind his back ) Kid Blue's gun, and blasts one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the Kid's midsection. He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in the face. Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but mostly the men are trapped. Then it's over. All is smoky still for a moment.
ABE: Joe. Guess I put the gun in that kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess everything comes back around. Like your goddamn ties.
SARA: Ok baby, we're going.
OLD JOE: Bon jour. You take this truck, you take your money, and you go live your life. No one's coming after you. I fixed it.
JOE: And you go kill the boy. That's how you fix it.
OLD JOE: That's how. You got your life back, you better think right now about what that's worth to you.
JOE: My life? Your life. Becoming you.
OLD JOE: Stupid little shit! You let him live, he's gonna take away everything that's yours, everything that's mine! You seen what the boy's gonna become.
JOE: I haven't seen that yet. Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's chest and knock him back. Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has until now blocked our line of sight down the highway. Kid Blue. The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to the dusty pavement. The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a stop and spin it around. Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss. Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as a rock. Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe. Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round after fiery round. Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud. KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to slow the bike but can't in time. In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him. He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly FIRES his buss. A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without a driver. It skids, crashes. When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head.
SARA: Here we go. Give it a wave EXT. DIRT ROAD They roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway. At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them, is the dark figure of Old Joe. Gun in hand. Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it. Straight for him.
CID: Duck down baby
STOP: Duck down baby
SARA: Duck down baby
CID: Stop please he can shoot us
SARA: Just stay down Half the distance closed, but he's still far off. A shot cracks the front grill, another cracks the windshield.
CID: The truck lurches horribly, and flips straight back in a graceful arc, landing upsidown. Sara and Cid, dazed, hanging by their seatbelts.
SARA: Are you ok?
CID: I'm sorry In the rear view mirror, Sara sees Old Joe getting closer.
SARA: You're ok. C'mon baby we have to run now.
SARA: Sara is stopped in her tracks by an invisible force.
NO!: Sara is stopped in her tracks by an invisible force.
SARA: With a sudden jolt the field ripples out from Cid, like a stone thrown in a pond. Sara lifts into the air.
CID: And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes crashing down.
MOM: And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes crashing down.
SARA: You did good, baby. You did so good. I love you. Behind them, Old Joe struggles to his feet. Sara kisses Cid.
CID: GO NOW
NO: GO NOW
SARA: GO NOW
GO NOW: No no mom no
CID: No no mom no
SARA: You go! She pushes him away and Cid runs. Then she turns. Standing her ground. Directly between Old Joe and Cid. Old Joe TRIPS in the mud, fumbles his gun. Sees Cid approaching the safety of the CORN STALKS. Blocked by Sara.
OLD JOE: EXT. FIELD - WITH JOE Still too far away, struggling as fast as he can, helpless as Old Joe closes in on Sara. He fires his buss at Old Joe, but is way out of range.
JOE: EXT. FIELD - WITH OLD JOE & SARA Sara, not going anywhere.
OLD JOE: I'm sorry He pulls the trigger.
SARA: EXT. FIELD - WITH CID Cid stops just shy of the corn. Turns back to the field. There's his mom, Sara, unharmed and smiling. The bad man is gone. The field is empty.
CID!: EXT. FIELD - WITH CID Cid stops just shy of the corn. Turns back to the field. There's his mom, Sara, unharmed and smiling. The bad man is gone. The field is empty.
CID: Where's Joe?
SARA: He had to go away, baby.
CID: He took the bad man with him? She kisses him.
