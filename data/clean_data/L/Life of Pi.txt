WRITER: Richard Parker.? Mamaji didn't tell me everything. He just said I should look you up when I got back to Montreal.
ADULT PI: So what were you doing in Writing a novel.
WRITER: Writing a novel.

ADULT PI: We get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods instead of just But you're a Hindu first?
WRITER: But you're a Hindu first?
PI: None of us knows God until someone introduces us. I was first introduced to God as a Hindu. There are 330 million gods in the Hindu religion - how can I not come to know a few of them?
PI: .But he didn't!
MOTHER: That's what he told her. "I didn't eat dirt!" "No? Well, then open your mouth." So Krishna opened his
FATHER: ( With quiet sincerity. ) Spectacle. Don't let the stories and pretty lights fool you, boys. Religion is darkness.
PRIEST: You must be thirsty. Here, I brought you this.
PI: Why would a god do that? Why would he send his own son to suffer for the sins of ordinary people?
PRIEST: Because He loves us. God made Himself approachable to us - human - so we could understand Him.
ADULT PI: That made no sense. Sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty? What kind of love is
PI: If God is so perfect and we're not, why would He want to create all this? Why does He need us at all?
PRIEST: All you have to know is that He loves us. "God so loved the world that He gave His only Son." This Son taught us to love one

FATHER: the same time is the same as not believing in anything at all.
MOTHER: finding his way.
FATHER: does not choose a path? Listen: instead of leaping from one religion to the next, why not start with reason? In a few hundred years, science has taken us farther in understanding the universe than religion has in ten thousand.
MOTHER: Science can teach us more about what's out there - - but not what is in here. Art, music, literature - they all spring from our faith.
FATHER: Some eat meat, some eat vegetable. I do not expect us all to agree about everything. But I would much rather have you believe in something I don't agree with than to accept everything blindly. And that begins with thinking rationally. Do you understand?
PI: I would like to be baptized.
WRITER: So you're a Christian and a Muslim?
ADULT PI: And a Hindu, of course.
WRITER: And a Jew, I suppose?
ADULT PI: Oh, well, I do teach a course on the Kabbalah at the University. And why not? Faith is a house with many But no room for doubt?
WRITER: But no room for doubt?

FATHER: Father yanks Pi violently away from the cage, wrenching Pi's hand through the bars. Richard Parker, startled, raises his head, hissing. He turns and bounds back out through the gate at the other end of the hallway, disappearing into the exhibit area. Father spins Pi around and shoves him against the wall.

PI: I'm sorry. I was.
MOTHER: What are you thinking?
FATHER: This is between a father and his Selvam, the gate.
MOTHER: He said he's sorry. You want to scar them for life?
FATHER: Scar them? That boy almost lost his But he's still a boy!
MOTHER: But he's still a boy!

ANANDI: No, he heard something - he's listening. You see?
FATHER: So.you see? We have talked about it for some time. Do you understand what I'm saying? Pi?
PI: Sorry. You've been.
FATHER: Worried. For my family. Our animals are worth far more abroad than here in India, and if the town council stops supporting us, I don't know where we'll be. So. it is what we have to do. Do you understand?
PI: I'm sorry. what are we talking We are leaving India.
RAVI: We are leaving India.
PI: We are selling the zoo.
MOTHER: We are selling the zoo.
FATHER: The zoo itself was never ours to sell - the land belongs to the town. But the animals are ours, and if we sell them, we will have enough to start a new life.
PI: But where would we go? Our life is here Appa!
FATHER: Canada. I have some opportunities for work in Winnipeg. I'll be shipping most of the animals for sale in North America; we can get freighter passage for the whole family. So, it is settled. We will sail like Columbus!
PI: But Columbus was looking for India!
MOTHER: Pi, they're serving dinner below.

TAIWANESE SAILOR: Hello, I am happy Buddhist, so I eat rice next to gravy. On ship, gravy is not meat. Is taste. Okay? You try?
FATHER: ( Noting Pi's banana: ) Don't worry - we will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in
PI: Why give O.J. a tranquilizer? She's not going to cause any trouble.
FATHER: The stress of traveling is not good for the animals.

PI: Hari, the hyena, with a sloping, bear-like forehead and the nervous manner of a beaten dog, reappears. Pi instantly dives across the tarp, scrambling for safety on the oar. The hyena staggers and stumbles listlessly. Pi turns to face the creature, struggling for calm.
PI: HELLO.! HELLO.! ANYBODY?
PI: No! Stop it! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop it! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!!
PI: I'm sorry, O.J.; I don't have any seasickness medicine for you -
PI: But the hyena gets up in an instant - it attacks again, this time going for O.J.'s throat.
YES!: But the hyena gets up in an instant - it attacks again, this time going for O.J.'s throat.
PI: There are no lines!
PI: Here, Richard Parker. I've got some water for you.
PI: EXT. THE LIFEBOAT/THE RAFT - DUSK Pi still fishes with no success. Richard Parker stares in the water at the dorado. He leans over the side of the boat, pawing hungrily at the surface as fish streak past - but the fish elude him. Richard Parker leans out further, striking with both paws - and finally jumps in altogether. Richard Parker strikes and splashes as fish streak past. Pi grins at the tiger's predicament - but the moment Richard Parker realizes he can't climb back aboard, he begins swimming toward the raft. Pi snaps to, recognizing the danger he's in. He reels the raft over to the lifeboat, practically leaping onto the bow. As he hauls the raft aboard, Richard Parker manages to catch the netting on the raft with one paw. Pi leans back against an oar with all his weight, trying to lever the raft aboard; the weight of the tiger tips the entire bow lower in the water. Pi is about to lose the struggle when the tiger's claw rips through the netting, and the lifeboat springs back up in the water; the momentum flips the raft up onto the boat. Pi turns, watching as Richard Parker swims up behind him alongside the bow. He digs into the supply box and rises with a hatchet in his hand, crossing to stand over the tiger and blowing the whistle threateningly. Standoff. Pi pumps the axe a few times, but cannot bring himself to kill the tiger. Richard Parker stares up at Pi a long moment, then paddles to the stern, trying once again to pull himself aboard at the other end of the boat.
PI: What am I doing? As he removes one of the floorboard panels, imagining new uses for the wooden slats, he hears Richard Parker scratching at the hull of the boat.
PI: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
AAAAHHHH!!!!: Boy and tiger face off for several seconds, both panting, neither blinking nor showing fear, as the rain of fish gradually slows around them. Richard Parker turns his focus from Pi and takes in the situation around him. Realizing that he stands up to his knees in a pile of flying fish, he turns his attention to a more convenient meal. Pi uses the gaff to snag the tuna, shoving it to the farthest edge of the bow. As he rises, late afternoon light casts golden flames across the surface of the water, throwing Pi into backlight.
PI: Pi gives the tiger a stern glare. RP stops, stares back, then backs off.
NO!: Pi gives the tiger a stern glare. RP stops, stares back, then backs off.
PI: Dolphins, Richard Parker!
PI: EXT. THE LIFEBOAT - NIGHT Richard Parker gazes into the distance; Pi stares intently at the tiger.
PI: What are you looking at.? Tell me. What do you see?
PI: Storm! Storm, Richard Parker!
PI: The manual is gone. Pi ties himself to the lifeboat with a rope from the raft.
PI: Praise be to God, Lord of All Worlds, the Compassionate, the
PARKER!: The sky lights up all around them. The tiger begins roaring, pawing at the air, eyes wide, crazed with fear. Pi turns to face the storm.
PI: We're dying, Richard Parker. I'm

PI: Hey! Hey! Hey c'mon. Hey! Hey-get away. This is my bed!

WRITER: It was human tooth?
ADULT PI: Don't you see, the island was Carnivorous? Like. a Venus Yes, the whole island - the plants, the water in those pools, the very ground itself. During the day, those pools held fresh water, but at night, some chemical process turned the water in those pools into acid - acid that dissolved those fish, that sent the meerkats scurrying into the trees and Richard Parker running to the boat.

WRITER: But where did the tooth come from?
ADULT PI: Years ago, some poor fellow just like me must have found himself stranded on that island.. And like me he thought he might stay there forever. But all that the island gave him by day, it took away again by night. To think - how many hours spent with only meerkats for company? How much loneliness taken on?
PI: RICHARD PARKER!
RICHARD PARKER!: 172 EXT. THE ISLAND/LIFEBOAT - SUNSET 172
ADULT PI: And then Richard Parker, my fierce companion, the terrible one who kept me alive, disappeared forever from my life.
ADULT PI: After a few hours, a member of my own species found me. He left and returned with a group who carried me away.
ADULT PI: You know, my father was right. Richard Parker never saw me as his friend. After all we'd been through, he didn't even look back. But I have to believe that there was more in his eyes than my own reflection staring back at me. I know I felt it - even if I can't prove it. I just wish. You know, I've left so much behind. My family, the zoo, Anandi, India - I suppose in the end the whole of life becomes an act of letting go. But what always hurts the most is not taking the moment to say goodbye. I was never able to thank my father for all I learned from him, to tell him that without his lessons I would never have And I know he's a tiger, but I wish I'd said: 'It's over. We've survived. Thank you for saving my life. I love you, Richard Parker. You will always be with me. May God be with you.'
WRITER: I don't know what to say.
ADULT PI: Hard to believe, isn't it?
WRITER: It is a lot to take in, to figure out what it all means.
ADULT PI: If it happened, it happened. Why should it have to mean anything?
WRITER: Well, some of it is pretty Pi takes a tattered notebook out of the bookcase.
ADULT PI: I was the only one who survived the shipwreck, so the Japanese shipping company sent two men to talk to me in the Mexican hospital where I was recovering. I still have a copy of their report.
OKAMOTO: Thousands of meerkats? On a floating carnivorous island? And no one has ever seen it?
YOUNG PI: Yes. Just like I told you.
CHIBA: Bananas don't float.
OKAMOTO: ( In Japanese: ) Why are you talking about bananas?
CHIBA: You said the orangutan floated to you on a bundle of bananas. But bananas don't float.
OKAMOTO: ( In Japanese: ) Are you sure about that?
YOUNG PI: Of course they do. Try it for In any case, we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats.
OKAMOTO: In any case, we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats.
YOUNG PI: I've just told you a long story. I'm very tired.
OKAMOTO: We're here because a Japanese cargo ship sank in the Pacific.
YOUNG PI: Something I never forget. I lost my whole family. Get him some water. We don't mean to push you. And you have our deepest sympathies. But we've come a long way. And we're no closer to understanding why the ship sank.
OKAMOTO: ( In Japanese: ) Get him some water. ( In English: ) We don't mean to push you. And you have our deepest sympathies. But we've come a long way. And we're no closer to understanding why the ship sank.
YOUNG PI: Because I don't know. I was asleep. Something woke me up. It may have been an explosion; I can't be sure. And then the ship sank. What else do you want from me?
OKAMOTO: We need a simpler story for our report. One our company can understand. A story we can all
YOUNG PI: So.. a story without things you never seen before.
OKAMOTO: That's right.
YOUNG PI: Without surprises. Without animals or islands.
OKAMOTO: Yes. The truth.
WRITER: So what did you do?
ADULT PI: I told him another story. Four of us survived.
YOUNG PI: .The cook and the sailor were already onboard. The cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard. Mother held onto some bananas and made it to the lifeboat. The cook, the cook was a disgusting man. He ate a rat. We had food enough for weeks, but he found the rat in the first few days - and he killed it, and dried it in the sun and ate it. He was such a brute, that man. But he was resourceful. It was his idea to build the raft to catch fish. We would have died in those first few days without him. The sailor was the same man who brought rice with gravy, the Buddhist. We didn't understand much of what he said, only that he was suffering. I can still hear him - the happy Buddhist who only ate rice with gravy. He had broken his leg horribly in the fall. We tried to set it as best we could, but the leg became infected and the cook told us we had to do something or he'd die. The cook said he'd do it, but mother and I had to hold the man down. And I believed him - we needed to do it.
ADULT PI: After that, no more questions. The investigators didn't seem to like the story, exactly - but they thanked me, they wished me well, and they left.
WRITER: So. the stories. Both the zebra and the sailor broke their leg. And the hyena killed the zebra and the orangutan. So . the hyena is the cook. And the sailor is the zebra, mother is the orangutan. and you're. the tiger.
ADULT PI: Can I ask you something?
WRITER: Of course.
ADULT PI: I've told you two stories about what happened out on the ocean. Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship, and no one can prove which story is true and which is not. In both stories, the ship sinks, my family dies, and I So which story do you prefer?
WRITER: ADULT PI
ADULT PI: So which story do you prefer?
WRITER: The story with the tiger. That's the better story.
ADULT PI: ( Heartfelt: ) Thank you. And so it goes with God.
WRITER: ( Pause. He looks up. ) Mamaji was right. It is an amazing story. Will you really let me write Of course. Isn't that why Mamaji sent you here, after all? My wife is here. Would you like to stay for dinner? She's an incredible cook.
ADULT PI: Of course. Isn't that why Mamaji sent you here, after all? My wife is here. Would you like to stay for dinner? She's an incredible cook.
WRITER: I didn't know you had a wife.
ADULT PI: And a cat, and two children.
