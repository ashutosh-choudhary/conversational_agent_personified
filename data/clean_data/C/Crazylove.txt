PAUL: You can take it back and we can have one custom made if you want.
LETTY: No, you've done a perfect job.
PAUL: So, what do you say, Let?

RUTH: What do you think?
LETTY: And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?

N: URSE GATES
URSE GATES: I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
JIM: I'm afraid I can't let you take that in without the proper invoice.
MICHAEL: It's a pizza.
JIM: All the same, rules are rules.
MICHAEL: You don't understand. This is a very important, very special, morale-boosting pizza.
JIM: What I understand is how low morale gets when you're posted at a guard station all night, Val.
LETTY: I don't mean to go on and on like It's OK. It's good to let it out.
NURSE GATES: It's OK. It's good to let it out.
NURSE GATES: Did you ever tell Paul how you He was graduating from law school, and he just assumed I was OK with dropping out. We never really talked about it. But I know he was disappointed in

DR. EMLEE: I think it's a problem that you never told me about Michael. I had to hear it from another patient.
LETTY: I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
DR. EMLEE: Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
LETTY: I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee. I can take care of myself.
D: R. EMLEE
R. EMLEE: What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his.
LETTY: I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
DR. EMLEE: Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
LETTY: I don't need a lecture. I care about Michael.
DR. EMLEE: Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes.
LETTY: Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of.

DR. EMLEE: All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
MICHAEL: A daisy for the lady.
LETTY: The lady knows this is a dandelion.
MICHAEL: A rose is a rose.

MICHAEL: Back-to-back sessions with the Sounds important.
LETTY: Sounds important.
MICHAEL: I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
LETTY: Really? Me too.
MICHAEL: I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
LETTY: Wow. I'm bad news.
MICHAEL: What's my rap?
LETTY: Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid Fuck. That's all true.
MICHAEL: Fuck. That's all true.
MICHAEL: Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
LETTY: What are the delusions like?
MICHAEL: I think people are after me, crap like that.
MICHAEL: Shocking, huh?
LETTY: Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
MICHAEL: I wish I could have seen that.
LETTY: I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
MICHAEL: y Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight.

I: NT. REC ROOM - LATER Letty and Michael walk through the rec room toward the dining hall. Nurse Gates bends down in front of Mrs. Hallstrom, who sits where we last saw her.
