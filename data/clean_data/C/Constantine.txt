EARLY PRODUCTION DRAFT: November 14, 2002
GUARDS: (in Turkish) Stop!   Stop!
HENNESSEY: Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes!
HENNESSEY: (whispering) Thank God you're here...
JOHN: This is Constantine. John Constantine, asshole.
JOHN: How ya doing?
JEANIE: Vamos juntos a matarla.
JOHN: Let's see who we got here...
JOHN: I need a mirror. Now.
JOHN: A large mirror. At least -- (sizes up the child) -- three feet high.
JOHN: Chaz?
JOHN: Move the car.
CHAZ: Why?
CHAZ: Park the car -- Move the car...
CHAZ: There, I moved the damn car.
JOHN: Amar natash bow basar! -- Rescind from the flesh I command thee --
JOHN: That's it -- time to go home.
JEANIE: Tiempo para morir!
JOHN: Amar natash bow basar --
JOHN: Lift it.   Over the bed.   Up.
JOHN: Hennessey, tie it off --
JOHN: Now close your eyes -- all of you -- and whatever happens -- do not look into the mirror.
JOHN: Amar natash bow basar! -- rescind from the flesh I command thee!
JOHN: No!
HENNESSEY: John?!
JOHN: (looking into mirror) Not yet!
JOHN: Look!   Look at me!
JOHN: Goddamit -- look!
JOHN: Smile pretty you vain prick.
JOHN: Now, Hennessey. Now!
JOHN: For your boss.
JOHN: No you don't.
HENNESSEY: Now about the fee...
HENNESSEY: Thank you.     Yes... Gracias...
JOHN: Hennessey.
HENNESSEY: I know, I know, but I didn't think she was really possessed, not like that.
JOHN: I'm not back an hour and you drag me into --
HENNESSEY: -- Don't be mad, John, don't be --
HENNESSEY: On the left side.
HENNESSEY: Vest pocket.
JOHN: Don't do that shit on me --
HENNESSEY: Sorry, sorry.    Here, you can have half.
JOHN: I should take it all, save you from yourself.
HENNESSEY: It keeps them out, so I can sleep. Please, John, I need to sleep.
JOHN: I told you to move it.
CHAZ: Well maybe if you had told me you were dropping a three-hundred pound mirror with a pissed-off demon in it I would have moved it further.
CHAZ: Well?
JOHN: Well what?
CHAZ: Shouldn't have cut your stay in the land of enlightenment. You were so close to growing a conscience.
JOHN: Los Angeles...
JOHN: Never ceases to entertain.
MAN (V.O.): You still with me?
ANGELA: Yeah...
MAN (O.S.): So what's next, Detective?   We gonna do a full marathon?
ANGELA: Put your weapon on the tracks and step out with your hands above your head.
MAN (O.S.): Or how 'bout you show yourself and I put a bullet in your skull just like I did hers!
ANGELA: That's just not going to happen.
MAN (O.S.): You sure about that?!
ANGELA: (almost pleading) Now put down your weapon on the tracks and --
MAN (O.S.): Well ain't this a peach?!
DETECTIVE WEISS (V.O.): (over radio) Get off the tracks! Blueline is coming! Clear the tracks!
MAN (O.S.): C'mon, Detective, step into the light and be saved!!
CHAZ: There are four bags. I have two hands. This give you any ideas?
JOHN: Make two trips?
CHAZ: (yells across room) Simple question. How much longer do I have to be your slave?
JOHN: You're not my slave, Chaz. You're my very appreciated assistant. Like Tonto and Robin and that skinny fellow with the fat friend.
CHAZ: How much longer?
JOHN: Well I don't know, what's the going rate for saving a taxi driver hanging from his fingernails about to be swallowed into the jaws of Hell?
CHAZ: So what time you want me back?
JOHN: I need to make an appearance at Midnite's. Say ten-ish?
JOHN: Chaz...?
JOHN: A little something from Delphi.
CHAZ: Gee, thanks.
BEEMAN (O.S.): 'Provisions depleted?'
BEEMAN: I gave you three months worth. You were gone only one.
JOHN: What can I say, Beeman, India was a real drain.
BEEMAN: So what do you need?
JOHN: Everything you got.
BEEMAN: (pausing) You smell something, John?
JOHN: Maybe. Incubus in this girl I just exorcized seemed a bit more spirited than usual.
BEEMAN: Well, I've got your stone fragments from the Road to Damascus, dust from the Dead Sea Scrolls -- oh, you'll love this --
BEEMAN: Screech beetle from Mount Sinai.
BEEMAN: Yeah, to you it's nothing but to the Fallen -- like fingernails on a chalkboard.
JOHN: What is it with you and bugs?
BEEMAN: Gold was blessed by the Bishop Anicott during the Crusades.
BEEMAN: Watch it there.
BEEMAN: Dragon's breath.
JOHN: I thought you couldn't get it anymore.
BEEMAN: Whoa, don't want to get a flame near this. (off John's look) Piece of the shroud Moses wore to the mountain.
JOHN: Got any callinicus?
BEEMAN: (intrigued) How spirited was this incubus?
JOHN: (coughs) Like it was trying to come right out through the girl
JOHN: I know how it sounds...
BEEMAN: We're finger puppets to them, John, elaborate costumes -- they can work us but don't come through us. They can't. You know that.
JOHN: Check the scrolls anyway. Corinthians. See if there are any precedents.
BEEMAN: Sure, John.   Anything else?
JOHN: (coughs again) Wouldn't happen to have anything for --
BEEMAN: On the house.
WEISS (O.S.): Gutsy move out there, Dodson.
ANGELA: Gutsy?    Well that's a new one.
WEISS: You're alive. Bad guy's dead. No point in using the other words.
ANGELA: Thanks.
WEISS: (shuts his locker) Even though it was reckless -- irresponsible -- stupid...
ANGELA: I knew you still cared.
WEISS: You're good, Angela, real good but one of these days...
ANGELA: (heard it before) I know, nobody's luck lasts forever.
JOHN: Two frogs on a bench.
CHAZ: Two frogs on a bench.
CHAZ: What?   But I'm with him!   Right, John?   John?
NICO: Neighborhood's going to Hell.
JOHN: Numquam leadatur a morsu.
JOHN: Bastard changed the code again. (bangs the doors) Midnite! Come on, do I have to huff and puff here?!
MIDNITE (O.S.): Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes...
JOHN: Deciding which color to paint this place again?
MIDNITE: You're back early.
JOHN: I got tired of spending your money.
MIDNITE: But I'm sure you spent enough.
JOHN: Well I do have a certain standard of living.
MIDNITE: Tell me you found it.
JOHN: I found the vault.
MIDNITE: That's not what I asked.
JOHN: Hey, can I help it if Buddhist monks don't take bribes?
JOHN: Gotcha.
MIDNITE: Second century depiction of a sephiroth in the 4th realm...
JOHN: Right.    So we good here?
MIDNITE: It should counter the iconic plane --
JOHN: That damn thing's never going to balance.
MIDNITE: Must I remind you of what selling fake relics will do to your health?
JOHN: It's authentic, Midnite, you just have the wrong piece. Jesus...
JOHN: What? -- I didn't blink -- that was a cough. You never cough?
JOHN: Better not be any Washingtons in here this time.
MIDNITE: Why did you cut your trip short?
JOHN: I don't know... Just a feeling --
JOHN: Balthazar.
BALTHAZAR: We're not still whining about Manhattan, are we?
BALTHAZAR: That expression alone has made my entire night.
JOHN: I'll make your night -- I'll deport your sorry ass right where you stand --
JOHN: It's bad enough that you let these half-breeds in at all but this piece of shit --
BALTHAZAR: Perks of becoming a primary investor.
JOHN: What?!
BALTHAZAR: Things change, balances shift. Get used to it, Constantine.
JOHN: Not while I'm still breathing --
BALTHAZAR: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
HENNESSEY: Hey, John.
HENNESSEY: I'm real sorry about this morning, John, real sorry. Please don't hate me for draggin' you into that. Please don't...
JOHN: I don't hate you.
HENNESSEY: That's good to hear. Real good...
JOHN: But could you at least wait until I call for you before you show up?
HENNESSEY: You didn't call?
JOHN: Not yet. Jesus, Hennessey, you freak me out sometimes.
HENNESSEY: So you want me to go away and come back?
JOHN: No. I've got an assignment for you.
HENNESSEY: Really?   What kind of assignment?
JOHN: The kind you'll have to be sober for.
HENNESSEY: Oh God, you want me to surf the ether.
JOHN: Come on, you know that exorcism wasn't right.
HENNESSEY: I... I don't have the Sight anymore.
JOHN: Don't have it or don't want to use it?
JOHN: Just look around. A few days. You spot anything unusual, anything -- you let me know. Okay?
JOHN: It'll be like old times.
JOHN: Just for a few days.
HENNESSEY: Okay, okay... for you, John.      Like old times. Right.
ANGELA: I killed a man today.   Another one.
FATHER GARRET: I'm sorry, Angela.
ANGELA: Most cops go twenty years without firing their gun. Not me. I always seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
ANGELA (V.O.): I didn't even see his face. I just pulled the trigger and he went away. Just like all the others...
FATHER GARRET (V.O.): These feelings are natural in your line of work, Angela. I'd be worried if you didn't have them.
FATHER GARRET (V.O.): But you have to be strong. You can't allow your faith to be overshadowed by guilt.
ANGELA (V.O.): I'm trying.
ANGELA (V.O.): I'm trying real hard.
WEISS (V.O.): It's her, Angela...
WEISS: It's Isabel.
ANGELA: She... she fell from the roof?
WEISS: No.   She jumped.
WEISS: I know it's hard to accept but --
ANGELA: Isabel would never in a million years take her own life. Never.
WEISS: Angela... there was a surveillance camera on the roof.
WEISS (O.S.): Take some time...
JOHN: No -- I've beaten things, insurmountable things, things most people have never even heard of and after all that you think I'm going to be done in by THIS?
DR. ARCHER: You wouldn't be the first, John.
JOHN: It can't be that simple. I mean come on, Les, you saved me before. You can do it again, right.
DR. ARCHER: This is different. This is aggressive.
DR. ARCHER: Twenty years ago you didn't want to be here. Now you don't want to leave.
JOHN: That's because I know exactly where I'm going this time.
ANGELA: (rushing toward it) Wait, hold the door!
ANGELA: Going down?
JOHN: Not if I can help it.
ELLIE (O.S.): Lung cancer?   Lung cancer?!
ELLIE: That's funny as shit, John.
JOHN: As if you guys didn't have something to do with it...
ELLIE: Hey, I think you brought this one on yourself.
ELLIE: Now why wouldn't you trust me?
JOHN: I don't know, something in the air --
ELLIE: Don't worry, John, you'll beat this. You beat everything.
JOHN: Not this time, Ellie.
ELLIE: Oh wow, you're serious... No wonder the Boss is in such a good mood.
JOHN: Yeah, I thought maybe you could talk to him for me. You know...?
ELLIE: What?! Dammit, John, I know I owe you but to even ASK that? All those saints and martyrs slipping through his grasp -- his own foot soldiers sent back to him in chunks. He's going to take all that out on you, John, and he's going to enjoy ripping your soul to shreds until the end of time.
JOHN: So I take that as a 'no?'
ELLIE: You're the one soul the man himself would actually come up here to collect. And you know how much he despises this place.
JOHN: I'm starting to see his point.
ELLIE: Have you gone to see the Snob?
ELLIE: Look, don't let your ego get in the way on this. I'd miss having someone up here I can... relate to.
JOHN: I'm sure I can get you in here.
CHAZ: Pass.
ATTENDANT: Can I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?
JOHN: No thanks, I'm not staying long.
ATTENDANT: How about you, ma'am?
ANGELA: I'm not staying long either.
ANGELA: My business with him is urgent.
JOHN: First come, first served.
ANGELA: So you're rude no matter where you are.
ANGELA: Why is he stalling on this? My sister needs a Catholic funeral.
FATHER GARRET: Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin --
ANGELA: She didn't commit suicide.
FATHER GARRET: The Bishop has read otherwise.
ANGELA: Father... David -- this is Isabel. (meeting his eyes) Please...
FATHER GARRET: I'll talk to him again.
GABRIEL: (without looking back) I know what you want, son.
JOHN: Been keeping your all-seeing eye on me, have you?
GABRIEL: I could offer how a shepherd leads even the most wayward of his flock but it might sound disingenuous.
JOHN: So you're going to make me beg?
GABRIEL: It wouldn't help. You've already wasted your chance at redemption.
JOHN: What about the minions I've sent back, the souls that I've saved -- that should guarantee my passage across --
GABRIEL: (keeping it private) -- No -- passage requires faith and faith by definition is belief without proof. You have proof. And that means you're not playing by the same rules as everyone else. Your work has mostly been for selfish reasons. I'm sorry.
JOHN: This is bullshit -- bullshit!
JOHN: It's like you've got some cosmic scale weighing everything we do -- help an old lady across the street -- put in a nickel, kick a dog, take out a dime -- you're fucking nickel and diming us to death down here!
GABRIEL: Keep your voice down.
JOHN: And you know what, you're the ones with the problem, not us -- You make these impossible rules to decide who goes up, who goes down and you don't even understand us --
GABRIEL: Each of you is born with the promise of salvation preordained. The cost of your redemption is simple belief. And yet you whine about impossible rules. Sometimes I imagine you hardly deserve the gift you have been given.
JOHN: Gift?! More like a curse the way you manage things.
GABRIEL: I am taking your situation into account, John, but don't push me.
JOHN: Why me, Gabriel? It's personal, isn't it? I didn't go to church enough? I didn't pray enough? I was five bucks short in the collection plate? Why?
GABRIEL: You're going to die because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15. And you're going to Hell because of the life you took. Or to put it in a way that your kind would understand. You're fucked.
JOHN: He has a rotten sense of humor. (steps past) And his punch lines are killers.
CHAZ: (shouting out) John?   It's raining! Hey!
VOICE OF MAN (O.S.): Hey, buddy, you got a light?
OLD MAN: (coughs) We gotta stick together, right?
ANGELA: I'm sorry, Isabel...
ISABEL (V.O.): (on TV) Constantine.
JOHN: A few months, maybe a year. That's it. End of story. Game over.
JOHN (CONT'D): (as Midnite doesn't react) Well, don't break down on my account.
MIDNITE: What do you want from me?   A shoulder to cry on?
JOHN: This bastard attacked me right out in the open -- on Sepulveda no less.
MIDNITE: They don't like you, John. You've deported how many back to Hell?
JOHN: That's just it -- this wasn't some possession or wayward half breed, it was a full-fledged demon. Here. On our plane.
MIDNITE: Right.
JOHN: I know what I saw.
MIDNITE: You must have just crossed over and didn't even realize it --
JOHN: I didn't cross over -- It was on this side. Here.
MIDNITE: -- it's wet out, you're wandering around aimlessly, not to mention completely emotional --
JOHN: Emotional?!
MIDNITE: Okay, so you saw something. We've seen a few small ones slip through now and then.
JOHN: It's more than that... first the girl, then this.
MIDNITE: John, you know my connections. Any shifts or tremors in the planes and I'd hear about it.
JOHN: Something's coming.
ANGELA: L.A.P.D.   This is Dodson, hello?
JOHN: Welcome to my life.
ANGELA (O.S.): Mr. Constantine?
ANGELA: I saw you at --
JOHN: -- I remember.
ANGELA: And --
JOHN: Yeah.
ANGELA: I'd like to ask you a few questions.
JOHN: I'm not really in the talking mood right now.
ANGELA: Could you just listen then?
ANGELA: Please?
JOHN: Always a catch...
ANGELA: My sister was murdered last week.
JOHN: Sorry to hear...
ANGELA: Her name was Isabel.   Isabel Dodson?
ANGELA: You don't remember her?
JOHN: Never met her.
ANGELA: You sure?
JOHN: She look anything like you? (as Angela nods) I would've remembered.
ANGELA: She was a patient at Ravenscar. Then last Tuesday she just decided to step off the roof.
JOHN: I thought you said she was murdered?
ANGELA: Isabel would never take her own life.
JOHN: You'd be surprised at what people will do.
ANGELA: Look, I know I'm not making much sense -- hell I'm not really sure what I'm doing here... I just feel -- the circles you travel in -- the occult, demonology, exorcisms...
ANGELA: I believe someone got to her, Mr. Constantine, brainwashed her into stepping off that roof. Some kind of legion or cult.
JOHN: Sounds like a theory.   Good luck.
ANGELA: Well I thought with your background and experience, you could at least point me in the right direction.
JOHN: Yeah, okay.   Sure.
ANGELA: My sister always talked about a world better than this. Heaven as some call it. She wasn't afraid of dying because she knew it was waiting for her. What everyone fails to grasp is that if she had really taken her own life --
JOHN: -- she would have committed a mortal sin and her soul would have gone straight to Hell where it would never feel love or compassion or anything but pain again as the master himself rips her apart over and over for the rest of eternity. (beat) That about right?
ANGELA: You're not the only one afraid of Hell.
JOHN: Oh shit...
JOHN (O.S.): Detective!
JOHN: How open is your mind?
JOHN: Do you believe in Heaven and Hell? (off no answer) How about what comes out of each?
JOHN: Hey!
ANGELA: You mean like angels?
JOHN: And demons.
JOHN: See, you don't have the mindset for this kind of work.
ANGELA: Look, I see terrible things every day. A mother drowns her baby. A ten-year-old shoots his father. But it's not demons, it's the evil that men do.
JOHN: You're right, we're capable of terrible things but we usually justify it with motives like money and power and jealousy.
JOHN: Then sometimes, something comes along and gives us just the right nudge and we do truly evil things just for the kick of it.
ANGELA: I don't believe in demons.
JOHN: You should.   They believe in us.
JOHN: We should go...
JOHN: Fast.
ANGELA: What is that?
JOHN: Wings.
ANGELA: Wings?
JOHN: And maybe talons.
ANGELA: Are you kidding? Of what?
JOHN: Something that's not supposed to be here.
JOHN: Close your eyes.
ANGELA: Why?
JOHN: Suit yourself.
JOHN: (to himself) 'I accidentally crossed over?'    I don't think so.
ANGELA: (coming up behind) What was that? I saw wings -- and teeth -- they were flying. What the hell were those things?!
JOHN: They weren't angels.
JOHN: Seplavites, actually. Scavengers for the damned. (off her lost look) Demons?
ANGELA: What? You can't be serious... this is impossible...
JOHN: Yeah... (to himself) And I don't think they were after me...
JOHN: You really believe she wouldn't commit suicide?
ANGELA: (a bit thrown) My sister? (a beat) Never in a million years.
JOHN: Let's be sure.
ANGELA: How?
JOHN: Simple.   See if she's in Hell.
ANGELA: These are all Isabel's things.
JOHN: The cat too?
ANGELA: Yeah, why...?
ANGELA: Don't you need candles and a pentagram for this to work?
JOHN: (deadpan) Why, do you have any?
JOHN: I need you to step outside now.
JOHN: Angela?   Please.
JOHN: Is she here?
JOHN: Is she here?!
JOHN: It's a simple question!    Is she here or not?!!
JOHN: Isabel?
JOHN (O.S.): (weakly) Angela... come back in...
ANGELA: John?     What happened?
ANGELA: How?   How did you do this...?
JOHN (V.O.): When I was a kid, I saw things...
JOHN (V.O.): Things I wasn't supposed to.
WAITRESS (O.S.): Coffee?
JOHN: Tea.
JOHN: My parents sent me to a doctor, a shrink, a priest. I was in four different institutions by the time I was eighteen.
JOHN: The last place they put me was run by a church...
JOHN (V.O.): The revered Father made the brilliant deduction that I was possessed, said I needed to be exorcised...
JOHN (V.O.): It was like someone trying to pull teeth that weren't there.
JOHN: So I took things into my own hands and I found a way out.
ANGELA: You attempted suicide.
JOHN: I never attempt anything.
ANGELA: But you're still here.    Alive.
JOHN: Not my doing.
JOHN (V.O.): Officially I was dead for seven minutes. But believe me, seven minutes in Hell is a lifetime.
SECURITY GUARD: Hey, what're you doing in here?
JOHN (V.O.): When I returned I didn't just see demons anymore, I could do the one thing they couldn't -- come and go as I please.
HENNESSEY: Be there, John... please...
JOHN (V.O.): Heaven and Hell are right here, behind every wall, every face -- the world behind the world. It's crossing over that's the real trick. That's why most demons can only whisper in our ears. But even a whisper can turn your favorite pleasure into your worst nightmare.
MAITRE D': Sir, you need a reservation!
JOHN (V.O.): But the worst demons are the ones that are allowed to be here -- the ones that are half-human so they blend in...
JOHN (V.O.): ... just like those with the angel's touch living alongside of us. The half-breeds.
JOHN (V.O.): They call it 'the Balance.' I call it hypocritical bullshit.
JOHN: So when one of them gets a little cocky, peddles their influence or hijacks a soul -- I deport their scaly ass right back to Hell. (takes a sip of tea) I don't get them all but maybe enough to insure my retirement.
ANGELA: Sounds like you're trying to buy your way into Heaven.
JOHN: Well, what would you do if you were sentenced to a prison where half the inmates were put there by you?
ANGELA: Why you? I mean many go to Hell, why were you able to escape?
JOHN: (sips tea) I don't know.
ANGELA: God has a plan for all of us.
JOHN: Not for me.
ANGELA: Isabel saw things too.
ANGELA: Detective Dodson here.
WEISS (O.S.): Security Guard spotted him near the body, chased him out.
WEISS: He comes over here, makes a run at the entire menu and pow -- deflates like a fricken Macy's day balloon.
JOHN: Shit... (sympathetic) Why didn't you call me, you fat sonna bitch...
JOHN: (to Hennessey) Rest in peace, Father.
JOHN (V.O.): I need to see where Isabel died.
ANGELA (V.O.): Seances, crystals -- channeling... Our father thought she was just trying to get attention. She certainly did that.
ANGELA: She'd tell everyone about things she said she saw. Crazy things. Things that hadn't happened yet. She'd scare my mother to death, talking on and on about Revelations and the end of the world. Then one day she just stopped... never said another word.
JOHN: So you put her in here.
JOHN: Show me her room.
NURSE: Barry!
NURSE: Oh God...
NURSE: No, Barry, that's not Isabel.
NURSE: I'm sorry. They were friends. He kind of had a crush on your sister.
JOHN: You were twins.
JOHN: So how long?
ANGELA: Two months. (beat) This time.
ANGELA: I already did all that.
ANGELA: Now you're insulting me.
JOHN: You don't walk off a building without leaving something behind.
ANGELA: You saw everything she left behind. In that box.
JOHN: Maybe she left something else. Something more personal. Just for you.
JOHN: You were her twin, Angela.    Twins tend to think alike.
ANGELA: I'm not like my sister.
JOHN: But you were at once time. When you were kids. When you'd spend every waking hour with each other. You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it. You'd get hurt, she'd cry.
ANGELA: That was a long time ago...
JOHN: That kind of bond doesn't just disappear.
ANGELA: There's nothing here.
JOHN: She planned her death in this room, she thought it up right where you're standing --
JOHN: She knew you'd come -- She counted on you to see what she saw, to feel what she felt -- to do what she did. What did she do, Angela?
ANGELA: How should I know?
JOHN: What did she do, Angela?
ANGELA: I don't know!
JOHN: What would you do?
JOHN: What would you leave her? What would it be? Where would it be?! Where would it be?
ANGELA: The tree.
ANGELA: (trying to rationalize) There must have been a tree in our backyard... when we were kids...
ANGELA: Cor?
JOHN: Corinthians.
ANGELA: (shaking her head) There is no 14h act in Corinthians.
JOHN: I need a church.
JOHN: Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the book of Ethenius. It's like a dark mirror of the Bible. It paints a different view of Revelations, says that the world will not come to an end at the hand of God but be reborn in the embrace of the damned.
ANGELA: There's a difference?
JOHN: Depends on which side of the fence you're standing.
ANGELA: So why haven't I seen this book before?
JOHN: Because it doesn't exist here on this side.
ANGELA (O.S.): What do you mean --
ANGELA: -- not here on this side?
ANGELA: Where did that come from?
JOHN: (stopping to read) 13:29. 13:30 -- Here... Corinthians 14:01... (skimming to this) 'The sins of the father would only be exceeded by the ego of the son.'
ANGELA: Whose son?
JOHN: Symbol isn't a demon's... that's why I couldn't place it... not a normal possession...
ANGELA: John, what are you talking about?
JOHN: But he can't cross over -- impossible for the son to cross over...
ANGELA: Whose son?   God's?
JOHN: No.  The other one. (off her look) Lucifer had a son too.
BEEMAN (O.S.): Oh my...
BEEMAN: This is not good...
BEEMAN: John?
JOHN (V.O.): The myth says Mammon was conceived before his father's fall from grace but was born after.
JOHN: But unlike his old man, he's never been in the presence of the Creator so he has no fear of him, no respect either. That goes double for us -- God's most prized creations. Mammon would be the last demon we'd ever want crossing over.
ANGELA: But demons can't come and go, that's what you said.
JOHN: Unless they found a bridge. (off her look) Some psychic with the chops to reach all the way to Hell and the grit to withstand whatever shit she'd pull out.
ANGELA: Isabel...
JOHN: But even a bridge wouldn't help Mammon. Because to cross over, the myth says he'd still need the one thing he could never get. Divine assistance. The help of God.
ANGELA: So it's impossible.
JOHN: Impossible? Sure it's impossible. That's what makes it so dangerous. These things exist to break the rules, to find the loopholes. If the past is any indication, then the future isn't on our side.
ANGELA: She knew. That's why she killed herself. But it doesn't make sense...
JOHN: Makes sense to me.
ANGELA: John, she sacrificed herself to beat him.
ANGELA: Why is she in Hell?
JOHN: Beeman?
JOHN: (pounds on door) Hey, Beeman? Beeman?!
ANGELA: Maybe he's not here.
JOHN: He's always here.
ANGELA: What?
JOHN: Oh Jesus, no --
ANGELA: (stepping back) Oh God --
JOHN: Who are you?! Answer me!! Goddamit -- reveal yourself!   I summon you!
JOHN: Into the light I command thee!! Into the light I --
JOHN: ... this is my fault... I sent them in... I sent them right to their deaths... a damn one-man plague.
ANGELA: John, you need a doctor.
JOHN: I've seen a goddamn doctor!!
JOHN: Get away from me!!
ANGELA: John?
JOHN: Stay the hell away -- (tortured look to her) Please --
ANGELA (O.S.): There were no trees in our back yard.
ANGELA: But you knew that already, didn't you?
ANGELA: (walking towards him) You see something in me... Something Isabel had.
JOHN: Go home, Angela.
ANGELA: I need to understand --
ANGELA: Why not?
JOHN: Because you open up to that world, you're inviting whatever's out there back in. That's what happened to Isabel.
ANGELA: I'm not Isabel.
JOHN: No, she embraced her gift while you denied yours and that denial is exactly why you're still alive. Stick with me, that'll change.
JOHN: And I don't need another ghost following me around.
ANGELA: Dammit, John -- they killed my sister!
ANGELA: I can't let them get away with that. Even if it means going down the same path she did. Now if you won't help me get there, I'll find my own way. But I won't run. Never.
ANGELA: Please...
JOHN: You do this, there's no turning back. You see them -- they see you. Understand?
ANGELA (O.S.): Do I take off my clothes or leave them on? (a beat) John?
JOHN (O.S.): I'm thinking.
ANGELA (O.S.): John.
JOHN (O.S.): On is fine.
ANGELA: Why water?
JOHN: It's the universal conduit. Lubricates the transition from one plane to another. Now ask me if there's water in Hell.
JOHN: Sit.
JOHN: Normally only a portion of the body has to be suspended but you wanted the crash course...
ANGELA: (teeth chattering) What will I see?
JOHN: Lie down.
ANGELA: (gesturing the depth) Lie down?
JOHN: You have to be fully submerged.
ANGELA: For how long?
JOHN: As long as it takes.     Here --
JOHN: Last chance... (off her look) Take a deep one.
ANGELA: All those people... so sad...
ANGELA: ... I've always known... where the bad guys are... where to aim, when to duck... it's not luck... I've always known...
JOHN: Angela?
ANGELA: It was rolling toward him -- not a ball -- something smaller. Shiny.
JOHN: Balthazar.
ANGELA (V.O.): Can you kill him? What about the Balance?
JOHN: That half-breed tipped my scales when he started killing my friends. I'm just adding a little counterweight.
ANGELA: What about me?    I can't stay here forever.
JOHN: Think of it as a bulletproof vest.
ANGELA: So I'm going.
JOHN: (knows he can't win) You're staying in the car.
JOHN (O.S.): This shouldn't take long.
YOUNG TURK: (into phone) Hey, early bird is a fat bird, know what I'm sayin'?
PRETTY BOY: What are we pushing today, sir?
BALTHAZAR: Phillip Morris.
JOHN: How's he doing it?
BALTHAZAR: This is in direct violation of the Balance!
JOHN: Screw the Balance.
JOHN: How's he doing it, you half-breed shit?!
BALTHAZAR: I will see you very soon...
JOHN: Not really, no.
BALTHAZAR: You can't cheat it this time... you're going back to Hell.
JOHN: True.   But you're not.
BALTHAZAR: What are you doing?
JOHN: I'm reading you your last rites.
BALTHAZAR: Your remedial incantations have no relevance to my kind.
JOHN: Aren't you half human?
JOHN: You see, that makes you eligible to be forgiven. You do know what it is to truly be forgiven? To be welcomed into the kingdom of God?
JOHN: A demon in heaven -- love to be a fly on that wall...
BALTHAZAR: You're not a priest, you have no power...
JOHN: -- I escaped hell, who else do you know that has the power to do that?!
JOHN: Just tell me how Mammon is crossing over and you can go back to your shithole.
JOHN: 'May the merciful God have mercy on you and grant you the pardon of all your sins...'
JOHN: 'Whosoever sins you remit on earth they are remitted unto them in heaven. I absolve you from -- '
BALTHAZAR: -- It may not even work...
JOHN: How?   How's he doing it?!
JOHN: (bellowing out) 'Grant your child entry into thy kingdom in the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Gh -- '
BALTHAZAR: ... Sangre de dio.
JOHN: How?
BALTHAZAR: What killed the Son of God will give birth to the son of the devil.
JOHN: He's found the Spear.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.): (over com) Ladies and gentlemen, we've been cleared for landing. Please make sure your seats are in their upright and locked position.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.): (over com) We should be on the ground in Los Angeles within ten minutes.
ANGELA: Something's coming...
JOHN: What happened to staying in the car?
ANGELA: You were in danger.
JOHN: Well now there's a premonition.
BALTHAZAR: One more chance...
JOHN (V.O.): Jesus didn't die from being nailed to a cross.
JOHN: He was finished off by a soldier's spear.
ANGELA: I'm Catholic, John -- I know the crucifixion story.
JOHN: Then you know what this spear would mean to a demon trying to cross over.
JOHN: The stains on its edges?
JOHN: Mammon needed divine assistance -- how's the blood of God's only son?
ANGELA: So that's it -- he's got everything he needs to escape...
JOHN: Not quite. (glances at her) Twins.
JOHN: Here we go --
ANGELA: What is that?
JOHN: A hound on the hunt.
JOHN: Hang on --
ANGELA: Impossible.
ANGELA: I lost it.
ANGELA: He's down --
JOHN: He's not down.   Gimme your phone.
BRITISH MAN: They mark their territory with graffiti instead of urine but they're still very much animals.
CHAZ: This is a private line -- John?!
JOHN: Chaz -- where are you?!
CHAZ: Ah... 3rd and Figueroa.
JOHN: You still got that Sedrallus?
CHAZ: (glancing to couple) Yeah, but I'm kind of busy right now, John.
JOHN: Dammit, Chaz, I'm trying to save my ass here!
CHAZ: (under his breath) What else is new...
JOHN: Remember the Chalic of Enook incident?
CHAZ: (remembering) Oh no, no, no, not that, I just paid off this car!
JOHN: West side of the 3rd Street Bridge, say...
JOHN: ... 2 minutes.
CHAZ: I'm five blocks away! (as John CLICKS off) John? John?! Ah... shit.
CHAZ: Sorry, tour's over.
ANGELA: He's back.
ANGELA: John, he's back and he's gaining!
JOHN: Of course he's gaining.
CHAZ: Shit -- shit -- shit --
JOHN: Where's the amulet?
CHAZ: (running up) What the hell was that?!
JOHN: We're even.
CHAZ: Even?
MIDNITE: Mammon has been trying to climb out of his father's shadow for eons.
JOHN: And this time he might just make it.
MIDNITE: (unconvinced) Because he's got the Spear?
JOHN: And the bridge.
MIDNITE: You're giving this girl way too much credit.
JOHN: You don't know her.
MIDNITE: And you do?   That would be a first.
JOHN: Where's the chair?
MIDNITE: The chair?
JOHN: The delicate little number from Sing Sing?
MIDNITE: It's a fine line that separates a hero from a fool.
JOHN: I'll take my chances.
MIDNITE: And taint my establishment with your blood? I don't think so.
JOHN: Midnite --
MIDNITE: You know what that device can do to the ill-equipped --
JOHN: Midnite --
MIDNITE: -- and even in your most glorious days your brain was never your most powerful attribute --
JOHN: Where the hell is the chair, you dumb shit?!
JOHN: That was the cancer talking, you know that, right?
MIDNITE: (holds up his finger) Once.
JOHN: What's in your bathroom, a Renoir?
MIDNITE: I have insurance issues.
MIDNITE: You haven't surfed in decades.
JOHN: Like riding a bike...
MIDNITE: You'll be lucky to reach an elemental plane.
JOHN: Then just increase the juice.
MIDNITE: In your condition your body won't take much.
JOHN: I just need enough rope to find her.
MIDNITE: And if you do -- what then?
JOHN: One goddamn problem at a time --
JOHN: You want me to sign a waiver?
JOHN: Hang on, Angela.
MIDNITE (V.O.): Listen to my voice inside...
MIDNITE: I'll try and guide you out.
JOHN: Try?
MIDNITE: Mammon was forced out of that girl when she jumped so unless he found a holding vessel to wait in, he would have fallen back to Hell.
JOHN: No, he's still here.   I'm sure of it.
MIDNITE: Then watch yourself. He could be in anyone out there.
JOHN: Roach wings? What happened to using lilac pedals -- ?
MIDNITE: Peter do caelis, Deus, misere nobis. Fili Redemptor mundi, Deus, Miserere nobis...
MIDNITE (V.O.): Find the possessor and the Spear will be revealed... find them... find them and follow...
JOHN: Ravenscar. The abandoned wing. He's in the boy.
MIDNITE: You know these won't kill them.
MIDNITE: You probably won't even get close enough to use them.
MIDNITE: And it's not just the boy.
MIDNITE: You better worry about whoever's helping him.
MIDNITE: As much as I admire your blind faith even in the most dire situations -- expecting to just waltz into a facility that is about to become the floodgate of Hell is reaching a bit, even for you.
MIDNITE: Well I suppose two fools can die just as easily as one.
MIDNITE: Hey, you think I'm trusting you to save the world?
MIDNITE: But we're going to need more than a few magic bullets to get inside.
JOHN: That ritual you do with the water, can you do more than one bottle at a time?
MIDNITE: (sighs) Figures.
JOHN: Okay -- let's cut the scratch and call it a night. Meeting's over.
JOHN: Ellie?
ELLIE: Oh, John, you know how much I love it on this side. This was just an opportunity to make it permanent.
JOHN: You think his son will be any different? He'll just turn this place into his own Hell and then where will you to party, Heaven?
ELLIE: No need to get nasty.
JOHN: Never bothered you before.
ELLIE: I am so going to miss our little trysts.
JOHN: I'm sure you will.
JOHN: Now turn around and take your friends with you.
JOHN: I will deport you.   All of you. You know I can.
ELLIE: Oh, John, this is embarrassing. Where is your pride?
JOHN: Go to Hell.
ELLIE: Holy water!
ELLIE: I'm not going back there!
JOHN: We are what we are, Ellie --
MIDNITE: Let's go.
MAMMON (O.S.): Angela.
JOHN: (rushing toward him) Barry!
JOHN: Let her up!!   Let her up!!
JOHN: Shit --
JOHN: Amar natash bow basar! Rescind from the flesh I command thee --
JOHN: Back to Hell, asshole --
MIDNITE: (to John) Finish it.
JOHN: Et separatur a plasmate tuo, Ut num quam laedatur amorsu antiqui serpentes.
JOHN/MIDNITE: Rescind from the flesh I command thee -- Amar natash bow basar!
JOHN: Into the light I command thee! Into the light I command thee!
VOICE OF MAN (O.S.): Your ego is astounding.
JOHN: Gabriel?
JOHN: Figures...
JOHN: And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.
GABRIEL: You presume to judge me, John.
JOHN: Betrayal, murder, genocide?    Call me provincial.
GABRIEL: I am seeking to inspire humankind to be all that was intended.
JOHN: By unleashing Hell on Earth?     Good thinking...
GABRIEL: You've had it too easy for too long.
JOHN: So what's a few thousand years of pain, right?
GABRIEL: You never deserved to be blessed. You've all been born with a silver spoon in your mouth, never really appreciating the gift you were given so freely -- unconditional love from your creator.
JOHN: And that just bugs the shit out of you.
GABRIEL: It's not your fault. Like the animals you are, you never learn unless sufficiently prodded. Pleasure has no lasting effect. But subject you to pain, unpleasantness -- suffering -- and you will take notice, you will fight to overcome, to earn your redemption. That is when you're at your best.
JOHN: You're trying to teach us a lesson?
GABRIEL: No, I'm giving you the chance to rise above the suffering and truly earn the love of God. (a beat) The road to salvation begins tonight. Right now.
JOHN: (whispering) ... I know I'm not one of your favorites... I'm not even allowed in your house these days... but I could use a little attention...
GABRIEL: (whispering to her) Cross the bridge to your destiny...
JOHN: Hurry...
SATAN (O.S.): The time has come at last to collect your soul.
SATAN: Hello, John.
JOHN: You're early.
SATAN: You're the one show I wouldn't miss.
JOHN: So I've heard.
SATAN: I didn't think you'd make the same mistake twice.
SATAN: You didn't, did you?
JOHN: ... so how's your son?
SATAN: And why would that matter to you?
JOHN: ... he's topside...
SATAN: I know.
JOHN: With Gabriel.
SATAN: Your point?
JOHN: He's helping your son create his own Hell on Earth...
SATAN: Well, boys will be boys...
JOHN: He has the Spear of Destiny.
SATAN: This is another one of your cons.
JOHN: Go look for yourself...
JOHN: You've waited twenty years for me, what's another twenty seconds?
SATAN (O.S.): Gabriel?
SATAN: Say goodbye to the sun -- both of you.
GABRIEL: No!!!!!!!!
SATAN: So... what do you want?   An extension?
JOHN: Isabel...
SATAN: What about her?
JOHN: ... let her... go home...
SATAN: You would give up your life so she could go to Heaven?
SATAN: Fine. (closes, opens eyes) It's done.
SATAN (V.O.): Time to go.
SATAN: The sacrifice!! No!!!!   THIS ONE
SATAN: You will live, John Constantine, you will live so you'll have the chance to prove that your soul truly belongs in Hell. You will live!
JOHN: Human...
JOHN: You don't deserve to be human.
GABRIEL: Then pass judgment on me now.
GABRIEL: Do it.   Seek revenge.   End my life.
GABRIEL: Kill me! Pull the trigger!     Be the hand of God!
JOHN: ... and I'll be condemned again...
GABRIEL: Do it!
JOHN: You're even worthless as bait.
GABRIEL: Deny your true nature today, but what of tomorrow, of the tomorrow after that? It is only a matter of time before you end up right back where you belong. It is who you are, Constantine. Damned.
JOHN: That's called pain.    Get used to it.
ANGELA: Thank you, John.
JOHN (V.O.): Some people are born to make a difference. I had to die. Twice.
JOHN (V.O.): God does work in mysterious ways.
JOHN (V.O.): Some people like it...
JOHN (V.O.): Some people don't.
