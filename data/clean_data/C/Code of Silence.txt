SHOOTING DRAFT: EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT TO DAWN Thundering north through the glass canyons of the Loop, the elevated train SCREECHES through the city awakening. As it races north across the river past ancient factories giving way to high rise splendor, lights glistening against the dawn, we see the complex business of bringing a city to life in the morning. On the Near North Side an assortment of revelers are winding up their night on the town. The pressmen loiter outside the Tribune loading docks, and fishing boats are outbound through the Chicago River locks. A streetsweeping crew moves through the Fulton Market, Chicago's central meat and produce distribution center. At the Merchandise Mart platform the elevated train picks up two old cleaning ladies wearing babushkas.
SPIDER: Say, hey, Cub fans, I hope to hell y'all down there cause we got a big game today.

CRAGIE: ( yelling into the apartment ) Police! Stay where you are!
EDDIE: Take it easy, Kosalas.
CRAGIE: The kid didn't dust him. I did.
CRAGIE: Him or me, Sarge. The kid saw the whole thing.
CRAGIE: Tell him, Nick.
KOSALAS: ( softly ) Yeah, that's how it went down.
EDDIE: ( pause ) Stay here. ( to Cragie ) Take care of your partner.
VICTOR: ( to relative ) Call Luis.
KOBAS: Get these people back out of here,
CRAGIE: Look, it's no big thing, Kid. A friggin' dog and pony show. Some dumb ass questions by dumb ass bureaucrats. "When's the last time you were at the range?" Crap like Look. It was a fuckin' accident. Why can't you just be
KOSALAS: Look. It was a fuckin' accident. Why can't you just be
CRAGIE: ( stiffens ) You born yesterday?! These ain't cops. They'll roast our ass just cause we carry a badge. Both of us. ( menacing ) We stick together on this, kid. We're partners, right?
DONATO: Aw man, don't do that. You know how much these things cost?
DONATO: Eddie. Scam this. A bait shop. Worms, minnows. Don't even need real worms. Storage problem. Got those rubber ones, you know?
EDDIE: Yeah, what about the winter?
DONATO: We winter in Florida. Rubber neck the beach bunnies. Aw, look at that. Ruined my brand new fence climbers. Hand made in Italy.
DONATO: Oh, fuck, Partida. I'm gonna tell her you shot me. Cusack. You were in charge here?
PARTIDA: Cusack. You were in charge here?
EDDIE: Does it look like it?
PARTIDA: ( to Donato ) And you were a principal in one of the shootings?

PARTIDA: Where's the officer who was involved in the other shooting?
EDDIE: ( pointing ) Third floor rear.

MUSIC: ( to Efren ) You know that, Efren. When your big bad brother Luis gets the word, your ass is freeze dried and fried.
BRENNAN: Talk you hemorrhoid!
POMPAS: ( in Spanish ) Your mother fucks dogs in the street.
BRENNAN: You wanna tune-up? Hey Sarge, you know why a Comacho's like a cue-ball? Cause the harder you hit 'em, the better their English gets.
EDDIE: We're jerking off here.
SANCHEZ: Let's cut the shit, Cusack.
SANCHEZ: Option 1: you can send em downtown. If Judge Collins didn't get laid last night, you can probably get him to arraign my clients for loitering in their own hallway. He'll set bail. I'll take care of it. Option 2: release them here and now and we'll call it a day. Up to you.
EDDIE: I like to see you earn your money.
CRAGIE: We come up the back stairs. We start cleanin' the hallway when the deceased pops out of a doorway with a 25 automatic. I tell him to drop it, but he's comin. We had no choice. Kosalas here saw the whole thing.
KATES: Did you?
KOSALAS: I was on another doorway.
KATES: But you saw the action?
KOSALAS: I saw him fall.
KATES: And the kid was armed?
KOSALAS: That's the way it went down.
KATES: And you saw the weapon?
KOSALAS: ( nods ) Yes sir. I saw it in his hand.
KATES: ( signs document ) Cragie, you'll be assigned to headquarters until the hearing
CRAGIE: Hearing? Who called for a hearing? The little fuck tried to shoot me in the back!
KATES: Ms. Partida
CRAGIE: That piece of shit!
KATES: Shut-up, Cragie. Partida has demanded a formal hearing. You will be under oath so the department will provide you with a lawyer unless you've got your own. An OPS Review Board member is waiting to talk to you. Doesn't sound like you got anything to worry about.
KATES: Kosalas, you work with Cusack until this is over.
KOSALAS: Yes sir.
EDDIE: I ain't got no time to nursmaid a rookie. I don't need a partner.
KATES: ( explodes ) Your right! You don't need a partner! You need a goddamn keeper! ( slams fist on desk ) Jesus Christ! How do I explain this one upstairs? ( stands ) We gave you 600 man-hours, you took a month planning the damn thing, and what have you got to show for it? Nine bodies? A dead informant? One of my best men shot! For Christ's ( stares at ceiling ) You're going to have me back on a beat busting perverts in the park.
EDDIE: We got a bigger problem. These Comachos aren't gonna take this lying down. The animals are out of the Just what I need. A goddman war.

KATES: I'll deal with upstairs.
KATES: Just get me some answers, huh.
EDDIE: That's my job.
PARTIDA: .you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to have an attorney present at all times. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.
EDDIE: I'm going to have to fix that.
EDDIE: You know, it's kind of interesting. That 16 year old in the hallway with the gun? Partida told me he doesn't have a record. The kid's never been Yeah, well, you know, if you read the papers, cops only shoot honor students. Sole support of the family and all that.
KOSALAS: Yeah, well, you know, if you read the papers, cops only shoot honor students. Sole support of the family and all that.
KOSALAS: Nice fellow this Luis Comacho. Donato says they call him the Angel-of-Death.
EDDIE: Real sweetheart.
DIANA: Diana and her grandmother grin at each other. They are done. Theresa stands back to admire their work.
DIANA: A PHONE RINGS Diana rushes into the kitchen and comes right out with a birthday cake, and sets it on the table next to some presents.
DIANA: Daddy, would you get that!
THERESA: Diana goes to the stairs where her mother sits with her hands over her eyes.
DIANA: Keep 'em closed now.
DIANA: O.K., open 'em.
DIANA: Happy birthday, momma.
THERESA: ( in Italian ) Happy birthday, Molly.

ENGINEER: .After the gyros are locked, any movement of the hand controller is duplicated by the 'Prowler.'
ENGINEER: This simple control system means that even semi-skilled employees can operate the unit with a minimum of training. As they say, "Even a child can operate it."
KATES: He's talking about you, Cusack. Pay attention. You're all gonna have to be qualified on this. It's the future.
EDDIE: Just what the world needs, another gun without a brain.
KATES: You're looking at the perfect cop. The damn thing follows orders.
EDDIE: I got better things to do than play with toys. If the Commander will pick someone to try and elude 'Prowler,' we can show how our various target acquisition systems function.
ENGINEER: If the Commander will pick someone to try and elude 'Prowler,' we can show how our various target acquisition systems function.
MACHINE: ( from speaker ) Bang. You're dead.

DONATO: O.K. O.K. But just let me plant two words in your brain. Alligator
KOSALAS: Eddie nods, and Kosalas signals the waitress. There is a long beat at Kosalas fidgets and Eddie waits.
KOSALAS: Looks like I'm caught between the rock and the hard place, Sarge.
KOSALAS: You know I really wanted to be a good cop, but. shit. It's hard enough sometimes just to stay alive. Comes so easy to you. You got all the fuckin' answers. Me, I'm still tryin' to find the questions.
KOSALAS: Cragie planted the gun on the kid. Just wasted him, and then I. I don't know what to do about the hearing tomorrow.
EDDIE: Tell the truth.
KOSALAS: See. It's all so nothin' for you. If I talk straight every cop on the force will shit on me. If I don't. Cragie gets away with murder.
EDDIE: And the chance to do it again. Next time he might take away a cop. That make any difference?
KOSALAS: He's my partner.
EDDIE: Your partner's selling you out, Kosalas. He kills an unarmed kid, and now he's risking your ass to save his own.
KOSALAS: It was a mistake.
EDDIE: It cost an innocent kid his life.
KOSALAS: I know that! I KNOW THAT!
KOSALAS: ( softly ) Jesus. I see that kid's face every time I close my eyes.
EDDIE: Tell 'em like it is, Nick. I'll back you up.

PARTIDA: ( to steno ) Officer Cragie has already been sworn. ( pause ) Officer Cragie, you have heard Mrs. Murillio's testimony
CRAGIE: Yes, sir.
PARTIDA: You have heard her tell this panel that she saw you lay the gun in her grandson's hand.
CRAGIE: I'm not saying the woman would make this up. But there's no way she could have seen anything from where she was standing in a hallway that dark. Like you said, she's the boy's If it was dark, Officer, how were you sure Vega had a gun?
PARTIDA: If it was dark, Officer, how were you sure Vega had a gun?
CRAGIE: We were lucky. There was a glint of light, a reflection comin off the barrel of the weapon.
DONATO: You think he'll get a pass?
EDDIE: You heard it all. What do you think?
DONATO: If the hearing was over I'd have to put my money on the old lady. But Kosalas's next. My bet's on The kid may surprise you.
EDDIE: The kid may surprise you.
PARTIDA: And right after you heard Officer Cragie's gun discharge, what did you do then?
KOSALAS: I immediately advanced down the hall.
PARTIDA: And what did you see?
KOSALAS: The deceased, Vega, lying on the floor. Officer Cragie was checking his vital signs.
PARTIDA: What happened then?
KOSALAS: We recovered a .25 calibre automatic from the teenager's right hand.
PARTIDA: Did you see that weapon in Vega's hand before Officer Cragie fired?
KOSALAS: Yes, sir.
PARTIDA: No more questions.
PARTIDA: I'd like to now call Sergeant Cusack.
DIANA: You made that uniform look good.
PIRELLI: That good looking gorilla next to me is Eddie's father. Better than good cop. Killed in the line of duty.
EDDIE: I can't comment on that. It was over before I got there.

EDDIE: Cragie's in my unit, yes.
PARTIDA: Did you give the men their various I did.
EDDIE: I did.
PARTIDA: Did you request that officer Cragie be on your TAC team?
EDDIE: No, I didn't.
PARTIDA: Sergeant. I have here a department document dated 24 September, of last year. It is a request by you, to your superiors, to have Officer Cragie transferred to another unit. Are you familiar with this document?
EDDIE: The room listens to every word.
PARTIDA: Why did you request his transfer?
EDDIE: Maybe 30 years is too long for anyone to look at the city's guts, Mr. What happened to this request?
PARTIDA: What happened to this request?
EDDIE: It was denied.
PARTIDA: This is a letter of support for Officer Cragie. Everyone in his unit signed it but
EDDIE: I don't agree with what it says.
PARTIDA: Are you saying you do not believe Officer Cragie is fit to work the streets of Chicago?
EDDIE: That's what I'm saying.
EDDIE: ( to phone ) I just dialed 348-6610, and I get this funny buzz. Check the line for me? Thanks.
BRENNAN: Seems to me the man's got his tongue stuck to his asshole, Cragie.
CRAGIE: Hey, that don't bother him. He's the fuckin White Knight. You wanna take on the whole world by yourself? Now you're gonna get your chance, Sarge.
