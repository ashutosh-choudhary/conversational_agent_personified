DELETED: FADE IN: EXT. MEGEVE DAY A handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers. One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl. She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite activity eating. Then a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver shining, black and ugly in the sunlight. REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat. The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun shoots a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight into REGGIE's face.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Including JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so. REGGIE looks at him sternly.
REGGIE: Don't tell me you didn't know it was
WIDER ANGLE: SYLVIE GAUDET, French, attractive, blonde, in her early thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS.
REGGIE: Isn't there something constructive he can do like start an avalanche?

SYLVIE: When you start to eat like this something is the matter.
REGGIE: Sylvie I'm getting a divorce.
SYLVIE: Ça alors! From Charles?
REGGIE: He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have But what?
SYLVIE: But what?
REGGIE: I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
SYLVIE: It is infuriating that your unhappiness does not turn to fat!
SYLVIE: But why do you want a divorce?
REGGIE: Because I don't love him.
SYLVIE: But that is no reason to get a
SYLVIE: With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
REGGIE: ( sitting ) I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
MAN: Does this belong to you?
WIDER ANGLE: Including REGGIE, MAN, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE is too terrified to answer. Realizing this, the man, PETER JOSHUA, takes off the snow-mask to reveal a handsome, tanned face.
PETER: Oh, forgive me. Is this yours?
REGGIE: ( indicating SYLVIE ) It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
PETER: He was throwing snowballs at Baron We don't know each other, do we?
REGGIE: Why, do you think we're going to?
PETER: I don't know how would I know?
REGGIE: I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
PETER: ( smiling ) Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical ( he starts off )
REGGIE: ( turning ) How's that?
PETER: ( turning ) How's that?
REGGIE: You give up awfully easy, don't you?
SYLVIE: Viens, Jean-Louis, let us take a walk. I have never seen a Rothschild
PETER: ( drying ) Clever fellow almost missed me.
REGGIE: I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
PETER: ( moving ) Sorry. Which view would you like?
REGGIE: The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
PETER: Peter Joshua.
REGGIE: I'm Regina Lampert.
PETER: Is there a Mr. Lampert?

PETER: I'm not sure I
REGGIE: Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste the small size and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size that the large size is the smallest size there is.
PETER: Oh. I guess.
REGGIE: Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
PETER: Yes, but we're divorced.
REGGIE: That wasn't a proposal I was just Is your husband with you?
PETER: Is your husband with you?
REGGIE: Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you Pete?
PETER: Mr. Joshua. Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
REGGIE: Now you're angry.
PETER: No, I'm not I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
REGGIE: Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
PETER: Shakespeare never said that.
REGGIE: How do you know?
PETER: It's terrible you just made it Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?

GRANDPIERRE: Is it all right?
REGGIE: I wish you wouldn't.
GRANDPIERRE: Les effets de Lampert.
GRANDPIERRE: On Wednesday last your husband sold the entire contents of the apartment at public auction. Furniture, clothing, kitchenware everything. The gallery, in complying with his wishes, paid him in cash. One million two hundred and fifty thousand New Francs. In dollars, a quarter of a million. The authorities in Bordeaux have searched his compartment on the train. They have searched it thoroughly. They did not find $250,000, Madame.
GRANDPIERRE: These few things are all that was found in the train compartment. There was no other baggage. Your husband must have been in a great hurry.
GRANDPIERRE: One wallet containing four thousand francs one agenda his last notation was made yesterday Thursday "Five p.m. Jardin des Champs- Why there?

REGGIE: ( reading ) "My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed." ( she looks up, puzzled ) Not very much, is it?
GRANDPIERRE: We took the liberty of calling your dentist we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
REGGIE: Did you?
GRANDPIERRE: Yes. Your appointment has been One key to your apartment one comb one fountain pen one toothbrush one tin of tooth powder that is all.
GRANDPIERRE: If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
REGGIE: ( sighing ) Is that all? Can I go now?
GRANDPIERRE: One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
REGGIE: Of course it is.
GRANDPIERRE: And this?
REGGIE: I don't understand.
GRANDPIERRE: And this? And this?
GRANDPIERRE: Have you nothing to say, Madame?
REGGIE: ( hopefully ) It's all right if you want to smoke your cigar now.
ANOTHER ANGLE: As PETER enters.
REGGIE: ( surprised ) What are you doing here?
PETER: I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am and to find out if there was anything I could do.
REGGIE: How did you find out?
PETER: It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
REGGIE: Thank you.
PETER: I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.

PETER: Where did everything go?
REGGIE: Charles sold it all at auction.
PETER: Do you know what you're going to do?
REGGIE: Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
PETER: Doing what?
REGGIE: I'm a simultaneous translator like Sylvie, only she's English to French I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
PETER: Instant divorce you mean?
REGGIE: Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this tossed off a train like a sack of third-class Come on. You can't stay here.
PETER: ( Taking her hand ) Come on. You can't stay here.
REGGIE: I don't know where to go.
PETER: We'll find you a hotel.
REGGIE: Not too expensive I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
PETER: Something modest but clean and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains okay?
REGGIE: I loved this room but Charles never saw it only what was in it. All those exquisite things I think I prefer it like this.
REGGIE: It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
SYLVIE: Didn't Charles have any friends?
REGGIE: Don't ask me I'm only the widow. If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
SYLVIE: At least he knows how to behave at
SYLVIE: Have you no idea who could have done Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name now it turns out I didn't even know that.

BARTHOLOMEW: I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert I'm an administrator a desk jockey trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs

REGGIE: Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
BARTHOLOMEW: Yes and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good
BARTHOLOMEW: ( a pause, regarding her ) Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
REGGIE: Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
BARTHOLOMEW: You're Charles Voss's wife now that he's dead you're their only Mr. Bartholomew if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job!

BARTHOLOMEW: Oh, haven't I? The money Mrs. Lampert the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too they want it very badly.
REGGIE: But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
BARTHOLOMEW: ( laughing ) Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that! ( drying his eyes ) Oh, dear.
REGGIE: Then whose is it? His or theirs?
BARTHOLOMEW: ( she looks at him for a moment ) Oh, I see.
REGGIE: ( she looks at him for a moment ) Oh, I see.
BARTHOLOMEW: And I'm afraid we want it back.
REGGIE: But I don't have it.
BARTHOLOMEW: That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
REGGIE: I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the
BARTHOLOMEW: I believe you.
REGGIE: Thanks very much.
BARTHOLOMEW: Oh, you've got the money all right you just don't know you've got it.
REGGIE: Mr. Bartholomew if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
BARTHOLOMEW: Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert you've got it.
REGGIE: You mean it's just lying around someplace all that cash?
BARTHOLOMEW: Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim you look for it, Mrs. Lampert I'm quite sure you'll find it.
REGGIE: Look for it, Mrs. Lampert look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
BARTHOLOMEW: Look for it, Mrs. Lampert look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
BARTHOLOMEW: Here's where you're to call me day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
REGGIE: Wait a minute you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
BARTHOLOMEW: We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
REGGIE: Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him so whoever killed him has it they have it!
REGGIE: Why not?
BARTHOLOMEW: ( grimly ) Because they're still here.
REGGIE: Like I said, Mrs Lampert I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.

REGGIE: Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
PETER: Usually it's because they want something and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
REGGIE: Do you tell lies?

REGGIE: How do you know what they're doing?
PETER: I don't but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have What are you talking about?

DELETED: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM NIGHT REGGIE hangs up the phone, picks up her bag, checks her hair in the mirror, then starts for the door. She stops as she notices the connecting door leading to the room next door, DYLE's room. She goes to it, silently slips out the key and bends to peer through the keyhole.
WIDE ANGLE: Including DYLE as he reacts, his head wheeling to look at the key. Snatching his coat, he runs for the door.

REGGIE: ( to DRIVER ) Aux Halles vite!
DELETED: EXT. LES HALLES NIGHT REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW walking. The Central Market is teeming with activity trucks creeping around other trucks, cases of fruit and vegetables stacked on every inch of sidewalk, WORKERS of all types milling around, unloading trucks and stacking crates, little electric carts scooting in and out and nearby, one of the huge, high-roofed sheds where the butchers work.
BARTHOLOMEW: ( looking around ) Incredible, isn't it? Zola called it 'le ventre de Paris' the womb of Paris, the belly.
REGGIE: ( peeling it ) What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
BARTHOLOMEW: ( leaves a coin on the crate ) Were you followed?
REGGIE: Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
BARTHOLOMEW: He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew I saw it.
REGGIE: He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew I saw it.
BARTHOLOMEW: Dyle, or whatever his name is.
REGGIE: Dyle, or whatever his name is.
BARTHOLOMEW: What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
REGGIE: He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
BARTHOLOMEW: Describe him.
REGGIE: Well he's tall over six feet rather thin in good physical shape, I'd say dark eyes quite handsome, really.
BARTHOLOMEW: ( shaking his head ) No, what?
REGGIE: No, what?
BARTHOLOMEW: That's not Carson Dyle.
REGGIE: ( stopping ) There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert that's You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
BARTHOLOMEW: There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert that's You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
REGGIE: You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
BARTHOLOMEW: It's enough to make you a vegetarian, isn't it?
REGGIE: It's just lucky that I'm not hanging next to one of those things right
REGGIE: Mr. Bartholomew why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
BARTHOLOMEW: I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
REGGIE: Dead? Mr. Bartholomew maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
DELETED: INT. LES HALLES BISTRO NIGHT Lined up at a zinc bar are several BUTCHERS, their white smocks stained with blood. REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW sit at the
BARTHOLOMEW: I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
REGGIE: Barely, yes.
BARTHOLOMEW: In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. the military espionage unit were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men
WAITER: Vous désirez?
REGGIE: ( smiling ) They always do that.
BARTHOLOMEW: ( to the WAITER ) Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes et un ballon de rouge.
REGGIE: Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes et un ballon de rouge.
BARTHOLOMEW: Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
REGGIE: Can I at least keep the onion soup?
REGGIE: ( to the WAITER ) La soupe tout simplement.
REGGIE: ( anxiously ) Go on, please five men $250,000 the French Underground
BARTHOLOMEW: Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
REGGIE: Steal it how?
BARTHOLOMEW: By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
REGGIE: ( fascinated ) May I have a cigarette, please?
REGGIE: I hate these things it's like drinking coffee through a veil.
BARTHOLOMEW: Everything went smoothly enough until after the gold was buried then, before they could get out, they were ambushed by a German patrol. A machine gun separated Scobie from his right hand and caught Carson Dyle full in the stomach.
BARTHOLOMEW: What's wrong with that one?
REGGIE: Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
BARTHOLOMEW: Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
REGGIE: Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew what happened then?
BARTHOLOMEW: Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they
WAITER: La soupe, c'est pour qui?
REGGIE: Pour moi. Go on, Mr. Bartholomew.
BARTHOLOMEW: Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
REGGIE: But if they stole all that money why can't you arrest them?
BARTHOLOMEW: We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together but we still have no But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
REGGIE: But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
BARTHOLOMEW: C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
REGGIE: I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.

In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
REGGIE: Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
BARTHOLOMEW: That's the spirit.
REGGIE: Oh, stop it. What do you want me to We're anxious to know who this man is the one calling himself Dyle.
BARTHOLOMEW: We're anxious to know who this man is the one calling himself Dyle.
REGGIE: Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
BARTHOLOMEW: No, Mrs. Lampert.
REGGIE: But no one actually saw him die.
BARTHOLOMEW: No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
REGGIE: Oh. Then who's this one?
BARTHOLOMEW: I don't know but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
REGGIE: Me? Why me?
BARTHOLOMEW: You're in an ideal position he trusts you. Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.

SCOBIE: ( after a pause ) That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home.

REGGIE: What do you mean, no?
GIDEON: What do you mean, no?
TEX: The kid said
REGGIE: No, Jean-Louis.
REGGIE: It's nothing, I tell you!
GROUP SHOT: As TEX finally springs the latches and opens the lid.
WIDER ANGLE: Including REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS by the door.

REVERSE SHOT: DYLE, TEX and GIDEON staring at CAMERA.
TEX: Now who'da done a mean thing like I'm not quite sure.
DYLE: ( looking carefully at both ) I'm not quite sure.
TEX: This ain't my room.
GIDEON: Mine, either.
DYLE: ( considering the situation ) The police aren't going to like this one bit.
GIDEON: ( helpful ) We could dry him off and take him down the hall to his own room. ( looking at the body ) He really doesn't look so bad.
TEX: We could put him to bed 'n let one o' them fem-de-chambers find him in the mornin'.
TEX: Poor ol' Herman him 'n good luck always was strangers. Maybe now he'll meet up with his other hand someplace but I sure hope it ain't waitin' for him in Heaven.
GRANDPIERRE: No! No! No! No!
GRANDPIERRE: A man drowned in his bed impossible! And in his pajamas the second one in his pajamas c'est trop bête!

GRANDPIERRE: And yet you registered in Megeve as Mr. Joshua. Do you know it is against the law to register under an assumed No, I didn't.
DYLE: No, I didn't.
REGGIE: It's done in America all the time.
GRANDPIERRE: None of you will be permitted to leave Paris until this matter is cleared up. Only I warn you I will be watching. We use the guillotine in this country I have always suspected that the blade coming down causes no more than a slight tickling sensation on the back of the neck. It is only a guess, of course I hope none of you ever finds out for certain.

REGGIE: Who do you think did it Gideon?
DYLE: Or Tex?
REGGIE: Or Tex?
DYLE: You're a big help. Can I have one of
REGGIE: You're a big help. Can I have one of
REGGIE: ( to the VENDOR )
REGGIE: I think Tex did it.
DYLE: Because I really suspect Gideon and it is always the person you don't Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical or can't they help What's so illogical about that?
REGGIE: Because I really suspect Gideon and it is always the person you don't Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical or can't they help What's so illogical about that?
DYLE: Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical or can't they help What's so illogical about that?

DYLE: A ) It's always the person you don't suspect; B ) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C ) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
REGGIE: Oh. I guess they just can't help it.

REGGIE: Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie. Wouldn't it be nice if we were like What like Scobie?
DYLE: What like Scobie?
REGGIE: No Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
DYLE: ( frowning ) I'd love some, thanks.
REGGIE: I'm sorry.
DYLE: No sense messing up the streets.
REGGIE: I'm scared.
DYLE: I'm scared.
REGGIE: I'm scared.
DYLE: Don't worry, I'm not going to hit No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
REGGIE: No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
DYLE: Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many
REGGIE: What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex that means we're in his way, too.
DYLE: Yes, I know.
REGGIE: First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
DYLE: ( surprised ) What? Assassinate somebody?

REGGIE: swing down from there on a rope to save the woman you love like Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'?
REGGIE: Hurry up and change I'm starved.
DYLE: Let me know what you want I'll pick a suit that matches.
DELETED: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM LATE AFTERNOON She enters, fixes her hair in the mirror, then goes to the door connecting her room with DYLE's. She unlocks it, tries to open it, but finds it locked. Disappointed, she knocks.
REGGIE: It's the house detective why haven't you got a girl in there?
DYLE: Lord, you're a pest.
DYLE: I'd like to take a bath.
REGGIE: Wouldn't it be better if you did it in my room?
REGGIE: I wouldn't want to use that tub. Besides, I don't want to be alone. I'm afraid.
DYLE: I'm only next door if anything happens, holler.
DELETED: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM LATE AFTERNOON As DYLE enters.
DYLE: He wheels as the door is slammed and REGGIE, who had been standing behind it, locks it and pockets the key.
REGGIE: Got you.
DYLE: Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
REGGIE: The shower's in there.
DYLE: ( warning ) Reggie open the door.
REGGIE: This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
DYLE: Then I suggest you call one of them.
REGGIE: I dare you. What are you doing?
REGGIE: ( has she gone too far? ) What are you doing?
DYLE: Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on? What a nut.
DYLE: I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe any Shut the door!
REGGIE: Shut the door!
DYLE: I don't think I know that one.
REGGIE: What on earth are you doing?
DYLE: ( explaining pleasantly )
DYLE: The suit needs it more than I do, How often do you go through this little ritual?
REGGIE: How often do you go through this little ritual?
DYLE: Every day. The manufacturer recommends I don't believe it.
REGGIE: I don't believe it.
DYLE: "Wearing this suit during washing will help protect its shape."
DYLE: He begins unbuttoning his suit. She turns and leaves, slamming the door after her.
DELETED: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM LATE AFTERNOON As REGGIE goes to the armoire to select a dress. The PHONE rings and she answers it.
REGGIE: ( into phone ) Yes ?
BARTHOLOMEW: ( on the phone ) Mrs. Lampert? Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert
REGGIE: ( on the phone ) Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew I'm ( on the phone ) I told them what you said about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
BARTHOLOMEW: ( on the phone ) I told them what you said about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
REGGIE: ( pause, quietly ) Are you sure there's no mistake?
BARTHOLOMEW: ( on the phone ) None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert be careful.
DYLE: I left all my drip-dry dripping is it all right?
DYLE: Reggie is something wrong?
DYLE: You're probably weak from hunger. You've only had five meals today. Hurry up and we'll go out.
REGGIE: Do you mind if we go someplace crowded? I I feel like lots of people tonight.
DYLE: Reggie you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
REGGIE: I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie and the one who's going to be next me?
DYLE: Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around I want you to believe that.
REGGIE: How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
DYLE: No not yet.
REGGIE: But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
DYLE: Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
DYLE: What do I have to do to satisfy you become the next victim?
REGGIE: It's a start, anyway.
DYLE: I don't understand you at all one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
REGGIE: Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
WIDER ANGLE: She rises from the table and walks away. DYLE hesitates a moment, then follows.
DYLE: I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
REGGIE: ( looking at the river ) I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
DYLE: Okay. Then get set for the story of my life not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
REGGIE: Fiction or non-fiction?
DYLE: Why don't you shut up!
REGGIE: Are you going to listen?
DYLE: Are you going to listen?
REGGIE: Go on.
DYLE: After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
REGGIE: I suppose all this is leading It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
DYLE: It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
REGGIE: What do you mean?
DYLE: When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need including some they'd barely miss.
REGGIE: ( astonished ) You mean, you're a thief?
DYLE: Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
REGGIE: I don't believe it.
DYLE: Well, I can't really blame you not now.
REGGIE: But I do believe it that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle Welcome home Peter Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
DYLE: Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
REGGIE: Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
DYLE: ( now called ADAM ) The man's the same, even if the name No he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got brains, charm, education, a handsome face
REGGIE: No he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got brains, charm, education, a handsome face
ADAM: Oh, come on!
REGGIE: there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
ADAM: It's simple. I like what I do I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
REGGIE: Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
ADAM: Yes, but
ADAM: Right. Now go eat your dinner.
ANOTHER ANGLE: They walk back to the table, where a WAITER is busy putting food on it, mostly on REGGIE's side.
REGGIE: ( miserably ) I could eat a horse.
ADAM: ( looking at all the food ) I think that's what you ordered.
REGGIE: Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on
ADAM: How was I leading you on?
REGGIE: All that marvelous rejection you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
ADAM: That's right.
ADAM: What would you like me to say that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million No I guess not.
REGGIE: No I guess not.
ADAM: It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
REGGIE: Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
ADAM: Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
ADAM: Oh, you should see your face.
REGGIE: What about it?
ADAM: ( taking her hand, nicely ) It's lovely. What's the matter?
ADAM: What's the matter?
REGGIE: I'm not hungry isn't it glorious?
REGGIE: ( alarmed ) It's all right look.
ADAM: It's all right look.
REGGIE: You don't look so bad in this light.
ADAM: Why do you think I brought you here?
REGGIE: ( indicating the lovers ) I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
ADAM: Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
REGGIE: Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
ADAM: How do you think I got here?
REGGIE: Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
ADAM: No. The doctor said it would be bad for my thermostat.
ADAM: When you come on, you really come Well come on.
REGGIE: Well come on.
REGGIE: I know why you're not taken no one can catch up with you.
ADAM: Relax you're gaining.
DELETED: INT. GIDEON'S ROOM NIGHT MED. SHOT GIDEON. As he sits bolt upright in bed, startled. The room is dark and the phone is ringing. He switches on the lamp, looks at the clock ( it reads 3:30 ) and shakes his head before picking up the receiver.
GIDEON: Huh? You must be crazy it's three- thirty in the morning you mean now? all right I'll be down in a minute.
GIDEON: Hey! Turn on the lights!
GIDEON: Hey! How do you stop this thing?

GRANDPIERRE: And now your friend the one from Texas he has disappeared checked out pouf! into thin air! Where is I don't know.

GRANDPIERRE: Tell me, Mr. Dyle where were you at three-thirty?
ADAM: In my room, asleep.
GRANDPIERRE: And you, Mrs. Lampert?
REGGIE: I was, too.
GRANDPIERRE: In Mr. Dyle's room?
REGGIE: ( bitterly ) No in my room.
GRANDPIERRE: ( pause, lighting cigar ) It stands to reason you are telling the truth for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
GRANDPIERRE: And if I were you, I would not stay in my pajamas. Good night.
ADAM: That wraps it up Tex has the money. Go back to bed I'll let you know when I've found him.
REGGIE: You're going to look for him now?
ADAM: If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
REGGIE: There's no time I'll call you in the morning.
ADAM: There's no time I'll call you in the morning.
ADAM: INT. PHONE BOOTH NIGHT CLOSE SHOT TEX. As he speaks on the phone.

TEX: ( on the phone ) ( laughs ) I'll tell you what, fella you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round from now on I'll be right behind ( hangs up )
REGGIE: What is it?
ADAM: Open up.
ADAM: I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
REGGIE: I just heard from him he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got I've looked, Adam you know I have
ADAM: I just heard from him he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got I've looked, Adam you know I have
REGGIE: I've looked, Adam you know I have
ADAM: Where's that airlines bag?
REGGIE: Lord, you're stubborn.
ADAM: I sure am. Get it.
ADAM: Charles must have had the money with him on the train, and Tex missed it.
REGGIE: But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
ADAM: Let's look anyway.
REGGIE: Lord, you're stubborn.

ADAM: The letter
REGGIE: I'll bet you don't really need those.
REGGIE: You need them.

ADAM: Heroin peppermint-flavored heroin.

ITALIAN DELEGATE: di conseguenza, il Governo Italiano è decisamente a favore per l'incoraggiamento, in accordo con le tradizioni etniche rispettive delle culture basilari dei passi in via di sviluppo. Per esempio, pregare i Vietnamiti di aggiungere alle loro risaie ed ai loro campi di soja tradizionali una raccolta di semola, non solo sconvolgerebbe le loro secolari tradizioni ma, oltre tutto, e questo è molto importante per il Governo che io ho l'onore di rappresentare disturberebbe l'esportazione delle derrate farinose italiane in questa parte del mondo. Signori Delegati vi ringrazio della vostra attenzione.
REGGIE: I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
SYLVIE: Don't be silly he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
REGGIE: Hold it Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
SYLVIE: Oh la vache!
BRITISH DELEGATE: Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates my distinguished colleague from Italy. Her Majesty's delegation has listened with great patience to the Southern European position on this problem, and while we find it charmingly stated, we cannot possibly agree with its content. In 1937, in the British colonies of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika and, if I'm not mistaken, more or less in Somaliland a programme of crop rotation was instituted vis-à-vis arable land which had never before known the plough, beginning before the soil was able to know the sort of fatigue now plaguing most of Western Europe. In 1937, therefore, Her Majesty's Government at that time His Majesty's Government was able to properly assay the situation. We therefore oppose the resolution.
ADAM: Reggie I think I've found are you on?

ADAM: You didn't look. Last night, when we went through the airlines bag, something was missing. See ? "One agenda." It wasn't there.
REGGIE: You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it at least, nothing that the police thought was very Can you remember anything at all?
ADAM: Can you remember anything at all?
REGGIE: Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had on the day he was killed.
ADAM: With whom? Where?
REGGIE: I think it only said where but I Think, Reggie, you've got to think it may be what we're looking for.
ADAM: Think, Reggie, you've got to think it may be what we're looking for.
REGGIE: That money's not ours, Adam if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
ADAM: Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
REGGIE: Of course there is!
ADAM: There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie please think what was written in Charles' notebook?
REGGIE: Well it was a place a street corner, I think. But I don't Hold it. I'm on.

REGGIE: Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
ADAM: Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
REGGIE: It's hopeless I don't even know what we're looking for.
ADAM: It's all right I don't think Tex does, either.
REGGIE: Tex? You mean he's here, too?
ADAM: MED. SHOT TEX He stands near the merry-go-round, looking at something in his hand: Charles' agenda. Now he closes it and moves off, disappearing behind a hedge.

ADAM: What are you talking about?
TEX: First her husband, now her she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! You want? Here it's yours!
TEX: Look at you! Horn-swoggled by a purty face 'n all them sweet words! You killed all three of 'em for nothin'! You greenhorn! You block-headed jackass! You clod you booby you nincompoop !

FÉLIX: The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
FÉLIX: Look at them, Madame.

REGGIE: How much is it worth?
FÉLIX: The money is unimportant.
REGGIE: I'm afraid it is important.
FÉLIX: ( shrugging ) In your money, perhaps $65,000.
REGGIE: Do you mind if I sit down? What about the blue one?
FÉLIX: It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
REGGIE: What's its value today?
FÉLIX: In human life? In greed? In suffering?
REGGIE: In money.
FÉLIX: Forty-five thousand.
REGGIE: ( to SYLVIE ) Do you have anything to eat? ( to FÉLIX ) And the orange one what about the orange one?

It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the Today it has a value of $100,000. Eh, bien I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.

ADAM: Reggie why won't you listen?
REGGIE: I'm through listening to you!
ADAM: But I didn't kill anybody.
REGGIE: Then who did? You're the only one
ADAM: Reggie please believe me!
REGGIE: As REGGIE wearily gains the top, ADAM lunges for her. He manages to grab her foot as he falls forward, but all he winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand.

"BARTHOLOMEW": ( calmly ) We all know Carson Dyle is dead, Mrs. Lampert.
ADAM: It's Carson Dyle, I tell you!
"BARTHOLOMEW": You're not going to believe him, Mrs. Lampert it's too fantastic. He's trying to trick you again.
ADAM: Tex recognized him that's why he said Dyle. If you give him those stamps, he'll kill you too!
"BARTHOLOMEW": Mrs. Lampert if I'm who he said, what's preventing me from killing you right now?
ADAM: Because he'd have to come out to get the stamps he knows he'd never make it.
"BARTHOLOMEW": What's the matter with you, Mrs. Lampert? Are you going to believe every lie he tells you? He wants the money for himself that's all he's ever wanted.

ADAM: ( a pause ) There's not a reason on earth why you should.
REGGIE: All right, Adam.
"BARTHOLOMEW": Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert, or I'll kill you.
ADAM: It won't get you the stamps, Dyle You'll have to come out to get them, and I'm not likely to miss at this Maybe not but it takes a lot of bullets to kill me. They left me there with five of them in my legs and my stomach they knew I was still alive but they left me. I spent ten months in a German camp with nothing to stop the pain and no food they were willing to take all these chances for the money, but not for me. They deserved to die!

THE END: BONUS ITEM Lyrics to the theme song of the film:
CHARADE: Music by Henry Mancini, Words by Johnny Mercer When we played our Charade we were like children posing, Playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts we Oh, what a hit we made. We came on next to closing Best on the bill, lovers until love left the masquerade. Fate seemed to pull the strings, I turned and you were gone. While from the darkened wings the music box played on. Sad little serenade, song of my heart's composing, I hear it still, I always will, best on the bill Charade.
