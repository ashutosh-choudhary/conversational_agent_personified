GONG SHOW: An excerpt from The Gong Show ( reenacted ). The video image fills the screen. We watch a fat man recite Hamlet, punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. The audience is booing. Eventually the man gets gonged. Chuck Barris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the wings to comfort the agitated performer.
PERFORMER: Why'd they do that? I wasn't done.
GONG SHOW: Chuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene Gene the Dancing Machine. Barris turns to the camera, points at it.
BARRIS: We'll be right back with more stuff.

BELLHOP: ( re: exploded tv ) Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir?
BARRIS: ( conspiratorially ) You know what I'd do? And don't tell anybody I'd rub. I'd rub Alpo brand dog food on my dick so the dogs would stick their noses into my. dick. Guaranteed big laugh, right? That was my trick, my great contribution to the world. How wouldn't I degrade myself, I ask you.
BELLHOP: I. I. I don't know, sir.
BARRIS: I always pay for the damn tv's, don't I? Don't I?!
BELLHOP: It's Yes, you do, sir, and we appreciate that It's just that there've been complaints from some of the other guests, and Mr. Andrews, the assistant manager, requested that I

ACTUAL BARRIS: It was 1981. I had holed myself up in this New York hotel. Parker Hotel. Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my Ashamed? What do you mean?
ACTUAL BARRIS: When you're young, your potential is infinite. You might do anything, really. You might be great. You might be Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you get to an age where what you might be gives way to what you have been. You weren't Einstein. You weren't anything. That's a bad moment. But I remembered something Carlyle wrote: ". there is no life of a man, faithfully recorded, but is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or unrhymed." I realized my salvation might be in recording my wasted life, unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me understand why.
MOTHER: You like the way mommy looks, Chuckie?
MOTHER: I bet you would like to be a mommy some day, wouldn't you?
BARRIS: Yes, mommy. Please.
MOTHER: C'mere, you.

TUVIA: Yeah, well. I hate strawberries.
BARRIS: Honestly, a man's penis tastes exactly like a strawberry lollipop.
TUVIA: Look, I know that's not true, so
BARRIS: It is true. It's weird but it's true. I just read a research paper on it.
BARRIS: ( sadly wistful ) My first love.
TUVIA: Uchh. Yech. It doesn't taste anything like strawberry, you creep. Well, what does it taste like?
BARRIS: ( curious ) Well, what does it taste like?
TUVIA: Y'know, I'm gonna tell your mother what you just did.

TUVIA: I did not!

I don't know if any of you are aware of this, but it's a federal offense to make licentious remarks on a network television broadcoast.

I will then personally escort the offender to federal prison for booking under edict number 364 of the Broadcast Act of 1963. And it's a long drive to that prison. Just you and me. No other witnesses

BYRD: Hey, I'm CIA operative John Q. Public when it comes to tv and that should make my opinion of interest to you.
BARRIS: Let's hear it then.
BYRD: Well, what do you have now? The couple gets sent to some stupid second-rate Hollywood shitcan restaurant, right? Sets you back fifty bucks? That's not too exciting a prize to us vicarious- living boobs out in TV-land.
BARRIS: Yeah, what's your point?
BYRD: Up the stakes, Chuckles. Send 'em to some exotic locale. Europe, Southeast Asia, for example.
BARRIS: The network's not going to let me send two unmarried kids on vacation together.
BYRD: ( shrugs ) Send 'em with a chaperone. Some respectable old lady with a sewn closed ( considering ) Y'know, that's not half bad.
BARRIS: ( considering ) Y'know, that's not half bad.
BYRD: I'm telling ya. And. And sometimes you can be the chaperone, Chuckie. Let's say we have a job for you in Austria. You, a successful tv producer, above suspicion, chaperones the young couple, and while you're there, blam! you take care of some Company business. It's the perfect cover. TV producer by day, CIA operative by night.
BARRIS: I told you, I don't have to kill people for money anymore.
BYRD: Chuck, when I said you fit our profile, very little of that had to do with you needing the money. Some of it, but very little. You liked it with Renda, Chuck. I saw it in your eyes. You liked it but you botched it. Don't you want to get really good at something, Chuck?
DIRECTOR: ( rapidly ) Ready one, take one. Ready three, take three. Ready one, take one.
BLONDE BACHELORETTE: Number one, can you please tell me what a girl is like who hasn't been on a date before and how you can tell she hasn't been on a date before?
DIRECTOR: Ready two, take two. This guy has never been on a date.
FAT BACHELOR: Jesus, she's gotta pick this guy. This is just too good.
BARRIS: Jesus, she's gotta pick this guy. This is just too good.
FAT BACHELOR: . I'll ask her what she likes to do and
DIRECTOR: Ready one, take one. Ready two, take And if she doesn't know what she likes to Ready three, take three. The only date he's ever had is with his right hand.
FAT BACHELOR: And if she doesn't know what she likes to Ready three, take three. The only date he's ever had is with his right hand.
DIRECTOR: Ready three, take three. The only date he's ever had is with his right hand.
FAT BACHELOR: . then I'll know she hasn't done it
BARRIS: Excuse me, is this seat taken?
WOMAN: By you.
BARRIS: London is wonderful this time of year, isn't it.
WOMAN: Yes it is.
BARRIS: ( beat ) Oh. Sorry.
PATRICIA: By you.
BARRIS: London is wonderful this time of year, isn't it?
PATRICIA: Especially the fog. It affords one solitude, even in a city full of people.
BARRIS: I'm Chuck.
PATRICIA: Yes, I gathered.
BARRIS: And you are?
PATRICIA: ( smiles ) Here you go, Chuck.
BARRIS: At least give me a made-up name. Something for me to cry out during those dark nights of the soul.
PATRICIA: Cry out, "Olivia!"
BARRIS: That's Twelfth Night.
PATRICIA: Very good, Chuck. I'm pleasantly surprised. You're not like the other
FAT BACHELOR: I thinks he's really pretty and I want to be her boyfriend.
ENGLISHMAN: ( loud whisper )
BARRIS: Do you have it?
ENGLISHMAN: Do you have it?
BARRIS: Sorry. Yeah.
ENGLISHMAN: Just the same.
BARRIS: Thank you. Oh, one more thing.
ACTUAL BARRIS: I felt bad about Ronnie. But really I did that ugly, fat, stupid kid a favor. He was ugly and fat and stupid. More life wouldn't have changed that for him. No woman would ever have loved him. That's just the brutal truth, y'know?
BARRIS: It's Patricia, actually.
PATRICIA: It's Patricia, actually.
PATRICIA: . and so then I spent a year in Operation Chaos, inside the anti-war movement as an agent provocateur, nudging it toward violence in order to discred it. That was fun. I got to wear granny Sounds fun. So tell me, Patricia, why'd you come up here tonight?
BARRIS: Sounds fun. So tell me, Patricia, why'd you come up here tonight?
PATRICIA: I don't know. You're sort of cute in a homely way. And it's always lonely when that civilian you're fucking calls out the name off your fake passport.
BARRIS: "All the information I have about myself is from forged documents."
PATRICIA: Barris is thrilled and kisses her. It begins to turn hot and heavy. Suddenly Barris pulls away.
BARRIS: Actually, I just gotta go into the bathroom and take care of something.
PATRICIA: No, baby. Leave the microfilm in.
BYRD: Hey, buddy. This is Simon Oliver.
BARRIS: Everything go okay? You don't look too Mr. Barris, do not ever again jeopardize one of my missions by killing a game show contestant. Is that understood?
BYRD: Everything go okay? You don't look too Mr. Barris, do not ever again jeopardize one of my missions by killing a game show contestant. Is that understood?
OLIVER: Mr. Barris, do not ever again jeopardize one of my missions by killing a game show contestant. Is that understood?
BARRIS: You're welcome, pal.
OLIVER: Do I make myself clear?
BARRIS: Fuck you! They're my contestants.
OLIVER: ( CONTINUED )
BARRIS: Lovely. Tell me, Mr. Barris, are you in possession of my microfilm?
BYRD: Lovely. Tell me, Mr. Barris, are you in possession of my microfilm?
OLIVER: Lovely. Tell me, Mr. Barris, are you in possession of my microfilm?
BARRIS: Yeah, I got it.
OLIVER: Let's have it then.
BARRIS: It's up my ass, Oliver. Why don't you reach on up there and get it.
OLIVER: What do you think Patricia Watson was?
BARRIS: INT. BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - DAY Barris, now in t-shirt and jeans, shuffles through the busy bullpen area. Employees wave, say "hi", give Barris the peace sign. He returns the gestures, but halfheartedly. He seems depressed. Loretta sidles up beside him.
LORETTA: Well, if isn't the hitman.
BARRIS: ( turning, wild-eyed ) Hitman! Hitman! Hitman! Hitman!
OFFICE WORKERS: Hitman! Hitman! Hitman! Hitman!
LORETTA: I said, well, if it isn't the hitman. Just heard through the grapevine that ABC is going to pick up The Newlywed Game.
BARRIS: You're kidding me.
LORETTA: Not kidding you. Day-time and prime- Oh, fuck, Loretta. That's sensational!
BARRIS: Oh, fuck, Loretta. That's sensational!
OFFICE WORKERS: Hitman! Hitman! Hitman! The Newlywed Game was based on my theory that almost any American would sell out their spouse for a washer-drier or a lawnmower you can ride on. Such was my respect for that most holy of unions. I must've been on to something, because the show aired for thirteen years.
ACTUAL BARRIS: The Newlywed Game was based on my theory that almost any American would sell out their spouse for a washer-drier or a lawnmower you can ride on. Such was my respect for that most holy of unions. I must've been on to something, because the show aired for thirteen years.
PENNY: Great wheels, man.
BARRIS: Yeah, I decided to start treating myself right. You spend so much time denying yourself things. Life's too short.
PENNY: Yeah, I really gork what you're saying, You really grok what I'm saying, man. Not gork.
BARRIS: You really grok what I'm saying, man. Not gork.
PENNY: ( beat )

BARRIS: I'll take the house.
PENNY: Penny happily kisses Barris.
PENNY: So, man, are you seeing anyone?
BARRIS: Nobody serious. You?
PENNY: No. I think we should get married.
BARRIS: Aw, Pen, don't start
PENNY: No, listen, it makes sense. You and I feel exactly the same about marriage, right? How much bullshit it is, right? And the odds of us finding someone else with the exact same view on it are small. So, it makes sense.
MOTHER: We need a new ice box.
ANNOUNCER: A brand new Amana refrigerator-freezer with automatic ice maker!
BARRIS: Beautiful. Did you see that? How much they loved each other just then? That's what it's all about, kiddies.
EMPLOYEE #1: Yeah. Rick took four slices of pizza at lunch yesterday. Everyone else only got Oooh. Is that true, Rick? Where are Here. No, it's not true.

BARRIS: Rick, you're dead meat, buddy. I sentence you to. dance for us in today's post-meeting version of "Out of Limits" featuring the musical stylings of the CBP Stompers.
RICK: Aw, Chuck.
BARRIS: Get up here, you rascule, you.
MONTAGE: As "Out of Limits" continues, now the actual version, we see montage of Barris shooting, stabbing, and garroting various foreign-looking people in strange, murky locations intercut with Barris having sex with Patricia Watson in different bedrooms and motel rooms, Barris dancing with Patricia in various exotic locales, and Barris on the set for his many game shows, happily directing the bustling activity.
JIM LANGE: Sometimes Chuck would just disappear for weeks. I remember once we had a conflict on the set over the right way to throw that kiss at the end of the show, . and Chuck was just not reachable to resolve it.
JIM LANGE: Look, it's water under the bridge. I'm not gonna talk about it.
BARRIS: The word's interpret.
PENNY: Well, do you have an extra "r" then I could borrow?
BARRIS: Well, do you have an extra "r" then I could borrow?
PENNY: Well, do you have an extra "r" then I could borrow?

BARRIS: Shit fuck piss. Okay okay okay.
PENNY: Shit fuck piss. Okay okay okay.

PENNY: You're tired.
BARRIS: I got a date.
PENNY: Since when?
BARRIS: I just met this girl.
PENNY: Like, just now ?
BARRIS: Yeah. Kinda.
PENNY: Well, that's rude.

MONICA: Have a seat.
BARRIS: ( beat ) Yes, I have.
ACTUAL BARRIS: Yeah, I remember that religious girl, sure. Monica Something. Fleming. Oh God, she had the softest, fleeciest clam I ever experienced. It took a little more work than usual, but I got in there, It was some clam. Oh Lordy. You get old, y'know, but the taste for soft clam, it just doesn't go away. This is the great tragedy of getting old.
WOMAN: Getting married to Alan is the best thing I've ever done. It's just so wonderful knowing that you've got someone by your side through everything for he rest of your life.
LORETTA: 'kay, Mon. He's off.
BARRIS: My sweet little clamato.
MONICA: I'm pregnant.
BARRIS: Is it mine?
MONICA: I can't believe you asked me that.
BARRIS: I know. I'm sorry. But you're sure, right?
MONICA: I hate you so much right now.
BARRIS: Look, we'll take care of it.

BARRIS: Here we are.
MONICA: ( collapsing ) I can't I can't I can't I can't.
BARRIS: It's okay. It'll be okay.
PENNY: What a waste.
BARRIS: Tell me about it. I figure over the years I must've spent close to twenty grand on these abortions: airfare, hotels, doctors, gifts.
PENNY: That's not what I meant.
BARRIS: And I don't even know how many of these fetuses were mine. That's what really kills me.
WOMAN #1: It was his.
WOMAN #2: Yeah. It was his.
WOMAN #3: It wasn't his. I lied.
WOMAN #4: Yes, it was his baby.
WOMAN #5: WOMAN #6
WOMAN #6: The godamn son of a bitch. He asked you to ask me this?
WOMAN #7: I was screwing a lot of guys at the time. It coulda been his.
WOMAN #8: Uh-uh. I just needed someone to pay for it. He was a wallet with legs.
WOMAN #9: Yeah, I was just a kid. It ruined my I don't really want to talk about this.
ACTUAL BARRIS: I don't really want to talk about this.
PENNY: So I'm assuming this means Monica is out of the picture.
BARRIS: Yeah, I got baptized for nothing.
PENNY: Chuck, I was thinking. I have this plan now, now that you're free
BARRIS: God, you look cute today.
PENNY: I always look cute. Don't distract me. What was I going to say?
BARRIS: I don't know.
PENNY: You do know. Chuck, why don't we get married? We've known each other forever. We've fucked each other forever. You think I'm cute, you just said. You always come to me when you're in trouble. And you're almost forty, Chuck.
BARRIS: ( shouting ) I know how old I almost am! That's it. Don't ever ask me to marry you again!
PENNY: ( quietly ) I won't.
BARRIS: I'm sorry I yelled at you today, Pen.
PENNY: I'm not crying because you yelled at me. This is it, isn't it? This is us.
ACTUAL BARRIS: I almost asked Penny to marry me right then. But I didn't.
PROSTITUTE: Is that right?
LORETTA: ( CONTINUED )
BARRIS: ( not turning ) Rod Flexner's here.
LORETTA: Rod Flexner's here.
BARRIS: Shit piss fuck, send him in.
FLEXNER: Chuck! Great to see you.
BARRIS: What's up, Rod?
FLEXNER: Well, the thing is, Chuck, some of your shows aren't doing too well in the old ratings war. The Family Game, for one.
BARRIS: We move into Barris's eyes.
FLEXNER: And How's Your Mother-in-Law is, quite frankly, in the toilet, Chuck.
FLEXNER: Now, as you know, Dream Girl is flailing
FLEXNER: And The Game Game has no life in it at
FLEXNER: So I've been put in the unfortunate position of having to inform you that the network is canceling all four of these shows. Now don't shoot me, Chuck, I'm just the messenger.
BARRIS: ( to bartender ) They killed my babies. Just like that. I pushed them into the world through the birth canal of my imagination. Lovingly. Tenderly. Where's the humanity of these The fucking bastards.
BARTENDER: The fucking bastards.
BARRIS: What am I gonna do now? Hey there, can I buy you a drink?
LARGE MAN: What are you blind, asshole? This lady's with me.
BARRIS: ( screaming ) Fuck you!
LARGE MAN: ( lets go ) Get out of here, you pussy faggot piece of shit dog-shit shithead.
BARRIS: ( lets go ) Get out of here, you pussy faggot piece of shit dog-shit shithead.
PENNY: Hey, I was just in the
BARRIS: ( CONTINUED )
PENNY: This is our house, man. Our house! It's one thing to go elsewhere for your pussy needs. But this is our house!
BARRIS: This is not our house, it's my house.
PENNY: It's our house! I found it with you. I decorated it for you! I spent six months sitting on that fucking couch she's fucking you on, fucking waiting for the fucking plumbers to come! God, you are such an asshole!
WOMAN: I should go. This doesn't feel right.
PENNY: ( face down ) Wanna see a stupid girl vomit?
PENNY: Why were you with that girl in our living It's not our living room, Pen.
BARRIS: It's not our living room, Pen.
PENNY: That's your defense? You know what it feels like to see you with someone else? In any living room.
BARRIS: You know who I am, Penny. I don't force you to hang around.
PENNY: ( incredulous ) You don't force me? Fuck. So you're saying you have no interest in this, one way or the other?
BARRIS: No, I'm not saying that.
PENNY: Well, then, what are you saying, Chuck? Do you want me around or not? Do you even like me?
BARRIS: Of course I like you.
PENNY: How much?
BARRIS: I need to know how much you like me.
PENNY: I need to know how much you like me.
BARRIS: ( beat ) I don't even know what that means, "how much?" How can I rate a person in that way? That's ridiculous.
PENNY: You could if you felt it. If you felt it, it would be easy to rate me. You could spread your arms as wide as they would go and say, "This much, Penny."
BARRIS: Everything's complicated, Pen. Nothing's black and white like that.
PENNY: Do you want me around or not? If you don't, just say so, so I know. Okay?
BARRIS: I love you, Pen, in my way. Maybe not in that crazy, head-over-heels thing, but what is that, anyway? Romantic love. Isn't that just an illusion?
PENNY: ( beat ) But you just said you love me, right?
BARRIS: Jesus, how do you know these things?
BYRD: We even know what she actually thought it tasted like.
BARRIS: Really? I could never find that out. What did she think?
BYRD: It's a "need to know", my friend. So tell me, what can I do you for?
BARRIS: I could really use an assignment, Jim. To straighten my head.
BYRD: I got something for your head.
JIM LANGE: . and we're the sending the two of you for three days and three nights to beautiful. West Berlin!
BARRIS: ( kisses him, sits ) So, here's what we got. Name's Hans ( pulls out photos ) Other side of the wall. We don't like him very much.
PATRICIA: ( kisses him, sits ) So, here's what we got. Name's Hans ( pulls out photos ) Other side of the wall. We don't like him very much.
BARRIS: ( singing Toot-toot-tootsie ) Bye-bye, Colbert, bye-bye.
PATRICIA: You'll work with a kraut named Keeler. He's been trailing Colbert for a month now. Knows the routine. Keeler's a drunk, so you stay sober and take charge.
BARRIS: ( collecting photos ) Done and done. See you after?
PATRICIA: Prove how much you love me, baby. Kill for me. Then I'm all yours.
BARRIS: What you writing, Sig?
KEELER: I am keeping track of all the goings on on this street.
BARRIS: Hey, Keeler, a bird just flew by.
KEELER: Yah. I know how to do my job.
KEELER: ( calmly to Barris ) Under the seat, please.
BARRIS: ( falsetto ) Who is it?
BARRIS: Good morning, Mrs. Reynolds.
HOUSEKEEPER: ( looking around ) Another rough night, huh?
BARRIS: ( tapping his head ) The human psyche is a wondrous thing.
HOUSEKEEPER: ( smiling maternally ) Yes, I know it is. ( taking gun ) We don't need this now, do we? Why don't we just put this away?
BARRIS: Mrs. Reynolds, may I rest my head on your bosom for a little while?
HOUSEKEEPER: Oh, that doesn't really seem like a very good idea, Mr. Barris.
BARRIS: I'm sorry. You're right. I just. I'm just without. comfort of any sort, and I. please forgive me.
HOUSEKEEPER: ( smiles at him ) No harm done.
BARRIS: ( bowing ) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You are a scholar and.
HOUSEKEEPER: It's fine, sir.
BARRIS: Mrs. Reynolds, what do you suppose God thinks of someone like me?
HOUSEKEEPER: Yes, God.
BARRIS: Yes, God.
HOUSEKEEPER: Well, Mr. Barris, your television shows have brought laughter and joy to millions of people. That's a very important thing, I think, in these difficult times. I would imagine God likes you very much.
BARRIS: Thank you, that's very kind. So. I should get back to.
HOUSEKEEPER: Yes, of course, sir. Don't mind me.
BARRIS: I'm really, really fucked.
PICARD: Get in.
BARRIS: What? Who the hell are you?
PICARD: No time. Get in or die.
PICARD: Merde. KGB. They know who you are, Monsieur Barris. It is their intention to kill you very much in East Berlin.
BARRIS: Merde! MERDE!
PICARD: Not to worry, my friend.
BARRIS: What the hell is that?
PICARD: Your ride, Monsieur Barris.
BARRIS: No fucking way.
PICARD: It's quite reliable and easy to operate. It will get you over the wall. Or you can stay here. In the German Democratic Republic. I will arrange for you to get a good factory job. No, you must fly, like Daedalus before you, to the freedom of the west.
BARRIS: Christ. What about you?
PICARD: They do not catch me, monsieur. This is my talent, to get away always. In guerre. In amour. This is my talent, and perhaps this is my curse.
BYRD: ( chuckling ) So, did you have a nice flight?
BARRIS: Fuck you, Jim. It was terrifying.
BYRD: Seems the KGB knew exactly what you were up to. You were there to kill Colbert, they were there to kill you. I'm thinking we got a mole. So much hate in the world, Chuck.
BARRIS: Am I in danger still?
BYRD: Jesus, yes. KGB didn't go out of business since yesterday, so far as I know. You're fucked, Chuck. But our main concern should be: if they know who you are, they know who I am.
BARRIS: Fuck off. What do we do?
BYRD: Bow out. Lay low. That's what I'm gonna do. You're lucky you have another career to immerse yourself in.
BARRIS: Thank you. Thanks. That was great.
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: I don't know, Chuck. It's looking bleak.
BARRIS: There's gotta be somebody in America with some talent. Ted Mack got bookings every
BARRIS: ( ushering out ) Thank you. Thank you. We'll be in touch. That was wonderful. We've been going about this all wrong. Rather than killing ourselves trying to find good acts, we just book bad ones and kill them.
EXECUTIVE #2: Chuck, it's torture to sit through even one of these people
BARRIS: We kill 'em before they're through. As soon as it gets unbearable, we kill 'em. Celebrity judges ring a bell to end the act. to kill 'em. And when you kill something, it stops. This I know to be
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: For God's sake, what are you talking Celebrity judges ring a bell to end the act. to kill 'em. And when you kill something, it stops. This I know to be

HOST: Why'd you do that, Jamie? This is someone's grandmother. She was really This is The Gong Show, not the Van Cliburn eliminations.
JAMIE FARR: This is The Gong Show, not the Van Cliburn eliminations.
HOST: This is a human being with aspirations.
BARRIS: ( muttering ) Oh, fuck me. This guy sucks. He's bringing everyone down.
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: None of the hosts are getting it, Chuck. But we have a thought.
BARRIS: EXECUTIVE WOMAN
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: You host.
BARRIS: I don't want to be on tv.
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: Listen, we can't sit through anymore of these test shows. Do it, Chuck, or we advise the network to pull it.
BARRIS: ( stiff ) Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to The Gong Show! I'm your host, Chuck Barris! ( turns away in disgust )
BARRIS: Welcome to The Gong Show. Here's an esoteric act if there ever was one. Ephemeral. It's an ephemeral act.
BIG NOSE: Why? Why? Why?
BARRIS: I don't know. I don't understand.
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: You can't quit.
BARRIS: I can't quit? But I get panicky, Louise, in front of all those people.
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: You lack confidence, that's all.
BARRIS: I lack confidence?
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: But we'll take care of that. We'll get you some confidence powder. Leave that to us.
BARRIS: Confidence powder?
EXECUTIVE WOMAN: Nose candy, Chuck. Blow. Snow. Flake.
BARRIS: Blow, snow, flake?

GENE GENE: Oh yeah, a real Jekyll and Hyde. Sometimes nice as you please. Give you the shirt off his back. Other times he'd rant like a crazy man. I remember once he screamed at me that I didn't know anything about dancing. "Nijinsky," he yelled, "now there was a dancer!"
BLACK COMEDIAN: Today I had a bad day today.
JAMIE FARR: Chuck used to love to discuss philosophy. I think he was very saddened that the public saw him as this sort of spastic moron. I remember at the time I was reading Wittgenstein. And Chuck was just thrilled to have someone else in addition to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff Look, Jamie, you know as well as I that language does not exist without an outward criteria.
BARRIS: Look, Jamie, you know as well as I that language does not exist without an outward criteria.
PATRICIA: ( looking at clock ) Can we pick up tomorrow?
BARRIS: Can we pick up tomorrow?
JAMIE FARR: Yeah. But consider my thinking on elementary propositions. I'm serious.
BARRIS: Will do. Love ya.
JAMIE FARR: Right back at ya, amigo.
PATRICIA: I'm concerned about you. I think you need to get back into the life. Our sex was always amazing after you killed. Truth is you're not that great after your discussions with Jamie Farr.
BARRIS: ( picks up ) Jamie, I can't talk anymore tonight
BARRIS: Sure. Dinner sounds good. There's a place called La Scala. See you there at
PATRICIA: ( eyes closed ) Dinner sounds good with whom?
BARRIS: Patricia glances over at Barris. They stare at each other.
KEELER: A very fancy place.
BARRIS: Only the best for my friend.
KEELER: The friendships one develops during wartime are remarkably strong.
BARRIS: There is an awkward silence.
KEELER: So how is the business of television?
BARRIS: Well, it's hit and miss. I've got a new show called "Operation Entertainment" which I believe is going to kill. It's sort of a Bob Hope visiting the troops thing, but it's weekly and.
KEELER: Why do you do what you do, Chuck?
BARRIS: Well, I like to think that I bring joy and laughter to millions of people. I'm not saying that my shows are as good as they could be. Yet. But
KEELER: Why do you kill?
BARRIS: During the second world war, I had the pleasure of killing. Yes, pleasure. I found it exhilirating. Afterwards, I could find nothing else to fill me so much with life. So I became what I am today. I wanted the exhiliration again. of death.
KEELER: During the second world war, I had the pleasure of killing. Yes, pleasure. I found it exhilirating. Afterwards, I could find nothing else to fill me so much with life. So I became what I am today. I wanted the exhiliration again. of death.
WAITER: Are you gentlemen ready to order?
KEELER: I'll have the shrimp scampi and a green And for you, sir.
WAITER: And for you, sir.
KEELER: Um, Just give me a steak. Rare.
WAITER: Thank you.
KEELER: "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy whole might. Work while it is called, for the night cometh wherein no man can work."
BARRIS: That's Carlyle!
KEELER: It's amazing you should quote him. He's my hero.
BARRIS: It's amazing you should quote him. He's my hero.
KEELER: I read in a book recently that killing your first man is like making love to your first woman. Every smell, every nuance, you remember with a special allure, as if the acts had occured outside civilization, outside time. And when the allure is gone, you are I am condemned to live the rest of my life outside civilization. You will be too, my good friend.
BARRIS: I am condemned to live the rest of my life outside civilization. You will be too, my good friend.
KEELER: I am condemned to live the rest of my life outside civilization. You will be too, my good friend.
ACTUAL BARRIS: The next day I heard Keeler offed
PENNY: When you called, I wasn't gonna come.
BARRIS: I'm glad you did, Pen.
PENNY: I said to myself, enough. Enough of this jerk already. Enough.
BARRIS: I could see how you would feel that way.
PENNY: But I've come upon something interesting through my delvings into human psychology. It's called TA, Transactual
BARRIS: Transactional Analysis.
PENNY: Now see, by correcting me you're responding as "Parent" to my "Child." "Here's the proper way to say this word, Penny." But that's okay. As long as we both understand that's what you're doing. Y'know, I'm okay, you're okay. So what's wrong, Chuck? Are you okay?
BARRIS: A guy I knew killed himself last night.
PENNY: My God. Everyone you know kills themselves. Or tries. Who is it this You don't know him. A stagehand.
BARRIS: You don't know him. A stagehand.
PENNY: Why'd he do it?
BARRIS: He didn't like his work anymore.
PENNY: Is being a stagehand really bad or Yeah, it's pretty bad.
BARRIS: ( beat ) Yeah, it's pretty bad.
PATRICIA: You were supposed to meet me at The Palm two hours ago.
BARRIS: Oh fuck, I forgot.
PENNY: Who is this?
PATRICIA: I do not get stood up. Do you Um, Penny, this is Patricia. How did you find me?
BARRIS: Um, Penny, this is Patricia. How did you find me?
PATRICIA: Are you serious? That's what I do for a Who's Patricia? What does she mean, that's what she does for a living?
PENNY: Who's Patricia? What does she mean, that's what she does for a living?

TEENAGE BOY: Nobody, man. We just waited for you to leave after the show. We just think the show is cool. We just think you're cool.
TEENAGE GIRL: Please don't kill us.
UNKNOWN COMIC: Hey, Chuck. Take it off.
BARRIS: Take it off.
UNKNOWN COMIC: The fucking bag. Take it off.
BARRIS: The fucking bag. Take it off.
BARRIS: Here he is, the Prince of Puns, the Wizard of Whoopee. The Unknown Comic!
UNKNOWN COMIC: Chuckie Baby, Chuckie Baby, Chuckie What? What do you want?
BARRIS: What? What do you want?
UNKNOWN COMIC: What's the difference between toilet paper and a shower curtain?
BARRIS: I don't know.
UNKNOWN COMIC: ( calling off ) Here's the guy!
BARRIS: Get out of here.
UNKNOWN COMIC: ( for Barris's ears only ) You're fucking crazy, man.
LORETTA: Phone call from someone named Tuvia.
BARRIS: I'll take it! Don't hang up!
LORETTA: I'll take it! Don't hang up!
BARRIS: I'll take it! Don't hang up!
BARRIS: TUVIA ( O.S. )
BARRIS: Of course I do.
GUY: Hey, Chuck, I got a talent.
BARRIS: Not now.
GUY: Just take a second.
TUVIA: You look great.
BARRIS: TELEPHONE VOICE
TELEPHONE VOICE: Paul Picard is dead.
PICARD: ( yelling ) Fly, Daedalus, fly!
BARRIS: This is the moment we've been waiting
ED ASNER: And the winner is Taxi!
STARLET: I don't see why your shows are never
JAMES L.BROOKS: And I honor you, members of the academy, for recognizing and supporting high quality television.
ACTUAL BARRIS: But as I stood there, I realized, I couldn't kill Jim Brooks, the man who was responsible for such good stuff: Mary Tyler Moore, Rhoda, Cindy, Phyllis, episodes of My Friend Tony. I loved those shows as much as anybody in
BARRIS: Hey, congratulations, Jim.
JAMES L.BROOKS: Oh, hey! Thanks.
BARRIS: Chuck Barris. The Gong Show.
JAMES L.BROOKS: Oh, right. Hey, thanks, Chuck.
BARRIS: Once again you deserve it. Your shows are the greatest. You bring so much. quality to the medium.
JAMES L.BROOKS: Thank you. I appreciate that. I really
BARRIS: PARTY MAN #1
BARRIS: ( unenthused ) Great. I'm just heading
BARRIS: Party Man #1 begins farting "Jingle Bells." Barris gets up and moves away.
PRETTY WOMAN: PRETTY WOMAN
BARRIS: PRETTY WOMAN
PRETTY WOMAN: I thought it was you.
BARRIS: ( bowing ) It's me.
PRETTY WOMAN: I'm glad to meet you because I wanted to tell you that I've seen The Gong Show and I think you are the most insidious and despicable force in entertainment today.
BARRIS: PRETTY WOMAN
PRETTY WOMAN: How dare you subject the rest of the world to your loathsome view of humanity.
BARRIS: I don't think it's that loathsome.
PRETTY WOMAN: What is it then? To mock some poor, lonely people who just crave a little attention in their lives. To destroy them. So everybody's not brilliantly talented. They're still people. They deserve respect and compassion. I mean, who the hell are you? What the fuck have you ever done that elevates you above the pathetic masses? Oh, I forgot, you created The Dating Game. Wow, right up there with the Sistine Chapel. I guess that's what gives you the right to.
BARRIS: Excuse me, I've got to
FAT BACHELOR: I only want to be loved.
BARRIS: That's all I fucking wanted!
BARRIS: No, I'm.
BARRIS: Please, I'm not feeling well.
BARRIS: You can stop by the office to audition
BARRIS: Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
ACTUAL BARRIS: That was it. I just disappeared. The network had to put The Gong Show into reruns. It was 1981. I holed myself up in this hotel in New York. Parker Hotel.
BARRIS: Who Am I?
BARRIS: Fuck. Shit. Piss.
OLIVER: How'd you know where I was?
BARRIS: How'd you know where I was?
OLIVER: Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, don't be an orangutan. We always know where you are. We always know what you're doing. By the by, I'd think twice before I'd attempt to get that tripe you're writing published. And there's a typo on page
BARRIS: Look, what do you want, Oliver? I don't work for you anymore. I have things
OLIVER: I'd like you to come back for one last assignment, Chuck.
BARRIS: No. Now get. Good-bye
OLIVER: I think you might be interested when I tell you it's the mole who fingered your friends Jim Byrd and Paul Picard. and Seigfried Keeler.
BARRIS: Keeler committed suicide.
OLIVER: Yes, of course he did. He threw himself from a twentieth floor window after he strangled himself to death with an electrical cord.
BARRIS: ( beat ) I'm not interested, Oliver.
OLIVER: As long as the mole's alive, you don't have a chance in hell of remaining so. Besides, killing is in your blood, old man. You fit the profile.
BARRIS: That fucking profile again! What's the fuck is it?! What the fuck do you bastards know about me, that I don't?!
OLIVER: Indeed. Where to begin. First, let go of me. Let's see. Well, you had a twin sister, stillborn, strangled by your umbilical cord. Your first hit, Chuck. Your mother always wanted a daughter. She blamed you for your sister's death. And, so, until your sister Phoebe was born, she raised you as a girl.
BARRIS: That's not true.
OLIVER: Oh, and your father the dentist? Not really your father. Your biological father was a man named Edmund James Windsor. A serial killer. A fact your mother didn't know when she had an affair with him in 1930. If you want to look him up, he was also known as the Tarrytown Troll, because he had been described by witnesses as short and ugly. Windsor died in the electrical chair at Ossining in 1939. We believed your self- loathing tendencies coupled with that extra Y chromosome and whatever else you inherited from your father would serve us You're lying.
BARRIS: You're lying.
OLIVER: I'm trying to think what more I can tell you. I'm sure there's more. But you have me at a disadvantage here, Barris. I don't have your files in front of me.
BARRIS: Just leave me the hell alone!
OLIVER: Your mother always loved the game shows, and you so wanted to please her. We never expected the game show business to work out for you. But that it did, turned out to be in our favor. I guess your need to be a good daughter drove you more than we anticipated.
BARRIS: Huh? What?
BARRIS: Jesus, how'd you find me? Am I listed in some guidebook or something?
PENNY: You sent me your last letter on hotel Oh. Well, it's great to see you, Pen. You look beautiful.
BARRIS: Oh. Well, it's great to see you, Pen. You look beautiful.
PENNY: I don't really. But I appreciate the lie. I know how you hate lying. Boy, this place is scary looking.
BARRIS: ( taps his head ) The human psyche.
PENNY: I came to take you back to California with me. It's a lonely state without I don't know, Redhead.
BARRIS: I don't know, Redhead.
PENNY: I can't wait forever for you to ask me to marry you, you know. Well, apparently I can. But I really don't want to. Chuck.
BARRIS: ( crying ) I love you so much. You don't understand. I don't even know why. You're such a schmuck.
PENNY: ( crying ) I love you so much. You don't understand. I don't even know why. You're such a schmuck.
BARRIS: You don't know the half of it.
PENNY: You're not gonna marry me, are you?
BARRIS: I don't know if I can.
PATRICIA: I can't believe you finally left your two- hundred-dollar-a-night cave to see me. I'm honored.
BARRIS: Y'know, I got a visit this morning from Penny. She's wanted to marry me forever. But she doesn't know who I am, what I've, what I'm capable of.
BARRIS: I hate myself for how I've lived, Treesh.
PATRICIA: Neitzsche said, "Whoever despises oneself still respects oneself as one who I never thought of that. Jesus, I can't even despise myself with any insight.
BARRIS: I never thought of that. Jesus, I can't even despise myself with any insight.
PATRICIA: Insane asylums are filled with people who think they're Jesus or Satan. Very few have delusions of being the guy down the block who works at an insurance company. Wonder what that means.
BARRIS: Y'know, I wanted to be a writer once. I wanted to write something that someday some lesser person would quote. But I never did. I'm the lesser person, Treesh. I never said anything meaningful that wasn't said by somebody else first. I am disposable. I disposed of people and I am disposable. You look cold.
PATRICIA: Chuck, what's gotten into you? You're actually acting like a gentleman.
BARRIS: I suppose you still won't tell me where you're staying.
PATRICIA: No. But I'll show you.
PATRICIA: Sure. Bourbon.
BARRIS: Sure. Bourbon.
PATRICIA: I've been thinking a lot about you lately, Chuck.
BARRIS: Patricia approaches Barris with the drinks, hands him one.
PATRICIA: I've missed you.
BARRIS: You could've fooled me.
PATRICIA: Well, I've mellowed.
BARRIS: That sounds right.
PATRICIA: To life.
BARRIS: To life.
BARRIS: It's done and I'm done. Agreed?
OLIVER: Agreed. But if you get antsy. and you
BARRIS: Hey, Redhead?
BARRIS: Drive, Danny! Now!
PENNY: What's going on?
BARRIS: ( still looking out window ) Pen, I have something to confess.
PENNY: ( CONTINUED )
BARRIS: ( stalling ) You know me as the creator of The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game, The Family Game, The Game Game, How's Your Mother-in-law, Dream Girl of 1968.
PENNY: Operation Entertainment.
BARRIS: Yeah, Operation Entertainment. The Rah- Rah Show, Gong Show, The Dollar-Ninety- Eight Beauty Show, The Ra-Rah Show.
PENNY: You said that already.
BARRIS: ( beat ) Okay, but what you don't know is that I've brutally murdered thirty-three people for the CIA.
ACTUAL BARRIS: Y'know, I came up with a new game show idea recently. It's called The Old Game. You got three old guys with loaded guns on stage They look back at their lives, see who they were, what they accomplished, how close they came to realizing their dreams. The winner is the one who doesn't blow his brains out. He gets a refrigerator.
THE END: Writers : Charlie Kaufman
