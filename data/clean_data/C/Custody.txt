RICK: You have a kid.
MELANIE: So do you.
RICK: Not criticizing, just surprised. I don't believe anyone at their old day-care had kids. If they did they kept them in a closet and only brought them out on special occasions. Christmas, Easter, an occasional birthday, and maybe when they had friends over for dinner, but only as a status symbol. It was like they'd say, "Here's the white picket fence. Here's the SUV. Here's the dog. Oh yes, here's the 2.5 children. Kids you can get back in the closet now."
MELANIE: You'd could make a fortune with a Renta- Kid business.
RICK: That has potential.
MELANIE: I've often thought of renting mine. Why pay for a baby-sitter when thousands of people would pay good money to set your kid on the mantle for a few hours?
RICK: So, what's his name?

ZACH: You're old.
RICK: You got me there. I am old.

MELANIE: For potty training. Give him something to aim at. Drop a Cheerio or two in the toilet and let him pee away.
RICK: I'll have to try that. So, any questions about the job? Melanie moves towards the boys.
MELANIE: I'm going to go talk to them for a little bit. I'll let you know.
ZACH: My mom tells great stories.
KRIS: We don't have a mom.
ZACH: That's okay, I don't have a dad.
MELANIE: Once upon a time.
MELANIE: The end.
MELANIE: I'm gonna talk to your dad.
MELANIE: We'll read another one in a little You have a real knack there.
RICK: You have a real knack there.
MELANIE: Not a knack really. It's just about finding hope in places there should be none.
RICK: Whatever it is, I've never seen them take to a woman like that. Melanie smiles.
RICK: You want the job?
MELANIE: I'd like that.
WOMAN: You're really funny. and kinda Maybe we should.
RICK: Maybe we should.
WOMAN: Go out sometime? I'd like that. I don't know. maybe.
RICK: I don't know. maybe.
WOMAN: CUT TO:
MELANIE: No problem.
KRIS: Who was that?
MELANIE: That was your daddy.
PHILLIP: I love daddy.
KRIS: Is he coming home?
MELANIE: No, he's going to be late. He has a
MELANIE: So, I guess you have to deal with me a little while longer.
WOMAN: You're a single father? That's wonderful. So many men refuse to accept any responsibility for their kids. So, how many do you have?
RICK: Um. three.
WOMAN: That's amazing. I'm sure they're just angels.
WOMAN: My sister has three. She said when the second one was born it doubled the work. She didn't realize the third would double the work load would again. And to think you do it all by yourself.
RICK: Um. kinda.
WOMAN: You're a terrific man. Did I tell you I love kids? They love me. It just comes so instinctively even though I've never had kids myself. I get lots of practice with my nephews though. So, when can I meet your boys?
KRIS: You're not my mom.
RICK: You can't.
WOMAN 2: A guy like you is so hard to find. I think I love you and I think you need to love me too.
RICK: That was incredible.
WOMAN 3: I know I haven't known you very long, but I there's something I need to say.
RICK: I know I haven't known you very long, but I there's something I need to say.
RICK: ( Calling out ) Was it something I said?
MELANIE: Did you have a good time?
RICK: Yeah, it was good. kinda okay. pretty much sucked.
MELANIE: What happened?
RICK: Why can't I find a woman like you?
MELANIE: You're trying too hard.
RICK: I feel bad for the boys. They don't have a "mom". She'll always be their mother, but she'll never be their mom.
MELANIE: Quit trying so hard. You're forcing issues that can't be forced. Relax. Everything happens when and how it's suppose to. It's about spirit and finding the will to love again, for you and the boys.
RICK: You want to stay and.
MELANIE: I'm going to get.
RICK: You sure?
MELANIE: You sure?
RICK: You sure?
MELANIE: A beat as they study each other's eyes.
MELANIE: I'll see you tomorrow.
RICK: Melanie EXITS. Rick turns to tend to Nicky. He stops for a moment then heads to the kitchen for a handful of Cheerios.
NICHOLAS: Nicky almost do'd it.
RICK: Almost, baby boy. Almost.
CARRIE: Finally had to grow up?
RICK: Yeah, I.
JOHN: You've got direction.
RICK: I suppose. I don't know if you'd call it direction, but there's a definite sense of purpose.
CARRIE: Good for you.
RICK: Yeah, but is it good for the kids?
JOHN: Do the kids have direction?
RICK: Only two kinds of people make it in this world, boy; Those that are smart and those that are strong. If you don't want to be smart and do your homework then you can be strong and do pushups.
RICK: I'm probably not as demanding of them as I should be.
JOHN: You have to instill a sense of direction at a very early age.
MOTHER: So, Phillip what do you want to be when you grow up?
PHILLIP: Daddy says I can do three things when I grow up.
MOTHER: And what are those? Phillip takes a deep breath.
PHILLIP: I can go to college and move the hell out of his house. I can join the military and move the hell out of his house, or I can get a job . move the hell out of my house.
RICK: . move the hell out of my house.
MOTHER: CUT TO:
RICK: Ya gotta let them be what they're going to be.
JOHN: No, you have to mold them early. If you don't mold them they'll grow up to be Democrats.
RICK: And you do this with your kids?
JOHN: That's not the point, is it, I think Rick is doing a wonderful It's a struggle, going at it alone,
CARRIE: I think Rick is doing a wonderful It's a struggle, going at it alone,
RICK: It's a struggle, going at it alone,
CARRIE: Excuse me, gentleman, I need to powder my nose.
JOHN: I can't believe you.
RICK: Whining about being single. Married men would kill to be in your I'm just saying it's hard.
JOHN: Whining about being single. Married men would kill to be in your I'm just saying it's hard.
RICK: I'm just saying it's hard.
JOHN: You have your sons to raise without feminine interference. Do you understand the significance of your situation? Do you understand the power in your circumstance?
JOHN: Men, all over the world, would kill for that kind of power.
JOHN: You have the kids and she pays child support. and you sit here and whine about things being hard? Give me a break.
RICK: It does have its advantages, I
JOHN: On me.
RICK: On me.
JOHN: On me.
RICK: John heads to the bar. Carrie approaches the table.
RICK: He went to grab a couple beers.
CARRIE: You know Rick, someday some girl is going to realize what a good man you are.
RICK: Carrie, I don't even have the funds to buy my own beer.
CARRIE: Love isn't about money. Love is about truth and selflessness and discovering who you are and who'll be. Someday, someone will find you.
MELANIE: I'll call you back.
MELANIE: Rick pulls her in for a kiss.
MELANIE: What was that for?
RICK: For finding me.
NICHOLAS: Have to potty, daddy.
RICK: Go potty, buddy.
RICK: I thank you for everything, but it's time to move on.
FRANK: Where are you going? What will you I don't know, Frank, but I'm worth more than this.
RICK: I don't know, Frank, but I'm worth more than this.
RICK: Phillip, what's wrong?
PHILLIP: Well, I wanted that piece and Kris took that piece, and I really, really wanted that piece.
MELANIE: What's so important about that It's bigger.
KRIS: It's bigger.
RICK: Easy on the drinks guys.
MELANIE: What's wrong, Phillip?
PHILLIP: I gotta pee and Kris.
RICK: We're not going to fight over the
MELANIE: What's that?
RICK: Huh? Oh, this? Nothing!
PHILLIP: This time mine's bigger.
RICK: I took off work to be here.
CINDY: Thank you.
RICK: So, what do you want?
CINDY: I want to see your boys.
RICK: I don't think that's a good idea.
CINDY: I'm their mother.
RICK: You forfeited that obligation, That's not fair!
CINDY: That's not fair!
RICK: You abandoned your kids!
CINDY: I did not. I left them in the care of their loving father. There's a Is there?
RICK: Is there?
CINDY: I just want to see the boys.
RICK: You think they even know who you I'm their mother.
CINDY: I'm their mother.
RICK: You keep saying that.
CINDY: I know things can never go back to the way they were before.
MAN: Cindy lies in bed smoking a cigarette.
CINDY: Rick? Rick? Rick?
RICK: Let's keep the attorneys out of this and settle things like civil
CINDY: Let's keep the attorneys out of this and settle things like civil
RICK: Hi guys.
MELANIE: This is a surprise. Leave work to spend the day with us?
RICK: Come on guys. Someone is here to see you.
MELANIE: ( A beat )
CINDY: Thank you.
RICK: Three hours.
CINDY: They'll be here.
RICK: Where are you going.
MELANIE: Anywhere you're not.
RICK: What about the boys? What about me?
MELANIE: I'm all about second chances, but not when I come in second place.
RICK: What are you talking about?
MELANIE: Why was she here? What was that?
RICK: She's their mother.
MELANIE: Mother? I've been more of a mother than she ever was.
RICK: She's their mother.
MELANIE: Who willingly walked out of their She's their mother.
RICK: She's their mother.
MELANIE: You keep saying that.
RICK: You think this is easy? You think raising these boys is something I want to do alone? Every day is like a prison sentence. Every thing I do, every decision I make is directly affected by the boundaries of my responsibility. I have three children, but I have no me. Everywhere I go people stare at
RICK: They stare at me, and I know what they're thinking.
PEDESTRIAN: You poor, poor man. You poor, poor children. How unfortunate to only have your father. How terrible it must be not to know your mother.
MELANIE: What about Zach? How noble of you to be the only single parent in the world. How stoic you are. so concerned with the best interests of your children. Too bad. Their best interest is walking out the
KRIS: When can we see you again?
CINDY: Is someday tomorrow?
PHILLIP: Is someday tomorrow?
CINDY: Someday is someday, baby.
RICK: Give your Mom a hug, guys, then get in the house.
CINDY: I'm sorry.
RICK: I thought things had changed.
CINDY: I thought things had changed.
RICK: I am who I am, Rick. I'm not cut out to be a mommy.
CINDY: I am who I am, Rick. I'm not cut out to be a mommy.
RICK: I could have told you that.
CINDY: I had to give it a shot. Rick turns to walk away.
RICK: At whose expense? Huh, Cindy? At whose expense? Who's going to dry their tears tomorrow when they realize your never coming back? Who's going to rock them to sleep at night when they ask why mommy doesn't love them?
CINDY: You are, and you wouldn't have it any other way.
PHILLIP: Is Mel coming today?
RICK: I don't know, buddy.
NICHOLAS: Yes Nicky?
RICK: Yes Nicky?
NICHOLAS: I love Mel.
RICK: She loves you too.
RICK: ( Yelling ) Don't you yell! If you have something to say, come here and tell me.
KRIS: Phillip's in the closet
RICK: Phillip's in the closet
KRIS: Phillip's in the closet
RICK: What were you doing in there?
PHILLIP: Being Daddy.
RICK: Who locked the door?
KRIS: Wasn't me.
PHILLIP: I did.
MOTHER: Rick?. Rick?. Rick?
MOTHER: Take care of my babies.
FATHER: What are you giving him money for?
MOTHER: To help him through the hard times. He's a good father, just having a rough go.
FATHER: I've never met a good father that couldn't support his kids.
MOTHER: I'm too old for that. The better side of life has passed me by. What if they fall? I don't hear like I used to. What if one of them was seriously hurt and I didn't hear their cry? I hate that the only thing I feel competent to do is give them money. I love my son and I love my grandbabies, but how would I live with myself if something happened to those
REPRESENTATIVE: Sir, you're 3 months behind on your electric bill.
JAILER: I always knew you were a lifer.
ADOPTION AGENT: Because of their age it may take awhile. We'll start them out in foster care, but eventually they'll all be placed in loving, nurturing
RICK: They'll be together though, right?
ADOPTION AGENT: Mr. Stevens, I wish I could make that promise, but the odds of an adoptive family willing to take them all is astronomical.
RICK: Come on guys we're out of here.
ADOPTION AGENT: Mr. Stevens?
RICK: I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
RICK: ( Calling out. ) Can I get some help here.
RICK: Can you help me?
CONVICT: Can you help him?
RICK: I don't know.
CONVICT: What does he need?
RICK: I don't know.
CONVICT: He needs a father, not a book reading baby-sitter.
RICK: ( In a hushed rage ) I can't fucking do this.
CONVICT: Yes you can.
CONVICT: Use your mind and your heart. It's different than it ever should have been. but different isn't wrong.
RICK: But I.
CONVICT: Use what you have. There is a vein of wealth inside you just waiting to be mined. Think differently than you have ever thought before. Worker harder than you ever thought you could. Love these children like they've never been loved before.
RICK: The answer lies within. Quit worrying about how these misguided events have torn your life apart. Quit dwelling on all of your misgivings. Look around you. You're not alone. But you, and you alone, will make the difference.
CONVICT: The answer lies within. Quit worrying about how these misguided events have torn your life apart. Quit dwelling on all of your misgivings. Look around you. You're not alone. But you, and you alone, will make the difference.
RICK: It's not worth a lot, maybe a few hundred bucks, but it might keep you in soap for a year.
CASE WORKER: Mr. Stevens, I can see you now. Rick and the Pregnant Woman lock I ain't some charity case. I know what you think when you look at me. You think; Look at that poor, poor woman. Look at those poor, poor children. How unfortunate it must be that they only have a mother. How terrible it must be not to know their father.
PREGNANT WOMAN: I ain't some charity case. I know what you think when you look at me. You think; Look at that poor, poor woman. Look at those poor, poor children. How unfortunate it must be that they only have a mother. How terrible it must be not to know their father.
CASE WORKER: Mr. Stevens?
RICK: I didn't mean it like that?
PREGNANT WOMAN: No one ever does.
CASE WORKER: Mr. Stevens?
CASE WORKER: Mr. Stevens? I can see you now.
RICK: I'm sorry, I'm going to have to Excuse me?
CASE WORKER: Excuse me?
RICK: Responsibility calls.
NICHOLAS: Please daddy? Please? Rick opens the book so all can see.
RICK: Once upon a time.
NICHOLAS: Daddy, I'm hungry.
NICHOLAS: It's very, very empty.
PHILLIP: Daddy, I'm thirsty.
RICK: Get your coats on.
KRIS: We're leaving guys.
CLERK: Thirty-two hundred and fifty-six
OLDER WOMAN: Think it's bad now? Wait til they're teenagers.
RICK: Mom, I have an idea, but I need your help.
RICK: Put your checkbook away. What I need you can't buy.
MOTHER: What do you need.
RICK: For you to believe in me.
MELANIE: I know you.
CINDY: Excuse me?
MELANIE: Rick's ex-wife?
CINDY: And you are?
MELANIE: Can I ask you a question? What is Phillip's favorite color?
CINDY: Blue. His favorite color is blue. How many teeth has Kris lost?
MELANIE: Blue. His favorite color is blue. How many teeth has Kris lost?
CINDY: I don't know. Why?
MELANIE: Four. Two on top and two on bottom. He got a quarter for the first one, fifty cents for the next two and he parlayed the last into an even dollar. Nicholas cries at night because he thinks the house is filled with ghosts. Kiss him once on the forehead, once on the cheek and sing The Cradle Will Rock and he'll sleep the whole night through. Kris' favorite subject is math. He loves to read and write, but he doesn't do so well in social studies. He knows how to ride a bike. Why? Because I taught him. Phillip wants to learn but he's always afraid he'll fall. Nicky just likes to Flintstone his tricycle. Phillip's favorite cartoon is Tunenami.
CINDY: What's your point?
MELANIE: I'm more their mom than you'll ever So, why are you here with slick and not with "your" kids?
CINDY: So, why are you here with slick and not with "your" kids?
MELANIE: Things change.
CINDY: Yeah. yeah they do. Now if you'll excuse me I need to find the I couldn't do it, ya know?
MELANIE: Do what?
CINDY: I always thought I wanted to be a parent, and I was really good at being pregnant, but I sucked as a mom. I know that now. I don't have what it takes.
MELANIE: I don't think I've ever felt as much pity for anyone as I do for you right now.
CINDY: Take care of my boys. all of
RICK: Well, guys, I guess this is it.
KRIS: We can do it daddy.
RICK: Yes we can.
CLIMBER: You can do it.
RICK: Yes we can.
RICK: What is it, Kris?
KRIS: Look daddy.
PHILLIP: We can do it.
RICK: ( Through a weary voice. ) Yes we can.
RICK: Too late, Kris has tripped over a can of paint. As he sits on his butt a look of fear crosses his face, a tear forms in his eye. Rick takes his paintbrush and dots Kris on the nose.
KRIS: Phillip and Nicholas are quickly engaged in painting each other and a full-blown paint war ensues.
BOYFRIEND: What's wrong? What did I do?
MELANIE: Not you, it's me.
BOYFRIEND: What then?
MELANIE: I'm sorry.
RICK: Put the stone down.
PHILLIP: No buts: Put the stone down.
RICK: No buts: Put the stone down.
RICK: I knew this was a hard climb,
RESTING CLIMBER: Long way up.
RICK: RESTING CLIMBER
RESTING CLIMBER: Long way down for that matter.
RICK: That too.
RICK: So, what's your point.
RESTING CLIMBER: No point, just an observation.
RICK: I'm okay.
RESTING CLIMBER: For the boys.
NICHOLAS: Daddy, I'm thirsty. Rick studies the climber for a moment.
RICK: Go ahead.
RESTING CLIMBER: You know, if you stop here, halfway between a long way up and a long way down you really haven't accomplished much, have you?
RICK: We're not stopping. We're just That's what I said, fourteen years ago. Rick looks toward the top.
RESTING CLIMBER: That's what I said, fourteen years ago. Rick looks toward the top.
RICK: We can do this.
RESTING CLIMBER: Yes you can.
RICK: We can do this!
PROSECUTOR: What is so important Mr. Stevens that you would burden this court with convening today?
RICK: I just needed clarification.
PROSECUTOR: On what, Mr. Stevens? On what?
RICK: I know if I have to, I can do this alone, but do I have to do this alone? A hushed MURMUR rises in the audience. The Judge RAPS his gavel on the bench.
JUDGE: Order in this court! A beat as things quiet down.
RICK: I don't know.
PROSECUTOR: He doesn't know. He just doesn't I don't know.
RICK: I don't know.
JUDGE: Then this court sees no reason to amend the original verdict. The order stands.
RICK: Tell it to someone who cares, Mr. I have. I have laid my heart out on the line time and time again, only to walk away empty handed. This love, this caring, this sharing of life, it's a sentence and my heart has been condemned. It doesn't matter who I've told, what's in my heart is never quite enough. The people I have cared for most have shunned me in life and in love. Unanswered phone calls. Unnoticed displays of affection. A rose that withers on the doorstep. No matter what I do, it's never enough. Just once, just one fucking time, I want to be enough.

PROSECUTOR: Your only condemnation is self- pity. You have people that care all around you, but you're too blind to see them. If you don't pull yourself together soon, my friend, they soon will all be gone.
MELANIE: What do you want?
RICK: I'm a proud man, sometimes foolish.
MELANIE: Go on.
RICK: I have a long way to go before I could ever be the man you need me to be.
MELANIE: And I got confused between what I should have done and what I thought was right.
RICK: And I got confused between what I should have done and what I thought was right.
MELANIE: Yes you did.
RICK: I put you on a pedestal and then I knocked you down. It wasn't fair.
MELANIE: Life's not fair Rick.
RICK: You were more a mother to my boys than they have ever known. You were more a woman to me than I have ever You're right.
MELANIE: You're right.
RICK: You're not going to make this easy, are you?
MELANIE: Cut the bullshit, Rick.
RICK: ( In Mel's ear ) I can live my life alone. I can raise my kids alone. I can walk this path alone. I'd much rather do it with you.
MELANIE: I can't.
RICK: ( Turning back around. ) I won't.
MELANIE: ( Turning back around. ) I won't.
RICK: I shouldn't have come here.
MELANIE: No, you shouldn't have.
MELANIE: You just don't get it do you?
RICK: Get what?
MELANIE: You're here for you, you selfish
KRIS: I could have looked sad.
PHILLIP: I can look sad too.
KRIS: But I look sadder.
NICHOLAS: I sad.
PHILLIP: Don't quit, daddy.
KRIS: Daddy doesn't quit.
JOHN: You love her?
RICK: I think so. I don't know.
JOHN: If you think you're in love you
RICK: I suppose I am.
JOHN: Does your heart skip a beat when she walks by?
RICK: She's my best friend. or was.
JOHN: Does your heart skip a beat when she walks by?
RICK: Do your palms sweat when you think about her?
JOHN: Do your palms sweat when you think about her?
RICK: Does she inspire you?
JOHN: Does she inspire you?
RICK: With music and poetry.
JOHN: And is there passion?
RICK: There's fire.
JOHN: And have you ever told her this?
RICK: She knows.
JOHN: Have you ever told her this?
RICK: Don't you think you should?
JOHN: Don't you think you should?
RICK: It only confuses things.
JOHN: Loving your best friend confuses things? I can't think of a love more lucid. Rick stands to leave.
JOHN: You know I'll never forgive you for this, don't you? You had the power and the dream at your fingertips and you're giving it all away.
RICK: You didn't marry your best friend?
JOHN: I thought you had things all planned out.
RICK: I thought you had things all planned out.
JOHN: Affairs of the heart and those of the mind are two different things.
RICK: It's not too late, you know?
RICK: Go Home, John. Go home and talk to your best friend the way you talk to me.
RICK: I need you to watch the boys.
MOTHER: But you're father.
FATHER: Woman, enough.
MOTHER: No more excuses. It's time to live life and enjoy our grandkids. Go. The boys will be fine.
FATHER: No more excuses. It's time to live life and enjoy our grandkids. Go. The boys will be fine.
MOTHER: Can't we just give him money to pay for a baby-sitter?
MELANIE: ( To herself ) Oh shit.
CUSTOMER: The cup has nearly reached the brim.
MELANIE: Pay attention, would ya?
CUSTOMER: Pay attention, would ya?
MELANIE: What do you want?
RICK: To talk.
MELANIE: I'm working.
RICK: I know.
MELANIE: So, where are the boys?
RICK: They're at my parents.
MELANIE: What? Not going to use them to try to persuade me with guilt?
RICK: Is that what you thought?
MELANIE: I have a son of my own. I know when people are using their kids.
CUSTOMER 2: ( To Customer 2 ) Excuse us for a moment okay?
RICK: ( To Customer 2 ) Excuse us for a moment okay?
CUSTOMER 2: I'd just like some coffee.

RICK: What is your problem?
CUSTOMER 2: CUSTOMER 2
RICK: CUSTOMER 2
CUSTOMER 2: The coffee, it's cold.
RICK: ( Setting the cup back Quit your bitching.
MELANIE: I can't believe you came here.
RICK: I can't believe you're a waitress.
MELANIE: Beats chasing around after snot nosed brats all day.
RICK: I thought you liked my kids.
MELANIE: I was talking about you.
RICK: I deserved that.
MELANIE: So, what do the kids need? A babysitter? A surrogate mom?
RICK: This isn't about the kids.
MELANIE: Then what's it about?
RICK: It's about me, the selfish prick.
MELANIE: About you?
RICK: Hear me out, okay?
MELANIE: ( Looking at her watch. ) You have 15 seconds.
RICK: Okay, okay.
MELANIE: Melanie, there is a grace about you that reminds me how clumsy I am. There is an honesty about you that reminds me how deceitful I can be. There is a beauty in your eyes that reminds me how ugly I've become. There is a kindness in your voice that contradicts my coarseness. There is a glow around you that illuminates my dullness. There is spirit in you that challenges my laziness, but most of all, there is a woman in you, that sparks my desire, a desire to be graceful and honest and beautiful and kind. A desire to be better than I am or ever thought I could be.

RICK: I think my ten seconds are up.
MELANIE: Who's counting?
CUSTOMER 2: Miss. My coffee?
MELANIE: Get it yourself.
RICK: I love you.
MELANIE: I don't think I heard you.
RICK: If I give you my heart will you promise to treat it softly? Kiss it when it hurts? Put it in a box and know that it belongs to you?
MELANIE: That's not what you said.
RICK: I said I love you.
MELANIE: As brutal as that can be?
RICK: I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you.
MELANIE: I kind of like you too.
MELANIE: I never thought you'd make it.
RICK: Been waiting long?
MELANIE: I never thought you'd find me.
RICK: I had to find me first. I hope you plan on walking, cause I'm not sure I can carry you.
MELANIE: So, how do we do this? The two begin the ascent together.
RICK: One step at a time?
MELANIE: Side by side?
RICK: Maybe you could carry me?
JAILER: Getting out of here, huh?
RICK: It's time to move on.
JAILER: If you leave don't ever come back.
RICK: Not even.
JAILER: Not even on a visit. You're a very ugly man. I'd hate to explain to the other guards why you'd come to visit me.
KRIS: Yes, Kris?
MOTHER: Yes, Kris?
KRIS: Grandma I love you.
PHILLIP: I love her more.
NICHOLAS: I love her the whole universe.
