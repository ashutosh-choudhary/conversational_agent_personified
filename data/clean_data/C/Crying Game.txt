JODY: Two types, Fergus. The scorpion and the frog. Ever heard of them?
JODY: Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can, and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I give you a ride on my back, you'll go and sting me."

Takes the scorpion on his back. Braves the waters. Halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all. And as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out, "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for now we both will drown?" Scorpion replies, "I can't help it, it's in my

DIL: Would you like a drink?
FERGUS: Yes, please.
DIL: What'll it be?
FERGUS: She goes into a small kitchen. Fergus looks at the mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody. The camera tracks into the soldier's smiling face. Then into Fergus's face. His reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside Dave's. She comes through with two drinks.
FERGUS: Someone out there.

FERGUS: Shouldn't I go?
DIL: And they fall into one another's arms. She stretches up with her whole body over him. They grow suddenly and violently They fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor. The photograph above them seems to smile. He draws up her dress with his hands. She suddenly pulls away.

FERGUS: She dances closer.
DIL: If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
FERGUS: If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
DIL: You're not having me on, are you? 'Cause Dil can't stand that.
FERGUS: She puts her cheek against his. Dave, at the bar, slams his drink down.
