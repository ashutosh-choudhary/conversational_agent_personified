ANNA: -and you hate organized religion.

ZOEY: It was understood.
ANNA: Yeah again.not feeling confident in your choices. Please Zoey. ( beat ). Be careful this time.
QUINN'S ROOM: Quinn flies out of bed and sees Louis leaning against the wall with his arms crossed.

QUINN: Louis our whole purpose here, is to show up, and over time establish a social base, and then kill each other.
LOUIS: You know and I'm very good at the social base part, and you are not so good.
QUINN: That's because you find a way to screw it up every time.
LOUIS: That's because, I know this is news to you, I represent evil.
QUINN: That's something we agree on. I'm tired I don't know if we can get off this train. It's just a viscous cycle.
LOUIS: I don't know if we can get off this train. It's just a viscous cycle.
QUINN: Letting you win is not an option.
LOUIS: I wasn't going there. ( beat )

JACK: Tragedy changes people, it effected Zoey in one way.you in another.
ANNA: ( beat,smiles ) I became a "fag hag"

QUINN: I think they have a pretty good idea.
LOUIS: So in all the times we have been here, you haven't gone to the cinema?
QUINN: Why not?
LOUIS: Why not?
QUINN: It's not what we are here to do.
LOUIS: In your bosses name, what is wrong with you? You've got to enjoy yourself. You might be chosen, but you have needs. We all do.
QUINN: I have to stay focused.
LOUIS: You've also burned yourself out. You're not going to be any good to me.
LOUIS' POV: He starts to run his hands through his hair. He tries to straighten up the mess on his head. He picks up some gel and squirts a small amount in his hand. He runs it through his hair, getting the desired look.
LOUIS: ( to himself ) You are a handsome devil.
LOUIS APARTMENT: Louis spins around and grabs his keys off of the coffee table. He then dances right out the door.
LOUIS: ( puzzled )
HALLWAY: .the hallway. Ryan Blood is standing in the doorway of his room, across the hall.
RYAN BLOOD: You looking for Quinn?
LOUIS: RYAN BLOOD
RYAN BLOOD: ( nodding toward the exit door ) He just left.
LOUIS: ( to himself ) What do we have here?
ZOEY: Why haven't I seen your place?
QUINN: My place isn't very exciting.
ZOEY: That doesn't surprise me. I can't imagine you having a vast Blu Ray collection.
QUINN: Blu Ray?
ZOEY: Wow.Quinn, you have to start enjoying the world around you.
QUINN: You know I realized today you are right about that.
ZOEY: So you're saying you want to come up stairs and watch "They Call Her One Eye"?
QUINN: ( laughs ) Uh.no. I'm still trying to get I am Curious Yellow out of my head.
ZOEY: Yeah.sorry about that.
QUINN: ( smiles ) It's OK.
ZOEY: I.I..I'm sorry.
QUINN: No don't be.
ZOEY: I shouldn't have been that aggressive.
QUINN: No.it's OK.
ZOEY: I need to get back though.
OK?: I need to get back though.
QUINN: I need to get back though.
ZOEY: Puzzling.but I know.virgin and all-
QUINN: -Well.I mean.
ZOEY: That came out rude.I just mean.I wanted to do it. I should have taken it It's OK. I'll be by tomorrow.
QUINN: It's OK. I'll be by tomorrow.
ZOEY: You sure?
QUINN: Yes of course.
ZOEY: ( worried ) I hope so.
DUMPSTER: Meanwhile, leaning against the dumpster, Louis watches the display unseen.
RYAN BLOOD: You're here to learn more about his "coming and goings". To find out what I have seen.
LOUIS: So far you are dead on.
RYAN BLOOD: It's more than that Louis-
LOUIS: -You know who I am?
RYAN BLOOD: I know pretty much everything. I've watched you, studied you.I feel I'm expert on your little game every seventy Oh yes.
LOUIS: RYAN BLOOD
RYAN BLOOD: Oh yes.
LOUIS: Where are you going with this you weird little man?
RYAN BLOOD: You had strategy in the beginning. Middle Ages.Old West.Even World War II. ( beat ) Let's take a step back for a second. The Old West. Lack of faith, corruption, these things make Quinn weak. The chink in his armor is his faith in people. You knew that, and corrupting America.a young land.was the key. ( beat ) Quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked for a human ally. That ally was Joseph Smith, and Quinn.or I mean Moroni.led Joseph to the plates that later when into-
LOUIS: How do I do that?
RYAN BLOOD: This girl is distracting him. Get his mind focused on the matter at hand. At this point I'm afraid he isn't even going to fight you.
LOUIS: I'm surprised this girl even likes Quinn. He comes across creepy.
RYAN BLOOD: Maybe that's the key-
LOUIS: ( lightbulb ) -Make her think he's crazy.
LOUIS: Where have you been?
QUINN: You've been waiting long?
LOUIS: No I figured you were on your way back-
QUINN: -because you are spying on me again? So I don't need to tell you where I've been.
LOUIS: Who's the girl?
QUINN: It's started again. You're already jealous. You are going to do the same thing you did during the war.you're going to sabotage this.
LOUIS: I'm insulted frankly.
QUINN: Don't you play that game. You are being No, I'm being serious. You care about the girl, it's obvious. Not in a friendship or I'm curious about human behavior way.
LOUIS: No, I'm being serious. You care about the girl, it's obvious. Not in a friendship or I'm curious about human behavior way.
QUINN: So why are you here?
LOUIS: Have you told her?
QUINN: Who I am? Of course not!
LOUIS: Quinn you only have a few days left and you care for this girl- - What's the harm in telling her?
QUINN: There's a lot of harm in telling her.
LOUIS: If this is real and you really care for this girl, you have to tell her. It's only fair to her.
QUINN: She has a best friend who is very guarded of me.It's odd she eluded to the same thing. You know the whole "I'm hiding something, and I need to come out into the open" thing.
LOUIS: Sounds to me like she is right.
QUINN: Well I better do this now then.
LOUIS: Yeah you don't want to lose your nerve.
QUINN: Can you let yourself out?
LOUIS: Of course.
ANNA: What the hell?
QUINN: I need to see Zoey.
ANNA: What about tomorrow? Or never is good.
QUINN: I need to talk to you, it's important.
ANNA: Jesus Christ!
QUINN: I need to tell you everything. Anna is so What are you talking about? Anna is I've not been honest with you about what I do.or who I am.
ZOEY: What are you talking about? Anna is I've not been honest with you about what I do.or who I am.
QUINN: I've not been honest with you about what I do.or who I am.
ZOEY: I need to come clean. I want you to trust me. I want your friends to trust me.
OK?: I need to come clean. I want you to trust me. I want your friends to trust me.
QUINN: I need to come clean. I want you to trust me. I want your friends to trust me.
ZOEY: ( nervous laugh ) OK Quinn, just spit it out.
QUINN: ( beat ) I'm an archangel named Moroni and I basically represent "light" or everything that's good. Louis, my friend, represents "darkness". Every seventy years we have to fight to the death. If I win everything stays the way it is. The world continues turning. If I lose, Louis takes on the role of the Antichrist and the apocalypse will be unleashed. I'm talking Book of Revelations stuff here. So I only have a limited time left in this world. ( beat ) I want to spend that time with you.

DARKNESS: FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-YEARS EARLIER-DAY Zoey, roughly 2 years old, sits in the floor of her parent's home playing. Her DAD, only seen from the waist down, walks in front of Zoey with his bible in hand. He makes it to Zoey's MOM, on the other side of the room

QUINN: Based on how you are acting this morning I have my doubts. That's not what I meant though. You woke up screaming.
ZOEY: It was nothing.
QUINN: I understand if you don't want to talk about it. I'm just concerned.
ZOEY: It's not a big deal. It was.a.well wouldn't call it a nightmare.repressed memory. Hell, it's not repressed.I think of it all the time.
QUINN: What is it?
ZOEY: You don't want to hear about it.
QUINN: Zoey takes a deep breath.
ZOEY: My father, I mentioned him before, was a Baptist minister. He always said he had this "sickness".

INTERCUT: INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT- A FEW MOMENTS LATER Jack sits at the PC while chatting away on his cell phone. It appears he is looking up information for who ever is on the other end.
JACK: You might be right sweetheart. The employee I was telling you about earlier was instrumental in getting Appleridge Orphanage shut down.
ZOEY: Huntington. I think she felt this guy was getting in the way of her master plan. Finally, nearly 20 years later, he convinced the state what was really going on there.

QUINN: How do people keep ending up in my room?
ZOEY: ( laughs ) You need to learn to lock up.
QUINN: I'm not fighting Louis.
ZOEY: Why the change of heart?
QUINN: I think you might be right. I don't think it's necessary. I think the world will keep turning one way or another. I'm not dependant on that. I'm not a savior.
ZOEY: Do you really believe? You know?
QUINN: Yes. I do believe it. I know it actually. Since I have been with you, I've doubted what I know to be fact though. Then it hit me, it really doesn't matter.

QUINN'S POV: We see Louis with great force repeatedly hit Quinn with the gun. Everything goes fuzzy and then we.
BLACKNESS: INT. QUINN'S ROOM-HOURS LATER Quinn slowly gets to his feet. He walks over to the doorway and kneels down. He sees a puddle of blood.Zoey's blood. He puts his fingers in it. He inspects his hand, rubbing the blood between his index finger and thumb. He jumps up and screams in anger. That would be Quinn's version of a battle cry.
JACK: Mother fucker!
QUINN: Where's Zoey?
JACK: Fuck you mother fucker! I'm going to call the fucking fuzz once you untie me! Fucking nut bag, ball sac-
QUINN: ( like he is talking to a retarded child ) Ass fuck salad-
