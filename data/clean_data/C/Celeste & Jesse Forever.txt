CELESTE AND JESSE FOREVER: Written by Rashida Jones & Will McCormack
JESSE: I'm a Love Rhino...
CELESTE JESSE: Don't worry `bout me, I've Dont' worry `bout me, I've got a enough love for got enough love, for the two the...(her Blackberry rings) us. Oh please... oh shit, I gotta take this. Turn it down.
CELESTE: Jess, turn it down, seriously! She playfully slaps him. He turns it down. A little.
JESSE: Maybe. I may have an important call coming in too, so... They both know he has no important call coming in.
CELESTE: (on the phone) Okay. Ready? This year all trends point towards simplicity and comfort. Celeste is momentarily distracted by a bad driver in front of them.
JESSE: What the shit??
CELESTE: (she whispers to Jesse) Shhh. Phone call.(back to her call) That's enough of a blurb, right? Jesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror. He then looks at his teeth.
JESSE: Does this tooth look dark? Celeste just glares at him.
CELESTE: Okay. Call me back if they need more. Jesse looks at his tooth again in the rearview mirror.
JESSE: Like a little darker than the rest? Celeste waves her hand to quiet Jesse.
CELESTE: Okay, thanks bye. (to Jesse) Can't you just sit still for two minutes? And we talked about this, no more smoking!
JESSE: I wasn't smoking, I just found it.
CELESTE: Come on. They drive by "Urban Light," Chris Burden's installation at the entrance of LACMA. They are rows of restored street lamps. Celeste sneers.
JESSE: I think it's beautiful. A beat passes. Then, Jesse pulls over.
CELESTE: What are you doing? Why are you stopping?
JESSE: Well, your appointment is not until noon and this is that place with the deadstock vintage Italian fabric. I thought it would be good for the guest room windows. Celeste is truly touched by the gesture.
CELESTE: Oh wow...you are so thoughtful. Jesse smiles, proud of himself.
JESSE: Whassup, muthafucka?? Celeste rolls her eyes and gets out of the car to look at fabric.
CELESTE: Jess, that place is insane. They have tassels that were manufactured for Mussolini's mistress...
JESSE: (covering the phone) Sorry, I'm on the phone. It's important.
CELESTE: Okay then. Celeste sits quietly while Jesse is on his call.
JESSE: Really? I just...don't know what to say. Thank you so much for calling me. Celeste throws her hands up in silent celebration.
CELESTE: (whispers) Did you get the job?? Jesse signals with his finger, "one minute."
JESSE: Well, sometimes things are just meant to work out. Celeste looks at him with anticipation.
CELESTE: Was that the job? Did you get the book job?
JESSE: No, but Celeste... He looks at her and grabs her hand, with tears in his eyes.
CELESTE: What the fuck are you talking about?
JESSE: Malibu. The waves are peeling out there.
CELESTE: Is this about surfing? You're talking about going surfing. Unbelievable.
JESSE: No, this is best part. Skillz got a hi-def digital camera and he's gonna film me!!!
CELESTE: Oh, god.
JESSE: And we're gonna upload it on You Tube!
CELESTE: I'm not...
JESSE: What? Is that not awesome?
CELESTE: No, yeah, I just thought it was about the Slate job you interviewed for.
JESSE: Oh yeah. No. They haven't called yet. But if they don't think I'm the right artist to illustrate the book, then it's not the right job for me. You know what I mean?
CELESTE: I absolutely do, yes. You are a wonderful artist. But at some point, you will show the world that one day...right?
JESSE: Hey, can I drop you at home now? Because I just missed a wave.
CELESTE: Well...
JESSE: Wait! I just missed another one.
CELESTE: Yeah. Take me home, it's fine.
CELESTE: Be back by six so you can shower.
JESSE: Why shower?
CELESTE: Dinner with Beth and Tucker.
JESSE: Right, right.
CELESTE: Have fun shredding your glassy peel.
JESSE: Aw, so wrong.
CELESTE: Love you.
JESSE: Love you too. He promptly blasts the radio and flashes their signature "C and J" hand sign. She flashes it back. He zooms off.
TUCKER: Did you end up going to see that band at Spaceland last week?
JESSE: Oh, The Injured Saint? Yeah, dude. They are real. You know what? They should be your wedding band.
JESSE (CONTD): They're loud but they're affordable.
CELESTE: They opened for Darcy Fudged His Knickers. Now, they're amazing. You'd be lucky to book them for your wedding. Or you should see if Emergency Breakthrough is available. The horn section is tight.
BETH: It's already done. We got the best swing band in New England. Sugarfoot and The Swingin' Scrod.
TUCKER: I told you, I'm not doing it. Swing is so late 90's, honey. Beth leans over a gives him a deep kiss. She knows how to work him.
BETH: I love you. We'll talk about this later. Celeste looks over the menu. Celeste and Jesse's next interaction is said with heavy, really bad German accents, which is hilarious--only to them.
CELESTE: So veee ahhh gawwnna share zeh beet zalad and zeh bolognese, riiiiiiight?
JESSE: Yawh. But I em murdering zeh creme brulee alooooone. No sharrrrring.
CELESTE: I don't vant dessert. I vill joost have bite oof yorrrs.
JESSE: Ve know zeh end of zat story. Yawh we doooooo!
CELESTE: Yawh!!!!
BETH: I can't do this. I just can't. Celeste is genuinely concerned about her friend.
CELESTE: Are you okay? Oh no...
BETH: It's just not right. I can't hold my tongue. We can't do this anymore.
CELESTE: Honey, weddings are stressful, I know all about it. But you guys we'll be fine!
BETH: NO. WE are fine. What the fuck are YOU TWO doing?? Jesse and Celeste look at Beth in amazement.
CELESTE: What do you mean?
JESSE: Yeah, what do you mean?
BETH: What do I mean?? You guys are not together anymore! This is not normal! You've been separated for SIX MONTHS and you hang out every day like nothing's wrong! It's fucking weird!
TUCKER: Beth...
BETH: No, Tucker, you think it's weird too. Speak up for yourself.
TUCKER: It's weird. Let's not play charades anymore.
CELESTE: No charades. We are separated and we're friends. You guys should be happy, all we did was fight before.
JESSE: Yeah, you guys should be thrilled about this. You'll never have to pick sides.
CELESTE: Yeah, everyone's cool.
BETH: Everyone is not cool! This is not cool! It's just not working for me, I'm sorry. Beth gets up and walks out. Celeste and Jesse sit there and stare at Tucker in silence.
JESSE: Bett iz zo angry.
CELESTE: Yah, she iz uber angry. Yahhh.
TUCKER: Yeah, you guys are weird. I can't do this. It's fucked up. Tucker gets up and leaves. Jesse and Celeste watch him leave and sip their wine quietly.
JESSE: C, look...uhhhh! Celeste looks at him. She joins in. She reaches over and pushes in on the tube. Vaseline comes out of the top. This looks a lot like a penis ejaculating.
CELESTE: Ahhhhh! Oh god! They both erupt in laughter. Even though this is the thousandth time they've done this stupid joke, it will always be funny. To them.
JESSE: Crazy.
CELESTE: It's not weird that we hang out. Do you think it's weird we hang out?
JESSE: No, of course not. You're my best friend.
CELESTE: Yeah you too. I mean, we can't not hang out. The last time we didn't talk for longer than a week was in 10th grade when you went to Space Camp Canada.
JESSE: Yeah, that was 6 weeks of torture. I mean, the anti-gravity training was insane but I missed you.
CELESTE: Well, I'm exhausted.
JESSE: Me too. Celeste walks to her front door with her key and Jesse heads towards the side gate with his key. It is now obvious that he is living in her guest house.
CELESTE: Hey, it's kinda chilly tonight, how's the heat in there?
JESSE: Oh, it's fine. I'm fine. He keeps walking. He turns again to Celeste.
CELESTE: Jesse, please, you can stay here as long as you like. It's your studio. It's actually really nice to have you here.
JESSE: For me too.
CELESTE: Oh, don't forget, the contractor needs to get in there for measurements in the morning. So make sure your thingys, your sculptures, whatever...are out of the way.
JESSE: Got it.
CELESTE: Night.
JESSE: Night. Love you.
CELESTE: Love you too.
BUSINESS MAN: Large coffee, please.
CELESTE: Excuse me, sir? The business man pretends to not hear her.
BUSINESS MAN: Oh. Sorry, I didn't know.
CELESTE: Did you not?
BUSINESS MAN: I'm in a rush.
CELESTE: So you did know. And everyone's in a rush, so... Other people in line are now paying attention. Celeste wants to let it go, but she can't.
BUSINESS MAN: Well, she was looking at the pastries, I didn't think she was ready to order.
CELESTE: Well, it's not just her. It's everyone behind her too. So, if you want to ask all these people if it's okay to cut in front of them because you are late, be my guest. Just don't assume that your time is more important than everyone else's. The business man gets his coffee.
BUSINESS MAN: Have a nice day.
CELESTE: (sotto) Prick.
CELESTE: American culture is dying. We have an unrelenting appetite for processed junk food, talentless pop stars like Riley Banks and recycled movie franchises like Transformers. The more we consume crap, the more we want crap.
RACHEL MADDOW: Sounds utterly hopeless. Is there an upshot?
CELESTE: I think there will be a groundswell movement towards simplicity. People will start to listen to their most rudimentary needs-- they will crave mental, spiritual and physical nourishment. It's back to basics.
RACHEL MADDOW: Wow, a lot to chew on. Well, thanks for being with us today. You're great, come back any time. For more on this gloomy but interesting subject, look out for trend forecaster, Celeste Martin's new book "Shitegeist," on bookshelves Monday.
CELESTE: Thanks so much, Rachel.
CELESTE: So I had dinner with the drama club last night.
SCOTT: Who's that?
CELESTE: Tucker and Beth. They're such dicks. They left in protest because they think Jesse and I are being "unhealthy." So judgy, right? We're fine.
SCOTT: You're only done when you're done.
CELESTE: Spare me the spiritual platitudes, Scotty. If we were gay,(she motions to Scott) no one would even question us being friends!
SCOTT: You and Jesse are clearly not ready to let each other go. And there's nothing wrong with that.
CELESTE: Yeah there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, what do you think?
SCOTT: Well, to be honest... Celeste looks at an e-mail her blackberry and interrupts.
CELESTE: Wait, we're signing Riley Banks?? When were you going to tell me?? I just trashed her on Rachel Maddow. Great.
SCOTT: Yeah, that's why I wanted you to come in. It's a huge account..
CELESTE: Scott, you and I built this company so we wouldn't have to take an account like Riley Banks.
SCOTT: Well, you and I may not have a company if we don't take Riley Banks. Recession, remember?
CELESTE: She's like a...soul-less hologram.
SCOTT: She is releasing a new album. She wants us to do the branding and merchandising. We need to take this account.
CELESTE: Ok. Fine. I'm gonna go eat lunch. Celeste starts to heads out.
SCOTT: If you are looking for my opinion, I do think you should start dating.
CELESTE: I don't do dating. The right guy will show up. And I'm still on track for my 25 year plan.
SCOTT: No one has a 25 year plan. Except for my mortgage company.
CELESTE: First child at 33. Second at 35. Which means I will only be 56 at my eldest's college graduation. The bad news is that I may not be at my 4th grandchild's high school graduation. But that's okay, I guess.
SCOTT: I'm fascinated with the mentally ill.
CELESTE: I've got time. I'm not worried.
SCOTT: Well, do me a favor and get your fuck on before you meet the next guy. Celeste looks at Scott in shock.
CELESTE: What are you doing?
SCOTT: Sorry, I was trying to be your saucy gay friend. It didn't feel good.
CELESTE: Yeah don't.
SKILLZ: The economic climate is real bad, man. And I think my business is taking the hardest hit of all. It's brutal. And no one's talking about it.
JESSE: You sell pot.
SKILLZ: Not for long, dude. Have you been to those weed pharmacies? They're killing me. I gotta branch out. Maybe start working in methamphetamines? Or maybe teach pre-school. I always wanted to do that. I love kids. Skillz is distracted by something.
JESSE: I don't think it's over.
SKILLZ: What? Her butt? No, it will never be over. It goes on forever. It's like space. So great.
JESSE: No, Celeste and I. I think she's just confused and overwhelmed right now about everything. But she'll come around. She always does.
SKILLZ: Uh oh. It's been a while now. I think it's over, bro. It may be time to accept that and move on. Call that dime Veronica. Jesse looks uncomfortable.
JESSE: That was a one time thing, a couple months after Celeste and I broke up. Celeste does not know about that. And we will keep it that way.
SKILLZ: Didn't know that was a hit and run. Sounded like you liked her.
JESSE: Well, she's not Celeste. It's always been Celeste. I'm not ready to give up.
SKILLZ: Okay, but remember, you can't re- heat a souffle.
JESSE: Huh?
SKILLZ: Also, there's Bettys everywhere. It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind Celeste that you can pull wool. Make her sweat a little bit.
JESSE: It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go out with somebody. They reach the front of the line.
YOGURT GIRL: Do you know what you want?
JESSE: Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I don't want to start all over again. I want everything that I believed to have been true to be true. I also want a goji berry/green tea swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity Pebbles. Please.
SKILLZ: (to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go out on a date with my friend here.
YOGURT GIRL: Um, wait, where's your wife? You guys are here like everyday together.
JESSE: Well...we're separated.
YOGURT GIRL: Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay. I'll go.
BETH: It's so...grotesque.
CELESTE: But kind of beautiful. In a grotesque way.
BETH: Ugh, let's keep moving. Too many feelings. Celeste and Beth wander to the wall and stare at a Damien Hirst collage.
CELESTE: Beth, the reality is I love Jesse dearly but he doesn't have a checking account. Or dress shoes. The father of my children will have a car. But...Jesse will always be my best friend.
BETH: Okay fine. I've said my peace. It's your life. But I definitely don't think he should be living in your guest house. I think you're kind of breaking his heart. Slowly.
CELESTE: Jesse is fine.
BETH: Can I show you something?
CELESTE: Sure. Beth suddenly pulls Celeste into a corner. With no art.
BETH: Okay. Look. She points to her neck.
CELESTE: What am I looking at?
BETH: It's a hair. On my NECK.
CELESTE: Ewww. Will you get that thing lasered off, please? What the fuck?
BETH: I can't because it will pop up somewhere else where I can't keep my eye on it.
CELESTE: Are you serious? That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. It's not a turnip.
BETH: Trust me, I know my body. It's a cruel land mine.
CELESTE: Okay, well at least pluck it for Chrissake.
BETH: I should, at least before my wedding, right?
CELESTE: What is wrong with you? Celeste grabs the hair and pulls it out.
BETH: (in pain) AHHHHHHHHHH! A security guard heads for them.
CELESTE: Sorry sir, my friend has a really strong emotional reaction to modern art.
BETH: That was fucking rude.
CELESTE: Had to be done.
CELESTE: Hey...you're not working? Are you watching the Olympics? Again? And crying? Again? Jesse blows his nose.
JESSE: Yeah.
CELESTE: God, you really love that, don't you?
JESSE: Matthias' wife died in a car accident last year.
CELESTE: Well, three years ago now but...
JESSE: And he dedicated his gold medal to her. The human spirit is...unbreakable. Jesse is choked up, can barely speak.
CELESTE: Uh huh. Hey, did you finish that artwork for the Pop Form website?
JESSE: Huh? Oh yeah, I'm almost done. I'm working on it. I think you'll really like it.
CELESTE: I'll like it more when I have it because I needed it yesterday, so...
JESSE: Celeste, can you sit down for a minute? I have something really important to tell you.
CELESTE: Oh. Okay. Does it have something to do with the work you owe me? Celeste sits. Jesse sits next to her. Again, he has tears in his eyes.
JESSE: I don't know how to tell you this but...I have a date tonight. I'm gonna start dating. People.
CELESTE: A date? Really? That is so great.
JESSE: It is? You don't...
CELESTE: Yeah! Don't cry. Good for you, Jess.
JESSE: That doesn't bother you? Wow, okay. Well, it's actually the Yogurt Girl. From Yoga Yurt?
CELESTE: Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. She's cute! But so young, right?
JESSE: Super young. Her body is all-time.
CELESTE: Okay, no need for that. But this is good! You gotta crawl before you walk. I mean she's definitely not gonna be wifey number two, right? Ha.
JESSE: Well, it's just a date. She hugs him in an unconsciously patronizing way.
CELESTE: Big move. I'm proud of you. Jesse looks confused and slightly hurt.
JESSE: Thanks?
CELESTE: Can I get up now?
JESSE: Huh? Yeah, sure. Celeste gets up and is immediately fixated by his hair.
CELESTE: No, nothing. Are you gonna wear your hair like that?
JESSE: What? Oh. I don't know, is it weird?
CELESTE: Not weird, just different from how it looks best. She walks over and starts messing with his hair as he continues.
JESSE: Anyway, this is what we're doing right? We're getting divorced and we're friends and we're also dating people? That's what we're doing? She is satisfied with her work. She steps back.
CELESTE: There. Better. You'll be great. You don't even need to be great. Just be you. Take her somewhere nice.
JESSE: Okay mom.
CELESTE: Call me after?
YOGURT GIRL: So I was in school but then I dropped out because I really wanted to work in fashion but it's really hard to find a paid internship? So I went back to school and now I work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm really looking to make money doing something I love? But I'm sure the universe is looking out for me and when the time is right, the right thing will come along, you know?
CELESTE: Where is it? They told me it would be in new releases...
BETH: Well you probably shouldn't steal it. Even if it is yours. Celeste marches to the Oprah's Book Club table and swiftly replaces the center display book with her own.
CELESTE: There.
BETH: But you don't have the "O" on your cover, you can't do that!
CELESTE: Yes I can. Jesse and Tucker arrive and see the book.
JESSE: There you guys are...you're on Oprah's Book List?? That's so great! Something catches Celeste's eye.
CELESTE: Some people are browsing my book. Guys, come with me to eavesdrop ... Celeste, Tucker and Beth head off. Then:
JESSE: Veronica?
VERONICA: Yeah, hey. How are you?
JESSE: Good, good. You look great.
VERONICA: Thanks, you too. How's your clothes pin collage going?
JESSE: Slowly, but it's going.
VERONICA: Well, don't give up. Your work is really unique. And beautiful. I hope that doesn't sound...
JESSE: No, that's means a lot, thank you. They looks at each other for a beat.
VERONICA: I had a lot of fun too. There is silence, as Beth, Celeste and Tucker arrive and stare at her. Who is this creature??
JESSE: Oh sorry, Veronica, this is Beth and Tucker and Celeste. Veronica notices Celeste's name on the book.
VERONICA: Oh, this is your book? I read an excerpt online, it's really compelling.
CELESTE: Wow, thank you. That is so nice.
VERONICA: Well, nice to see you.
JESSE: Oh you too. Take care. She turns and leaves.
CELESTE: What is that?
JESSE: That was uh...Veronica.
CELESTE: Story?
JESSE: No story. Just this girl I met a while ago.
CELESTE: Huh. She's pretty. Celeste changes focus again and turns to a Border's employee to loudly and unconvincingly act out "Interested Reader" for other shoppers to hear.
SKILLZ: Oh baby youuuuuuuu, you got what I neeeeeed...
JESSE: And you say he's just a friend, and you say he's just a friend....
JESSE SKILLZ: Oh baby youuuuu.... Oh baby youuuuu.... Jesse's iPhone rings. A very flirty picture of Celeste comes up.
SKILLZ: No, no, no. Ignore for sure.
JESSE: Uh, I just need to...(picks up) Hey.
SKILLZ: (whispering) Nooooo!
JESSE: (talking to Celeste) Uh huh. Okay. Okay. No, I'm not busy. (hangs up) Uh, I'm gonna go home.
SKILLS: Come on, after the show it's the after party.
JESSE: There's an Ikea dresser that she needs me to "build." Skillz takes this in. He is impressed.
SKILLZ: Huh. Really, cowboy? Are you guys...
JESSE: I told you pal, I know what I'm know I'm doing. She just needed time.
CELESTE: I'm in here! Fuck Sweden!
JESSE: Oh baby youuuuu....
CELESTE: It was definitely easier to build the Brooklyn Bridge, I think.
JESSE: Well, how hard can it be? It's a dresser, right?
JESSE: Fuck me!!! Do you think they intentionally pick a random piece of furniture to make totally unbuildable, just to fuck with you??!
CELESTE: Thank you!
JESSE: Wait. I got it.
CELESTE: Perfect.
JESSE: Fucking lay-up. We reveal that they are looking at a small, mangled, Swedish robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling that should have been the dresser. They both slide to the floor in satisfaction. They look at their "artwork." They laugh; they are pretty drunk.
CELESTE: Ruscha meets Basquiat...
JESSE: ...meets Serra meets Corky from "Life Goes On."
CELESTE: Yeah. He's a vegan, you know.
JESSE: Cherish. That is so cute. They share a laugh.
CELESTE: You're cute. Celeste looks at him. She kisses him. He kisses back. It gets hotter. They fall back.
CELESTE: Hey. What are you doing?
JESSE: I love you. Celeste does not respond. She pops up out of bed.
CELESTE: Okay...
JESSE: We should talk about this.
CELESTE: Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a bad idea. I'm sorry.
JESSE: Don't be sorry. It was nice. And I love you.
CELESTE: Oh Jess, I don't...come on, we were drunk, and the dresser and I thought...you're dating other people!
JESSE: Only to...god, I'm so stupid. He realizes how pathetic it sounds.
CELESTE: Oh no, I thought...
JESSE: You thought what?
CELESTE: Well, clearly I wasn't thinking. Or I wouldn't have let it happen. Come on Jess, we're not getting back together, you didn't think... Celeste realizes he did think...Jesse is crushed. He gets up and leaves. He turns.
JESSE: You know, there's a guy that you can call, from Ikea, that will build you're dresser. You should call him. Hell, he'll probably fuck you too. I'm a fucking idiot.
CELESTE: Jess! No, I didn't..Jess! Celeste collapses back in the bed.
PAUL: Hello.
CELESTE: What?
PAUL: I said hello.
CELESTE: Oh. Hi. Celeste keeps walking briskly. PAUL, 35, short but handsome, tries to keep up with her.
PAUL: (a little too loud) How was your practice?
CELESTE: My practice?? It was...wait, what?...it was fine. (who is this guy?)
PAUL: I see you in class a lot. You have a great warrior two. Are you single? Celeste puts on her shoes.
CELESTE: Are you really doing this right now? You're really doing this right now. Paul realizes that his game is wack. Oh well.
PAUL: Yeah, I can't believe it either. I don't do this, it's just happening, I can't stop...it...what do you do?
CELESTE: Just gonna jump right in there. Wow, Captain Conversation.
PAUL: Paul. Here's my card.
CELESTE: You bring cards to yoga??
PAUL: Look, you're really pretty. I'm not good at this. Help. He smiles nervously.
CELESTE: (she looks at the card.) A financial analyst. Cool.
PAUL: Not really. It's not cool. Did you ever tell me what you did for a living?
CELESTE: No, no I didn't. There is a pause in conversation. Celeste continues to put her shoes on.
PAUL: Well, will you? I'd love to know.
CELESTE: I'm a trend forecaster. I forecast trends. Paul scoffs at the notion that this is a real career.
PAUL: Trend forecaster. Really? Huh. They have reached the parking lot. Celeste turns to him with purpose.
CELESTE: You traded in your Porsche for an Audi because the economy is tanking and you're afraid you'll lose your job soon. You bought a Samsung cell phone because you think it makes you seem more "business-oriented," unlike the iPhone which is for teenage girls. You go to yoga because you went to a sub Ivy League college, spent the last ten years working long weeks and drinking all weekend and you feel like it's time to do something "spiritual." Nice to meet you, (looks at the card) Paul. Celeste walks away. Paul remains where he is, flummoxed.
CELESTE: No, just make sure the San Fran focus group has a little more diversity than last time. It was like a rave. Without drugs. Okay. She hangs up and pauses. Then dials again.
VERONICA: I'm glad you called. Jesse smiles big.
CELESTE: Hey. It's me. Again. I miss you. Anyway, call me. Okay. Bye. She hangs up, takes a breath and then, to herself:
JESSE: (on the phone) Hey. You're back. I want to talk to you.
CELESTE: Yeah, I want to talk to you too. Where have you been?? It's been like two weeks. So much to lay down...like, did you know that pay- per-view porn is available in Cantonese?
JESSE: Really? Like subtitles or dubbed? Wait, actually, I'm really close to your house right now. Can I come by for a minute? It's....important.
JESSE: Okay. I have to tell you something.
CELESTE: Me too. Wait, you first. Are you gay?
JESSE: No, not gay. He takes a really deep breath.
CELESTE: (playfully) Oh no, did you go on another date?
JESSE: I'm having a baby.
CELESTE: I don't understand.
JESSE: I'm having a baby. Celeste is still busy, putting away groceries. She is half- listening.
CELESTE: What do you mean?
JESSE: I am having a baby. Celeste opens the pantry and puts away cereal.
CELESTE: With another person?
JESSE: Yes. With another person. Celeste takes out cold cuts from the bag and opens the fridge.
CELESTE: Um. What? Sorry, I'm confused. Wait, what? What the fuck? With whom?
JESSE: With Veronica.
CELESTE: Veronica?? What's a Veronica?
JESSE: You actually met her. That day at the book store.
CELESTE: Huh. But that's not even physically possible, that was two weeks ago.
JESSE: Well, the truth is, I slept with Veronica three months ago. It was just a one night thing. But she's pregnant. Celeste rearranges the fruit bowl.
CELESTE: Whoa. Okay. Shit. Didn't know about that. But that's not important right now. This is not good. Alright. Okay. You and I are gonna deal with this. We will, we'll just have to. What do you need me to do?
JESSE: No, you don't have to do anything.
CELESTE: But you don't even know this person, right?
JESSE: Yeah I know her. I mean, I'm getting to know her. And I really want to make it work with her.
CELESTE: Make it work?? You slept with her once! What are you talking about?
JESSE: I've actually been seeing her, well, a lot, recently. And I think I really like her.
CELESTE: So what you're saying is you got a girl pregnant and now you think you like her because she's pregnant? Or...I'm really confused.
JESSE: The universe is fucking weird, Celeste. I slept with her months ago and never called her after.
JESSE (CONTD): But we started hanging recently and she told me she was pregnant with my child. I know it's crazy, but it just feels...right. It was like this really weird retroactive gift. I don't know...
CELESTE: Can you excuse me for a second? Celeste gets up and walks slowly to the bathroom. She gently shuts the door. She looks around, not knowing what to do with herself. She focuses on a crack in the wall, she looks closer and then grabs the wall, thinking she might faint. She silently begins to sob, mouth open, eyes shut tight. She collapses on the wall. She is in silent turmoil. Is this really happening?
CELESTE: Sorry about that. I had something in my eye.
JESSE: Right. Look, I know this is so sudden. And so weird. I've been holding on to us, this idea of us, for so long. And I know you've wanted me to let go. So I'm sorry. You were right, we're friends. We will always be friends. And I need that now.
CELESTE: Of course.
JESSE: Thank you. Love you. Jesse gives Celeste a big, long hug.
CELESTE: It was nothing. She forces a smile.
SCOTT: Hello?
CELESTE: Hey. Celeste lets out a guffaw.
SCOTT: What are you doing?
CELESTE: I'm just following Diddy Twitty.
SCOTT: I don't...know what that means.
CELESTE: It's Sean Comb's Twitter page. There's also a singing competition on television. It's called American Idol? Keep up.
SCOTT: Okay saucy. You don't have to be so saucy.
CELESTE: Well, just part of our job, so...ready for breaking news? Jesse is having a baby with some girl. Crazy.
SCOTT: Whoa. Wow. Did you even know he was seeing someone?
CELESTE: It's this girl he slept with once a couple of months ago.
CELESTE (CONTD): And now he's "making it work" with her. Plane crash.
SCOTT: I don't know what to say. I am so sorry, Celeste.
CELESTE: No need, Scott, I'm totally fine.
SCOTT: Are you?
CELESTE: Look, I wasn't going to have his baby. So, good for him.
SCOTT: Well, it's great that you're so resolved about this but it's also okay for you to have feelings. It's very sudden. Celeste pauses to consider this.
CELESTE: Right. Well, let me see...mmmm, nope, I'm fine. I promise. Not in love with him anymore. It kind of makes it easier. Scott is not convinced. Celeste is still distracted by the computer.
SCOTT: Um...that's great. Who's the guy?
CELESTE: The yahoo who did Pop Form's taxes last quarter. He's been asking me out forever. Not the one, but it'll be nice to be admired.
SCOTT: I agree, go be admired. Who knows, you may actually even simulate human emotion.
CELESTE: Thank you. She hands the menu back to the waiter.
MAX: Well, actually I... Suddenly, Celeste catches a glimpse of Jesse, sitting at the bar, by himself, watching tv. She is not prepared for this.
CELESTE: OH MY GOD. My ex is here. Oh god, oh no, we just made eye contact. Maybe he didn't see me. Wait, he did. He's coming over. Oh god, this is so awkward.(to Max) You should probably leave.
MAX: Wait, what? I don't think...really?
CELESTE: Yeah, just go. Jesse is at the table.
JESSE: I just wanted to say hi. I'm Jesse.
CELESTE: Oh, this is Matt.
MAX: Max.
CELESTE: Mack.
MAX: Max.
JESSE: Nice to meet you, Max.
CELESTE: We're just here. Just eating. It's a date. I'm dating.
JESSE: Cool. The puttanesca special is the thing to get.
MAX: Good to know. I ordered that. A moment of awkward silences passes.
CELESTE: Who are you here with?
JESSE: Oh, just here alone. Watching the Lakers.
MAX: Kobe-LeBron tonight, right?
JESSE: Yes. Epic.
MAX: So psyched I tivo'ed it.
JESSE: Nice to meet you, man. Good to see you, C.
MAX CELESTE: You too. You too.
MAX: He's cool.
CELESTE: Uh huh. Celeste immediately scarfs down her salad which has just arrived. She's quiet.
MAX: How was that? Are you okay?
CELESTE: I'm fine! Celeste stares at Jesse at the bar.
MAX: What?
CELESTE: Nothing. Do you like bread?
MAX: Bread? Um, yeah, I like bread.
CELESTE: Cool, cool. Silence, once again.
CELESTE: This was great! I'm free next Wednesday? Sushi?
MAX: Um, I don't think we should.
CELESTE: Oh, because of mercury poisoning? I think that's a myth. I go to this acupuncturist that...
MAX: No, I think you may need some time. To get over, you know, your divorce. It took me a long time to start dating after mine.
CELESTE: Thank you for your concern but I'm just fine. I guess you're just not a match for me.
MAX: Well, have a good night. Good luck. Max gets in his car and is gone. Celeste stands there, confused and alone. She shakes him off.
CELESTE: (sotto) Whatever.
CELESTE: Hi honey!
BETH: Hi, wow, you are really out of breath. Did you fucking run here?? From West Hollywood??
CELESTE: Yeah I ran. Just started. It's really fun.
BETH: You're soaking wet. Isn't that like 12 miles??
CELESTE: 13.5 actually. I was just clearing my head, you know, keeping the endorphins up.
BETH: Do you...want to sit down?
CELESTE: Oh, okay! Wow, is this it? It's so nice. Celeste flops on the couch full prostrate. A saleswoman approaches.
SALESWOMAN: I'm so sorry but that's a one-of-a- kind piece that was handwoven by a tribe of Afghani women. So if you could maybe just sit over there? The saleswoman points to a metal industrial, uncomfortable looking chair.
CELESTE: Right. Sorry. Totally.
BETH: Wow, you are a sweat tsunami.
CELESTE: You should get it. It's really pretty. Celeste gets up and there is an outline of Celeste's entire body in sunblock and sweat. They look at the wreckage.
BETH: Uh boy.
CELESTE: Don't worry. I know people who can get that out. Easily.
BETH: Okay. I guess I'm getting it.
CELESTE: The Riley account is a handful. I've been sooooo swamped.
BETH: It's great you're staying busy...
CELESTE: (about the couch) If it doesn't come out, I can have it reupholstered.
BETH: Thanks. How's dating?
SALESWOMAN: Sorry, can I get your card?
BETH: Here you go.
CELESTE: Great. Dating's really great.
BETH: Have you talked to Jesse?
CELESTE: No, but I actually ran into him last night. I think he's getting a little fat.
BETH: I think he's been looking pretty fit lately. (to the saleswoman) Can I get a rush delivery on that?
CELESTE: So you've seen Jesse?
BETH: ...Yeah, I have.
CELESTE: Huh. Have you hung out with...
BETH: Veronica?
CELESTE: Yeah.
BETH: Yes. I have. Silence.
SALESWOMAN: So, my first available delivery is Monday afternoon. Does that work for you?
BETH: Yeah, that's fine. If you can you just call my cell...
CELESTE: She's dumb, right?
BETH: Huh? Oh no, not dumb. Simple.
CELESTE: Simple means dumb.
BETH: No, actually, simple in a really elegant way.
CELESTE: Elegant?? The saleswoman senses awkwardness.
SALESWOMAN: Okay, so you're all set then.
CELESTE: Elegant??
BETH: Thanks a lot. (to Celeste) They head for the exit.
CELESTE: I am, I just didn't realize that Monica was "elegant."
BETH: Veronica. And you know what? You would probably really like her. Beth studies Celeste for a moment.
CELESTE: Not one.
BETH: Please let me drive you home. I'm afraid you'll drown.
CELESTE: Sure. I have a date tonight so I should probably shower before then. Beth looks at a sopping Celeste.
BETH: Yes. Shower. Who's the date?
CELESTE: Rupert Bates.
BETH: Rupert Bates? The Gap model?? Oh my god, he's so hot but he's like 15.
CELESTE: 22. Skillz set me up. He's about to be a huge star. He's filming "20,000 B.C.?" It's the prequel to
BETH: Fuck, I LOVED that movie.
SALESWOMAN: I loved that movie too! It really spoke to me.
CUT TO:: Celeste,on the couch, looking slightly mortified. She smiles tepidly at him.
CELESTE: That was so...good.
RUPERT: I wrote that for my mum.
CELESTE: Lucky lady. So how do you know Skillz?
RUPERT: He provides me with the happy smoky green treats.
CELESTE: (sotto) Ew. Celeste cringes. What a dork. Rupert slides next to Celeste and is all of a sudden right in her face. He touches her hair. He kisses her, deeply. He pulls away and takes her in.
RUPERT: Hello, Special One.
CELESTE: Oh...hi. Oh god. (whispers) Oh no, no, no I gotta go.
RILEY: Ugh. My hair is so dry. It looks like straw. Savannah quickly pops a pill. Then offers one to Riley.
SAVANNAH: Here. Do you want an Adderall?
RILEY: No, that shit makes me feel like a robot. Speaking of robot, who the hell designed this place? It's like Spock and his eyebrows are about to walk around the corner. Celeste takes this opportunity to flush and come out of the stall.
CELESTE: Hi Riley, I'm Celeste, I'm a partner at Pop Form.
RILEY: Hey. Wow, you're pretty. Riley looks closer at her skin and picks at it.
SAVANNAH: Too much sugar? Coffee? Alcohol?
RILEY: Ugh, maybe it's my skin regime.
CELESTE: Um...it's actually regimen?
RILEY: Sorry?
CELESTE: Regime is a system of government. It's a "skin regimen." Riley and Savannah glare at Celeste.
RILEY: Thanks, Scrabble. Nice to meet you. They leave.
CELESTE: Charming.
SCOTT: Celeste has some ideas for the logo which are looking really great. He looks to Celeste who is not paying attention. She is busy learning that she was right and Riley was wrong. Celeste looks up and shoots a patronizing smile at Riley. Riley catches her and looks away uncomfortably.
CELESTE: Right. Yes. Sorry. So we are going for an industrial feel with the artwork...
SCOTT: Hello, Special One.
CELESTE: Uh, you got my IM.
SCOTT: Sounds so awful.
CELESTE: Where are the guys who don't wear makeup for a living? And maybe a little intellect? A little intellect wouldn't hurt anybody. Scott has an idea.
SCOTT: Wait, wait. You've never met Nick, right? Nick Moran?
CELESTE: The photographer? You know him?
SCOTT: Yeah, we went to school together. This could be perfect.
CELESTE: (she sings, like she's in a musical) I'm uncomfortable with daaaaaating. I don't like any of iiiiiit.
SCOTT: (he sings back) Trust meeeee. You will liiiiike hiiiim. Also, I love cooo-ooock.
CELESTE: You really got to try a little harder to integrate the gayness, Scott.
CELESTE: So you pissed in your pants?
NICK: I waited seven hours. Three of them soaking in my own pee. But I finally got the shot of Ahmadinejad. He hands her a photograph.
CELESTE: Wow. That is incredible. I think he's smiling, maybe.
NICK: He is. I think the piss stain running down my jeans made him laugh.
CELESTE: Well, the world will think you're brilliant. No one will ever know but me.
NICK: I was nominated for a Pulitzer. I didn't win.
CELESTE: Well, the guy who won shit his pants, so... They laugh. They are connecting.
NICK: (looking at his watch) Oh my god, we missed our reservation. It was at 8:30. Should I call down and see if they can still take us?
CELESTE: How about room service?
NICK: Perfect.
CELESTE: That was really, really nice.
NICK: Um, yeah. So, what are you doing for the rest of your life?
CELESTE: Making out with you. They start to kiss again.
NICK: (whisper)What do you think I'm doing?
CELESTE: (whisper) Why are you doing that? Don't do that..It was going so well.
NICK: Shhhhh. Celeste pulls away slowly, shaking her head, "no." Nick keeps going. Eyes closed.
CELESTE: Almost where?? No! Celeste quickly grabs her stuff and gets the hell out of dodge.
NICK: Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhh! Nick recovers from his climax and looks around to realize she's gone.
CELESTE: Vegan Vittles.
CELESTE: No, I don't want to do a video chat. Yeah. Just tell her she needs to get to L.A. tomorrow. Okay. (she hangs up, now on the Blackberry) Sorry, one second, I just have to send this e-mail. Jesse sits there and wait for several seconds for her to finish her e-mail.
JESSE: Hi. What's up?
CELESTE: A lot. (to waitress) Can I get some coffee?
WAITRESS: We have yerba matte?
CELESTE: Um, green tea?
WAITRESS: We have decaf green tea.
CELESTE: Water's fine.
WAITRESS: K. Anything for you?
JESSE: I'll get the veganchilada with the cashew cheese sauce on the side. Oh can I look at the seaweed menu? She hands him a tiny piece of recycled paper.
CELESTE: Wow.
JESSE: How are you? You look great.
CELESTE: Thanks. She notices his feet.
JESSE: Oh yeah, they're vegan. Celeste could throw up.
CELESTE: You look good too.
JESSE: A lot of pilates.
CELESTE: Huh, I didn't know you did pilates.
JESSE: Yeah, well, Veronica's a dancer and has equipment at our house, so... There is an uncomfortable beat.
CELESTE: Um...work is great.
JESSE: Good.
CELESTE: My book is getting great reviews. Riley Banks is a new client which is huge. Things are going really well.
JESSE: Great. Long silence.
CELESTE: It's only weird if you think it's weird.
JESSE: Celeste, I never wanted to hurt you.
CELESTE: Thank you. You didn't. Glad we cleared that up.
JESSE: Look, I actually wanted to see you because...apparently there's some kind of hold up on your side with the divorce papers and Veronica's actually not a citizen so..
CELESTE: What? Where's she from?
JESSE: Uh, Belgium.
CELESTE: (sotto) Huh. Belgium. Elegant.
JESSE: What?
CELESTE: Nothing.
JESSE: Point is, we need to...get married. I'm sorry. I really need you to sign those papers.
CELESTE: Well, Jesse, I've been busy with work. Because some people work for a living. So I haven't really been focused on what I can do to help you get on with your new life.
JESSE: I'm sorry. I know.
CELESTE: What makes you think you are even suitable to be a dad?? You don't even know how to read the electric bill. How are you going to support yourself? Have you even thought this through?
JESSE: I guess I'll have to figure it out. Veronica is really supportive of my work.
CELESTE: Really? Really Jesse? I paid the rent for ten years. If that's not supportive, I don't know what is.
JESSE: That's true. And thank you. There is a long pause.
CELESTE: We never even talked about kids.
JESSE: You had reservations about having kids.
CELESTE: I had reservations about having kids with YOU.
JESSE: Well, ditto. I think Veronica will be a really good mother.
CELESTE: Low blow. Celeste gets up from the table. She collects her things.
RESTAURANT GUY: Um, yeah. I do.
CELESTE: Exactly. Get a real job. Celeste exits.
CELESTE: Jesse's a fucking vegan??
BETH: A vegan who's soon to have his work shown. At the Gagosian.
CELESTE: The Gagosian?? You're kidding. What, the fucking clothespin thing? When??
CELESTE (CONTD): Don't tell me actually...how did anybody even know about his art, he doesn't...I don't actually want to know...god, he's on fire right now. Breaking up with me was the best thing that ever happened to Jesse. I should break up with me.
BETH: Now, now. Someone else's success is not your demise, C.
CELESTE: Shut up. Unless it's Jesse's. Who are dressed as again?
BETH: Beiber.
CELESTE: Ooh, he just got a buzzcut.
BETH: Really? Fuck. When??
CELESTE: A couple hours ago. It was on Perez.
BETH: That's so sad. His hair was everything.
CELESTE: I need to fucking drink. Two large dudes, one dressed as Peter Pan, the other as Snow White walk by.
PETER PAN: We're doing Car Bombs in the kitchen. Wanna come?
BETH: Noooo.
SNOW WHITE: What are you?
CELESTE: What? Oh, White trash. Snow White is silent. Celeste points to her trash bag.
SNOW WHITE: (doesn't get it) Huh. Paul (from yoga) enters to grab some ice from the freezer. He is wearing a black shirt covered in mini cereal boxes with plastic knives through them. Celeste is mid-Car Bomb and wasted.
PAUL: Celeste?
CELESTE: Yoga?
PAUL: Yeah, I haven't seen you there for a while.
CELESTE: I've been running a lot. Keeps you in better shape.
PAUL: I can see that's important to you. (referring to the Car Bomb in her
FACE): Celeste is now drunk.
CELESTE: How's your practice? (waving her finger in his face, laughing)
PAUL: White trash?
CELESTE: Uh huh. What are you?
PAUL: Um, a cereal killer, obviously.
CELESTE: You're "punny."
PAUL: By the way, you were right.
CELESTE: About what?
PAUL: About me. All of it, the car, the phone, the yoga. Except that I did go to an Ivy League school. Cornell.
CELESTE: Barely an Ivy.
PAUL: I know.
CELESTE: Do you smoke?
PAUL: At parties.
CELESTE: Me too. Let's go.
PAUL: (Playful) Sorry about that day at the gym. I feel really open after yoga...
CELESTE: Shhhh. Don't say open. Your costume's great. Don't ruin it.
PAUL: I'm kidding. I only go to yoga to meet girls. Speaking of, what's the deal with you and me? Is this happening? Or...
CELESTE: My husband of six years wants a divorce so he can marry the woman who's carrying his child. That's the deal with you and me.
PAUL: I'm sorry, that sounds tough.
CELESTE: He's having a baby with a girl he barely knows. He's so lost. He's just going about it all...wrong.
PAUL: And you're right. Now what?
CELESTE: What do you mean?
PAUL: Well do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?
CELESTE: Listen, Yoga, I don't WANT to be right, I AM right. People will let you down. I've accepted that fact, but unfortunately, most of the time, knowing that does keep you from being happy. But at least it's real.
PAUL: No one has ever given a more self- righteous monologue wearing only a trash bag. Except for maybe the homeless guy outside my dry cleaners. Beth and Tucker approach Celeste and Paul.
BETH: Time to go, drunky. They head off.
PAUL: (yells to Celeste) Call me!
CELESTE: Hey, it's Celeste. You know, I still have a bunch of your stuff in the office. You should probably grab it at some point. Okay. She hangs up. She makes a decision. She grabs a box and starts throwing everything and anything in it that belongs to Jesse.
VERONICA: You're going to be a really good dad.
JESSE: What? Why did you say that? Veronica studies Jesse's face.
VERONICA: I don't know, I just know it.
JESSE: No one's ever said that to me.
CELESTE: At least they recycle.
JESSE: This is...so weird but I just realized...what's your middle name? I don't even know it. They laugh a little.
VERONICA: It's um...Godelieve.
JESSE: Goldleaf?
VERONICA: No, Goldelieve. It means loved by the Gods. It's Dutch.
JESSE: Sweet. Mine's Mordechai.
VERONICA: What does it mean?
JESSE: Means I'm really Jewish. Veronica giggles. They're getting to know each other. It's awkward...but sweet.
CELESTE: Guitar Hero?? That's quite an extravagant purchase for a freelance writer and his "elegant" Belgian bride. All of a sudden, her diamond bracelet slips off her wrist and plunks to the bottom.
JESSE: Celeste? Celeste stands up slowly as if nothing is wrong. She is also holding Jesse's journal close to her chest.
CELESTE: Hey!
JESSE: What...are you doing?
CELESTE: I just... She looks around to make an excuse.
JESSE: But why were you in the trash can?
CELESTE: I lost something.
JESSE: In the trash can?
CELESTE: My bracelet. It was a whole thing. It's over now. Jesse and Veronica just stare at Celeste for a long beat.
JESSE: You've met Veronica, right?
CELESTE: Yes! Hi! Wow, you're so pregnant, right! I love your sweater.
VERONICA: Oh. Thanks! (beat) Are you bleeding?
CELESTE: What? Oh (she touches her cheek), yeah, I guess I am.
VERONICA: Let me get you something for that.
CELESTE: NO. No, don't. It's fine, just a little cut.
VERONICA: Are you sure? I'm so sorry about this.
CELESTE: No, I'm sorry. So sorry. Well, I'm late for things. Have a good afternight.
VERONICA: You sure you don't want to come in for a drink?
CELESTE: Nooooo, no. That's very nice but no. Great to see you guys! Okay. She starts to walk away with the journal.
JESSE: Is that mine?
CELESTE: Waht? Oh, yeah, that's weird. I don't know how...here you go. She laughs nervously and hands him his journal. Celeste walks to her car.
BETH: You told her you liked her sweater? What are you, twelve?
CELESTE: It was a disaster. But you should have seen the sweater. So great. Beth, am I losing my mind?
BETH: Maybe. No. Please no more trash- diving. Let's focus on you now.
CELESTE: This guys Paul keeps calling me but I don't know...
BETH: C, you never know. Just go out with him. It doesn't have to be perfect...
CELESTE: I met him at the gym. I'm not meeting my husband at the gym.
BETH: Just go. Nothing to lose.
CELESTE: So where do you live? We reveal that she is lying next to Paul, they are both about to get thai massages.
PAUL: Uh, I live in Westwood. In a condo.
CELESTE: Cool.
PAUL: You are gonna love this place. You've never felt so relaxed in your life. Cherry and Lucky enter, the masseuses. They all exchange quiet hellos and head nods. Cherry and Lucky get to work. Lucky takes Celeste's leg and pushes it all the way over her head, not the most comfortable position.
CELESTE: Ahhhhh.(responding to the stretch) Wow, this is a unique place to take a date.
PAUL: Yeah, I take all my dates here.
CELESTE: I feel special.
PAUL: You are. They all are. Celeste giggles. Paul takes a deep exhale as Cherry rams her elbow into his shoulderblade.
CELESTE: Not...that well. I've been on a real winning streak, so I thought I'd call you.
PAUL: You know what? I'm happy you did. At that moment, CRACK! Lucky has Celeste in a bear hug and it looks like she may have broken her back.
CELESTE: AHHHH! I don't know what your definition of relaxing is but...
PAUL: Just wait. Trust me, you need this right now.
CELESTE: Why would you take me to a place where Asian people beat you up? That was absolute torture.
PAUL: But how do you feel? Celeste takes a beat to see how she feels.
CELESTE: I feel great, actually.
PAUL: So shut up then.
CELESTE: Where are we going now?
PAUL: Don't try to control me. You need to let go. In yoga, we call it vairyaga. He strikes a reverse triangle yoga pose in the parking lot.
CELESTE: Oh my god, don't, with the yoga.
CELESTE: This place is...really cool.
PAUL: You sound surprised.
CELESTE: I am, Westwood condo.
PAUL: I'll get us beers. Celeste takes in the atmosphere for a moment. She is happy to be out. She takes her hair down, puts her hands through it, trying to look a little better.
CELESTE: Ohh!! Celeste is into it now. She dances around him, other people watch them. Paul pulls Celeste in close. Celeste kisses Paul quickly, to his surprise.
PAUL: What was that for?
CELESTE: Vairyaga, bro, let go. Not everything has to have a reason.
ECU OF: Jesse, Skillz and Tucker with their arms up, cheering loudly.
SKILLZ: Oooh...toe touch basket toss coming up...degree of difficulty 9. Gnarly.......nailed it! Way to go, Becky!!! Jesse is look at his iPhone. He is looking at "Veronica and Jesse Baby Registry"
JESSE: What the fuck is a Baby Bjorn?
SKILLZ: It's a very, very tiny Swedish man.
TUCKER: It's a baby carrier that allows your child to benefit from parental intimacy without the confinement of a stroller. Duh.
JESSE: Why do you know that.
TUCKER: Beth. We go to a lot of baby showers.
SKILLZ: I put a lot of babies in the ladies. A parent of a cheerleader looks at trio with disgust. Jesse is still going through the registry list.
JESSE: Birthing towels, breast pump, Diaper genie? Fuck, I'm definitely having a baby. (beat) How's Celeste?
SKILLZ: She's...oh-kay. I'm fine-tuning her cannibus levels right now, just trying to find the right balance.
JESSE: Celeste doesn't smoke pot.
SKILLZ: She does now. She loves it. Jesse takes this in. Tucker changes the subject.
TUCKER: How's Veronica? She's so sweet.
JESSE: Yeah, less sweet pregnant but it's probably just hormones.
TUCKER: But are you into it?
JESSE: Yeah, I really like her. She seems great. For someone that I don't really know that's having my baby. "California Love" by Tupac (or whatever song we clear) comes on and the cheerleaders start a routine.
SKILLZ: Skillz stands up and starts breaking it down. He's not that good. Committed though. Jesse and Tucker continue to talk.
TUCKER: Are you scared?
JESSE: A little. Yes.
TUCKER: That's great. You should be. Just keep saying "yes." I'm really proud of you.
SKILLZ: She's like my top client now.
SKILLZ: Step out of the shadows and into the light. Are you crying?
CELESTE: I don't know what I'm doing. Dating is stupid and all of a sudden, my ex-husband bakes cakes? It's probably fucking gluten-free.
SKILLZ: What?
CELESTE: Nothing. Can you just roll a joint please? Skillz rolls a tight joint.
SKILLZ: Day by day, C. You need not trip. Celeste takes a drag.
CELESTE: What are they like together?
SKILLZ: Who? Jesse and Veronica?
CELESTE: Yeah.
SKILLZ: You know, they're oh-kay. Jesse is trying. It's not all rainbows and unicorns but...
CELESTE: So he's not happy.
SKILLZ: I didn't say that.
RILEY: I really like the logo.
CELESTE: Oh, thank you. Yeah, I think it's perfect.
RILEY: The I.M. Pei influence is pretty cool.
CELESTE: Wow, yeah, there is a little of that happening. I.M. Pei. Huh.
RILEY: Are you mocking me?
CELESTE: No, I'm just impressed that you know anything about architecture.
RILEY: Why, because I'm a pop star? You know what your thing is? Contempt prior to investigation.
CELESTE: I'm sorry?
RILEY: You're convinced you're smarter than everyone and THAT is your dark little prison.
CELESTE: Are you...?? How dare you... Riley smiles at Celeste, turns and leaves.
CELESTE: Dark little prison?? Bitch, what does she know. You know what's a dark little prison?? Having to wear midriffs for a living. What does she... Celeste is pulling into her driveway and notices...Jesse, sitting on her porch, smoking a cigarette.
JESSE: I started smoking again.
CELESTE: I can see that. That must go well with your pilates. Jesse looks sad and confused.
JESSE: I don't know what the rules are and I'm sure I'm breaking them but...god, I really miss you. Celeste tries to digest this.
CELESTE: You want to come in?
JESSE: Veronica is friends with the assistant gallerist there and he just really loved my stuff. I don't know, we'll see...
CELESTE: Jesse, that's great. I'm so happy for you.
JESSE: Yeah, yeah. It's great. Why doesn't he seem happier? He knocks back the rest of the drink.
CELESTE: Yeah. It's really nice to see you. He hugs her. Tight. They breathe together. They hug tighter. He pulls away, looks at her and kisses her for one second, very tenderly. She pulls away.
JESSE: Can we just...lay here for a bit? Celeste lays down and Jesse spoons behind her on the couch. They hold each other. There's a long drag of silence.
CELESTE: Yeah.
SCOTT: We have a massive problem on our hands. I need you in the office. Now.
CELESTE: I don't see anything.
SCOTT: (referring to the logo) It's a penis. And a butt.
CELESTE: What? Really? I don't see it.
SCOTT: You can't be serious. (points to the logo) There's the penis. And there's the penis going into the butt.
CELESTE: I think it's a stretch.
SCOTT: Well, it's not a stretch, Celeste. Scott puts a DVD into the DVD player. A reel of news clips comes on.
NEWSCASTER: ...teenagers were hoping to get a little bit of the teen star's fashion magic but instead, they have been suprised by what they saw.
PARENT: There's homosexual butt sex in the logo. Does Riley think we're that stupid?? I will never support gay marriage.
NEWSCASTER: Neither Riley nor a representative from Pop Form-the marketing company responsible-could be reached for comment. Scott turns it off.
SCOTT: Celeste, what did you do. How could be so careless? Celeste picks up the magnified logo again.
CELESTE: Oh. Oh my God. Oh wow, I totally see it now. WOW. Ha. Haha. Hahahahaaha. Celeste starts laughing uncontrollably. It's the funniest thing she's ever seen.
SCOTT: (fuming)Stop it. Stop laughing.
CELESTE: Scott, come on...
SCOTT: No, this is not a joke. Our company's in serious danger.
CELESTE: You're being dramatic.
SCOTT: Get out. I can't, with you, right now. I have to deal with this. I'll call you soon. Her laughter fades and she exits the conference room.
CELESTE: No...okay.
JESSE: Hey.
CELESTE: Hey.
JESSE: We gotta talk.
CELESTE: I know. That's why I called.
JESSE: Celeste...
CELESTE: Wait, let me say something. I don't know what happened last night. I don't know what's happening with your other situation. But I need to say this. For the record, I fucked up. I was cavalier about you. I took us for granted. And I know this may sound crazy but I'd be remiss if I didn't...if you were open to it...I think that I could do better. With you. With us. If there's a chance still...I'd like to know. Jesse can't even look at her.
JESSE: I'm sorry. I can't. Jesse gets up and leaves.
CELESTE: Hey! Jesse pauses for a moment. He turns.
JESSE: I don't know.
CELESTE: Oh no, I think you do.
JESSE: I made a mistake.
CELESTE: And?
JESSE: I shouldn't have come.
CELESTE: You're a fucking coward.
JESSE: I'm just trying to do the right thing with Veronica. I'm trying to change.
CELESTE: Well, you never changed for me. Jesse pauses.
JESSE: To be honest, you didn't really let me.
CELESTE: Wow. All I did was wait for you to grow up! I rooted for you, I fucking paid for everything, I did everything for you!
JESSE: Yeah, and I was never your equal. And you know what? I think you preferred it that way.
CELESTE: Right. Well, I know my success was never easy for you.
JESSE: And how do you define success, Celeste? Because you don't look very successful right now.
CELESTE: And you are? Pretending to be a father? Pretending to be an adult?
JESSE: What do you want?
CELESTE: I just want you to admit that you're wrong!
JESSE: Wrong? Wrong about what? What did you want me to do? Wait for you to meet someone first? Is that how you saw it happening? Celeste doesn't respond.
CELESTE: You know what, Jesse? You definitely will blow it. Jesse takes a beat. It stings.
JESSE: I feel really sorry for you. You might be alone forever.
CELESTE: Don't ever call me.
JESSE: Don't worry about it. Jesse walks away.
CELESTE: She's so sad.
SKILLZ: Is she? I don't think so.
CELESTE: No, she's sad. I can tell. I went to dance camp. We see Jennifer Grey elevated above Patrick Swayze, looking elated. Celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke.
SKILLZ: Shit'll get better.
CELESTE: Will it? You don't know that. Celeste grabs a handful of Cheetos from an economy-sized bag.
SKILLZ: J-Thunder? He's not doing anything to you. You wanted a divorce.
CELESTE: But I didn't want it like this.
SKILLZ: When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.
CELESTE: Huh?
SKILLZ: Oh. It's Victor Frankl.
CELESTE: Huh. Skillz gets up.
SKILLZ: I gotta go before Petco closes.
CELESTE: You have a pet?
SKILLZ: No, but I gotta get a toy for this girl's cat, you know, so she'll give up the kitty.
CELESTE: Can I come?
SKILLZ: No.
CELESTE: Will you bring me some Panda Express?
SKILLZ: No.
CELESTE: Do you think the Obamas are really in love?
SKILLZ: Yes. Enough questions. I'll pick you up at noon.
CELESTE: Noon?
SKILLZ: Beth and Tucker's pre-wedding BBQ?
CELESTE: Right, right.
SKILLZ: Hey, easy on the herb until then. That shit is powerful.
BETH: Hi honey, you remember Eileen from...
CELESTE: Do you have any more of that ranch dressing? It's the fucking booooooomb. Beth is embarrassed. Celeste gives Beth's mom, CAROL, 60, very large, a big sloppy hug.
BETH: Let's get you a soda. They get to the bar.
CELESTE: Do you guys have any tequila?
BARTENDER: We only have Mimosas and Shandys.
CELESTE: I'll have both please. Beth pulls Celeste away from the bar and brings her into the house and plops her down on the couch.
BETH: I'm going to recommend some quiet time for you right now.
CELESTE: Can I smoke?
BETH: No. Celeste starts weeping.
CELESTE: I don't want to be alone forever.
BETH: Not forever, honey. Just until you sober up. You'll be fine.
CELESTE: Okay then, I'll just go to the other side of the pool. I promise I won't make you look bad.
BETH: At least she's quiet now.
SKILLZ: I'm gonna get her out of here.
CELESTE: (on the phone) Hey Riley, it's Celeste. I just want to talk to you about this "error" in your logo. I'm so, so sorry, I will fix this...call me.
BETH: I just think it's corny to wear white two nights in a row. I want to rock a pattern, or maybe something in pastel... She turns to Celeste in a dress.
CELESTE: What the fuck does Riley Banks know.
BETH: Um...nothing. She's a tart.
CELESTE: Yeah dude! She's fucking moderately talented, blessed with a good face and has maybe 5 more years left of stardom. Who is she to tell ME what... Celeste looks at her blackberry and realizes she never hung up on Riley. Oh shit. She hangs up quick and throws the blackberry across the bed.
RILEY: I need to talk to you. Come to my house. Now.
CELESTE: Oh boy.
CELESTE: The thing is, I have been having a really hard time in my life, everything is sort of falling apart and when you said that thing about contempt and investigation, it just sort of hit a nerve and...
RILEY: Just, shut up for a minute. Riley is in tears.
CELESTE: Oh. God, I'm sorry. I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.
RILEY: Nobody knew. He didn't want anybody to know. Fucking ass hole. And now, my career might be over because you put a penis in my logo. Thank you for that. Riley is clearly destroyed.
CELESTE: So you called the smartest person you know. Riley smiles through her tears.
RILEY: Are you crying? Celeste turns off the television.
CELESTE: Oh, yeah, this just reminds me of someone.
RILEY: A guy?
CELESTE: Yeah. A guy.
RILEY: You miss him?
CELESTE: Yeah, I do.
RILEY: They all fucking suck.
CELESTE: Kind of.
RILEY: So it never gets better?
CELESTE: No, it doesn't. But you do. You're gonna be fine.
CELESTE: Hi...I know I won't...no I'm on the road already! Near...Bakersfield? Of course I'll be there...love you too. She hangs up and was clearly lying. She must do something. Something she does not want to do. She looks at the stoic woman in front of her.
PRIEST: I now pronounce you husband and wife. Tucker and Beth kiss. Everybody explodes in applause. We see Celeste in the audience, clapping. She looks beat down and tired.
GIRL #1: She pursued her love of Spanish men, but missed her Tucker, more than just as a friend.
GIRL #2: And our princess returned home to her loving prince, and they've been together ever since.
GIRL #2: And now we're gonna hear from Celeste, Beth's best friend in the world.
CELESTE: Thank you. Thanks a lot, girls, that was so...wow. There are no words. Well, this is gonna sound bad but I actually forgot that I was speaking tonight. Beth looks at her, frozen.
JESSE: I know this may not the best time to talk about this...but...at some point, we will have to talk about Tucker's dance moves. INSERT of Tucker dancing on the dance floor. It's unexplainable. It's shocking how terrible it is.
CELESTE: He is so special. Not as special as that poem. That those girls did?
JESSE CELESTE: Wow. Wow.
JESSE: Your speech was really...beautiful. Thank you.
CELESTE: I meant it.
JESSE: I know.
CELESTE: You know what else is beautiful? Celeste picks up a baby gerkin from her plate and starts to jerk it off, as she and Jesse did earlier and as they have done many times.
JESSE: Aw yeah! Fuck! Jesse and Celeste are in hysterics. Just then, Veronica arrives.
VERONICA: Jesse?
JESSE: Hey. Celeste and Jesse stop like two children who just got caught.
VERONICA: What are you doing?
JESSE: What? Nothing. We're just... He looks at Celeste for cover. She is giddy, wasted and happy to explain.
CELESTE: Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where we find the littlest thing that resembles a penis and we just, you know...
VERONICA: I don't get it. Celeste and Jesse stop.
CELESTE: It's stupid. Veronica is looking at Celete's food.
VERONICA: Oh, the foods out. (to Celeste) See you on the dance floor? Watch out for Tucker though. They leave Celeste, standing alone, smiling. She bites into the carrot.
PAUL: (keeping score on a notepad) So, that's 38 points plus 50 bonus points for using all my tiles so...
CELESTE: Wait, wait, wait. I think I may have to challenge. Zooecia?? That's not a word, that's my hoochie cousin's name!
PAUL: Are you challenging or not?
CELESTE: Yes, I definitely am.
PAUL: Well, I will tell you that Zooecia is a sac secreted by a compound organism but here you go. (he hands her the Scrabble dictionary) Look for yourself. Celeste finds the word, reads the definition and silently accepts defeat.
CELESTE: I've never lost a game of Scrabble in my life.
PAUL: Well, nothing lasts forever.
PAUL: I'm so sorry I beat you in Scrabble.
CELESTE: No you're not.
PAUL: You're right, I'm not. The making out gets a little hotter. Celeste is aggressive.
CELESTE: Will you get a condom?
PAUL: Uh...I don't think we should...
CELESTE: No, you're using a condom.
PAUL: No, I don't think we should sleep together. Celeste pulls away from him.
CELESTE: What?
PAUL: I just...I don't know.
CELESTE: Are you not into it?
PAUL: No, no believe me, I'm into it.
CELESTE: Then, what's the deal?
PAUL: I really like you.
CELESTE: Right, I'm confused...why not sleep with me then?
PAUL: Because I think I might really like you.
CELESTE: Oh. (further realizing) Oh. Okay. Well, I like you too. Celeste looks distant.
RILEY: Celeste looks around at lots of men, grinding each other with whistles in their mouth and drinks in their hands.
RILEY: Celeste just looks at her like, "Oh you poor, sheltered Disney princess. Are you serious?"
RILEY: Still nothing from Riley.
CELESTE: Riley looks around and takes it in. Aha, right. Celeste looks out amongst the crowd. Just then, two beefy, waxed, tanned, well-groomed gay men walk up to Celeste.
GAY MAN: Excuse me, can you please tell your friend Riley that we worship her??
GAY MAN #2: OMG, she's so pretty!
CELESTE: Sure... Celeste notices that they are both wearing the Riley Banks t- shirts, made for pre-teens, with the cock-in-the-butt mistake in the logo. She points at it.
GAY MAN #2: A dick in a butt? Yeahhh!
GAY MAN: It's amazing. All of our friends are rocking it. It's like the gay Izod. The gay man points to a group of his friends on the dance floor, ALL wearing Riley Banks gear, some of them have even made their own t-shirts with the cock in the butt logo magnified.
CELESTE: Wow, so, what, you just buy the biggest size they make?
GAY MAN: How dare you, I'm a size 10 in tween. I have a slight frame. They walk away, offended. Celeste turns to Riley. She is being adored by gay men.
RILEY: Celeste has a big idea.
CELESTE: Tweens don't want her anymore. But the gays do! Ten percent of Americans are gay, Scott. You're gay, start thinking gay. Gay Izod. She could be Lady Gaga by the end of the year. Huge market.
SCOTT: Wow, you might have just turned the cock in the butt around.
CELESTE: We WILL make the cock in the butt work for us. The cock in the butt will be huge! Just then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear her dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self- consciously.
SALESMAN: So, it comes with directions and it's actually really easy to assemble.
CELESTE: Look, you do not know me. I do not want to assemble. Trust me, you do not want me to assemble. Bad things happen. Could I just take the floor model? I'll hook you up.
SALESMAN: Lemme go ask my manager.
CELESTE: Thanks, dude. Celeste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart filled with baby stuff. She approaches her.
VERONICA: Of course, yeah, hi! What are you doing?
CELESTE: Oh, I'm getting a dresser. You?
VERONICA: Oh, you know getting...
CELESTE: She is? Celeste swallows this.
VERONICA: Very. And so helpful right now.
CELESTE: Of course. (laughs nervously) Well, looks like you're really organized.
VERONICA: Organized, terrified.
CELESTE: You'll do great.
VERONICA: Thanks. I hope so. They share an awkward moment.
CELESTE: No, don't. Really. There's nothing to apologize for. I'm the one who's sorry. I mean, I dug through your trash. Celeste laughs.
VERONICA: Look, I don't blame you. For anything. This has all been so weird. Everything happened really fast.
CELESTE: Yeah, it did. But everything will work out. I know it. Jesse's book is coming out...
VERONICA: He's so talented.
CELESTE: Yeah, he is. An awkward silence.
VERONICA: You too. They both steer their carts towards each other in opposite directions but bump right into each other.
CELESTE: Oh sorry!
VERONICA: Oh, it's okay! Bye again.
PAUL: Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be...oh God give me a reason, I'm down on bended knee..ooohohhh ooooh
CELESTE: Ooohh ohhh. Til you come back to me..
PAUL: I'm down on bended knee hee hee hee. They finish with a huge applause for themselves and toast with beers.
CELESTE: No, we ARE really good.
PAUL: Aw shit!
CELESTE: Get ready. You're first.
PAUL: Baby when I met you, there was peace on earth, I set out get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside. Soft inside? What the fuck?
CELESTE: Shhh come on. Focus.
PAUL: You do something to me, that I can't explain, hold me closer, and I feel no pain. Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication. Celeste and Paul sing in harmony.
CELESTE PAUL: Honest love, we feel, needs Honest love, we feel, needs conversation. And we ride it conversation. And we ride it it together, uh huh... it together, uh huh... Celeste slowly drops her mike. Paul is still singing.
CELESTE: (quietly) I can't.
PAUL: What? Come on, we're so good together. Islands in the stream, that is what we are. Get in there!! This is my favorite part!
CELESTE: No. I can't.
PAUL: I know I'm pitchy but I'm finding it. Sail away with me...
CELESTE: No. This. Us. I'm sorry. Paul slowly drops his mike.
PAUL: What do you mean?
CELESTE: I just...can't.
PAUL: Are you serious? Oh no. Why? He sits down on the couch. The music is still playing in the background.
CELESTE: I think I need to be alone? I'm not ready. I'm having fun and I feel like I'm beginning to like you and I just don't think I'm ready for that.
PAUL: What? Really? Celeste doesn't say anything.
CELESTE: I'm so sorry. You are so...great. But I'm getting divorced.
PAUL: Celeste, I know.
CELESTE: I think I need to go through this alone.
PAUL: Yeah. Yeah, okay. I respect that. Live by will, not by force.
CELESTE: What?
PAUL: You're only ready when you're ready, you know? Don't force it. It's just some yoga shit.
CELESTE: Thanks.
PAUL: But I do like you. I like you a lot. And when you are ready, if you're ready, call me.
CELESTE'S LAWYER: Sign here. And here. And here. Celeste looks up, makes eye contact with Jesse and smiles uncomfortably.
CELESTE: I like that tie.
JESSE: Oh, thank you.
CELESTE'S LAWYER: One more here.
CELESTE: Is it made out of organic mung beans? Jesse nods and chuckles.
JESSE: No, I actually found it digging through your trash.
CELESTE: Ohhh, I see. All right. They've broken the tension. But it's still silent. Then Jesse chortles. It sounds like a baby pig. It makes Celeste laugh.
JESSE: So...we're divorced! They high five. What are you supposed to do when you get divorced.
CELESTE: We did it.
JESSE: You wanna walk for a couple minutes?
CELESTE: Sure.
CELESTE: These are beautiful.
JESSE: I thought you hated them.
CELESTE: Yeah, well, I've never seen them at night. Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in. He looks pretty sad.
JESSE: I'm just feeling like maybe you were right. I am a fuck up. I don't know what I'm doing. My girlfriend left. There is a long pause.
CELESTE: What? Veronica? Left where?
JESSE: Left me. She wanted me to tell her everything was gonna be okay and I couldn't. I don't know why but I just...couldn't. She wants to go back to Brussels. Another monumental pause. Jesse's eyes start tearing up.
CELESTE: Hey...don't do that.
JESSE: Do what?
CELESTE: You are not a loser. You never were. You took a chance. I admire that and I believe in you.
JESSE: You do?
CELESTE: I do. And I want to thank you.
JESSE: For what?
CELESTE: For never being the person I wanted you to be.
JESSE: Oh, you're welcome.
CELESTE: Go get her.
JESSE: But I don't know if everything is gonna be all right.
CELESTE: Well, who does? Do you love her? Jesse looks at Celeste.
JESSE: I do.
CELESTE: Then it's worth fighting for.
JESSE: Okay. Okay. Celeste smiles with tears in her eyes.
CELESTE: God, I finally understand why you fucking cry all the time. Shit is emotional. They share a laugh. Then, they sit in silence for a beat.
JESSE: Me too.
CELESTE: So...I guess we were right.
JESSE: Huh? Celeste makes the "C and J" hand gesture from the high school photo in the opening montage. Jesse makes it back. They smile.
CELESTE: I love you too.
CELESTE: Hey. So, you're probably giving your card to some girl in yoga right now. But if that doesn't work out for you...I think I may be ready. To beat you in Scrabble.
CELESTE: Excuse me, sir? The young man turns around. Celeste realizes she's no longer this person. She restrains herself.
YOUNG MAN: Hey, I'm sorry for cutting. My dog's in the car and he's really thirsty. So, thanks.
CELESTE: No problem. She smiles again. The world feels bigger now.
