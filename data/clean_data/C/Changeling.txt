CHANGELING: A True Story
BLACK SCREEN: On which appears:
CHRISTINE: Walter.time for school, honey.
WALTER: Just ten more minutes
CHRISTINE: Sorry, champ.
WALTER: It's cereal, it's supposed to be
CHRISTINE: We're here, sweetie. Come on.
CHRISTINE: Okay Sandy, what's the prob
OPERATOR: You deal with this one, I'm not going near it.
CHRISTINE: Hello? Yes, this is the supervisor, ma'am, what can I Yes, I can see that you're on a party line, ma'am, what can I I know, it's unfortunate, but people sometimes do listen in on party lines. We hope to have private lines installed by Well, what's he doing when you're on the phone? Are you sure? Maybe there's a problem with the phone line. He could be asthmatic, or Oh. No, I.I've never heard of anything like that before either. Guess there's a first time for everything, right? No, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about people abusing the equipment or. themselves. I'm sorry. I
MR. HARRIS: Everything all right?
CHRISTINE: Fine, Mr. Harris.fine.just someone having a problem with a. with the connection.
MR. HARRIS: Tell them to take the plug and shove it in and out a few times, that'll usually do it.
CHRISTINE: Unfortunately that was part of the problem. If you'll excuse me..
CHRISTINE: Hey, sport.
WALTER: Hey, mom.
CHRISTINE: So how was school?
WALTER: Okay. We learned about dinosaurs, and I got in a fight with Billy What happened?
CHRISTINE: What happened?
WALTER: He hit me.
CHRISTINE: Did you hit him back? Good. Rule number one: Never start a fight, but always finish it. So why did he hit you?
WALTER: Because I hit him.
CHRISTINE: Wait.you hit him first?
WALTER: He said my dad ran off because he didn't like me.
CHRISTINE: Your dad never even had a chance to meet you.so how could he not like Then why did he leave?
WALTER: Then why did he leave?
CHRISTINE: Well, the same day you were born, something else arrived. It came in the mail, in a box just slightly bigger than you. You know what was in that box? Something called responsibility. Now, to some people, responsibility is fun, it's what you live your whole life for. Other people think it's the scariest thing in the world.
WALTER: So he ran away because he was scared of what was in the box?
CHRISTINE: That's dumb.
WALTER: That's dumb.
CHRISTINE: That's what I thought.
CHRISTINE: Walter, I decided a long time ago that I would always tell you the truth, that I would treat you like a grown-up. I can't expect you to respect me unless I respect you. I've never lied to you. Your father leaving had nothing to do with you, and everything to do with what was in the responsibility box.
WALTER: CHANGELING A True Story 6.
CHRISTINE: She takes his pinky in hers, gives a tug. He smiles.
CHRISTINE: First one to the corner store gets ice cream!
WALTER: Did I miss Amos and Andy?
CHRISTINE: I'm afraid so, sport. Come on now, time for bed.
WALTER: Are we still going to the movies Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie Chaplin playing down at Grauman's, and a new serial called The Mysterious Airman.
CHRISTINE: Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie Chaplin playing down at Grauman's, and a new serial called The Mysterious Airman.
WALTER: Who's that?
CHRISTINE: I don't know. Nobody does. That's what makes him so mysterious.
WALTER: Oh. Am I too heavy for you to carry?
CHRISTINE: Not for years yet, Walter. Not for
CHRISTINE: ( beat ) Oh, hello, Margaret. I'm fine, thanks. No, I was just ( beat ) You're kidding. When did she call in sick? ( checks watch ) What about Myrna? I know she could use the extra hours. Oh. No, it's just.I promised Walter I'd take him to the movies today. There has to be somebody else.. ( beat ) All right, I.guess we can do it tomorrow. I'll get there as soon as I can. But just until four, okay? See you in a bit.
CHRISTINE: There's a sandwich and milk in the icebox, and I've asked Mrs. Riley if her daughter can stop by in a couple of hours, just to
WALTER: I can take care of myself.
CHRISTINE: Of course you can. She's coming by to check on the house, not you.
CHRISTINE: Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies. Then we'll ride the Big Red down to Santa Monica and walk on the pier. How's that? That okay?
WALTER: I'm not afraid of the dark. I'm not afraid of anything.
CHRISTINE: I know you're not, honey. That's how I raised you. Be good. See you in a bit.
OPERATORS: We've got lines jammed from here to Ohio.he insists on talking to someone in charge.I've tried everything and the console's just dead.I need your signature here for a supply requisition..
CHRISTINE: All right, get me the Omaha routing station, see if we can put the calls through their switchers.and let's get that console running..
MR. HARRIS: Christine.good, I was hoping to catch you. I've been following your work reports, and I just want you to know that I'm very impressed.
MR. HARRIS: When I first suggested hiring female supervisors, my superiors weren't big on the idea. But you've held your own as well as any of our male supervisors, and
CHRISTINE: Thank you, Mr. Harris, but I
MR. HARRIS: Ben, please. Point is, we're looking for someone to take on a managerial position in our new Beverly Hills office. If you're interested I can
CHRISTINE: That's great, Mr. Harris, I really appreciate the vote of confidence.
MR. HARRIS: Good, good.so maybe we could
CHRISTINE: I'm sorry, but I really have to go. We'll talk on Monday. Good night!
CHRISTINE: Wait.wait.hold on, just a
CHRISTINE: Nothing. She goes into
CHRISTINE: INT. WALTER'S ROOM She opens the door to his room. No Walter.
CHRISTINE: Walter? Honey? Time to come in.
CHRISTINE: Susie honey, have you seen Walter?
GIRL: The girl continues away. Christine's concerned, but she hasn't hit the panic button, not yet. She crosses the street to
CHRISTINE: Mrs. Riley, I'm sorry to bother you at dinnertime, but I was wondering if Walter was here.
MRS. RILEY: No, I'm afraid not.
CHRISTINE: Do you know if Jamie was able to look in on him?
MRS. RILEY: Well, I mentioned it to her, but she was going to a dance with some of her friends.you know how teenagers are. Is everything all I'm sure it's fine, I just. Thank you, Mrs. Riley.
CHRISTINE: I'm sure it's fine, I just. Thank you, Mrs. Riley.
CHRISTINE: Walter.? Walter..
CHRISTINE: Yes, Operator, give me the police.
CHRISTINE: Yes, hello, my name is Christine Collins, I live at 210 North Avenue 23.I'm calling to report a missing child.it's my son, he..
CHRISTINE: I'm not sure.I just got home from work and.it could be since late this morning, it could be just an Have you checked around the Yes, of course, I
CHRISTINE: Yes, of course, I
CHRISTINE: No, he always stays around the house when it starts to get dark. Can you please send someone down here? I'm sorry, but our policy is that we don't dispatch units on missing child cases for twenty-four hours.
CHRISTINE: What? But that's
CHRISTINE: That's not Walter, he doesn't do
CHRISTINE: Please, I
REV. BRIEGLEB: Though she is not a member of our congregation, we pray for her today
REV. BRIEGLEB: Every day, new bodies show up along Mulholland, or in ditches, the work of Police Chief James Davis and his so-called "gun squad." Every day the needs of honest citizens are put second to greed and personal gain. Every day, the city sinks deeper into a cesspool of fear, intimidation and corruption. Once the City of Angels, Los Angeles is now a place where our protectors have become our brutalizers.where to be the law.is to be above the law.where none dare speak truth to power. But we will not be silent. We will continue to put their offenses and their failures in full view of the public. We will not be intimidated.
MR. HARRIS: I mean, if you need more time
CHRISTINE: The police are doing all they can, and frankly I could use the money. It's been almost a month, and.it wouldn't do any good to find Walter and bring him home if he doesn't have a home to come back to, right?
MR. HARRIS: Of course.
MR. HARRIS: Well.I'll leave you to it, then.
CHRISTINE: Excuse me, can I have your attention?
CHRISTINE: Listen, everyone, I appreciate your consideration, but I'm not made of porcelain. I won't break down and cry if the station to station call to Kankakee doesn't go through. Actually, I.promised myself that I wouldn't cry.wouldn't let myself cry.until I knew, one way or another, what.. Point is.I like the noise here. So don't be afraid to talk and.push buttons, and drop things. If it wasn't noisy, how would I know I was in the right place?
MR. HARRIS: Excuse me, has anyone seen Christine?
OPERATOR: I think I saw her in the back office.
CHRISTINE: Missing Persons department, please. Yes, hello, this is Christine Collins, I.yes, fine, thank you. I was just checking back to see if you had found any missing or lost children that might match the I see. No, I appreciate that, it's just.it never hurts to make sure all the lines of communication are working. I mean, that's what I do for a living, right? Well, I'll try back next week. If you do hear anything in the meantime, would you be sure to let me know? Thanks. Goodbye.
CHRISTINE: Missing persons department, please.
COOK: Two dollars.
MAN: Hell.looks like I left my wallet at home. Can I owe it to you?
COOK: No credit. Pay up or I call the cops. I'm tired of bums like you coming around here.
MAN: I'm not trying to stiff you, chief. I just left my wallet at home, that's all. I'll go back and get it. Five, ten minutes tops.
COOK: You got any collateral?
MAN: Can't ask for better collateral than a man's own flesh and blood, You stay here, son, I'll be right Now don't give me any trouble. He's a good man to trust us like this. You just sit here while I go get my wallet. Okay?
BOY: Now don't give me any trouble. He's a good man to trust us like this. You just sit here while I go get my wallet. Okay?
MAN: Now don't give me any trouble. He's a good man to trust us like this. You just sit here while I go get my wallet. Okay?
COOK: Ten minutes, then I'm calling the
COOK: Ah, hell..
COOK: Hello, Myrtle? It's Harve, down by the diner. Would you get me Sheriff Larsen? Yeah, I'll wait.
COOK: What's your name, son? Son.?
BOY: I don't remember.
COOK: INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY As before, Christine hurries from one station to another, lost in the barely-managed chaos. She stops at one station, glancing over papers, then looks over at
JONES: Mrs. Collins?
JONES: My name is Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Park Juvenile Division. My office supervises all runaway and missing child cases, including your son's, and.. He's alive, Mrs. Collins. He was picked up two days ago by local police in De Kalb, Illinois. He's safe and unhurt. He was in the company of some drifter, we've got an APB out for him now, and
CHRISTINE: All these reporters.you didn't tell me
JONES: Yours is a story with a happy ending, Mrs. Collins. People love happy Train should be pulling in shortly. We'd better get a move on.
JONES: Thank you.we'll have a statement for you in a little while.
"WALTER": Did you know that Los Angeles is where they make the Tom Mix movies?
MATRON: No, I didn't.
"WALTER": His horse is named Blue. You think they'll let me watch them make a movie?
MATRON: I don't know, you'll have to ask. But with all this attention, who knows, maybe they will.
JONES: Mrs. Collins, I'd like to introduce you to Chief of Police James E. Oh, my, I didn't expect
CHRISTINE: Oh, my, I didn't expect
DAVIS: We don't get a lot of positive attention from the boys in the press these days, so it's good to be here when there's a positive story, don't you think?
DAVIS: I take it you've been treated well by my boys in the department?
CHRISTINE: Oh.yes, of course, they've been great. Well, there was that part about having to wait twenty-four hours before filing a report, but
DAVIS: Technicalities aside
CHRISTINE: Yes.other than that, no complaints. They've all been wonderful.
DAVIS: Good, then you won't have any problem telling that to the press, and how the LAPD is concerned first and foremost with the safety of
JONES: Women. Just a sec..
CHRISTINE: She runs toward them. The matron turns, sees her, smiles and gets out of the way, revealing the boy.
JONES: Well? Aren't you going to
CHRISTINE: He's not my son.
JONES: I.what are you
CHRISTINE: He's not my son. He's not my son.
JONES: I'm.I'm sure you're mistaken.
CHRISTINE: He's been through four long, terrible months.he's gone through changes, lost weight
JONES: He's been through four long, terrible months.he's gone through changes, lost weight
CHRISTINE: I know my own son.
JONES: I'm just saying.I mean, you're in shock, and he's changed, and
JONES: What's your name, son? Can you tell me your name?
"WALTER": Walter Collins.
CHRISTINE: It's a common name, it
JONES: Do you know where you live, Walter? Do you know your home address?
"WALTER": My house is at 210 North Avenue 23, Los Angeles, California. And that's my Mommy!
JONES: Mrs. Collins.listen to me. I know you're feeling uncertain right now, but that's to be expected.a boy this age changes so fast.but we've compensated for that in our investigation. We're experts in child identification. There's no question that this is your son.
CHRISTINE: It's not Walter.
JONES: It's not Walter as you remember him. That's why it's important for you to take him home, on a.trial basis.
CHRISTINE: A trial basis?
JONES: Once you've put him back in familiar surroundings, and given yourself time to recover from the shock of his changed condition.you'll see that it is him. I swear to you, Mrs. Collins. I give you my word. Trust me.this is your son.
JONES: If there's any problem, any problem at all, come and talk to me and I'll take care of it. Mrs. Collins.he has nowhere else to go.
CHRISTINE: I.look, I'll take him home, but only because I.might not be thinking clearly right now, and
JONES: Thank you.
REPORTERS: How does it feel to have your son home, Mrs. Collins? What did you think when you saw him for the first It was.it's.hard to explain.
CHRISTINE: It was.it's.hard to explain.
JONES: ( jumping in ) It was certainly quite a shock. At first she hardly recognized him. Perfectly natural, the boy's been through quite an ordeal.
REPORTER: How're you feeling, son? Bet it feels great to be home.
"WALTER": Yeah, it's great!
DAVIS: The Los Angeles Police Department is thankful for all the hard work done by the De Kalb County Sheriff's Department in helping to make this joyful reunion possible. The LAPD is dedicated to serving the public at all times, and
ANOTHER REPORTER: Can we get a photo of mother and son, Captain?
CHRISTINE: CHANGELING A True Story 26.
I: CHANGELING A True Story 26.
JONES: He poses Christine and "Walter" so she is holding the boy in her arms. Dazed, stunned, confused, she manages to smile for the cameras. Bulbs FLASH and
CHRISTINE: Was the sandwich all right? Would you like some more milk?
"WALTER": No, thank you.
CHRISTINE: No, thank you.
"WALTER": No, thank you.
CHRISTINE: Now you need a bath. You're covered with soot from the train ride.
CHRISTINE: I found you a pair of pajamas. I bought them for Walter but he didn't like the fabric, so
CHRISTINE: Are you all right?
"WALTER": I fell. Stupid tub.
CHRISTINE: Did you hurt yourself? Let me see
CHRISTINE: She takes his hand and marches him out of the bathroom.
CHRISTINE: The last time I measured Walter the last time I measured my son he was four inches taller than you are right now. Who are you? What are you doing here? Who are you?
CHRISTINE: He's not my son.
JONES: Mrs. Collins
CHRISTINE: I don't know who he is, or why he's saying he's Walter, but there's clearly been some kind of mistake.
JONES: We agreed you would give him time to adjust
CHRISTINE: He's four inches shorter than Walter. Boys his age don't shrink. If anything, he should be taller.
JONES: Maybe your measurements are off. Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for
CHRISTINE: He's circumcised. Walter wasn't.
JONES: Mrs. Collins.your son was missing for four months. For at least part of that in the company of an as-yet unidentified drifter. Who knows what such a disturbed individual might have done? He could have had him.circumcised. might have
CHRISTINE: Made him smaller? Captain, please
CHRISTINE: why won't you listen to me?
JONES: I am listening, damn it, I I am listening. And I understand your feelings. He's changed, no mistake. You've both been through a terrible experience. That's why he needs your support and love to bounce back.
CHRISTINE: Captain, that boy wouldn't bounce back as my son if you coated him in rubber and dropped him off the roof.
JONES: Why are you doing this, Mrs. Collins? You seem perfectly capable of taking care of the boy, your work pays you enough to attend to his personal needs.so I don't understand why you're trying to run away from your I'm not running away from anything, least of all my responsibilities. I'm even taking care of that boy because right now I'm all he has. What worries me is that you've stopped looking for Walter.
CHRISTINE: I'm not running away from anything, least of all my responsibilities. I'm even taking care of that boy because right now I'm all he has. What worries me is that you've stopped looking for Walter.
JONES: Why should we look someone we've already found?
CHRISTINE: But you haven't found him. He's still out there somewhere, lost, maybe hurt..
JONES: His identity has been confirmed by the best minds in the field of child identification, people who know what they're doing.
CHRISTINE: And I don't? Captain, look, I don't want to cause trouble for you or the department. Honestly I don't. I know you've done everything you can.but there's been a terrible mistake, and I need your help if we're going to correct it.before it's too late. Please.
JONES: Sara, get Dr. Tarr on the phone.
DR. TARR: Mrs. Collins? Dr. Earl W. Tarr. Captain Jones sent me. I consult with him from time to time on juvenile cases. May I come in?
CHRISTINE: Oh.yes, of course.
CHRISTINE: Thank you for coming. I'm surprised Captain Jones moved so quickly. I was starting to think he didn't believe me.
DR. TARR: Well, I'm here now, and we'll put all that to rights. Where is the
DR. TARR: Ah! There he is. A handsome young man. He has your eyes, doesn't he? And a little bit of the nose. Very fit, in spite of all his travails. A very resilient boy you've got here, Mrs. Collins.
CHRISTINE: Doctor Tarr, I thought you were here to help me.
DR. TARR: I am. Captain Jones said the boy had gone through some extreme physical changes, and asked me to look in on him.to reassure you in this your time of motherly concern.
CHRISTINE: My "motherly concern" isn't for him because he's not my son.
DR. TARR: Statements like that will hardly help the boy's self-esteem, now will they? Captain Jones said something about a change in height.?
CHRISTINE: He's four inches shorter than
DR. TARR: Ah, well.hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins. We've known for some time that trauma can affect the growth of children. Given the stress of the last four months his spine may have actually shrunk. It's uncommon, but within the realm of possibility.
CHRISTINE: What about the circumcision?
DR. TARR: Very likely his abductor thought it appropriate. After all, circumcision is hygienically sound. Must have been quite traumatic at the time. No wonder he's submerged the memory.
CHRISTINE: Look, doctor
DR. TARR: As you can see, there's a perfectly sound medical explanation for all of this. But it's good for you to raise these questions. You should be apprised of all changes the lad went through during his absence.
CHRISTINE: Wouldn't I know whether or not he was my son? I'm his mother.
DR. TARR: Which means you're in no position to be objective. You are looking through the prism of extreme emotion at a boy who has changed from what you remember. He isn't the same boy that left here, just as a boy who goes off to war and returns isn't the same anymore.
CHRISTINE: What're you
DR. TARR: Hello, children, my name is Dr. Earl W. Tarr. I'd like to ask you some questions.
1ST KID: My mom says we're not supposed to talk to strangers.
DR. TARR: Good boy. Quite right. But as you see I'm with the police, so it's all right. Now, I'm sure you know Mrs. Collins here, and her son, Walter. How many of you recognize this young boy as Walter Collins?
DR. TARR: Now, now, no need to be afraid. Surely you knew Walter, and played with him? So which of you can identify Walter for me, for his mother, and for the police? This officer would want you to do the right thing as good young citizens.
2ND KID: Walter was as tall as me..
DR. TARR: Yes, precisely. He was as tall as you. Now he's not. He's lost a little height, you see. It's a thing called trauma. With luck, none of you will ever have to find out about it yourselves. So other than that, do you recognize this as your friend, Walter Collins?
2ND KID: I guess.
CHRISTINE: Dr. Tarr
DR. TARR: Already ahead of you, Mrs. Collins; children can be intimidated. But not adults. Shall we try a neighbor?
DR. TARR: and we'd appreciate it if you could make a positive identification for us.
MRS. RILEY: I'd be happy to. I saw the boy often. Come closer, son.
DR. TARR: Take your time.be sure.
MRS. RILEY: Oh, yes.yes.that's Walter all right. Used to come here all the time to play with my nephew, Roger.
DR. TARR: Thank you, Mrs. Riley. You've been a big help, I
CHRISTINE: Before we go.Mrs. Riley, do you have the time?
MRS. RILEY: She looks at her watch. Holds it farther away. Can't quite focus on it. Pulls her glasses out from inside her blouse.
MRS. RILEY: My last concession to vanity; men don't make passes at women who wear glasses, you know. Five o'clock.
CHRISTINE: Thank you.
DR. TARR: A boy is much larger than a watch, Mrs. Collins. Come along, son.
CHRISTINE: Captain, I.no, listen to me, this so-called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood like some kind of derelict mother who couldn't even recognize her own He found what he expected to find, what you obviously told him he would find, but it's not No, I am not reassured.
I: ( beat ) That I was embarrassed isn't the issue, the point is you're wasting time when you should be looking for my son, I ( beat ) Then I want to see this report, so I can refute it, before it goes to anyone else, all right? Fine.
"WALTER": I'm finished. Can I go to my room Yes. Go on up.
CHRISTINE: Yes. Go on up.
"WALTER": G'night, Mommy.
CHRISTINE: Stop saying that! I'm not your mother! And you're not my son!
CHRISTINE: WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? DAMN YOU! I WANT MY SON BACK!
SON BACK!: He tears off as she slumps to the floor, covering her eyes.
CHRISTINE: I want my son back.god, please. make it stop.just make it stop.
CHRISTINE: I was wrong to yell at you. You're still a child, and I think you don't really understand what you're doing, the hurt you're causing. Maybe this is all just some big game of pretend to you, but I need you to understand. Walter is.he's all I have, he's everything to me, and every day we lose because of this puts him further away from where I can help him. Whatever the police think, whatever the world thinks, we know the truth, don't we? We both know you're not Walter. Getting you to admit that may be the only chance I have to straighten this out before it's too late. Maybe you're afraid of getting in trouble, that you're in too deep. But you're not. You don't have to tell me who you are, you just have to tell them who you're not. Just. tell them the truth.
CHRISTINE: REV. BRIEGLEB ( on phone )
CHRISTINE: Yes? Who is this?
CHRISTINE: Oh, yes, I heard some of your radio broadcasts after my son.you were very supportive, and I appreciate
CHRISTINE: No, I
CHRISTINE: "Acting on the request of the Los Angeles Police Department, Dr. Earl
REV. BRIEGLEB: Lovely bit of phrasing, isn't it? Noticed since the return of the boy to his mother. Not only does it state clearly that you are the boy's mother, one could infer from this that you are somehow responsible for these changes.and that the police are concerned for the boy's welfare in your hands. You should try the eggs, they're very good.
CHRISTINE: ( still reading ) "I examined the boy quite thoroughly, Dr. Tarr said
DR. TARR: and it's clear that he has something to tell. I'm sure that in time he will give his boyish story of the entire affair, but not until he has faith in his listener. And that is what is lacking: faith in the poor lad's story. In the course of my examination, I found nothing to dispute the findings by the LAPD.
REPORTER: How come he hasn't been able to tell anyone what happened while he was gone?
DR. TARR: I would say that the boy has either been coached or questioned to a point where he is largely confused about what happened to him during
CHRISTINE: Captain Jones promised he'd let me see the report before it went anywhere else.
REV. BRIEGLEB: Someone in authority at the LAPD lied? Good heavens, I may have to go lie down.
REV. BRIEGLEB: I was not laughing at your situation, Mrs. Collins. It's just.after one has this sort of conversation enough times, a certain degree of hysteria begins to set in. Please,
CHRISTINE: Why are they doing this?
REV. BRIEGLEB: To avoid admitting a mistake.that they brought back the wrong boy. Anyone reading that with half a brain would see through it instantly. Sadly, that leaves out about half the Times' readership, but still..
CHRISTINE: Thank you.
REV. BRIEGLEB: You have no idea how many people have sat in that very chair and said those exact same words to me in relation to our friends at the Los Angeles Police Department. Mrs. Collins, I have made it my mission to bring to light all the things the LAPD would prefer no one knew anything about.a department ruled by violence, abuse, murder, corruption and intimidation.
MONTAGE STARTS: INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE - DAY FAUX NEWSREEL FOOTAGE of Police Chief Davis speaking before a bunch of microphones.
DAVIS: ( overlapping ) We will hold court on gunmen in the Los Angeles streets. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least mercy to a criminal.
REV. BRIEGLEB: This police department does not tolerate dissent, contradiction. or embarrassment, Mrs. Collins. You have the power to embarrass them.and they don't like it. Not when they became the Heroes of the Hour the day they stood there posing with you, having rescued a lost boy from the wilderness.
CHRISTINE: Reverend Briegleb.I appreciate what you're saying, and what you're doing.but I'm not on a mission. The only thing I want is to find my son, that's all, and I just
REV. BRIEGLEB: A lot of mothers' sons ended up being sacrificed to expediency around here, Mrs. Collins. Yours wouldn't be the first. Do this right, and maybe yours will be the last.
CHRISTINE: If they honestly thought I was wrong, that'd be one thing.but if they don't care, if they're just trying to cover it up..
REV. BRIEGLEB: This is their attempt to win by framing the discussion their way. "Why, of course it's her son.yes, there have been changes.we're looking into it, and isn't it strange that they happened after the boy got home?" They're putting you in the position of having to disprove what they're saying.and that's hard. Most people believe what they hear from the police or the government. If you play it their way, you.and your son.are going to lose.
CHRISTINE: What do I have to do?
REV. BRIEGLEB: Change the rules of engagement. Re- define the argument. They brought in their expert, so you bring in yours. You have an advantage they don't. You know your son better than they ever will, and in that knowledge is the proof you need. Get that information, put it out there. Make them respond to you, not the other way around.
REV. BRIEGLEB: Once people side with the police, it's a hard climb.but even in a town as loud as this one, the voice of truth can be heard.if you're willing to take it all the way in spite of the dangers.and they are very real, Mrs. Collins, make no mistake. Once you open the book on these people, you're going to be looking over your shoulder every day, maybe for the rest of your You up to it, Mrs. Collins?
CHRISTINE: DR. MONTGOMERY
DR. MONTGOMERY: He had two cavities that needed filling. He put up a fight, but I took care of it.
CHRISTINE: He casts a look back at the closed door, shakes his head.
DR. MONTGOMERY: Your son's upper front teeth were separated by a small muscle. Made them sit about an eighth of an inch apart. The boy in that room has no such gap.
CHRISTINE: Does a gap like that get smaller with age? Because that's what they'll say.
DR. MONTGOMERY: In some cases, yes, it's possible. But the muscle between Walter's teeth prevents that from happening. They can never come together without an operation to sever the muscle, and I can tell you right now that he has never had such an operation.
CHRISTINE: Will you be willing to sign a letter saying that officially?
DR. MONTGOMERY: Pardon my language, but.hell,
DR. MONTGOMERY: Sounds like the anesthetic is wearing On the other hand, maybe I'll write that letter first. Give the little fella something to think about.
CHRISTINE: Well? What do you think? Is that the Walter Collins that you remember?
MRS. FOX: If it is, he's changed enormously. Do you know who I am?
"WALTER": You're a teacher.
MRS. FOX: Yes, but even teachers have names. What's mine?
"WALTER": I don't remember. I know you, but I don't remember your name.
MRS. FOX: My name is Mrs. Fox. Now, take your seat.
MRS. FOX: I didn't say take a seat. I said take your seat. Your assigned seat. You must know which one it is, you sat there for over a year.
MRS. FOX: Try again. Here's a hint: There's only one more empty seat left.
MRS. FOX: Mrs. Collins, if that's your son, I'll eat my yardstick. Not only will I put that in writing, I'll swear to it in a court of law and in front of President Calvin Coolidge himself if I have to.
REV. BRIEGLEB: I'll see you tonight at eight for my broadcast. I'll leave the back door open and a light on. Good
CHRISTINE: Good morning. My name is Christine Collins. On March 10th, my nine year old son, Walter Collins, disappeared. A four month investigation resulted in a boy being brought to Los Angeles from De Kalb, Illinois. They told me, and all of you, that this boy was my son. They were wrong. The Los Angeles Police Department made a mistake.a terrible mistake. The boy they found is not my son. That is the reason for the supposed "transformation." I have letters from his dentist, his teachers and others confirming that this boy is not my son. The letters are being reprinted now, and I should have them for you tomorrow.
CHRISTINE: I have given the police department every opportunity to admit their mistake and renew the search for my son. Since they have refused to do so, I have no choice but to present my case before the public. I hope this will persuade the police to finish the job they started, and bring my son home to me. Thank you.
JONES: Morelli, I want you to find the Collins woman and get her here. Bring her in the back way, and have a couple of matrons standing by.
1ST COP: Yes, sir.
CHRISTINE: Why are we using the back door?
1ST COP: Captain's orders. Front's jammed with reporters.
CHRISTINE: Is it?
DESK SERGEANT: Hey.anybody want to take a call from the Royal Canadian Mounties?
YBARRA: What'd they do, lose a moose?
DESK SERGEANT: They need a juvenile living here illegally deported back to Canada. He's living with his cousin on some ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.
YBARRA: All right, I'll take it, got nothing better to do..
JONES: Mrs. Collins.
JONES: Leave the boy for now. We'll look after him.
JONES: You've put us through quite a bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins. This situation has become an embarrassment for the entire department.
CHRISTINE: It wasn't my intention to embarrass No, of course not. You just told the papers we can't tell one boy from another as a compliment for the months we spent working on your case. Are you trying to make fools out of us? Is that it? Do you enjoy this?
JONES: No, of course not. You just told the papers we can't tell one boy from another as a compliment for the months we spent working on your case. Are you trying to make fools out of us? Is that it? Do you enjoy this?
CHRISTINE: No, of course not. I had to get your attention, I had to make you understand.he's not my son.
JONES: You know what your problem is? You want to shirk your responsibilities as a mother. You enjoyed being a free woman, didn't you? Enjoyed not having to worry about a young son. You could do what you wanted, go where you wanted, see anyone you wanted. But then we found your son. Brought him back. And now he's an inconvenience. That's why you cooked up this whole scheme, to try and throw him to the state, let the state raise him for you.
CHRISTINE: That's not true!
JONES: No? Even the boy says he's your son. Why would he do that? How would he know to do that?
CHRISTINE: I don't know! All I know is that he's lying!
JONES: Maybe so. Maybe he is a liar. But that's how he's been trained, isn't it? Lying was born in both of you. You're a liar and a troublemaker and if you ask me you've got no business walking the streets of Los Just a minute
CHRISTINE: Just a minute
JONES: Because either you know you're lying, or you're not capable of knowing if you're lying or telling the truth. So which is it, Mrs. Collins? Are you a derelict mother? Or just nuts? Because from where I sit, those are the only options.
CHRISTINE: I'm not going to sit here and take
JONES: You want to bring in experts? Doctors? Well, I can do that too.
JONES: Mrs. Collins.do you still insist that the boy out there is not your
CHRISTINE: He nods to the matron, who moves to restrain her.
CHRISTINE: Wait.what are you doing?
MATRON: Please don't struggle, ma'am. You'll only hurt yourself.
JONES: ( to the matron ) You are to convey the prisoner to the Los Angeles County General Hospital Psychopathic Ward.
CHRISTINE: No.wait, you can't
JONES: ( still to matron ) Make the following entry in the booking department: Defendant states she has been deceived by police and others, and that they have given her a boy and tried to make her think it is her son when she says it is not.
MATRON: Got another code twelve.
NURSE: Collins. Christine.
MATRON: Collins. Christine.
CHRISTINE: Wait.please, this is a mistake.
NURSE: ( to matron ) Certifying officer?
MATRON: Captain J. J. Jones, Lincoln Heights Please.you have to listen to me. The police are doing this to punish me. They tried to force this boy on me and tell me he was my son, but it wasn't my son, and now they say I'm crazy
CHRISTINE: ( forced calm ) Please.you have to listen to me. The police are doing this to punish me. They tried to force this boy on me and tell me he was my son, but it wasn't my son, and now they say I'm crazy
CHRISTINE: Oh, god.oh god, please, no..
NURSE: If you continue to struggle I'll have to put you in a straitjacket. Do you want that? Good. Then behave yourself. Code twelve.
CHRISTINE: No, please, you have to listen to
NURSE: Take off your clothes.
CHRISTINE: Physical examination, body cavity search and de-lousing. Required for all new patients.
NURSE: Physical examination, body cavity search and de-lousing. Required for all new patients.
CHRISTINE: That's not necessary
NURSE: You can remove your clothes yourself, or I can have the orderlies do it for you. Which do you prefer?
NURSE: Spread your legs.
NURSE: Christine enters
NURSE: This is your room. The doctor's left for the day. He'll see you in the morning.
CHRISTINE: The morning? But.wait, I've got to talk to someone in authority

CHRISTINE: Then if I could just use the phone.
NURSE: Phone privileges are earned by good behavior. You're not allowed newspapers, magazines, radio, books or sharp objects. This is for your own good.
CHRISTINE: Wait.please! There's been a terrible mistake!
PATIENT: My room. My room. They SAID it was MY ROOM!
CHRISTINE: I'm sorry, I
PATIENT: MY ROOM! MY ROOM! MY ROOM! MY
ROOM!: She starts SCREAMING. Christine covers her ears.
YBARRA: CHANGELING A True Story 55.
GORDON: Overheated, that's all. She'll be fine in a bit.
YBARRA: Listen, could you give me a hand? I'm trying to find a place called the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.
GORDON: Northcott Ranch.oh yeah. You're almost there. Follow this west for about two, three miles. Then the next right. That'll bring you right to it. Something going on?
YBARRA: Just looking into a juvenile matter. Thanks for the help.
YBARRA: ANOTHER ANGLE - POV SHOT Someone is watching as Ybarra moves toward the main house.
YBARRA: Anybody home?
YBARRA: This is the police. I have a warrant for a minor named Sanford Clark. Open the door and stand aside.
YBARRA: Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your face through the floor!
YBARRA: On your feet.
YBARRA: Jesus.what the hell's wrong with you? Don't you know assaulting a cop is against the law?
SANFORD: What difference does it make now?
YBARRA: We're just sending you back to Canada, son, it isn't the end of the world.
SANFORD: You can't just stay in the U.S. as long as you want, pal. We've got a orders to send you back home, and
YBARRA: You can't just stay in the U.S. as long as you want, pal. We've got a orders to send you back home, and
YBARRA: Didn't know Canada was that funny.
BRIEGLEB: No word from Mrs. Collins? Get on down to her house, make sure she's all right. If she's not there, call the LAPD, see what they know.
BRIEGLEB: This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church, bringing you the Lord's word on radio KGF. Good evening.
GORDON: I'd like a ticket to Canada. Alberta or Vancouver, whatever's leaving Don't have anything going that far tonight. Best I can do is put you on a train for Seattle. From there you can transfer to one of the locals or drive across the border.
TICKET VENDER: Don't have anything going that far tonight. Best I can do is put you on a train for Seattle. From there you can transfer to one of the locals or drive across the border.
GORDON: That'll be fine.
TICKET VENDER: One way.
GORDON: One way.
TICKET VENDER: That'll be fifteen dollars.
CHRISTINE: Can I see the doctor? Or someone in charge
NURSE: Breakfast is half an hour.
CHRISTINE: But I
NURSE: Down the hall. The doctor will call for you when he's ready. Go or stay, either way I lock the
CAROL DEXTER: You should eat. Eating is normal. You got to do everything you can to look normal. That's the only chance you've got. Besides, you'll need the strength.
CAROL DEXTER: My name's Carol Dexter. What's Christine. Christine Collins.
CHRISTINE: Christine. Christine Collins.
CHRISTINE: I won't be here that long. As soon as I can talk to a doctor, they'll realize there's been a terrible mistake and
CAROL DEXTER: Yeah, that always works. I heard them talking. You're here on a code twelve, police action. The doctors, the staff, they figure that if the police sent you here, there must be a good reason for it.
CHRISTINE: Then I'll just have to prove that I'm not insane.
CAROL DEXTER: Yeah? How? The more you try to act sane, the crazier you start to look. If you smile too much, you're delusional or stifling hysteria. If you don't smile, you're depressed. If you're neutral you're emotionally withdrawn and potentially catatonic.
CHRISTINE: You seem to have given this a great deal of thought.
CAROL DEXTER: I have. Don't you get it? You're code twelve. So am I. We're here for the same reason. We pissed off the cops.
CAROL DEXTER: What, you thought you were the only The lady over there was married to a cop who kept beating her up. When she tried to tell somebody, they sent her here. And that one? The police beat the crap out of her brother, broke both his arms. When she complained to the papers, they picked her up and.
CHRISTINE: What about you?
CAROL DEXTER: I.work nights. I mean, I work nights. Downtown. In some of the clubs. You know.
CAROL DEXTER: This one client started hitting me, and he wouldn't stop. So I filed a complaint. Turns out he was a cop. Next thing I know, I'm here.
CHRISTINE: But how can they
CAROL DEXTER: You're kidding right? Hey, everybody knows women are fragile, right? They're all emotions, no logic, nothin' goin' on upstairs. And sometimes, like when they say something that's a little, y'know, inconvenient.they just go fucking nuts, pardon my French. If we're insane, nobody has to listen to us. I mean, who are you going to believe, some crazy woman trying to destroy the integrity of the force, or a police officer? Then once they get us in here, we either learn to behave, and shut up, or Or you don't go home.or you go home like that.
CAROL DEXTER: Better finish up your oatmeal. Want to look sane for the doctors. Then I want to hear what they nailed you for.
FLASHBACK: on a HATCHET, rising and falling in tune with the ruler tapping. There's blood on the hatchet.
ADMINISTRATOR: Clark.Sanford Clark.
ADMINISTRATOR: Paperwork's come through. You'll be deported back to Canada day after tomorrow. The police there will to decide what to do with you next. I hope your stay here has convinced you not to try crossing the border illegally in future.
SANFORD: Wait, I.I want to talk to the officer who brought me in.
ADMINISTRATOR: I'm sure he has far more important things to do than
SANFORD: Please. It's important.
ADMINISTRATOR: He's off-duty until tomorrow, but. I'll see what I can do. No promises.
DRIVER: How far you going?
GORDON: Hop in.
DRIVER: Hop in.
DRIVER: Don't worry about that, pal. Just a little insurance. A couple of guys tried to hijack my truck a few years ago so they could run booze over the border. You can't be too safe, you know?
GORDON: Yeah, I surely do.
STEELE: Mrs. Collins.Dr. Jonathan Steele. Please, have a seat.
STEELE: I hope your stay has been comfortable so far.
CHRISTINE: Fine. Thank you.
STEELE: Really? I'd think it would be quite difficult at first.
CHRISTINE: ( catching herself ) Well, it was. Difficult, I mean. But comfortable.
STEELE: I see they took a blood test.
CHRISTINE: Wasserman Test. To check for syphilis. Apparently it can affect the mind.
STEELE: The idea that someone thinks you should be checked for syphilis.did that upset you?
CHRISTINE: No. Not at all. I'm sure it's. standard procedure.
STEELE: Yes. Exactly. Standard procedure. We have to cover all bases, and
CHRISTINE: ( covering her bases ) But.at the same time.I imagine that it would be.would probably be upsetting to.some people that someone else might.suspect that of them. ( beat ) However inappropriate that might
STEELE: According to your file, you believe the police have substituted a fake boy for your son. Is that true?
CHRISTINE: I didn't say they substituted a fake boy, just.not the right boy. They brought back the wrong boy. Not my son. He's still missing.
STEELE: That's strange.you see, I have here a newspaper article with a photo of you at the train station, welcoming your son home. That is you in the photo, isn't it?
CHRISTINE: So at first he was your son, but now he's not your son. Has this been going on for a long time? People.changing, becoming something other than what they are?
STEELE: So at first he was your son, but now he's not your son. Has this been going on for a long time? People.changing, becoming something other than what they are?
CHRISTINE: People don't change, doctor.
STEELE: You don't think people change?
CHRISTINE: That's not what I
STEELE: And the police.they're not out to persecute you?
CHRISTINE: No. Of course not.
STEELE: The police are here to protect us.
CHRISTINE: That's right.
STEELE: That's odd, because according to the head nurse, when you were admitted you accused the police of conspiring to do this deliberately, to punish you. So either she and the interns are also conspiring against you.or you're changing your story. Do you often have trouble telling reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?
ADMINISTRATOR: I'm sorry to bring you out in this weather, detective, but the boy has been quite insistent.
YBARRA: It's all right, I'll just see what he has to say so I can go home and get dry. Where is he?
ADMINISTRATOR: Room seven.
YBARRA: It's raining cats, dogs and democrats out there, so this better be worth
YBARRA: Look, I this isn't easy, okay?
SANFORD: Look, I this isn't easy, okay?
YBARRA: Nothing is.
SANFORD: My cousin's Gordon Northcott. He owns the ranch where you found me. He let me live there in exchange for watching the place when he was gone, doing chores, stuff like that. Said I could stay on as long as I wanted to. I figured that also meant I could leave whenever I wanted to, but he wouldn't let me.
YBARRA: Are you saying he held you prisoner? Bull. When I got to the ranch you were running around free as a jaybird. Could've left any time you wanted. So what's this, some kind of story to cover why you were in the country illegally?
SANFORD: No.no, it's nothing like that.
YBARRA: Because I don't have time for
SANFORD: Listen to me, please. He said
YBARRA: What? What did he
SANFORD: He said that if I tried to leave, he'd kill me!
YBARRA: Okay, lets start at the beginning. What did he make you do?
SANFORD: Him and me.me and Gordon, we. .we killed some kids.
SANFORD: I didn't mean to, I swear.he made me help him, said if I didn't he'd kill me, too. Please, you gotta help me.I'm scared.I don't want to go to Hell for killing kids.
YBARRA: What kids?
SANFORD: I don't know.I never knew their How many kids?
YBARRA: How many kids?
SANFORD: All together?
SANFORD: About.twenty, I guess.
YBARRA: You're lying.
SANFORD: No, it's true, I swear!
YBARRA: Twenty kids.
SANFORD: Yeah.thereabouts.I kinda stopped counting after a while, and Gordon said one or two might've gotten away, but
YBARRA: Nobody can just up and kill twenty We did.yeah, we did that..
SANFORD: We did.yeah, we did that..
YBARRA: Sanford looks off, pauses, then, softly and slowly..
SANFORD: Most times we'd bring back just one or two.sometimes as many as three.
GORDON: Time to go.
GORDON: There you are, we've been looking for you like mad.
KID: You have?
GORDON: Sure thing. Your folks, they got in an accident. They sent us to find you. They're hurt real bad. The police took 'em to the hospital, but they didn't have time to come find you, so we said we'd do it. Now come on, hurry.we gotta get to the hospital, see your folks.
SANFORD: It's okay. Come on in.
GORDON: Good boy! Now hold on, it's a long drive and we gotta fly.
QUICK IMAGES: Gordon, eyes insane with blood lust, stumbles toward the coop.
SANFORD: Sometimes.sometimes he'd leave one or two of 'em alive.barely anyway.and tell me.finish 'em. Finish 'em.or I'll finish you. And I did.I did.oh god.oh, sweet Jesus.I killed 'em.I killed 'em.I killed 'em..
YBARRA: These.uhm.these kids.do you think.if you saw them again, do you think you'd recognize them? Just a second.
YBARRA: I haven't updated these in a while, but still, it should be.. Just go through.and if you see any faces you recognize, put it on the table.
YBARRA: The name on the back of the photo is WALTER COLLINS.
JONES: Have you gone soft in the head, Sir, I
YBARRA: Sir, I
JONES: He's playing you! He knows he's in trouble, so he's come up with some cock and bull story about how he was forced to stay in the country
YBARRA: With all due respect, sir, I don't think so. You didn't see him, the kid's scared half out of his mind
JONES: He picked the Collins kid! We found him, remember? Haven't you been reading the papers? Or maybe you have, is that it?
YBARRA: Sir, if you'd just listen
SECRETARY: I'm sorry, captain, but he's here again.that reverend, Briegleb. He's asking about Christine Collins.
JONES: Tell the sonofabitch to get the hell off police property before I have him arrested for disturbing the peace.
SECRETARY: I tried. He said he's not leaving. him, or his friends.
JONES: What the hell.?
JONES: Jesus jumped down..
JONES: Ybarra? Listen. You're not to do anything except come back here.
YBARRA: Sir, department policy requires that all allegations of homicide have to be investigated. And these are kids, for chrissakes
JONES: Departmental policy is what I say it is, you got that? Now I'm ordering you to get your ass back here with that kid, you got that? You bring him here and you talk to no one, got it? Nobody!
YBARRA: All right, let's go.
BRIEGLEB: Are you Captain Jones?
JONES: I am.
BRIEGLEB: What the hell have you done with Christine Collins? Don't try and lie your way out of it. I talked to several neighbors who saw her being driven off in a police car.
JONES: Mrs. Collins has been placed in protective custody following a mental A what?!
BRIEGLEB: A what?!
JONES: Her statements and behavior have been found to be consistent with a delusional state of mind that could make her a danger to herself or others. In the public interest, we are looking after her son while she gets the help she clearly needs.
BRIEGLEB: Sorry, we're withholding that information to respect the privacy of the family. But I can assure you that she's getting the best treatment available. That's all.
JONES: Sorry, we're withholding that information to respect the privacy of the family. But I can assure you that she's getting the best treatment available. That's all.

DAVIS: I don't know if you're aware of it, Captain, but I have an exceptionally good vocabulary. I'm a terror at Scrabble, crossword puzzles, but even I'm in awe of the vocabulary that the press and the city council have been exercising in reference to this department courtesy of the Christine Collins.incident. Incompetent. Cowardly. Bullying. Reprehensible. Mendacious and invidious.those two courtesy of that prick Gustav Briegleb. Bonus words in Scrabble, both of them. Especially invidious. Hard to work that one into a conversation. But he managed it, all right.
JONES: Sir, I
DAVIS: The key, of course, is the context in which words like this get used. You have to do that in scrabble, you know, when somebody challenges a word.show how it's used in a sentence. So "incompetent," as in "A department so incompetent that they never realized that up to twenty children were being kidnapped and murdered under their very noses." And here: "So incompetent that they insisted they knew better than a mother the identity of her own child, forced him upon her, and then incarcerated her when she confronted them with evidence of their own reprehensible behavior." That was a two-fer. Incompetent and reprehensible in the same sentence. Guy must be a real terror at crossword puzzles.
DAVIS: Captain, your handling of the Collins case has exposed this department to public ridicule. There is even the potential for civil and criminal Sir, nobody could have known what was going on up at that ranch. Not us, not the Sheriff's Department, the Marshall's Office.as for the Collins woman.. I'm still not convinced that her kid is among the victims up in No, sir.
JONES: Sir, nobody could have known what was going on up at that ranch. Not us, not the Sheriff's Department, the Marshall's Office.as for the Collins woman.. I'm still not convinced that her kid is among the victims up in No, sir.
DAVIS: No, sir.
JONES: No, sir.
DAVIS: Maybe he was.which raises the obvious question: so what?
JONES: Davis turns back to him from the window.
DAVIS: The Mayor wants this to go away. I want this to go away. The way you do that is to stop insisting that Walter Collins was not among those kids killed up at that goddamned ranch. Because if the boy you brought back isn't Walter Collins, and he's not dead up at that ranch, then where the hell is he? People will want to know why we haven't found him. Why we aren't we doing our job. But if, on the other hand, he is, or could be among those poor boys killed up in Wineville.then the inquiries stop. It's a momentary embarrassment that you'll have to live with.but better a short inconvenience than a lingering problem, wouldn't you say, Captain?
JONES: Yes, sir.
DAVIS: The boy's been gone for nearly a year. If he was going to be found, it would've happened by now. Whether he was up at that ranch or not, the truth is he probably is dead somewhere. Better his mother accepts that now rather than later, don't you think?
JONES: Yes, sir.
DAVIS: Good. That'll be all, Captain.
JONES: Sir, there's talk of an investigation by the police commission.
DAVIS: Let me worry about the commission. But it wouldn't hurt to find out just who the fuck that kid is you brought back from De Kalb and why he did this, because the press bought into his bullshit same as we did. That we were all taken in by the scheming little bastard may help take some of the sting off this.
JONES: My boys are working on it now, sir.
"WALTER": I want a glass of water.
YBARRA: ( mocking ) What's your name?
"WALTER": ( mocking ) What's your name?
YBARRA: What's your name?
"WALTER": Walter Collins.
YBARRA: Walter Collins is dead.
"WALTER": ( shrugs ) I didn't do it.
YBARRA: Look, let me explain something to you. Because of your lies, you've ruined a woman's life embarrassed the police department, and got the whole city up in arms over this.
"WALTER": Got a lot done, didn't I?
YBARRA: All right, if that's how you want it, then I guess we're done here. Tell County Jail we're remanding him for trial.
"WALTER": Wait.what's remanding? What trial?
YBARRA: I told you, the real Walter Collins was murdered.
"WALTER": So? I didn't do anything! I wasn't even here when it happened!
YBARRA: By pretending to be Walter Collins, you're interfering in a police investigation of a kidnapping and murder. We can try you as an accomplice to murder after the fact. Too bad. County Jail is a lot worse than juvenile hall or a foster home. A lot worse.
"WALTER": You can't do that.I'm just a kid!
YBARRA: Sanford Clark is a kid, too. Fifteen. But he's going to jail. All murderers and their accomplices go to jail. Everyone knows that. Get him out of here. It's out of my hands now.
"WALTER": Wait! I don't want to go to jail.
YBARRA: Prove it.
YBARRA: The boy's real name is Arthur Hutchins Junior, age twelve, a runaway from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
JONES: Did you check the wire services?
YBARRA: Checks out. The report was filed by his divorced mother, who lives in Clinton, Iowa with the boy's grandmother. Apparently he didn't like living with the old lady, she didn't let him get away with the stuff he usually got away with, and one day.he up and left.
JONES: What about the man he showed up with at the diner?
YBARRA: Just some drifter. The boy was hungry, ran into this guy who said he knew how to get some food and not have to pay for it. Only when they finished, he left the kid behind while he cut out. When the police picked him up, they started going through the wire reports about missing kids
JONES: And he overheard them say the name Walter Collins.
YBARRA: But why that one? I mean, of all the police departments he could've screwed up, why Los Angeles?
JONES: But why that one? I mean, of all the police departments he could've screwed up, why Los Angeles?
YBARRA: I asked him the same question.
"WALTER": I.I knew that Los Angeles was where they made the Tom Mix movies. I figured maybe I could meet Tom Mix. Maybe he'd even let me ride his horse. His horse is named Blue. Did you know that?
BRIEGLEB: How are you feeling?
CHRISTINE: A little better, thanks. The sleep helped. Anything new outside?
BRIEGLEB: Nothing that can't wait until you're stronger. The police still have a car parked outside. They want to know what your next move is.
CHRISTINE: I want to go home.
BRIEGLEB: And then?
CHRISTINE: I've been giving that a great deal of thought ever since I got out of that.place. All those women, and what they did about Walter.. They're going to just keep on doing it, aren't they? Nothing's going to change.unless we make it change.
CHRISTINE: I used to tell Walter, "Never start a fight.but always finish it." I didn't start this fight.but by god I'm going to finish it.
BRIEGLEB: It's dangerous, and you've already been through a great deal, Mrs. Collins. Right now you're sufficiently high-profile that the police will hesitate to come after you out in the open.but if they see their position threatened, that could change quickly. Your life could be in danger.
CHRISTINE: "Always finish it. Always."
RACHEL CLARK: Just a minute..
GORDON: Hi, sis.
RACHEL CLARK: Gordon.I didn't know you were back in town.
GORDON: Got in a couple of days ago, figured I'd surprise you. That okay?
RACHEL CLARK: Yes.yes, of course. Come on in.
GORDON: Where's that little niece of mine?
RACHEL CLARK: She.went into town. Should be back this evening. Bob's here
GORDON: Good. Need to talk to him about staying on for a few days.
RACHEL CLARK: Listen, can I use your bathroom? It's been a long ride and I could use a shower.
GORDON: Listen, can I use your bathroom? It's been a long ride and I could use a shower.
RACHEL CLARK: Of course.
BOB: Is that Go next door. I'll call the police.
MOUNTIE: Go around the other side! Cut him
SECOND MOUNTIE: Go on! Get the bastard!
MOUNTIE: Screw this.I'm too old for this fightin' shit..
MOUNTIE: YOU.ARE UNDER.ARREST!
YOU.ARE UNDER.ARREST!: And he YANKS Gordon toward the other waiting officers.
BRIEGLEB: Mrs. Collins, I want you to meet a friend of mine, Mr. Hahn.
CHRISTINE: Mrs. Collins. My deepest condolences on your loss.
HAHN: Mrs. Collins. My deepest condolences on your loss.
REV. BRIEGLEB: Can we come in?
CHRISTINE: Yes.of course.
CHRISTINE: Mr. Hahn, was it?
HAHN: CHANGELING A True Story 98.
CHRISTINE: I appreciate the sentiment, but so far they still haven't positively identified any of the.remains. as Walter's.
HAHN: But he was identified, was he not?
CHRISTINE: Yes, but.I guess I still can't accept it. It doesn't feel real to It never does. I lost a daughter to polio five years ago. There's not a day goes by I don't think, I should mention this to Claudine. then I remember she's not here.
HAHN: It never does. I lost a daughter to polio five years ago. There's not a day goes by I don't think, I should mention this to Claudine. then I remember she's not here.
CHRISTINE: I'm sorry. Please, sit.
CHRISTINE: I've been on the phone all day with the appointment secretary for the police commission. They won't let me testify at the hearing, or call witnesses. They say it's not I know. My sources tell me the police commission is going to come out with a report that whitewashes the whole thing. They're going to say that Jones and the rest of the LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong, that the real blame is with the kid.and with you, for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety.
REV. BRIEGLEB: I know. My sources tell me the police commission is going to come out with a report that whitewashes the whole thing. They're going to say that Jones and the rest of the LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong, that the real blame is with the kid.and with you, for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety.
CHRISTINE: Then we'll just have to hire a lawyer.bring a civil suit and try to get the City Council to call for a hearing by the Welfare Board.
REV. BRIEGLEB: Jut one problem.
CHRISTINE: ( crestfallen ) I see..
HAHN: Which is why I'm doing this pro It would be my honor to defend your honor, Mrs. Collins. In my fifteen years as a lawyer, I have never seen anyone fight as long or as hard as you have, in what is so clearly in the cause of justice.
REV. BRIEGLEB: Now I want you to tell Mr. Hahn here the whole story, from end to end, leave nothing out, he'll need it all if he's going to get the City Council involved.
CHRISTINE: Of course. One thing, though. A personal favor. When we've finished here today, could you spare a few minutes to come with me downtown.
HAHN: Of course. Where downtown?
NURSE: Yes? May I
HAHN: My name is S. S.
NURSE: I'm sorry, but the doctor in charge won't be in until tomorrow morning Let me be clearer. Either you open those doors and produce the people named in that court order, or you will find yourself on the other side of those bars.without a key.
HAHN: Let me be clearer. Either you open those doors and produce the people named in that court order, or you will find yourself on the other side of those bars.without a key.
CAROL DEXTER: I knew you'd come.I knew you'd come back.I knew you'd come..
CHRISTINE: It's all right.everything's going to be all right now..
REPORTER: Mr. Northcott, any comment on your I'm feeling fine.
GORDON: I'm feeling fine.
REPORTER: How did you avoid capture?
GORDON: Well, I didn't, did I? Didn't know anyone wanted me until just recently. Didn't even try. My luggage still has my initials on it.
ANOTHER REPORTER: Did you know why the police were after you?
GORDON: No, but I figured it would be best if I stayed out of it.
REPORTER: Anything to say to the parents of the children you murdered?
GORDON: No comment.
DAVIS: Mayor Cryer.this is unexpected.
CRYER: So was this.
CRYER: Subpoenas, requests for depositions, interrogatories.all courtesy of Mr. Hahn and his new client, Christine Collins.
DAVIS: I thought this was supposed to go away. This is an election year, I can't afford this kind of press.
CRYER: I thought this was supposed to go away. This is an election year, I can't afford this kind of press.
DAVIS: It is going away, sir. I instructed Captain Jones
CRYER: I'm afraid falling on his sword and saying he made a mistake isn't going to be good enough, Chief. If we take him out of the picture for a while, it might help calm things down until the hearing's finished. There are several people on the council who are planning to run against me, and they'd love to accuse me of allowing a renegade police force to operate with impunity.
CRYER: Our friends in the press are having a field day with this mess. I'm getting five hundred phone calls, letters and telegrams a day demanding to know what the hell is going on at City Hall that we allow our police force to brutalize women and misplace children. Christ, all this picture needs now is for somebody to kick a puppy for the cameras. This is a train, Chief, and we need to either get in front of it, or be run over by it.
DAVIS: Mayor Cryer.I stand by my men. You know that.
CRYER: I do. And you know where I stand. So the question is..are we going to stand together.or hang together?
MAYOR CRYER: Gentlemen.gentlemen, please. As Mayor of Los Angeles, it is my duty to preserve the peace in our city, which has been disrupted by recent events in the case of Christine Collins. As a result, we have decided that Captain J. J. Jones of the Lincoln Heights Division is to be suspended from active duty, effective immediately.
REPORTER: What's the charge, Chief?
CHIEF DAVIS: The charge is conduct unbecoming an officer, and using improper and abusive language toward Mrs. Collins. It further charges that he exceeded his authority as a police officer by incarcerating Mrs. Collins on the alleged charge of insanity without sufficient cause.
REPORTER: Mayor Cryer, are you aware that the City Council has said it plans to open its own investigation into the Collins case?
MAYOR CRYER: I've heard this, yes. But since one of the main purposes of such a hearing by the City Council would be to suspend Captain Jones, and since that action has now been taken, the question is moot.
REPORTER: Which makes it look like the only reason Jones is being suspended is to head off the City Council
CHIEF DAVIS: I won't even dignify that question with a response. Good day.
CRYER: Cheer up, Chief. That little show should take the wind out of their sails. By Monday, this issue will be as cold as yesterday's fish. Never underestimate the public's lack of attention and potential for apathy. Old news is dead news, you'll see.
CHRISTINE: Reverend, what
BRIEGLEB: Sorry to barge in so late, Mrs. Collins, but it took me a while to find the right people for the right job. These three gentlemen are members of my congregation who, before coming to the Lord, had lived lives of brutality, vice and crime. Now they are pledged to doing god's work.and if this isn't it, I don't know what is.
CHRISTINE: I don't understand.
BRIEGLEB: People who bring charges against the police have a habit of
CHRISTINE: I see.well, I.thank you. Can I get you anything?
BRIEGLEB: Since we don't plan on sleeping, coffee would be lovely.
BRIEGLEB: Traffic's getting heavy. We'll go up Spring.
BRIEGLEB: Hold on.
BRIEGLEB: Start walking. Quickly.
REV. BRIEGLEB: Almost there. Just a few more Where is all this traffic's coming
CHRISTINE: Where is all this traffic's coming
CHRISTINE: Excuse me, can you tell me what the problem is up ahead?
MAN: Didn't you hear? It's the biggest protest I've ever seen.
REV. BRIEGLEB: Yeah.over that Collins broad, if you can believe that.
OFFICER: Yeah.over that Collins broad, if you can believe that.
CHRISTINE: He didn't mean.he couldn't mean
REV. BRIEGLEB: I don't know.all I know is that I think I just stopped breathing..
CHRISTINE: REV. BRIEGLEB
REV. BRIEGLEB: The Lord works in mysterious ways, Mrs. Collins.
REV. BRIEGLEB: Boy howdy, does He ever. Come on.
THORPE: There are nearly one thousand people gathered in this chamber, more than have ever been in this room before.
THORPE: ( on pa ) I therefore ask you to refrain from demonstrations of any kind. We're all here because we want to find out the real facts in this case, and everybody is going to be heard if we have to sit here for a week.
SECOND COUNCILMAN: Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any other members of the Police Commission.
THORPE: That's odd.we specifically stipulated that we would begin our hearings with testimony from the police department. Are there any representatives of the Police Commission in the room? Is Chief Davis here? Is Captain Jones here? Is there anyone here representing the police?
REPORTER: Mr. Chairman.Richard Thomas, The Evening Herald. Both the Police Chief and Captain Jones are in San Pedro for a police inspection at a station there.
THORPE: Are you telling me they directly violated the wishes of the City Council? That they refused to attend a vital hearing so they could conduct a routine inspection in San Pedro? And what the hell is Jones doing at an inspection after being suspended? I hate to call a recess before we've even started, but I think a few phone calls are in order. So we'll take a half hour break, then continue with the witnesses who have appeared here today. But let it be known that Captain Jones and Police Chief Davis will be subpoenaed and required to appear here tomorrow morning.
HAHN: Mrs. Collins, could you come across the street with me for just a moment?
CHRISTINE: But.shouldn't we
HAHN: I think there's something you should
HAHN: the police decided it was best to keep this off the main docket in order to avoid exactly the sort of chaos we have across the street.
MRS. CLAY: Mrs. Collins? I'm Leanne Clay, this is my husband, John.I just wanted to pass on my sympathies. What we went through, waiting to hear anything about our son David, was bad enough, and now this.. But there was no call for what the police did to you.no call at all.
BAILIFF: All rise.
GORDON: Hey.I saw you in the papers. You got a lot of moxie, standing up to the police like that.
JUDGE: Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have been charged with three counts of murder in the first degree, with an additional seventeen counts under review by the district attorney's office. How do you plea?
GORDON: Not guilty, your honor.
JUDGE: In light of the defendant's penchant for international travel, no bail will be set. This court will receive preliminary motions by tomorrow morning, with a trial date to be set for the earliest opening on the court's calendar. The defendant is remanded into custody. Bailiff..
JONES: We then instituted a nationwide search. On July 10, we received a cable indicating that a boy matching his description had been found in De Kalb, Illinois. Upon questioning, he admitted to being Walter Collins, and we made arrangements to transport him back to California.
HAHN: Where Mrs. Collins told you the boy was not her son.
JONES: Yes. She denied his identity in spite of all evidence pointing to the contrary.
HAHN: But as subsequent events have demonstrated, she was correct. So what prompted you to send her for psychological evaluation?
JONES: Whether or not this was in fact the correct boy was not relevant to my decision. Throughout this period, she acted strangely. She was often cool, aloof and unemotional, especially when presented with the boy we located in De Kalb, and in our subsequent conversations. It was because of her disturbing behavior that I submitted her for observation to the psychopathic ward of Los Angeles County General Just like that. You snap your fingers and an innocent woman is thrown into the psycho ward.
HAHN: Just like that. You snap your fingers and an innocent woman is thrown into the psycho ward.
JONES: She wasn't
HAHN: Every home in this state is in grave danger when a Police Captain can take a woman into his office and, five minutes later, have her thrown into the psychopathic ward on his own authority!
JONES: ( over the crowd ) She wasn't
HAHN: What was that, Captain?
JONES: She wasn't thrown. She was.
HAHN: Escorted, thrown, the verb doesn't matter, Captain. What does matter is that her incarceration was ordered without a warrant.
HAHN: I am holding a carbon copy of the affidavit of insanity that was issued in the case of the State of California vs. Christine Collins. Who signed the affidavit?
JONES: I did.
HAHN: And what is the date on this September 12th.
JONES: September 12th.
HAHN: But Mrs. Collins was incarcerated on September 6th.
JONES: The form is backdated.
HAHN: Yes, so it would appear. The bottom of the page is reserved for recording where and when the warrant was served. But it has not been filled in. May I assume from this that the warrant was never served?
JONES: That's correct. There was no need to serve the warrant since she was at that time already in custody.
HAHN: Let me see if I have this straight. A woman was thrown into the psychopathic ward without a warrant, because no warrant existed, and when it was finally written six days later, there was no need to sign it or go to a judge because
JONES: More murmuring from the crowd.
JONES: Extraordinary steps were necessary because we were dealing with an extraordinary situation! Is it our fault that we were being deceived by the boy who claimed to be Walter Collins? No. In light of his claims and her behavior, who wouldn't begin to wonder if there was something wrong with her?
HAHN: Because she questioned you.
JONES: Because she wouldn't listen, because she insisted on being obstinate and taking matters into her own hands best left to qualified officers, Because she was fighting for the life of her son! A boy who may have still been alive while you were wasting valuable time denying you had done anything wrong!
HAHN: Because she was fighting for the life of her son! A boy who may have still been alive while you were wasting valuable time denying you had done anything wrong!
HAHN: And in the end, that's what happened, isn't it? At some point, while all this was going on, Walter Collins died along with as many as nineteen other youths on the Northcott Ranch in Wineville. Is that correct,
JONES: Yes. It is.
HAHN: No further questions.
CHIEF DAVIS: so after much effort, we were able to identify this boy, who was has been responsible for so much recent trouble, as Arthur Hutchins of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Between this, and the arrest of the man suspected of murdering the real Walter Collins, we have cleared up two of the biggest mysteries in the history of Los Angeles. I hope that you gentlemen of the press will give as much space to the good things we do as the mistakes that are made on rare occasions.
CHIEF DAVIS: Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the boy's real mother, Mrs. Janet Hutchins.
MOTHER: I hope he hasn't been too much trouble for you.
CHIEF DAVIS: Oh, no, not at all..
WRIGHT: Mrs. Hutchins.Mrs. Collins, the woman he was staying with, wanted him to have these. They're the clothes she let him wear.
MOTHER: Well, thank you. Isn't that nice, Arthur? Tell the nice officer thank I don't want 'em! Give 'em to somebody else!
"WALTER": I don't want 'em! Give 'em to somebody else!
DAVIS: Precocious little fellow, isn't he?
"WALTER": It's not my fault! It was the police! They said I was Walter Collins, not me! It wasn't my idea!
CHIEF DAVIS: There.blame the police for your own mistakes. We've seen a lot of that lately, haven't we?
MONTAGE: Shot MOS, under MUSIC, somber and moving, INTERCUTTING between the two trials.
CHRISTINE: I'm up here, Reverend.
CHRISTINE: When Walter was.when he was here, I'd walk past his bedroom when he was asleep, and even if I couldn't see him, or hear him, I could.feel him in here.
REV. BRIEGLEB: Mothers and their children are connected in amazing ways. My uncle joined the army during the big war, and the day he died, before we ever heard a word about it, my grandmother woke up in the middle of the night and said, "Bobby's gone." She
CHRISTINE: That's why I don't think Walter is dead. I can still feel him, in this room.
REV. BRIEGLEB: Mrs. Collins
CHRISTINE: I know what the police said. But the remains.what they found on that ranch is so.most of it can't even be properly identified. What if that boy made a mistake when he picked Walter's picture?
REV. BRIEGLEB: I understand that you don't want to accept this. What mother does? But you have to let go.and start over. For yourself. He'd want you to move on.
CHRISTINE: Maybe. And maybe he'd want me to keep looking. Maybe he's waiting for me, somewhere.
REV. BRIEGLEB: He is, Christine.
REV. BRIEGLEB: We should go.
THORPE: This Committee has now heard all of the testimony, and in light of the facts presented, issues the following

GORDON: Yeah, I want to make a statement. I want to make it real clear that I never once got a fair shake from you, your "honor," or this court. The only one of you here worth a goddamn is her 'cause she's the only one never badmouthed me to the press. She understands what it is when the police frame you for something you didn't do and throw you in the hole. Isn't that right?
GORDON: I want you to know, Mrs. Collins, I never killed your boy. I
JUDGE: That's enough! Counsel, you will get control of your client or I will have him bound and gagged.
JUDGE: Gordon Stewart Northcott, it is the judgment of this court that you will be conveyed to San Quentin Prison, where you will be held in solitary confinement for a period of two years, until October 2nd, 1930. On that date, you are to be hanged by the neck until dead. May god have mercy on your soul.
CHIEF DAVIS: no, as I said after the hearing, I have every intention of finishing my term as Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. I will not resign. I will fight to the finish. The Collins case was merely an excuse for certain politicians who have been trying to have me removed for some time, and I
CHIEF DAVIS: anyway, I remain confident that the Mayor's office will stand firmly behind me. That's all.

GORDON: They're gonna let me have whatever I want for dinner. Got a steak coming, with spinach, mashed potatoes and green beans. I always wondered why they did that whole last meal thing. One of the other guys on Death Row said when you take the drop, you foul yourself, and everything you ate.comes out the other end. So maybe that's why they make sure you got something in you when it happens. They like knowing you fouled yourself on the way to
GORDON: Sure you don't got a cigarette?
GORDON: The warden, Clinton Duffy, he's a good guy. He's writing a book about all the death sentences he's carried out in this place. Says it's called "Eighty-Eight Men and Two Women." Beats my record all to hell.

MR. HARRIS: Are you sure?
MR. HARRIS: I'm meeting some friends for dinner at Musso and Frank's on Hollywood. They're going to pipe the Oscar ceremony through to the restaurant. Should be quite a night. I'd love it if you'd come.
CHRISTINE: Ben, that's very sweet, and I wish I could.but I really need to stay and finish this.
CHRISTINE: Ben.? I put down two dollars on "It Happened One Night" for best picture. Seems I'm the only one here who thinks it has a chance against "Cleopatra." If I win, how about we have dinner tomorrow night to celebrate?
MR. HARRIS: You've got a deal, Christine. Good How about I call you if you win?

CHRISTINE: When? Where did they No, of course.I'll be right there.
MRS. CLAY: I wanted to go to him right off, but they said it was important to talk to him alone first.
CHRISTINE: Are they sure it's
MRS. CLAY: They're sure, but more important, I'm sure. It's my boy, all right.it's David. He's alive, Christine. They found him up in Hysperia.
CHRISTINE: But how
YBARRA: All right, so after you got into the car, what happened next?
DAVID: They drove me around for a long time, then we ended up at this ranch
GORDON: SHUT UP! I'll see you boys later..
SHUT UP!: ( grinning ) I'll see you boys later..
YBARRA: Do you remember his last name?
DAVID: Do you remember his last name?
YBARRA: Do you remember his last name?
DAVID: Christine covers her face. Can barely stand up.
YBARRA: So if you only remember some of the names of the rest, how come you remember his full name?
DAVID: Because of what happened.
WALTER: We gotta try it!
JEFFREY: We have to get out of here!
WALTER: I'm not. I'm not afraid of Don't you want to go home? Don't you want to see your mom again?
JEFFREY: Anybody else?
JEFFREY: Okay. Anybody who doesn't want to come, get over at that end in case this comes down.
JEFFREY: When we get out, we split up, go in different directions, they can't catch all of us. Ready?
JEFFREY: They do so, pulling for all they're worth.struggling.the ceiling SHIFTS above them, dirt falling all over the place. they pull harder, the wire cutting into fingers, but still pulling.then suddenly
JEFFREY: CHANGELING A True Story 136.
DAVID: Walter turns to see David stuck in the wiring. LIGHTS go on around the ranch. He hesitates.then RUNS back to David, helps to untangle him. They HEAR a SHOTGUN blast, and FEET running their way.
DAVID: Walter gets him untangled, and the two RACE away from the coop, running for all they're worth as a FLASHLIGHT hits first one, then the other. They RUN
DAVID: That's the last I saw of any of So you don't know if either of the other two were captured?
YBARRA: So you don't know if either of the other two were captured?
DAVID: No. All I know is, if he hadn't come back for me.I don't think I ever would've gotten out of there.
YBARRA: What happened after that?
DAVID: I hid in the woods for two days, too scared to move, because I was sure they'd find me. I finally started walking, but every time a car came up I was afraid it was them. So I kept off the main roads until I saw a train stopped at a crossing, and I jumped in.
YBARRA: Why didn't you tell anyone what had I was afraid! I thought they'd come after me, or my folks.so I didn't tell anybody. I was on my own until I got a free meal from this lady, Mrs. Lansing. I told her I was an orphan, on my own. She said I could stay on, and.I Every night, I'd wake up, thinking they were right outside my window. Then I heard the police talking on the radio about what happened at the ranch, and I thought, for sure I can't go back now.

YBARRA: Why not?
DAVID: Since I didn't tell anybody what happened, I was afraid they'd blame me for those kids being dead. So I just.stayed away.
YBARRA: So what made you come forward now, after all this time?
DAVID: I miss my mom.I miss my dad.I just.I just want to go home.
YBARRA: Still can't believe it. Five years, case closed, everyone thinks he's dead.and there he is.
CHRISTINE: I am.
YBARRA: You don't think he's still out there, do you?
CHRISTINE: Why not? Three boys made a run for it that night, Detective. If one got out, maybe either or both of the others did too. Maybe Walter went through the same fears he did. Afraid to come home or identify himself, afraid he'd get into trouble, that people might think it was his fault. Either way, it gives me something I didn't have before What's that?
YBARRA: What's that?
CHRISTINE: She turns and walks off into the night, as we SUPERIMPOSE:
