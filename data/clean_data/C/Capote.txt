CAPOTE: Written by Dan Futterman
TRUMAN: So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot of his book, and he says to me: the writing's going well, but I just want to make sure it's not one of those problem novels. I said: Jimmy, your novel's about a Negro homosexual who's in love with a Jew wouldn't you call that a problem? Susan's father had a minor heart attack, so she's writing more erotic poems about death and sex.
CHRISTOPHER: Susan's father had a minor heart attack, so she's writing more erotic poems about death and sex.
BARBARA: It's so tiresome.
WILLIAMS: Hmm. What rhymes with angina?
GRAYSON: How's your writing?
TRUMAN: Oh, I've got a million ideas of what to write next I just have to choose
GRAYSON: Their attention is pulled back into the group as:
TRUMAN: Their attention is pulled back into the group as:
BARBARA: Who would I want to play me? Natalie Too fat.
ROSE: Too fat.
BARBARA: Audrey Hepburn?
ROSE: Not bad. Sort of middle-class.
TRUMAN: When a movie is made of my life I know exactly who I want as me. Marilyn Monroe.
TRUMAN: .never had anything like this happen to them before. They're used to sleeping at night with the doors Yes, we should buy stock in Master Locks all of Kansas will be in the hardware store tomorrow.
TRUMAN: They have no idea who the killer is. But it doesn't matter who the killer is what matters is who the townspeople imagine the killer is. That's what I want to write about.
TRUMAN: I'm gonna need some help. I'm thinking about Nelle she can protect me.
TRUMAN: I want to leave tonight.
NELLE: I figured you'd missed it.
TRUMAN: God I'm glad you agreed to come. You're the only one I know with the qualifications to be both a research assistant and personal bodyguard. Oh, Nelle, you poor thing.
NELLE: Off. Truman. Off. I'm happy to see you too, but I can still whip your behind.
PORTER #1: ( reading tags ) Mr. Truman Capote, Miss Nelle Harper Lee. Where would you like these, That one up there and that one on the floor.
TRUMAN: That one up there and that one on the floor.
NELLE: What all did you bring?
PORTER #2: Thank you greatly, sir. It's an honor to have you with us. If you don't mind my saying, your last book was even better than the first
TRUMAN: You're sweet.
PORTER #2: Just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get.
TRUMAN: Thank you. You're very kind.
PORTER #1: ( to Nelle )
NELLE: You're pathetic.
NELLE: You're pathetic.
TRUMAN: You paid them to say that.
NELLE: You paid them to say that.
NELLE: You paid them to say that!
TRUMAN: ( squealing ) How'd you know? How did you know?!
NELLE: "Just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get."
TRUMAN: You think that was too much? I thought that was a good line.
NELLE: INT. TRUMAN AND HARPER LEE'S CABIN, TRAIN - MORNING Nelle's awake, but still in her bunk, looking out the window at the Kansas plains. Truman's dressing, watching her.
TRUMAN: Alvin Dewey, Kansas Bureau of Investigation. KBI.
TRUMAN: Mr. Alvin Dewey, please.
GUARD: Third floor. In what used to be the Sheriff's Office.
CHURCH: The wife said no more smoking in the house. I told her, "Fine. Walter's got a couch upstairs in his apartment. I'll stay with him and Dorothy till we're done here." I've got my bag and a carton of cigarettes in the car.
DEWEY: Mr. Dewey. Truman Capote from the New Yorker.
TRUMAN: Mr. Dewey. Truman Capote from the New Yorker.
TRUMAN: Silence. Nye is looking at Truman, particularly puzzled.
TRUMAN: The scarf.
NYE: The scarf.
TRUMAN: The scarf.
NYE: ( then ) Thank you. ( turns to Dewey ) I wonder when we could arrange an interview? Some time to talk.
TRUMAN: Thank you. I wonder when we could arrange an interview? Some time to talk.
DEWEY: About what?
TRUMAN: We're not looking for any inside information I don't care one way or another if you catch whoever did this I'm writing an article not about the Clutter killings, but how they're affecting the town, how you all are bearing up
DEWEY: I care.
TRUMAN: Excuse me?
DEWEY: I care. I care a great deal if we catch whoever did this.
TRUMAN: As do a lot of folks around here.
DEWEY: As do a lot of folks around here.
TRUMAN: Of course.
NYE: ( to Church ) New Yorker?
CHURCH: You have press credentials?
NYE: What's the New Yorker?
CHURCH: Magazines don't give out
TRUMAN: Magazines don't give out
CHURCH: You can come to the news conference with the rest of them. Sears and Roebuck.
DEWEY: I'll talk facts but I won't speculate. The main fact here we need to be clear on is not one, but four people were killed. A lot of folks say Herb Clutter had to be the main target because he was dealt with the most Had his throat cut.
JOURNALIST #1: Had his throat cut.
DEWEY: ( a moment ) Yes. We'd all like to know why. But it could've been any one of the family they were after. We just don't know
JOURNALIST #2: You've identified the murder weapon?
DEWEY: Wounds indicate a shotgun, close- range, but no casings were found.
JOURNALIST #1: Twelve-gauge, hunting
DEWEY: JOURNALIST #1
JOURNALIST #1: They were all shot in the face?
DEWEY: No. Nancy in the back of the head.
JOURNALIST #2: Is there any evidence of, I'm sorry, sexual molestation of the women?
DEWEY: JOURNALIST #2
JOURNALIST #2: Anything else stolen?
DEWEY: Kenyon's radio seems to be the only.
JOURNALIST #3: The boy was sixteen?
DEWEY: Fifteen. Nancy was sixteen.
JOURNALIST #2: It's her friend that found them?
DEWEY: Laura Kinney.
JOURNALIST #2: Spell that?
DEWEY: I assume you're okay with the Laura part. K-I-N-N-E-Y. But, please, leave her be.
OLD MAN: There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans, a whole bunch of Mexicans.
DEWEY: ( standing, stubs out cigarette ) George, it's good to see you again. I do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or a whole bunch, as you said, but it doesn't matter a whole lot whether it was Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos. We're going to find whoever did this. Four good people from our community are dead. Let's remember that. Okay with you? ( holds up a notice ) The West Kansas Farm Committee's offering a thousand dollar reward for information leading to an arrest. Please print that. ( moving to the exit ) Thank you all for coming.
TRUMAN: Mr. Dewey's protective of the Clutters. I wonder how well he knew
TRUMAN: He was foxy with that old man. Are you ever gonna let me drive?
NELLE: Truman, you're a menace. You can barely see over the wheel.
NELLE: This make you miss Alabama?
TRUMAN: ( rolling window down, shakes his head ) Not even a little bit.
TRUMAN: Kids back away. Nelle notices. She leaves Truman, walks up to a group of THREE GIRLS.
NELLE: GIRL #1
GIRL #1: Can any of you tell me where I'd find Laura Kinney?
NELLE: Can any of you tell me where I'd find Laura Kinney?
GIRL #1: Oh, um.
NELLE: ( gently ) Is that her? With the tall boy?
GIRL #2: Yeah. With Danny Burke.
NELLE: Danny Burke? Thank you.
GIRL #2: Oh, quiet yourself, Janice.
NELLE: Truman. Truman
NELLE: These folks live their lives in a particular way. You need to consider adapting yourself to that fact.
TRUMAN: I'm gonna find out where those two kids live. Maybe you'll let me do that alone?
NELLE: I'm gonna find out where those two kids live. Maybe you'll let me do that alone?
TRUMAN: You hate my friends.
JACK: I wouldn't say hate. So long as they don't knock on my door.
TRUMAN: I saw the bodies today.
JACK: The Clutters. I looked inside the That's horrifying.
TRUMAN: The Clutters. I looked inside the That's horrifying.
JACK: That's horrifying.
TRUMAN: It comforts me something so horrifying it's freeing. It's a relief. Normal life falls away. But, then, I was never much for normal No, you weren't.
JACK: No, you weren't.
TRUMAN: People here won't talk to me. They want someone like you, like Nelle. Me they hate.
JACK: I can't think of a single quality I share with Nelle.
TRUMAN: Maybe manliness.
JACK: Maybe manliness.
TRUMAN: My point exactly.
JACK: It's why I left the Midwest in the first place. I knew I could only find someone like you in New York
NELLE: Let's go.
NELLE: ( Danny stops ) Would you mind terribly if I walked with you for a bit?
LAURA: I thought you were from the FBI with your long coat.
TRUMAN: Is that so?
LAURA: That's why I ran off.
TRUMAN: I've been getting a lot of that
LAURA: It's fine talking to you all. Practically nobody around here wants to talk since what happened.
NELLE: Folks have been through a rough patch. Including you. Nancy was your best friend.
LAURA: She was my best friend.
NELLE: How has Danny been?
LAURA: Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible ever happened to him before. Nancy just started wearing his ring again after this huge fight Mr. Clutter was trying to get her to end it 'cause Danny's Catholic.
NELLE: What were the Clutters?
LAURA: Methodist. Danny was the last person at the house that night. That's why Mr. Dewey's keeps interviewing him they don't think he had anything to do with it just to see if he remembers anything unusual and all.
NELLE: People in town seem to wonder if he was involved.
LAURA: That's been real hard for Danny.
TRUMAN: Oh, it's the hardest when people have a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise. Since I was a child folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way I look and the way I talk. They're always wrong. Do you know what I mean?
LAURA: I want to show you something.
TRUMAN: Not one person here understands her.
LAURA: Maybe you'll get a better picture of Nancy. And the family.
NELLE: What is this?
LAURA: It's her diary.
NELLE: "Danny here tonight and we watched TV. So nice just having him sit with us. Left at eleven. P.S. He's the only one I really love."
NELLE: And that was that.
TRUMAN: The end of a life.
NELLE: "Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible ever happened to him before. "
TRUMAN: "Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible ever happened to him before. "
TRUMAN: I have 94 percent recall of all 94 percent.
NELLE: 94 percent.
TRUMAN: I've tested myself.
NELLE: ( scans some of what he's written ) I hate that you're better than me at
NELLE: Don't you dare close your eyes on my
NELLE: Stand up and walk out that door. Go to your room if you're gonna sleep. Truman. Truman.
NELLE: FADE OUT.
NELLE: What right do you have being tired? You were snoring blissfully
TRUMAN: I don't snore
NELLE: while I lay there, hating you
TRUMAN: You don't hate me.
NELLE: Not much. Marie Dewey?. We've got somewhere to go for Thanksgiving supper.
TRUMAN: Apparently Detective Foxy's wife has a better opinion of me than Detective
MARIE: You came.
NELLE: Nelle nudges Truman, who hands over his gifts: a BOTTLE OF J&B, and a PACKAGE of GOURMET SPICED NUTS.
TRUMAN: ( soberly ) Thank you for having us.
MARIE: ( mock serious ) Thank you. ( then: ) Get yourselves in here. ( turns and walks into the house ) Alvin! Get your pants on. They're
TRUMAN: More. More.
MARIE: Alvin will hate this.
TRUMAN: Yes, but we who know the truth will love it.
MARIE: ( laughs ) I have to stop. ( then ) I cannot believe you're from New Orleans. I miss it so much.
TRUMAN: I only lived there for a short while but my Mama was born and bred.
MARIE: You know something Alvin pretends he doesn't know who you are, but the minute you came to town he read your books. He had one of his men pick up "Breakfast at Tiffany's" in Kansas City 'cause it's banned from the library here.
TRUMAN: What did Mr. Dewey think?
MARIE: He liked it more than he's willing to admit.
TRUMAN: How very foxy.
TRUMAN: Mama would've put in half the bottle by now. Alright, one more shake.
MARIE: Alright, one more shake.
TRUMAN: Silence. Marie sips her drink.
NELLE: Silence. Marie sips her drink.
MARIE: How you doing, foxy?
TRUMAN: I was writing the script as they were filming, all that time in Italy. I'd work like mad all day long and then dash down to the bar around midnight to hand in the next day's scenes. Humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar
MARIE: ( whispers to Alvin ) Humphrey Bogart.
TRUMAN: where he and John drank every John Huston.
MARIE: ( to Alvin ) John Huston.
TRUMAN: and I mean drank, like famished water buffaloes. Well I'd only just handed them the final scene when the bellhop told me I had a phone call. It was my stepfather, Joe Capote, calling to say that my mother had died. I flew home to New York terribly distraught but when I got to the apartment I could see that Joe was in even worse shape than I was. He grabbed my hands and sat me down at the kitchen table, and he said to me, "Talk. Talk about anything, any subject in the world. Don't worry whether it will interest me or not. Just talk so I won't break down." And I did. He couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts. It was too painful.
MARIE: It's been a hard couple weeks for Alvin. He and Herb Clutter were good friends. From church.
DEWEY: Oh come on, Alvin. These are good
MARIE: Oh come on, Alvin. These are good
TRUMAN: Who would put a pillow under the boy's head just to shoot him? Why would they tuck Nancy in?
DEWEY: ( surprised by the insight ) I want to know the same thing.
NELLE: Twisted notion of tenderness.
NELLE: Thank you.
MARIE: So many of my friends would love to meet you.
NELLE: That'd be fine
TRUMAN: ( to Dewey ) You don't have to worry. I'm not going to write about this until everything's over.
DEWEY: I'm not worried. I know what room you're in at the hotel. And I know where you live in Brooklyn.
HOLT: ( re the apples ) I'd of picked them up but I haven't been myself. Mind you, I make the walk out here every day, check the house, make sure the pipes don't freeze that sort of item. The least I can do for Mr. Clutter.
NELLE: How long have you worked here?
HOLT: 1940 a lotta years. The wife too, cleaning the house. Cooking.
NELLE: Well, she's marvelous. Lunch was She had a hard job after what all happened. Cleaning. I burned most of the rest mattresses too far of a mess. I've asked around some if anyone's looking for a strong hand.
HOLT: ( ignoring this ) She had a hard job after what all happened. Cleaning. I burned most of the rest mattresses too far of a mess. ( then, looks at them ) I've asked around some if anyone's looking for a strong hand.
HOLT: I don't think they'll be able to sell the place till they catch the ones that did it. That's what I hear anyhow.
JACK: You're celebrating.
TRUMAN: Remember Nelle's manuscript she sent me in New York?
JACK: Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird. You said it was good.
TRUMAN: And I was right. She just heard Lipincott wants to publish it.
JACK: ( pause ) Well. Jesus. That's terrific. Tell her congratulations.
TRUMAN: ( covers phone, mouths to Nelle: ) Just promise you'll be home by I can't leave now Jack I mean it was hard at first, but now I'm practically the mayor.
JACK: Just promise you'll be home by I can't leave now Jack I mean it was hard at first, but now I'm practically the mayor.
TRUMAN: I can't leave now Jack I mean it was hard at first, but now I'm practically the mayor.
JACK: I want to come home I do. Though if they catch whoever did this, who knows what I'll probably be here til next Christmas.
TRUMAN: I want to come home I do. Though if they catch whoever did this, who knows what I'll probably be here til next Christmas.
JACK: Right. I'll let you go.
TRUMAN: Jack, we'll go away this spring to write. Maybe Spain.
JACK: Alright, Truman.
TRUMAN: ( hangs up ) The poor boy misses me.
NELLE: You remember when we were kids?
TRUMAN: You remember when we were kids?
NELLE: You remember when we were kids?
TRUMAN: I was never a kid. I was born fully I had no idea what a homosexual was. But I knew whatever they were, you were one of 'em.
NELLE: I had no idea what a homosexual was. But I knew whatever they were, you were one of 'em.
TRUMAN: ( quickly, as if reciting ) girdle up no extra bulges if you're dressed right for him when he gets home, the evening should be smooth sailing. Bon voyage, gals.
MARIE: I can't believe you got this whole page I only read it to you once!
TRUMAN: I've trained myself.
NELLE: .trained myself.
TRUMAN: I have 94 percent
NELLE: .94 percent recall.
TRUMAN: ( laughing ) You cut that out. You believe that Alvin?
MARIE: You believe that Alvin?
ALVIN: He walks out. Silence.
MARIE: I'm sorry. He's upset. smoking three packs a day. Two men did it. They know who. One of them used to have a cellmate who gave him up for the thousand dollar reward. They passed through Kansas City last week writing bad checks by the time Alvin's boys got up there they'd skipped out again.
NELLE: Where to?
MARIE: They have no idea.
DEWEY: Alvin. Paul. Now.
DEWEY: ( gets up, goes ) Come here.
MARIE: Alvin .
DEWEY: Alvin Jr. enters.
MARIE: Tell them we're at dinner, Alvin.
DEWEY: Not now, Alvin.
NELLE: We hear LOUD CROWD NOISE at the south end of the square. A CONVOY of FOUR CARS enters the square. It pulls around to the front of the courthouse. STATE TROOPERS spill out of the lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers get DICK HICKOCK handcuffed, pale out of the car and lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH. Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence. They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG, ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as if they are arthritic. Truman stares.
MARIE: ( whispers to Truman ) Motorcycle accident. He broke them and they never healed right. ( Truman looks at her ) Alvin told me.
MORNING: FADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says "SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE - PRIVATE". Dorothy Sanderson opens the door.
DOROTHY: Truman Capote.
TRUMAN: Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you'd be left alone this morning by that hard-working husband of yours. So I have breakfast. I have news. And I have literature. My friend Jack mailed me the book you wanted.
DOROTHY: "For the maiden of the Midwest, the priestess of the plains, the queen of the kitchen: my first novel.
DOROTHY: You're too much. Go on into the living room, lemme grab that it's been ringing all morning.
DOROTHY: Oh. Truman. I meant in there. I. um.
DOROTHY: It's the women's cell. It's hardly ever used. But they wanted to, um, separate. Please. Let's sit in the living room. I'll set up in the living
DOROTHY: She goes Truman starts to follow, then lingers.
TRUMAN: They put you in the women's cell.
PERRY: Among other indignities.
TRUMAN: Well. she's a good cook.
PERRY: She's scared of me.
TRUMAN: I think so am I. A little bit.
PERRY: Are you? You have any aspirin? My legs
DOROTHY: Um. Truman? All set.
TRUMAN: I'm sorry.
TRUMAN: ( murmurs ) His feet don't touch the floor.
JUDGE TATE: In the matter of the State of Kansas v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith this Court has been informed by counsel Mr. Weeks that defendants wish to waive their right to Preliminary Hearing. Mr. Hickock, is that your wish?
HICKOCK: ( unconvincing ) Yessir. Yes.
TRUMAN: Why are they doing that?
JUDGE TATE: Mr. Smith.
PERRY: ( stands. then: ) I ask that the waiver be effectuated.
JUDGE TATE: So noted. We're adjourned.
DOROTHY: Mr. Capote.
TRUMAN: ( offers pie ) Madame Sanderson.
DOROTHY: Is that for the two of us to share? Or for me to eat alone while you talk to our guest?
TRUMAN: Was it your choice to waive the
TRUMAN: You still need some? Give me your hand.
PERRY: I could kill you if you got too close.
TRUMAN: Would you like some water?
TRUMAN: Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book
PERRY: He said we'd curry favor with the Judge if we waived our rights.
TRUMAN: Who did?
PERRY: The lawyer.
TRUMAN: Truman nods, not wanting to push this any further. Perry picks up the book, holds it out through the bars.
PERRY: Your picture's undignified. People recall first impressions.
TRUMAN: What's been your first impression?
PERRY: You want something.
TRUMAN: From you?
DOROTHY: Truman. Walter's gonna be home soon.
TRUMAN: ( to Perry ) I just want permission to talk. ( then ) Has anyone else visited?
DOROTHY: Will you tell me if you need anything? I can have whatever you want sent from New York. Will you do that?
TRUMAN: Will you tell me if you need anything? I can have whatever you want sent from New York. Will you do that?
SHAWN: William Shawn.
SHAWN: INTERCUT to Truman in a PHONE BOOTH outside the COURTHOUSE.
TRUMAN: I'm writing a book. It's too much for a single article this town, the killers most of all you will be stunned by Perry Smith
SHAWN: Why? What has he
TRUMAN: Not much yet, but I know. I can sense him. He's desperately lonely, frightened. I have questions are you ready?
SHAWN: Would it matter
TRUMAN: How much more money can you send me? How quickly can you get Dick Avedon out here to take some pictures?
HICKOCK: Perry, honey. You look terrific.
HICKOCK: Calm yourself down, sweetheart. Be patient, Capote. Maybe later they'll send you my skin.
HICKOCK: Be patient, Capote. Maybe later they'll send you my skin.
TRUMAN: I have the perfect place for it, over the hearth.
NELLE: Where'd Perry get the art set?
JUDGE TATE: Members of the jury. Have you reached a verdict?
FOREMAN: ( stands ) Yes sir.
JUDGE TATE: Defendants rise.
JUDGE TATE: Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene Hickock stand accused of four counts of the crime of murder in the first degree. Have you reached a unanimous We have, your honor.
FOREMAN: We have, your honor.
JUDGE TATE: What is your verdict?
FOREMAN: Guilty. On all counts.
JUDGE TATE: Have you unanimously reached a We have, your honor.
FOREMAN: We have, your honor.
JUDGE TATE: What is the sentence?
FOREMAN: Judge nods, the foreman sits. Judge turns to Perry and Dick.
JUDGE TATE: Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene Hickock. You've been found guilty of four counts of murder in the first degree. You will be taken to the state penitentiary at Lansing. No later than midnight, May 13 of this year, nineteen hundred and sixty, each of you will be hanged by the neck until dead. So ordered.
HICKOCK: Alright, partner. Least now we're not the only killers in Kansas.
TRUMAN: You think he slept at all?
TRUMAN: I need to see him before we go.
TRUMAN: They're going to transfer you up to Lansing today. You'll have to make sure to put me on the visitor's list. Otherwise I can't see you.
TRUMAN: Will you do that? I'm going to help find you a proper lawyer. You need a serious lawyer for an appeal. They took Dick last night. I need you to get him to do the same thing put me on the visitor's list. Will you do that, Perry?
TRUMAN: FADE OUT.
BEN BARON: Nelle. Kudos on "Kill the Bird." Is that it?
NELLE: Close enough. Thanks.
SHAWN: He hasn't written a word yet, though he says it's the nonfiction book of the decade.
TRUMAN: He's as short as I am. And almost as pretty. I'd be with him right now but he's being given new
TRUMAN: Most people assume he's a monster. I don't see him that way. The book I'm writing will return him to the realm of humanity it's the book I was always meant to write.
JACK: Watch out. This is the start of a great love affair.
NELLE: Oh yes. Truman in love with Truman.
TRUMAN: .I was in Marilyn's apartment just last week. I had to break it to her that, of the four Matisses hanging on her wall, two were upside down.
TRUMAN: ( to reporter ) To answer your question, I'm following "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by blazing a different path by inventing an entirely new kind of writing: the non-fiction novel.
REPORTER: You have a subject?
TRUMAN: On the night of November 14, two men broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family. Why did they do that? It's been suggested that this subject is tawdry it's not worthy of literature. I disagree. Two worlds exist in this country the quiet conservative life, and the life of those two men the underbelly, the criminally violent. Those worlds converged that bloody night. I spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence. I spent hours talking to the killers and I'll spend more. Researching this work has changed my life, altered my point of view about almost everything. I think those who read it will be similarly affected. Such a book can only be written by a journalist who has mastered the techniques of fiction
REPORTER: You're speaking of yourself.
TRUMAN: You're really very clever.
TRUMAN: Perry's decided to appeal. He claims their attorney was incompetent that he never raised the issue of temporary insanity.
JACK: So you find them a new lawyer.
TRUMAN: They're facing execution in six weeks, Jack. They need someone to argue whether or not that's right.
JACK: I'd also like to see them alive, yes, thank you very much. I need to hear their story.
TRUMAN: I'd also like to see them alive, yes, thank you very much. I need to hear their story.
TRUMAN: If you met him you'd understand. It's as if no-one's ever asked him a single question about himself. He's so. damaged and strange I don't trust this Hickock fellow. Perry's the only person who can describe to me what happened that night. I need to hear him say it.
JACK: Just be careful what you do to get what you want.
TRUMAN: I'm finding them a lawyer.
JACK: Truman. You're finding yourself a
KRUTCH: We do well by our boys. Showers once a week. Feed em good. We'll be feeding Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if he don't eat. Get the food in through his arm.
TRUMAN: What are you talking about?
KRUTCH: Hasn't eaten in a month. But it's not his right to kill himself. It's the People's right. The People of this State. And that's who I work for, the People. You can write any of this down.
TRUMAN: No one told me.
KRUTCH: Yah. Won't eat.
TRUMAN: When can I see him?
KRUTCH: ( checking desk calendar ) How about you come back Thursday?
TRUMAN: No. That's no good. I need to see them now, then whenever I want for as long as I want.
KRUTCH: Not how we do things here. I see.
TRUMAN: I see.
TRUMAN: I understand what a burden unlimited visitation might be on this institution, and on the People who pay for it. I want to be clear that I don't expect the citizens of Leavenworth County to have to shoulder that burden.
TRUMAN: To be dispensed as you see fit.
KRUTCH: I didn't know where to count your boy being half-Indian. I did him a favor though. Counted him White.
TRUMAN: You're a kind and generous man.
HICKOCK: My hero.
TRUMAN: Thanks for your help with the lawyer.
HICKOCK: Thanks for your help with the lawyer.
TRUMAN: That's fine.
HICKOCK: You must be desperate for a story to come all the way out here.
HICKOCK: You want to see Perry. Go ahead.
TRUMAN: Thank you.
HICKOCK: Ask me, he's just trying to prove the insanity defense.
TRUMAN: ( to Perry ) I don't care what your plans are for
TRUMAN: But you're gonna wake up enough to tell me what you did with my tie.
TRUMAN: It's okay. It's Truman. It's your
TRUMAN: How'd you learn to draw like that?
PERRY: Before she had us. Before she started Who took care of you as a child?
TRUMAN: Who took care of you as a child?
PERRY: Orphanage. Me and Linda.
TRUMAN: That's your sister?
TRUMAN: We're not so different as you might think. I was abandoned repeatedly as a child. My mama'd drag me along to some new town so she could take up with another man she'd met. Night after night she'd lock me in the hotel room Mama'd turn the latch and tell the staff not to let me out no matter what. I was terrified I'd scream my head off till finally I'd collapse on the carpet next to the door and fall asleep. After years of this she just left me with relatives in Alabama.
PERRY: Who raised you up?
TRUMAN: My Aunts. That's when I met Nelle she lived next door. Your mother was Indian?
PERRY: Drinking was not a good thing for No tolerance for it.
TRUMAN: Drinking was not a good thing for No tolerance for it.
PERRY: No tolerance for it.
TRUMAN: And your father?
PERRY: No tolerance for him either.
TRUMAN: What I can't decide is if you understand how fascinating you are.
PERRY: I'm sorry about your tie. They took it away from me because we're all on suicide watch. It's why the lights stay on at night.
TRUMAN: I hope we're past that now. You had me worried.
PERRY: I don't care about the tie. It's just a pity because it looked so good on you.
TRUMAN: I don't care about the tie. It's just a pity because it looked so good on you.
PERRY: Be careful of Ricardo. I think he wants you all to himself.
TRUMAN: But he's naturally mendacious not to be trusted if he had a hundred dollars he'd steal a stick of chewing You wouldn't. I want to take your notebooks with me I want to read them.
PERRY: But he's naturally mendacious not to be trusted if he had a hundred dollars he'd steal a stick of chewing You wouldn't. I want to take your notebooks with me I want to read them.
TRUMAN: You wouldn't. I want to take your notebooks with me I want to read them.
TRUMAN: I want to take your notebooks with me I want to read them.
TRUMAN: If I leave here without understanding you, the world will always see you as a monster. I don't want that I don't see you that way.
PERRY: I tracked my father down in Alaska. I was 14. One day I said to him, "Mom's dead." I could see it. A week later we got the news. She finally drunk herself to death.
TRUMAN: This is remarkable.
PERRY: Sometimes you see a thing how it really is.
TRUMAN: He trusts me that's why he gave it to me. He's given me absolutely You should see his drawings, Nelle, how good he is. He wants so badly to be taken seriously, to be held in some esteem.
NELLE: Do you?
TRUMAN: Do I what?
NELLE: Hold him in esteem?
TRUMAN: Well. he's a gold mine. I mean he's told me his entire life, and now it's all here for me to write down All of the history I need. His entire life in this Diary. His dead mother. A brother and sister killed themselves.
NELLE: You tell him your mama did the same I tell him everything. We've been talking our heads off the past month. Sometimes, when I think how good my book can be, I can hardly breathe.
TRUMAN: I tell him everything. We've been talking our heads off the past month. Sometimes, when I think how good my book can be, I can hardly breathe.
NELLE: ( finds what he wants ) Here's what I wanted to read to you: "If Called Upon to Make a Speech:" this is exactly what I was talking about a speech just in case he's ever recognized for an achievement: "If Called Upon to Make a Speech: I can't remember what I was going to say for the life of me. I don't think ever before have so many people been so directly responsible for my being so very, very glad. It's a wonderful moment and a rare one. Thank you!" ( beat ) There's an exclamation point on the end of that thank you, in case you didn't catch it. ( silence ) Where'd you go?
TRUMAN: ( finds what he wants ) Here's what I wanted to read to you: "If Called Upon to Make a Speech:" this is exactly what I was talking about a speech just in case he's ever recognized for an achievement: "If Called Upon to Make a Speech: I can't remember what I was going to say for the life of me. I don't think ever before have so many people been so directly responsible for my being so very, very glad. It's a wonderful moment and a rare one. Thank you!" ( beat ) There's an exclamation point on the end of that thank you, in case you didn't catch it. ( silence ) Where'd you go?
NELLE: Christ. I guess it stopped being I never said it was. Listen to this.
TRUMAN: I never said it was. Listen to this.
DEWEY: ( to waitress )
DEWEY: You're nothing if not hard-working.
TRUMAN: You look good, healthy again.
DEWEY: Not a chance.
TRUMAN: I've decided on a title for my book. I think you'll like it very masculine. "In Cold Blood."
DEWEY: ( lights the cigarette ) That refers to the crime or the fact that you're still talking to the The former, among other things.
TRUMAN: The former, among other things.
DEWEY: I see.
TRUMAN: I've been wanting to ask if you'll let me look at your investigation That lawyer you helped find for your friends got them a hearing at the Kansas Supreme Court
DEWEY: That lawyer you helped find for your friends got them a hearing at the Kansas Supreme Court
TRUMAN: I heard this morning.
DEWEY: on the issue of inadequate counsel.
TRUMAN: Alvin. Do you not want me to look at your notes? You are permitted to say I'll tell you what: if those boys get off, I'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down.
DEWEY: ( rises, takes out wallet ) I'll tell you what: if those boys get off, I'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down.
DEWEY: I have to be in court at nine o'clock.
DEWEY: Call Roy Church. He'll show you what you want to see.
HICKOCK: Hey, hey.
PERRY: Thank you.
TRUMAN: It was as much for me as for anyone. I couldn't bear the thought of losing you so soon.
PERRY: We're going to be able to use your book for our case. You'll write we never got to raise our insanity plea. You wrote how terrible the lawyer I haven't written a word yet. What have you been doing?
TRUMAN: I haven't written a word yet. What have you been doing?
PERRY: What have you been doing?
TRUMAN: Research. Waiting to talk to you.
PERRY: All right.
TRUMAN: I had hoped
PERRY: What are you calling it?
TRUMAN: The book? I have no idea. If I'm going to write about you if I'm going to determine how to write about you you need to tell me about that night at the Clutter
TRUMAN: If I'm going to write about you if I'm going to determine how to write about you you need to tell me about that night at the Clutter
TRUMAN: Perry shakes his head.
TRUMAN: Why? Do you worry what I'll think?
TRUMAN: Is that it?
PERRY: Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.
TRUMAN: I know a lot of people.
TRUMAN: What is that you keep drawing?
PERRY: You must hate having to come to this Perry, I have invitations to be in Morocco, Greece. I choose to be here. Those people have everything, all their prayers have been answered, yet they're more desperate than ever. I prefer to be here with you.
TRUMAN: Perry, I have invitations to be in Morocco, Greece. I choose to be here. Those people have everything, all their prayers have been answered, yet they're more desperate than ever. I prefer to be here with you.
PERRY: ( looks at Truman; evenly ) I was ten, I wet the bed, the nuns at the orphanage hated the smell. First month one of them found me shivering just trying to get through the night. The Sister pulled back the covers and shined her flashlight to see what I'd did. The sheets were wet. She hit me so many times with that flashlight she broke ( he shrugs ) That night I dreamed about the yellow bird. Tall. Yellow like the sun. It picked me up and it clawed the Nun's eyes and it lifted me into the sky.
TRUMAN: I'm just missing this one piece, Jack. Be patient with me.
JACK: How long is that gonna take? Why don't you try leaving him alone for a while? Come to Spain. You can always visit him later.
TRUMAN: I don't know.
JACK: Well, I'm off. I've got my own writing to do.
TRUMAN: Do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.
JACK: Too many people around. I'll leave the address on the kitchen table. Truman, what do you do there when you're not with him? It must be awful.
JACK: Think about what I said. Join me when you can.
TRUMAN: I will. I will. Bye.
PERRY: I didn't see you. Jesus, you. Come in. Where's the guard?
TRUMAN: I can't. I brought you some things, but I have to fly back East.
PERRY: An hour. I'm sorry.
TRUMAN: An hour. I'm sorry.
PERRY: You can't.
TRUMAN: I'm sorry.
PERRY: Who are you going there to see
PERRY: I told him that.
PERRY: I told him!
TRUMAN: Your writings are magnificent. I hope these help you do more.
TRUMAN: I have so much material from the trial, from our visits, your journals. I have to organize it all, and I have to start the process of writing. I'll visit soon. Perhaps this fall. I miss you already. Write me every five minutes.
TRUMAN: SHAWN ( OVER PHONE )
TRUMAN: I'm already well into the third part, but I I can't finish that till I convince Perry to describe the night of the killings to me. I was planning to visit this fall, see
SHAWN: I think you need to talk to him now.
TRUMAN: And we all need to see how this ends for the final part. I can't finish the book till I know what happens. If Perry and Dick are executed it's one thing and if not, well
SHAWN: Truman. You got your ending
TRUMAN: I really don't know
SHAWN: The Kansas court denied their appeal. It came over the wire on Friday. You need to talk to Perry now. He'll be dead by September. I'm sorry, I know how much you've come to care about
SHAWN: Right. Yes. Right.
TRUMAN: Right. Yes. Right.
SHAWN: I want to set up a reading for you in the fall, in New York. We'll build some interest, and we'll publish in the fall.
TRUMAN: Plums. Thank god. We have nothing in the house.
TRUMAN: Why aren't you working?
JACK: I knew you couldn't be depended on to stock the kitchen.
JACK: What would we feed our famous guest?
TRUMAN: Oh, Jesus. I completely forgot.
JACK: ( utterly nonchalant ) Plus I finished my novel yesterday.
TRUMAN: My man, my hero, my talented. My You said that.
JACK: You said that.
TRUMAN: You are the hardest worker, the most unsung talent I know. As Nelle passes by on her way to London to sell her book which needs no selling, may a little of her success rub off on both of us.
JACK: Here, here!
NELLE: ( to Truman ) When was the last time you wrote back to him?
TRUMAN: I don't know.
JACK: What's this?
NELLE: A letter for your boyfriend I was asked to deliver.
TRUMAN: From Perry.
JACK: Let's have it.
NELLE: "Dear Friend Truman. Where are you? Read this item in a medical dictionary: "Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia, by fracture of the cervical vertebrae, by laceration of the trachea." Not too comforting as we lost our appeal. Missing you alone and desirous of your presence. Your amigo, Perry." Mr. Shawn told me about the court decision yesterday.
TRUMAN: Mr. Shawn told me about the court decision yesterday.
JACK: I was wondering why you were in such a good mood. Surely, I thought, it's not because I finished my little That's a terrible thing to say.
TRUMAN: That's a terrible thing to say.
TRUMAN: ( to no one in particular ) I used to write him all the time. I've been so focused lately on the
TRUMAN: Jack says I'm using Perry, but he also thinks I fell in love with him when I was in Kansas. How both of those things can be true is beyond Did you? Fall in love with him.
NELLE: Did you? Fall in love with him.
NELLE: I don't know how to answer that. It's as if Perry and I started life in the same house. One day he stood up and walked out the back door while I walked out the front. With some different choices, he's the man I might have become.
TRUMAN: I don't know how to answer that. It's as if Perry and I started life in the same house. One day he stood up and walked out the back door while I walked out the front. With some different choices, he's the man I might have become.
NELLE: Are you kidding me?
NELLE: Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think he's what I like about you best.
TRUMAN: ( smiles ) I'll see you at the reading in New The sixteenth.
NELLE: The sixteenth.
NELLE: Truman. Honestly. Are you going back to Kansas because you care about Perry or because you need information before he's killed?
TRUMAN: Can't it be both?
NELLE: No. I don't think it can be.
PERRY: What was he in jail for?
TRUMAN: They said it was not paying his taxes. But really for being an outsider refusing to go along.
TRUMAN: You don't have to read any of these if you don't want to. But I thought you'd like something decent. You're much too smart for adventure
ROW GUARD: Lock-down while Lowell goes to solitary. Nobody in or out. You want in or out?
TRUMAN: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, LOWELL LEE ANDREW'S CELL - MOMENTS The SIX GUARDS start to pack up Andrews cell while he sits on the cot and watches.
LATER: The SIX GUARDS start to pack up Andrews cell while he sits on the cot and watches.
PERRY: Everyone says he's a genius. I don't think he's a genius. He's rich and he went to college like any of us would've if we got the chance. He came home for Christmas and shot his
TRUMAN: in front of the television.
PERRY: You remember the story
TRUMAN: They were watching Father Knows Best.
PERRY: I won't be sorry to see him go. Always correcting my grammar.
PERRY: Now Dick and me we're next in
TRUMAN: I'm so sorry I've been away.
PERRY: It was a long time.
TRUMAN: I know.
PERRY: I wish you could come next week, when they take him out to the Corner, but the whole prison shuts down.
TRUMAN: I have to be in New York anyway.
PERRY: How's the book going?
TRUMAN: Very slowly.
PERRY: Will you show it to me?
TRUMAN: I've hardly written anything.
GUARD #1: The ROW GUARD opens the cell door. Andrews is led out, arms and legs shackled, into the corridor.
HICKOCK: Keep your head high, buddy.
ANDREWS: Alright now.
HICKOCK: .or they won't be able to rope you under your fat fucking chin.
ANDREWS: Andrews shuffles down the hall. Perry watches him go. On Truman watching Perry. We hear the GATE slam shut.
BEN BARON: ( loudly, over the hubbub ) Hello Hollywood. That's quite a bundle you sold your book for.
NELLE: Baron moves past, Nelle smiles politely, whispers to Shawn.
NELLE: What a gentleman.
YOUNG ASSISTANT: Mr. Capote. Can I get you anything?
TRUMAN: ( clears his throat ) Thank you.
TRUMAN: Hello. My name is Truman Capote.
TRUMAN: Perry Smith's voice was both gentle and prim a voice that, though soft, manufactured each sound exactly ejected it like a smoke ring issuing from a parson's mouth.
TRUMAN: The four coffins, which quite filled the small, flower-crowded parlor, were to be sealed at the funeral services very understandably, for the effect. was disquieting. Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red velvet, her brother a bright plaid shirt; the parents were more sedately attired, Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe; and and it was this especially that lent the scene an awful aura the head of each was completely encased in cotton, a swollen cocoon twice the size of an ordinary blown- up balloon, and the cotton, because it had been sprayed with a glossy substance, twinkled like Christmas- tree snow.
TRUMAN: Imagination, of course, can open any door turn the key and let terror walk right in. [One] Tuesday, at dawn, a carload of. strangers, ignorant of the local disaster were startled by what they saw as they crossed the prairies and passed through Holcomb: windows ablaze, almost every window in almost every house, and, in the brightly lit rooms, fully clothed people, even entire families, who had sat the whole night wide awake, watchful, listening. Of what were they frightened? "It might happen again."
LITERARY ENTHUSIAST: Your portrait of those men was terrifying. Terrifying.
TRUMAN: Thank you.
ISHERWOOD: Your hairpiece is terrifying.
TRUMAN: I was going to say the same thing!
SHAWN: Everyone was there.
TRUMAN: Tennessee loved it.
SHAWN: Of course he did.
TRUMAN: Should we do more? I was terrified, No, Now we get to withhold while everyone else talks. Let them do the
SHAWN: No, Now we get to withhold while everyone else talks. Let them do the
SHAWN: This book is going to change everything. It'll change how people see you as a writer. It'll change how people write. You'll finish by I think so. You know they're scheduled for next month?
TRUMAN: I think so. You know they're scheduled for next month?
SHAWN: Hanging. Yes. I'll commit as many issues as it takes to publish. Three. As many as it takes.
TRUMAN: I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll get Perry to talk
SHAWN: Honestly, what's he got to lose?
TRUMAN: It really is too awful. Institutionalized sadism.
SHAWN: You'll be able to finish now.
TRUMAN: As strange as it may sound to you, I'm going to miss him.
TRUMAN: When did you hear?
PERRY: Two days ago.
PERRY: It's what we've been waiting for. A stay of execution to make a federal
PERRY: All thanks to you.
PERRY: Kansas's had it in for me for ten years in prison the first time, at that trial, here. They can't corner me now. Not till the U.S. Government says so
TRUMAN: Perry, sit down. For a minute. I need you to talk to me.
PERRY: We've got all the time in the world to talk. About everything. I've been thinking about Ricardo. You need to stop sending him those trashy books. I won't even mention the pornography. I realize he might have trouble grasping the literature you gave me, but those books only exacerbate the problem only 'heighten' or 'intensify' it. Maybe we should start him on a program.
TRUMAN: Give him the simple novels first
PERRY: Give him the simple novels first
TRUMAN: Perry stops.
TRUMAN: I know what exacerbate means.
PERRY: Okay. I thought in case.
TRUMAN: There is not a word, or a sentence, or a concept, that you can illuminate for me. There is one singular reason that I keep coming here
PERRY: .November 14th, 1959. Three years ago. Three years. That's all I want to hear from you. I've asked you not to
TRUMAN: .November 14th, 1959. Three years ago. Three years. That's all I want to hear from you. I've asked you not to
PERRY: I've asked you not to
TRUMAN: ( stands up ) This is ridiculous. ( to the Guard ) I'm ready. ( to Perry ) I have a plane to catch. I found your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she'll talk to me about something useful.
PERRY: Don't go out there.
PERRY: Please don't go out there.
TRUMAN: This is my work, Perry. I'm working. When you want to tell me what I need to hear, you let me know.
MRS. MURCHAK: They'll play outside a while longer.
MRS. MURCHAK: I don't want them to see that.
TRUMAN: They've never seen these pictures?
MRS. MURCHAK: ( shakes her head ) Too many questions.
MRS. MURCHAK: June's dead. Frank shot himself. Now Perry's did what he did. I suppose I'm next. Some ruination will visit I don't think life works that way.
TRUMAN: I don't think life works that way.
MRS. MURCHAK: It does in this family.
MRS. MURCHAK: I used to love him. He was my little
MRS. MURCHAK: He scares me now.
TRUMAN: When was the last time you saw him?
MRS. MURCHAK: Ten years.
TRUMAN: Do you think I could borrow one of those pictures?
MRS. MURCHAK: ( hands it to him ) Take the whole thing. I don't want'em ( then ) Just. Perry doesn't know where I live. He thinks we're still in Portland. Please don't tell him we're ( he already has ) Don't be taken in by my brother. He's got this sensitive side he'll show. You believe he's gentle, so easily hurt. But he'd just as soon kill you as shake your hand. I believe
TRUMAN: ( he already has ) Don't be taken in by my brother. He's got this sensitive side he'll show. You believe he's gentle, so easily hurt. But he'd just as soon kill you as shake your hand. I believe
MRS. MURCHAK: Don't be taken in by my brother. He's got this sensitive side he'll show. You believe he's gentle, so easily hurt. But he'd just as soon kill you as shake your hand. I believe
TRUMAN: Hello handsome.
ROW GUARD: You want to go in?
TRUMAN: The Guard unlocks the door. Perry STARTS TO MOVE toward it. The Guard SLAMS it shut.
PERRY: What's the name of your book?
PERRY: What's the name of your book?
TRUMAN: I don't.
PERRY: What's the name of your book?
TRUMAN: I don't know what you're talking
PERRY: "Truman Capote read last night before a packed audience from his non-fiction book IN COLD BLOOD."
PERRY: ( reads ) "The true-crime novel tells of killers Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, who brutally murdered a Kansas family three years ago."
TRUMAN: Who sent that to you?
TRUMAN: Who sent that to you?
PERRY: That's not your goddamn business.
TRUMAN: It is my business, because it's not true. The organizers of the reading needed a title. They picked one a sensational one, I admit to attract a crowd.
PERRY: They picked it.
TRUMAN: That's not your title.
PERRY: That's not your title.
TRUMAN: I haven't chosen one yet.
TRUMAN: How could I choose
PERRY: You pretend to be my friend.
TRUMAN: How could I choose a title when you still haven't told me what happened that night? How could I? I couldn't
TRUMAN: I have something from your sister.
TRUMAN: She misses you.
TRUMAN: It's alright. I'll go in.
TRUMAN: I'm sorry. I should have told you what they made me call the book. I couldn't pretend to be your friend. The truth is, I can't help wanting to be. You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to.
PERRY: Look at my belly.
PERRY: There must be something wrong with us. To do what we did. We heard there was ten thousand dollars in that house. Once we'd tied up everybody and searched all over, I knew the guy who told us about it was wrong. There wasn't any money. But Dick wouldn't believe it. He went tearing through the house again, banging on the walls, looking for a safe. He said when he was done, he was going to come up to Nancy's room and have his way with her. I wouldn't allow it. I told him that. I sat with Nancy.

He said when he was done, he was going to come up to Nancy's room and have his way with her. I wouldn't allow it. I told him that. I sat with Nancy.
PERRY: Dick came to get me and we turned out the lights and went down to the basement, where we had Mr. Clutter and the boy. Dick kept saying "No witnesses." I figured if I just waited him out he'd give up and leave them tied up there. We'd drive all night, they'd never find us. Mr. Clutter's wrists were tied to a pipe over his head. He looked like he was hurt, so I cut him down.
PERRY: We put a box there on the floor so he'd be more comfortable. He asked if his wife and daughter were alright and I said they were fine, they were ready to go to sleep. I told him it wasn't long till morning when somebody would find them. He was looking at me. Just. looking at me. Looking at my eyes. Like he expects me to kill him expects me to be the kind of person who would kill him. I was thinking this nice man, he's scared of me. I was ashamed. I mean, I thought he was a kind man, a good. a gentleman. I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat. I didn't realize what I'd did till I heard the sound.
PERRY: I was staring at him, bleeding on the floor. I told Dick to finish him off, but he wouldn't do it. We couldn't leave Mr. Clutter like that, so I got the shotgun.
NIGHT: KENYON CLUTTER ( 15 ) is bound and gagged on an old sofa, a pillow under his head. A flashlight illuminates his face. A shotgun enters frame, FIRES. An enormous BURST of LIGHT.
NIGHT: Bonnie Clutter ( 40's, small and thin ) tied up on her bed. Moonlight through the window.
PERRY: Then we drove off.
PERRY: What do you think of me now?
TRUMAN: Added up, how much money did you get from the Clutters?
PERRY: Between forty and fifty dollars.
TRUMAN: No answer. He walks down the hall to the BEDROOM.
TRUMAN: No answer. On Truman, standing in the middle of his room. He has finished all that he can finish, and is lost as to what to do next.
TRUMAN: Mr. Shawn, I. I've spent four years of my life on this book. They got a stay of execution yesterday. Another, yes..
TRUMAN: Supreme Court..
TRUMAN: .It's harrowing all I want is to write the ending and there's no fucking end in sight. No. No, I haven't been drinking again.
JACK: I don't know how you can eat that. Perhaps if you weren't drinking so much you wouldn't have to. "Dear friend Truman. Haven't heard from you in such a long while. Please help find new lawyer. If not, Dick will have to write Supreme Court brief himself. Our last appeal. What a pair of wretched creatures. Please help. Your amigo? Perry."
JACK: ( reads ) "Dear friend Truman. Haven't heard from you in such a long while. Please help find new lawyer. If not, Dick will have to write Supreme Court brief himself. Our last appeal. What a pair of wretched creatures. Please help. Your amigo? Perry."
JACK: Your amigo.
TRUMAN: Put it with the others.
JACK: You tried?
JACK: ( walking out ) You need to get ready.
JACK: At least pretend for Nelle that you're having a good time tonight.
TRUMAN: She looks UNCOMFORTABLY DOLLED UP for the premiere of her
NELLE: I thought I'd find you here.
TRUMAN: ( to the bartender ) Please, another.
NELLE: How are you?
TRUMAN: I'm sorry to hear that.
NELLE: I'm sorry to hear that.
TRUMAN: Well. It's torture. Torture. .what they're doing to me.
NELLE: Now the Supreme Court. Can you believe it? If they win this appeal I will have a complete nervous breakdown. I may never recover. Just pray things turn my way.
TRUMAN: Now the Supreme Court. Can you believe it? If they win this appeal I will have a complete nervous breakdown. I may never recover. Just pray things turn my way.
NELLE: It must be hard.
TRUMAN: It's torture. They're torturing me.
NELLE: I see.
NELLE: And how'd you like the movie, Truman.
TRUMAN: I frankly don't know what the fuss is about.
TRUMAN: OPERATOR ( OVER PHONE )
TRUMAN: I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith in the Kansas Correctional System. Will you accept charges? Mr. Truman Capote?
OPERATOR: I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith in the Kansas Correctional System. Will you accept charges? Mr. Truman Capote?
OPERATOR: Mr. Truman Capote?
TRUMAN: Will you accept charges?
OPERATOR: Will you accept charges?
TRUMAN: ( no way out of this ) Uh. Yes.
OPERATOR: You'll accept charges?
TRUMAN: Mr. Smith, you're on the line.
OPERATOR: Mr. Smith, you're on the line.
PERRY: Hello? I can't This doesn't seem Operator, I don't think you put me
TRUMAN: I'm here. Hello, Perry.
PERRY: Hello, Perry.
TRUMAN: Hello, Perry.
PERRY: They let me make a couple phone calls before I go down to Holding. You heard the Supreme Court rejected the I didn't. I hadn't heard that.
TRUMAN: I didn't. I hadn't heard that.
PERRY: I'm sorry.
TRUMAN: I'm sorry.
PERRY: Yeah. They let me make two phone
PERRY: We've got a date set for the Warehouse, Dick and me. Two weeks and. Finito. April 14. Will you visit me? Truman. Will you come visit?
PERRY: Will you visit me? Truman. Will you come visit?
TRUMAN: I don't know if I can. I'll try. I don't know if I can.
PERRY: Please visit me, Truman. Just.
GUARD: CUT TO:
KRUTCH: Perry sits up. Krutch sits on the one chair. The Guard stands by the door, takes out a PAD and STUBBY PENCIL.
KRUTCH: You're allowed three names of people you'd like to witness tomorrow. If there's anybody you want, tell me Truman Capote.
PERRY: Truman Capote.
KRUTCH: Anybody else?
SHAWN: You want anything?
PERRY: Thank you. You sent the telegram to his hotel?
GUARD: Hours ago.
PERRY: May I make a phone call?
SHAWN: That's him again.
SHAWN: We've never even met. It is utterly inappropriate for me to be talking to him.
SHAWN: Yes. I'm sorry, he's out, gone out. I'm not sure when.
KRUTCH: You got a telex.
KRUTCH: "Perry. Unable to visit today because not permitted. Always your friend, That's it.
PERRY: It's not true, is it?
NELLE: Would you put him on please?
SHAWN: He won't talk.
NELLE: ( calmly ) Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down and put the phone on his ear, I need to speak to him.
SHAWN: It's Nelle.
KRUTCH: I didn't think I'd be seeing you You can visit for a few minutes.
SHAWN: Come with me.
TRUMAN: Come with me.
SHAWN: Truman. No.
