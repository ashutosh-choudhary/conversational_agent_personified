WYBIE: He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral ­ you know, wild? Of course, I do feed him every night and sometimes he'll come in my window `n bring me little dead

CORALINE: Looks more like slime to me.
CHARLIE: Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot now what's it going to be?
CORALINE: Think they're trying to poison me?
CORALINE: Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?
CORALINE: She catches her breath, pulls the door wider and CRAWLS
CORALINE: She looks around, notices the painting over the fireplace: the crying blue boy is now SMILING, his shirt clean and his ice cream back on his cone.
CORALINE: Mom?! What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

MEL: If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages edited, he'd better wrap them up ASAP.
CORALINE: Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats.
MEL: ( NODS ) Uh huh.
CORALINE: Smells something bad, sniffs the envelopes.
CORALINE: She knocks again.

CORALINE: What do you mean? She's amazing!
CAT: You probably think this world is a dream come true. But you're wrong. The Other Wybie told me so.
CORALINE: That's nonsense. He can't talk.
CAT: Perhaps not to you. We cats, however, have far superior senses than humans and can see and smell, and

OTHER FATHER: Hey there.
OTHER MOTHER: Was it wonderful, dear?
CORALINE: Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat ­ Spink and Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies, that was just a disguise. But then, I was flying through the air and. it was, it was magic.
OTHER MOTHER: You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?
CORALINE: ( nods, turns back ) Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie.
OTHER MOTHER: You could stay here forever. if you want to.
CORALINE: OTHER FATHER
OTHER FATHER: Sure.we'll sing and play games, and Mother will cook your favorite meals.

OTHER FATHER: No point; he pulled a long face.
OTHER ORCHARD: Coraline runs past trees that are LUSH WITH GREEN LEAVES
CAT: And what do you think you're doing?
CORALINE: Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what I'M doing.

BOY GHOST: And saw that we weren't happy.
BOY GHOST: Gave all that we asked -
BOY GHOST: She said that she loved us,
ALL GHOSTS: And ate up our lives.
CORALINE: Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever; not if she wants to win my life. Beating her is my only chance.

CORALINE: She's in there.
WYBIE: C-can you ­ can you unlock it?

CORALINE: How is hundred-year-old candy going to
HELP: Miss Spink suddenly RAISES her KNITTING NEEDLES as if to STAB CORALINE. Coraline yelps, hands up in defense. But it's CANDIES she attacks, sending sticky chips flying, making loud grunts as she stabs.
MISS SPINK: There you go, sweety.
CORALINE: What's it for?
MISS SPINK: Well,it might help. They're good for bad things, sometimes.
MISS FORCIBLE: No, they're good for lost things.

MISS FORCIBLE: Coraline can't take anymore. She gets up, takes the odd piece of candy and leaves.
CORALINE: Good-night, Mom. Good-night, Dad.
CORALINE: Hello. How did you get in?
CORALINE: MOM! DAD!!
MOM! DAD!!: They look up and, with a desperate look, Mel BREATHES on the inside mirror-glass to fog it. She writes H E L P U S. ­ her fingertip squeaking on the glass like a SMALL, SAD BIRD. Frost RISES UP, hiding the letters and then her parents. The image fades.
CORALINE: She's taken them.
CORALINE: They're not coming back, are they ­ Mom and Dad. Not on their own.
CAT: You know, you're walking right into her I have to go back.
CORALINE: I have to go back.
CAT: Challenge her then. She may not play fair but she won't refuse. She's got a thing for games.
CORALINE: Hmmm, okay.
MOTHER: There, framed in the open door, back-lit in blue, Coraline's REAL MOTHER, with neck brace and dressed in her shopping clothes, calls.

MOTHER: ( voice shifting ) Why would you run away from me?
CORALINE: Where are my parents?
CORALINE: They weren't bored of me. You stole
CORALINE: ( OFFHAND ) Why don't you have your own key?

CORALINE: ( NODS ) Uh huh.
CORALINE ): An exploring game . a finding things
OTHER MOTHER: And what is it you'd be finding,
CORALINE: My real parents.
CORALINE: And, and the eyes of the ghost children.
CORALINE: If I lose, I'll stay here with you forever and let you love me. And I'll let you sew buttons into my Hmmm. And if you somehow win this game?
CORALINE: Then you let me go. You let everyone go ­ my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here.
CORALINE: Not till you give me a clue.
CORALINE: And for my parents?
CORALINE: They GRAB CORALINE at her ankles, knees, hips, waist, and shoulder, and start to ROLL HER UP TOWARDS THE STONE
EYE!: CORALINE ( CONT'D )
OTHER FATHER: Sorrry, so sorrry, Motherrr making meeee.
BOY GHOST: Bless you, miss, you found me! But there's two eyes still lost.

TAFFY MONSTER: Thief!! Give it back!
CORALINE: Oh, Wybie.
CORALINE: I'm Coraline.
CORALINE: She grabs for it, but he's too quick. He back-bends to all fours and SCUTTLES around her towards the back
CORALINE: You don't get it, do you?
CORALINE: Of course you don't understand. You're just a copy she made of the real Mr. B.
CORALINE: Ahhh! No!!
NOOOO!: Two waiting rats - tail tips tied - pull tails tight, and TRIP her. She CRASHES THROUGH THE DOOR AND.
CORALINE: The whole rig, with Coraline on top, ROTATES as it collapses, THROWING CORALINE toward the front of the house when it HITS THE GROUND. She BLACKS OUT a moment.
CAT: I think I mentioned that I don't like rats at the best of times.
CORALINE: I think you might have said something like that.
CAT: It looked like you needed this one,
CORALINE: Thank you.
SHRINKING ISLAND!: NEW ANGLE on Coraline and cat as ground beneath their feet STARTS CRACKING, white light coming through. Cat makes a fearful sound, afraid for the first time in the Coraline holds out her arms to the trembling animal, her guardian angel.
BELDAM: So, you're back..

CORALINE: I already know where you've hidden them.
BELDAM: Well. produce them.
